        "'PERSON4': 'Yes.'",
        "'PERSON5': 'For this workshop thing.'",
        "'PERSON5': 'Because, you know, like um, usually in workshop, like we used to have a big organizing committee, and some people are from.'",
        "'PERSON5': 'So and I think none of us are from someization background.'",
        "'PERSON5': 'So-'",
        "'PERSON4': 'Yes.'",
        "'PERSON5': 'We have to work extra hard.'",

        "'PERSON5': 'No.'",
        "'PERSON4': 'Aha.'",
        "'PERSON5': 'Yeah.'",
        "'PERSON5': 'So that is, anyway, I did not thought like, um, like making a share task would be that much challenging.'",
        "'PERSON4': 'Mhm.'",
        "'PERSON4': 'Well, I that it ischallenging since why I was so much unsure about making workshop that.'",
        "'PERSON4': 'I think you manage it.'",
        "'PERSON5': 'Yeah, the actually, like we are also doing uh some workshops with.'",
        "'PERSON5': 'But thing is that there are like, like, the organizing committee is very big.'",
        "'PERSON5': 'And so all of us are doing some, some, some portion, ok?'",
        "'PERSON5': 'But I, like I am mostly looking into the like publicity and the website.'",
        "'PERSON5': 'Uh for that.'",
        "'PERSON5': 'And also a bit on writing the paper uh for that uh, but I did not like, um, share task I guess it there is so many things that we need to take care of.'",
        "'PERSON4': 'Yes.'",
        "'PERSON5': 'And the thing is like for us full legit workshop we don't have content.'",
        "'PERSON5': 'You know.'",
        "'PERSON5': 'So that is why we have to focus on-'",
        "'PERSON4': 'Yes, we don't have, we don't, we don't actually have scientific input.'",
        "'PERSON4': 'We have just the results of the experiment.'",
        "'PERSON5': 'Yes and I believe, like if to make it a workshop we definitely need at least one or two people who have a background in summarization.'",
        "'PERSON5': 'So that they could can think of many content.'",
        "'PERSON5': 'We are just focusing on only one data, right.'",
        "'PERSON5': 'Like only one aspect of summarization.'",
        "'PERSON4': 'Yes, well, actually this discussion makes me totally frustrated.'",
        "'PERSON4': 'Because originally, we planned and make a work, a shirt task.'",
        "'PERSON4': 'It means to give the participants a totally new task and asked them to make mixed experiment and then compare the results.'",
        "'PERSON4': 'Now we make a scientific workshop.'",
        "'PERSON4': 'We need invited speakers on the topic and articles on the topic.'",
        "'PERSON4': 'I really, I can 't help beat frustrated how it is it is possible to do.'",
        "'PERSON4': 'But you are and PERSON6 are optimistic.'",
        "'PERSON4': 'So, why not.'",
        "'PERSON5': 'Yeah, I think uh like uh, even if we call it a workshop, but it will be mostly challenge specific.'",
        "'PERSON5': 'Because we do not really have content for the workshop.'",
        "'PERSON4': 'Yes, yes.'",
        "'PERSON4': 'But it is also actually not a workshop it's a satellite event.'",
        "'PERSON4': 'At the satellite event maybe'",
        "'PERSON5': 'Right, right, that's the exact word.'",
        "'PERSON5': ' not call it a workshop.'",
        "'PERSON4': 'Yes, let's not call it a workshop.'",
        "'PERSON4': 'Yes, let's call it an event.'",
        "'PERSON5': 'And for the like speakers also like we have to invite some for the input.'",
        "'PERSON5': 'Because uh we haveto some like prominent people in summarization.'",
        "'PERSON5': 'Uh for uh like uh for some other topic.'",
        "'PERSON5': 'Uh so, but uh like they did not like, they didn't like responded affordably so they were actually not available.'",
        "'PERSON4': 'So you address somebody?'",
        "'PERSON5': 'Yes, yes, many, me and PERSON6 we, we addressed at least six to seven people from summarization community.'",
        "'PERSON4': 'Aha.'",
        "'PERSON5': 'But they are very, like they are very famous professors, including PERSON3, and-'",
        "'PERSON4': 'And they did not answer?'",
        "'PERSON5': 'No, they did answer, but they said, they were very busy.'",
        "'PERSON4': 'But what?'",
        "'PERSON5': 'They said they were very busy.'",
        "'PERSON4': 'All of them answer that they-'",
        "'PERSON4': 'So everybody declined.'",
        "'PERSON5': 'Yes, yes.'",
        "'PERSON4': 'Aha, ok.'",
        "'PERSON5': 'But the thing is that weto like the like what unquote very famous people from some relation who were like, you know.'",
        "'PERSON5': 'If we could have reached out to some early career people that would have been great from summarization.'",
        "'PERSON5': 'But anyway, we have to think ofwho has already worked on summarization.'",
        "'PERSON5': 'So for that, I will talk to PERSON6.'",
        "'PERSON4': 'Mhm.'",
        "'PERSON4': 'I do not know anybody.'",
        "'PERSON4': 'I really do not know at all this earlier at all.'",
        "'PERSON4': 'Maybecould know somebody.'",
        "'PERSON5': 'Yeah, maybe.'",
        "'PERSON4': 'You didn't ask him.'",

        "'PERSON4': 'Mhm.'",
        "'PERSON5': 'I'm going to ask him to be part of the program committee.'",
        "'PERSON4': 'Yeah, is definitely a good idea.'",
        "'PERSON4': 'He should be, if he agrees, he is a good part of an organizing committee.'",
        "'PERSON4': 'Probably he could know somebody for keynote.'",
        "'PERSON4': 'So from thismedia generations so, little bit younger, say.'",
        "'PERSON5': 'Mhm.'",
        "'PERSON5': 'So uh in this regard.'",
        "'PERSON5': 'But feel uh ORGANIZATION3 is is organizer, so it does not make sense, like someone from ORGANIZATION1, right?'",
        "'PERSON4': 'As a, as a what?'",
        "'PERSON4': 'What?'",
        "'PERSON5': 'As a does it make sense like someone from ORGANIZATION1 to deliver the keynote?'",
        "'PERSON5': 'I do not think so.'",
        "'PERSON5': 'Because we are part of the organizing committee right?'",
        "'PERSON4': 'Hm, I do not know.'",
        "'PERSON4': 'So if it is somebody, why not if it could be, if it is an authoritative person who knows about the topic, but I do not know the person.'",
        "'PERSON4': 'I do not know who could have this talk.'",
        "'PERSON5': 'Mhm.'",
        "'PERSON5': 'Um-hum.'",
        "'PERSON5': 'Yeah, right.'",
        "'PERSON4': 'As as I think about summarization, I knew just a couple of very young students who began to do the year.'",

        "'PERSON4': 'Should I, should you, do you want to ask him now?'",
        "'PERSON5': 'Ehm, I can e-mail him or how do you propose to ask him?'",

        "'PERSON5': 'Ok.'",
        "'PERSON4': 'No, he's in the next room.'",
        "'PERSON5': 'Oh, ok.'",
        "'PERSON4': 'In the office.'",
        "'PERSON5': 'So if he is available maybe he can, would he be able to join?'",
        "'PERSON5': 'Or maybe-'",
