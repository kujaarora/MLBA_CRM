        "'PERSON3': 'So basically  used to do is that it always acted only on sentence level.'",
        "'PERSON3': 'So then we, so like t- the problem which you faced was that you just  complete paragraph comprising of multiple sentences, and there it failed.'",
        "'PERSON3': 'So, what I did is that.'",

        "'PERSON3': 'Yeah.'",
        "'PERSON3': 'And PERSON2 also proposed that because he was also proposing that a few onths ago that PERSON5 he left I think, because he was improvising the test set for PROJECT2  that we will be using, and so he was saying that we need to find someone to look into this data set and in the worst case scenario I'll be the one doing this, but yeah, that's all from me.'",

        "'PERSON6': 'Yes, yes.'",
        "'PERSON6': 'So it would be good if you if you integrated and then run ASR and have someone who speaks LOCATION1 to say whether its better or not, and if you can process some some file and estimate  rate, and see whether its better with  or without it, so this would be proper set.'",
        "'PERSON3': ', so I will write this to the ORGANIZATION1 Doc and, I will , I think this would be much appropriate and better option to process the  so yeah.'",
        "'PERSON6': 'Yes of course.'",
        "'PERSON6': ' maybe  would be to just take someone speaking LOCATION1 and let him guess whats better, and second it would be to evaluate it  test set.'",
