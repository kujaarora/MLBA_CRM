        "'speaker_C': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Right.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah, I was thi'",
        "'speaker_D': 'I was thinking the advantage is that we can share this with other people.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Well, but if you're talking about one per frame,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'you're talking about gigabyte size files.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'You're gonna actually run out of space in your filesystem'",
        "'speaker_F': 'These are big files.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'for one file.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Right?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Because you have a two gigabyte limit on mostO Ss.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Right, OK.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I would say OK, so frame level is probably not a good idea.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'And th it's'",
        "'speaker_A': 'But for phone level stuff it's perfectly'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Like phones, or syllables, or anything like that.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Phones are every five frames though, so.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Or something like that.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'But but but most of the frames are actually not speech.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So, you know, people don't v Look at it, words times the average The average number of phones in an English word is, I don't know, five maybe?'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah, but we actually'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So, look at it, t number of words times five.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Oh, so you mean pause phones take up a lot of the long pause phones.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'That's not that not'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yep.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Exactly.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_F': 'But you do have to keep them in there.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Y yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So I think it it's debatable whether you want to do phone level in the same thing.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'But I think, a anything at frame level, evenP file, is too verbose.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I would use something tighter thanP files.'",

        "'speaker_A': 'I don't know what their structure is.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I've forgot what the str'",
        "'speaker_D': 'But, wait a minute,P file for each frame is storing a vector of cepstral or PLP values, right?'",

        "'speaker_D': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So that what's nice about theP file It i'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Built into it is the concept of frames, utterances, sentences, that sort of thing, that structure.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'You know, you can have integers and you can have doubles, and all that sort of stuff.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So that that sounds'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Um.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Right?'",

        "'speaker_F': 'you know, we we've done this stuff on prosodics and three or four places have asked for those prosodic files, and we just have an ASCII, uh, output of frame frame.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Ah, right.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Which is fine,'",
        "'speaker_F': 'but it gets unwieldy to go in and and query these files with really huge files.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'I mean, we could do it.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Right.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'And especially for the prosody work, what'",
        "'speaker_F': 'what it ends up being is you get'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah, the other thing'",

        "'speaker_C': 'And then the application has to impose the structure on top.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So what it looked like ATLAS chose is, they chose the other way, which was their file format is just'",
        "'speaker_C': 'nodes and links, and you have to interpret what they mean yourself.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'And why did you not choose that type of approach?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Uh, because I knew that we were doing speech, and I thought it was better'",
        "'speaker_F': 'OK.'",

        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah, that's w So,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yep.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Do they already have tools?'",

        "'speaker_F': 'If if it can handle that, it could handle states or whatever.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Right.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Yep.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'feature files, uh, like theseP files or anything like that.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'So each thing refers to the utterance that it belongs to.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So it's it's not hi it's sort of bottom up.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And then each utterance could refer to a turn, and each turn could refer to something higher up.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'And what if you actually have'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So,'",
