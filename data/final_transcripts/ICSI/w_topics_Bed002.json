        "'speaker_E': 'Are we supposed to read digits at the same time?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'No.'",

        "'speaker_E': 'Everyone would need extreme focus.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So, when you're reading the digit strings, the first thing to do is just say which transcript you're on.'",

        "'speaker_A': 'So'",
        "'speaker_A': 'you would just read that one.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'And then you read each line with a small pause between the lines.'",

        "'speaker_A': 'OK.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Well, we can start doing it.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Thanks.'",

        "'speaker_A': 'All of you look like you're doing it reasonably correctly, but you want it about two thumb widths away from your mouth, and then, at the corner.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'And that's so that you minimize breath sounds,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'so that when you're breathing, you don't breathe into the mike.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Um.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah, that's good.'",

        "'speaker_A': 'Um.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'On the speaker form just fill out as much of the information as you can.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'OK.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Um, but uh,'",

        "'speaker_C': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'No, I I wasn't complaining, I just wanted to understand.'",

        "'speaker_A': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Well, we can make up aliases for each of us.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah, I mean, whatever you wanna do is fine, but we find that We want the meeting to be as natural as possible.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So, we're trying to do real meetings.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So I think that it's better just as a pro post process to edit out every time you bash Microsoft.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'You know?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Um, OK.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So why don't you tell us briefly your give give your e normal schpiel.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So th'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Um.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So this is The project is called Meeting Recorder and there are lots of different aspects of the project.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Um.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So my particular interest is in the PDA of the future.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'This is a mock up of one.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yes, we do believe the PDA of the future will be made of wood.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Um.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'The idea is that you'd be able to put a PDA at the table at an impromptu meeting, and record it, and then be able to do querying and retrieval later on, on the meeting.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So that's my particular interest, is a portable device to do m uh, information retrieval on meetings.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Other people are interested in other aspects of meetings.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Um.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So the first step on that, in any of these, is to collect some data.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'And so what we wanted is a room that's instrumented with both the table top microphones, and these are very high quality pressure zone mikes, as well as the close talking mikes.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'What the close talk ng talking mikes gives us is some ground truth, gives us, um, high quality audio, um, especially for people who aren't interested in the acoustic parts of this corpus.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So, for people who are more interested in language, we didn't want to penalize them by having only the far field mikes available.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'And then also, um, it's a very, very hard task in terms of speech recognition.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Um.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'And so, uh, on the far field mikes we can expect very low recognition results.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So we wanted the near field mikes to at least isolate the difference between the two.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So that's why we're recording in parallel with the close talking and the far field at the same time.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'And then, all these channels are recorded simultaneously and framed synchronously so that you can also do things like, um, beam forming on all the microphones and do research like that.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Our intention is to release this data to the public, um, probably through f through a body like the LDC.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'And, uh, just make it as a generally available corpus.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Um.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'There's other work going on in meeting recording.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So, we're we're working with SRI, with UW, Um.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'NIST has started an effort which will include video.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'We're not including video, obviously.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'And uh and then also, um, a small amount of assistance from IBM.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Is also involved.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Um.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Oh, and the digit strings, this is just a more constrained task.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Um.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So because the general environment is so challenging, we decided to to do at least one set of digit strings to give ourselves something easier.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'And it's exactly the same digit strings as in TI digits, which is a'",
        "'speaker_A': 'common connected digits corpus.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So we'll have some, um, comparison to be able to be made.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Anything else?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'OK, so when the l last person comes in, just have them wear a wireless.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'It should be on already.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Um.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Either one of those.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'And uh, read the digit strings and and fill out the forms.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So, the most important form is the consent form, so just be s be sure everyone signs that, if they consent.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I'm sure it's pretty usual for meetings that people come late, so you will have to leave what you set.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'And uh, just give me a call, which, my number's up there when your meeting is over.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yep.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'uh, you know, What other ideas do you have?'",

        "'speaker_B': 'um, state where'",
        "'speaker_B': 'we can not only do the bare necessities, IE, changing the table so it does exactly in English what it does in German, but also that we can sort of have the system where we can say, OK, this is what it usually does, and now we add this little thing to it\", you know?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'whatever,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Johno's and Bhaskara's great belief net, and we plug it in, and then for these certain tasks, and we know that navigational tasks are gonna be a core domain of the new system, it all all of a sudden it does much better.'",
