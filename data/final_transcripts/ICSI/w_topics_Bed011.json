        "'speaker_D': 'uh'",
        "'speaker_D': 'in the th these people who are gonna take this and and try to do speech with it.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'uh Lots of pronunciations of th of the same thing are going to give you'",

        "'speaker_D': 'Y yeah thi well this is a question for'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And that way you get the speech data of people saying zoo\" over and over again or whatever too.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Maybe'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I suggest we'",
        "'speaker_C': 'make some fine tuning of these,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'get sort of run through ten or so subjects and then take a breather, and see whether we wanna make it more complex'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Right.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Um.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So I haven't really gone into the, you know looked at all of the stuff that's going on.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So I don't really'",

        "'speaker_D': 'um you can probably keep yourself fairly well occupied uh with the simple cases for quite a while.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Although, obviously th'",
        "'speaker_D': 'so so that sa s does suggest that'",

        "'speaker_D': 'That that it was it was very stylized, and quite a lot of people said more or less the same thing.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah, Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'But yeah, yeah I noticed that, too.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So, we we we wanna do more than that.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'OK.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'No, we won't have the transcriptions, but what we should be able to do'",
        "'speaker_D': 'and I don't know if, Fey, if you will have time to do this, but it would be great if you could,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'um,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'not transcribe it all, but pick out'",
        "'speaker_D': 'uh, some stuff.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'Are you gonna have the audio on the web site?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Until we reach the gigabyte thing and David Johnson s ki kills me.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Oh, we could get I mean, you can buy another disk for two hundred dollars, right?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'I mean it's it's not like OK.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So, we'll take care of David Johnson.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'No, he'",

        "'speaker_D': 'And'",
        "'speaker_D': 'other than that, yeah I guess we'll just have to'",
        "'speaker_D': 'uh, listen although I guess it's only ten minutes each, right?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Roughly.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Well, I guess.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'I'm not sure how long it's actually going to take.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'The reading task is a lot shorter.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'That was cut by fifty percent.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And the reading, nobody's interested in that except for the speech people.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'No, we don't care about that at all.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'It's actually like five minutes dialogue.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'I b My guess is it's gonna be ten.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'People'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Ten minutes is long.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'I understand, but people people you know uh'",
        "'speaker_E': 'It feels like a long time but.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'It feels like forever when you're doing it, but then it turns out to be three minutes and forty five seconds.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Could be.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah, it's not'",
        "'speaker_D': 'OK, so that'll be that'll be'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And it's fun.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'um on on the web page.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'That's great.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Um'",
        "'speaker_D': 'But anyway yeah, so I think'",
        "'speaker_D': 'it's a good idea to start with the sort of relatively straight forward res just response system.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And then if we want to'",
        "'speaker_D': 'uh get them to start doing uh multiple step planning with a whole bunch of things and then organize them an'",
        "'speaker_D': 'um tell them which things are near each other and'",
        "'speaker_D': 'you know, any of that stuff.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'You know, Which things would you like to do Tuesday morning?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So yeah I th that seems'",
        "'speaker_D': 'pretty straight forward.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'But were you saying that'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I need those back by the way.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'OK.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'I'm sorry, Fey, what?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'That w'",
        "'speaker_E': 'maybe one thing we should do is go through this list and sort of select things that are categories and then o offer only one member of that category?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'That's what I was suggesting for the first round, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So rather than having zoo and castle.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And then, I mean, they could be alternate versions of the same'",
        "'speaker_D': 'They could, but i but i uh tha'",
        "'speaker_E': 'If you wanted data on different'",
        "'speaker_D': 'eh they c yeah, but uh'",
        "'speaker_E': 'constructions.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'but'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Like one person gets the version with the zoo as a choice, and the other person gets the'",
        "'speaker_D': 'You could, but i but I I I think in the short run,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And no, th the per the person don't get it.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I mean, this is why we did it, because when we gave them just three tasks for w partA and three tasks for partB a'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Well no, they could still choose.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'They just wouldn't be able to choose both zoo and say, touring the castle.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Exactly.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'This is limiting the choices, but yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'OK, sorry.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'But um I I think this approach will very well work, but the person was able to look at it and say OK, This is what I would actually do.'",

        "'speaker_E': 'I mean there they are significantly different, but.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'But no, they're I mean they're sort of this is where tour becomes you know tourists maybe a bit different and,'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah, I guess so.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'um, these are just places where you you enter um, much like here.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'But we can uh'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah, in fact if y if y if you use the right verb for each'",
