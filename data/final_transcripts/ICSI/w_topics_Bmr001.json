        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'The the the underwater guys do this stuff which is'",
        "'speaker_C': 'different.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And it actually means that you should get the microphones as close together as possible.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Rather than trying to get them far apart so you can get'",
        "'speaker_C': 'separation, you sort of'",
        "'speaker_C': 'you want them very close.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'That's forty minutes'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Maybe we don't We don't need to save all channels, right?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So, on average.'",

        "'speaker_A': 'Oh, we'll do the higher math later, maybe but it's so it's so maybe like a gig or two a an hour,'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'OK, that is a bit more than I thought.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'How much here would we have to reformat the drive in there'",

        "'speaker_C': 'And then we'd have to'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'back it all up and'",
        "'speaker_C': 'copy it back on again.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah so this'll take some thought cuz we have we'",
        "'speaker_A': 'um'",
        "'speaker_A': 'If we are in fact gonna have forty or fifty hours at some point and we we wanna ha have part of our work be'",
        "'speaker_A': 'on feature extraction, it means that we need to have waveforms available somehow.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So I've I've already created aUU, doctor speech, data, MR\" directory,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'or had Jane do it and uh'",
        "'speaker_B': 'um but there's not a lot of free space around.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So it it it has currently about four gig'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Mm hmm.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And so we need we definitely need to go'",
        "'speaker_B': 'buy'",
        "'speaker_B': 'uh you know forty gig fifty gig of drive drive space.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'We don't need all we don't necessarily need it all on line.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I mean it will be different subsets.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So you won't you won't, you know, do all sixteen channels in a single'",
        "'speaker_B': 'That's true.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I hadn't even thought about that,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'although it'd be kind of interesting.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'What would you do?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'You typically train I mean you'd have fi you'd have fifty hours we'd only use'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I mean'",
        "'speaker_C': 'one of the PZM channels, something like this, and so that would you wouldn't have to use all sixteen channels at once.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'But it's kind of painful for because basically,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'if we put them onC Ds then each CD will have'",
        "'speaker_C': 'all the channels for one'",
        "'speaker_C': 'recording, and then when you want to build theP files, you just want to get one of those files off each of the sessions and'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah, it's pretty horrible.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So what would we do for training?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So if we're if we're training distant mi we'd just use one of them?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Well, maybe two of them, but I mean we wouldn't use we'd only use the distant mikes, right?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah so it might be four.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Right?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'But it wouldn't be sixteen.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Well, although we wanted to get alignments from the close mike stuff.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'But that's a separate training.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'But you don't want to be constantly take putting that on disk and off disk and on disk.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'No wait.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'More disk is better.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Absolutely.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I mean'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'my my preference would be to get get ourselves a hundred gig of disk.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'The thing is it's really not very expensive right now.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And just not bother.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So it's more of an issue of of structuring it with uh the uh Sys Admin folks so we don't panic them and'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And back up.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'figuring out where it goes.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Well, we don't it doesn't need to be backed up.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Right if if we if we burn it all on CD ROM,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'then,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Right, then it doesn't need to be backed up.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'um, in fact, we could'",
        "'speaker_C': 'you know we could throw away the Broadcast News stuff and put it on there or something like that.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah, we were talking about that.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I'm not sure if anyone's still using it.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I think the only one using it has been Javier, but at this point I think it's he's only been using it for features that he calculated quite a while ago,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Somebody used it recently.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'so if nobody else is doing'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I'll send mail to speech local.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'feature calculation'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Pardon?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I'll send mail to speech local and see if anyone's still using it.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'How much space is that using up?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Do you have any idea?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'It's uh twentyC Ds, so that's twelve gigabytes.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So that would last us for a while.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah, couple hours!'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Well, anyway for this this recording we're fine cuz we're only we're only'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'how many mikes are we recording right now?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Well, right now we don't have any choice.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'It r still records all sixteen channels.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'It's just most of them are all zeroes.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So that that's on our list too.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah, well that we can'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'do something about.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yep.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'It's mostly a question of user interface.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'How do we how do we specify which ones are on?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah, so we don't store any of our audio formats compressed in any way do we?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So these large sections when you guys aren't talking'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Probably, we could we could probably just run Shorten on them or something and it will get a big win.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I think that's a good Shorten.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Run what on those?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Tony Robinson's'",
        "'speaker_C': 'uh lossless compression thing.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'What's it do?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Um,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'it'",
        "'speaker_C': 'it does AR'",
        "'speaker_C': 'modeling'",
        "'speaker_C': 'and so it looks at a section, it runs an AR model to sort of r w to whiten it'",
        "'speaker_C': 'and then quantizes'",
        "'speaker_C': 'the residual'",
        "'speaker_C': 'with a nice with the three bits it can get away with.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Something like that.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So I think it On on each block it'll it'll compress you know if there's load on in any range it'll use ratio bits.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I think it does that.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah, so,PZ.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah, well.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah, it's something that that we definitely need to look at with this.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Maybe we shouldn't've subsampled it down to sixteen bits for our first try.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Well, it's OK, it's only the first try.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I what I'm thinking is um'",
        "'speaker_C': 'obviously we can do the we can we can choose any sixteen bits from the,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'so we can just have different gain things'",
        "'speaker_C': 'that we use you know per channel.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah, so we might wanna see if maybe the low sixteen bits on thePZ are better than the middle'",
        "'speaker_B': 'sixteen bits.'",

        "'speaker_A': 'Right.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'And uh'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Exactly exactly.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I think there are enough incidental meetings for us to to do this.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And if we can get it set up so it is convenient enough,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'um, then you can just do spontaneous meetings as well.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah, I mean that's the thing.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'It's OK to g'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Right.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Right.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Cuz'",
        "'speaker_B': 'That's right.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'But I mean if we if we want Jerry's group to use it then we probably won't ask them to read any numbers, right?'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Cuz.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Well, I I bet they would be willing to do it the first few times, just for the novelty.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_A': 'That was it.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'would be interested enough and have her read'",

        "'speaker_A': 'Um'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'to a to an outside service'",
        "'speaker_A': 'and uh see what that costs and how much hassle that is.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'And then we can'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah, the the problem of course is that it's'",

        "'speaker_A': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'You would send I mean,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'uh a transcriber is used I mean, I don't know, assume presumably a transcriber transcribes a single meeting, right?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And so they'",
        "'speaker_C': 'they just have to indicate that the speaker changes.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Right?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Right?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So you just pick one, with the best sounding one, and give it to somebody and they transcribe it.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'For one of one of.'",

        "'speaker_A': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Oh, that would be interesting.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'and we could do all kinds of weird things like having you know squelch so that you only, you know you only you'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I mean there's'",
        "'speaker_B': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'it's'",
        "'speaker_C': 'If we if we do something which is have a little bit of human input to get the words'",
        "'speaker_C': 'then we can leverage that a lot by some clever cross thing to figure out which channel they really belong to and stuff like this,'",

        "'speaker_C': 'probably.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yet.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'and uh we've heard estimates ranging between ten and twenty'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Wow.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'so you know in in principle then it'll take somebody a day for somebody to deal with this.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Mm hmm.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah, one of the things I was thinking with transcript is that if we take the near field'",
        "'speaker_B': 'and we do an initial recognition pass, is it easier for a transcriber to correct a transcript,'",

        "'speaker_C': 'is sort of a less less easy thing to do.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I don't know.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I do I don't know the answer to that.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I'm sure the professional transcribers obviously don't have any use for'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah, that's true, that's true.'",

        "'speaker_A': 'what is the output of the recognizer.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So maybe it depends on what the software tools are like.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'They should all be in India right now.'",
