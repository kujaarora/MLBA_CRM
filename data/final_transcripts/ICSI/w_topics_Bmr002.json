        "'speaker_C': 'Hmm.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'This is great.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'program it once'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Uh huh.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And and then put it on another machine and it would work.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'No, no.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So the question is do you know of resources that we could use.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Mm hmm, yeah, OK, so now I've I've been involved with some of that.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Oh, really?'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Oh, you do have to pay them.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Awesome.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'What I mean is it's not necessarily monetary.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And otherwise, as part of a grant, you can you can do it.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'I think so.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'OK.'",
