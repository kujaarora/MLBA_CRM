        "'speaker_B': 'I think we should make little marks on the table top.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Oh, OK.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Which means we need to move this thing, and sorta decide how we're actually going to do things.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So that we can put them'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I guess that's the point.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'Cuz it's gonna hang down, make noise.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'When's it gonna be installed?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Well, it depends on'",

        "'speaker_A': 'Um, I've looked a little bit into commercial transcription services and Jane has been working on doing transcription.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Uh, and so we wan wanna decide what we're gonna do with that and then get an update on the electronics, and then, uh, maybe also talk a little bit about some infrastructure and tools, and so on.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Um, you know, eventually we're probably gonna wanna distribute this thing and we should decide how we're gonna'",
        "'speaker_A': 'how we're gonna handle some of these factors.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Distribute what?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Hmm?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'The data?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I mean, so we're we're collecting a corpus and I think it's gonna be generally useful.'",

        "'speaker_A': 'uh, has been done before.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Oh.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'tapes.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'And and so how we do we distribute the transcripts, how do we distribute the audio files, how do we'",
        "'speaker_A': 'how do we just do all that infrastructure?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Well, I think'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I mean, for that particular issue ther there are known sources where people go to to find these kind of things like the LDC for instance.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah, that's right.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Right, but but so should we do it in the same format as LDC and what does that mean to what we've done already?'",

        "'speaker_A': 'ad hoc combination of stuff Dan set and stuff I set up,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'which we may wanna make a little more formal.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And the other thing is that, um,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'University of Washington may want to start recording meetings as well, in which case'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'w w we'll have to decide what we've actually got so that we can'",

        "'speaker_A': 'That's right.'",

        "'speaker_A': 'Visit my friends and'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'spend some time Well, and then also I have a bunch of stuff for doing this digits.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So I have a bunch of scripts withX Waves, and some Perl scripts, and other things that make it really easy to extract out and align where the digits are.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'And ifU d UW's going to do the same thing I think it's worth while for them to do these digits tasks as well.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'And what I've done is pretty ad hoc,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'um, so we might wanna change it over to something a little more standard.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Hmm.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'You know, STM files, or XML, or something.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'An and there's interest up there?'",

        "'speaker_D': 'There's interest up there?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Well they they certainly wanna collect more data.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'And so they're applying, I thinkIB?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Is that right?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I don't know.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Something like that.'",

        "'speaker_A': 'Um, but of course we're not gonna do that if we don't get money.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I see.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'And I would like that just to get a disjoint speaker set and a disjoint room.'",

        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah, we'",
        "'speaker_D': 'But if if there was a way to merge the two'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Well, I mean, but sometimes it's easier to type out something instead of going through and figuring out which is the right I mean, it depends on the error rate, right?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'That'd be fun.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I mean, we've talked about it but'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Well s but but again the timing is for fr should be for free.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'The timing should be'",
        "'speaker_C': 'But we don't care about the timing of the words.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Well I thought you just that's said that was a critical issue.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'No, uh the the boundary'",
        "'speaker_A': 'We don't care about the timing of the words, just of the utterances.'",

        "'speaker_E': 'boundary.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'We haven't decided which which time we care about, and that's kind of one of the things that you're saying, is like you have the option to put in more or less timing data'",
        "'speaker_B': 'and, uh, be in the absence of more specific instructions,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'we're trying to figure out what the most convenient thing to do is.'",

        "'speaker_A': 'more or less breath g not breath groups, sort of phrases, continuous phrases.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'And so, um, that's nice because you you separate when you do an extract, you get a little silence on either end.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So that seems to work really well.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'That's ideal.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Um.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Although I was I you know, the alternative, which I was sort of experimenting with before I ran out of time,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_E': 'But, you know, obviously there's a lag between when you hear it and when you can press the return key so it's slightly delayed, so then you you listen to it a second time and move it over to here.'",

        "'speaker_E': 'So that takes time.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Um,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'and and throw out the words, but keep the time markings.'",

        "'speaker_E': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Good idea.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'given that we had perfect boundary detection.'",

        "'speaker_E': 'I should have it finished by the end of the day.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'No, but the thing is the fact that she's she's did it before just might give a lower bound.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'That's all.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Exactly.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Uh, which is fine.'",

        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Well, uh but there's an extra problem which is that I didn't really keep accurate uh, it wasn't a pure task the first time, so uh, it's gonna be an upper bound in in that case.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Oh!'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And it's not really strictly comparable.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So I think though it's a good proposal to be used on a new a new batch of text that I haven't yet done yet in the same meeting.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Could use it on the next segment of the text.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'The point we where do we get the the the oracle boundaries from?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Or the boundaries.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah, one person would have to assign the boundaries and the and the other person would have to I mean that's easy enough.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Well, but couldn't I do it for the next'",
        "'speaker_B': 'We we we could get fake'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Oh, I see what you mean.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I could do that.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Well, but the oracle boundaries would come from volume on a partic specific channel wouldn't they?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'That would be the automatic boundaries.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'No, no, no, no.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'No, no.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'You wanna know given Given a perfect human segmentation, I mean, you wanna know how well I mean, the the question is, is it worth giving you the segmentation?'",

        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I mean, that that's easy enough.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I could generate the segmentation and and you could do the words,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'and time yourself on it.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'A little double ear kind of thing.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yep.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'I see.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So it that might be worth doing.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'That's good.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'I like that.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'That would at least tell us whether it's worth spending a week or two trying to get a tool,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'that will compute the segmentations.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And the thing to keep in mind too about this tool, guys is that sure, you can do the computation for what we're gonna do in the future but if if UW's talking about doing two, or three, or five times as much stuff and they can use the same tool, then obviously there's a real multiplier there.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Right.'",

        "'speaker_A': 'Trivial.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'They had two speakers over the telephone.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Oh, I see.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So what took them so long?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Um, mostly because they were doing much lower level time.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So they were doing phone and syllable'",
        "'speaker_A': 'transcription, as well as, uh, word transcription.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'And so we're w we decided early on that we were not gonna do that.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'I see.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'But there's still the same issue of managing the process, of of reviewing and keeping the files straight, and all this stuff, that which is clearly a hassle.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yep.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'And so so what I'm saying is that if we hire an external service I think we can expect three hundred dollars an hour.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I think that's the ball park.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'There were several different companies that and the the range was very tight for technical documents.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Twenty eight to thirty two dollars an hour.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And who'",
        "'speaker_C': 'who knows if they're gonna be able to m manage multal multiple channel data?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah, they won't.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'They won't.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'They w they'll refuse to do it.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'We'll have to mix them.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And then there's the problem also that'",
        "'speaker_B': 'No, but I mean, they they they won't they won't they will refuse to transcribe this kind of material.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'That's not what they're d quoting for, right?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Well, they might they might quote it'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yes, it is.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'For quoting meetings?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Sev several of them say that they'll do meetings, and conferences, and s and so on.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Wow.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'None of them specifically said that they would do speaker ID,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'or speaker change mark.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Th th the th there may be just multiplier for five people costs twice as much and for ten people co Something like that.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'They all just said transcription.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah, yeah, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Well, the the way it worked is it it was scaled.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So what they had is, if it's an easy task it costs twenty four dollars an hour and it will take maybe five or six times real time.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'And what they said is for the hardest tasks, bad acoustics, meeting settings, it's thirty two dollars an hour and it takes about ten times real time.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I see.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So I think that we can count on that being'",
        "'speaker_A': 'about what they would do.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'It would probably be a little more because we're gonna want them to do speaker marking.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'A lot of companies I've worked for y the, uh the person leading the meeting, the executive or whatever, would sort of go around the room and and mentally calculate h how many dollars per hour this meeting was costing, right?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'In university atmosphere you get a little different thing.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'But you know, it's a lot like, he's worth fifty an hour, he's worth\" And so he so here we're thinking, well let's see, if the meeting goes another hour it's going to be another thousand dollars.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'You know?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'It's'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So ch So every everybody ta Talk really fast.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yep, we have to have a short meeting.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'That's very interesting.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Stop talking!'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Let's get it over with.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Talk slowly but with few words.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'And clearly.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And'",
        "'speaker_B': 'That's right.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'only talk when you're pointed to.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'There you go.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Content words only.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'We could have some telegraphic meetings.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'That might be interesting.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah, it'd be cheap.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Cheap to transcribe.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'But at any rate, so we we have a ballpark on how much it would cost if we send it out.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And we're talking about do doing how many hours worth of meetings?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Thirty or forty.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So thirty or forty thousand dollars.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Well, for ten thousand dollars.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So, meanwhile'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Oh.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'What Well, it was thirty times'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Three hundred.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Three hundred dollars an hour.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Oh, I'm sorry, three hundred.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Right, I w got an extra factor of three there.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So it's thirty dollars an hour, essentially, right?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'But we can pay a graduate student seven dollars an hour.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And the question is what's the difference or ei eight dollars.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'How how much lower are they?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'What do you know what the going rate is?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'It's it's on the order of eight to ten.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'I think uh that would give us a a good good estimate.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I think.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'But I'm not sure.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'I'd I'd say yeah, I was gonna say eight you'd say ten?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Ten.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Let's say ten.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah, give them a break.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'The these are not for engineering graduate students, right?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Cuz it's easier.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Right, these are linguistics grad students.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'That's right.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah, I I I don't I don't know what the I don't know what the standard but there is a standard pay scale I just don't know what it is.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Six.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah, that's right.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'That's right.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Um,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'so that means that even if it takes them thirty times real time it's cheaper to'",
        "'speaker_C': 'to do graduate students.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And there's another aspect too.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I mean, that's why I said originally, that I couldn't imagine sending it out's gonna be cheaper.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'No, it isn't.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'The other thing too is that, uh, if they were linguistics they'd be you know, in terms of like the post editing, i uh tu uh content wise they might be easier to handle cuz they might get it more right the first time.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'And also we would have control of I mean, we could give them feedback.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Whereas if we do a service it's gonna be limited amount.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Mmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yep, yep.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Good point.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I mean, we can't tell them,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'you know, for this meeting we really wanna mark stress and for this meeting we want\"'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yep.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Good point.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'And and they're not gonna provide they're not gonna provide stress, they're not gonna re provide repairs, they're not gonna provide they they may or may not provide speaker ID.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So that we would have to do our own tools to do that.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Just hypoth hypothetically assuming that that we go ahead and ended up using graduate students.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I just'",
        "'speaker_D': 'I who who's the person in charge?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Who's gonna be the Steve here?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'You?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I hope it's Jane.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Oh, interesting.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Is that alright?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Um, now would this involve some manner of uh, monetary compensation or would I be the voluntary, uh, coordinator of multiple transcribers for checking?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Um, I would imagine there would be some monetary involved but we'd have to talk to Morgan about it.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah, out of out of Adam's pocket.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'You know, it just means you have to stop working for Dave.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'See?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'That's why Dave should have been here.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'To pr protect his people.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Well, I would like you to do it because you have a lot more experience than I do, but if if that's not feasible, I will do it with you as an advisor.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Oh, cool.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Uh huh.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'W we'd like you to do it and we'd like to pay you.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'We'll see.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'That's a'",
        "'speaker_E': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And and then'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Boy, if I wanted to increase my income I could start doing the transcribing again.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah, that's right.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'an an an and be and be sure and say, would you like fries with that when you're thinking about your pay scale.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'I see.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Good.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah, no, that I I would be interested in that in becoming involved in the project in some aspect like that more.'",

        "'speaker_A': 'More.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Um,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'any more on transcript we wanna talk about?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'What s so what are you so you've done some portion of the first meeting.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And what's your plan?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'To carry on doing it?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'What Well, you know what I thought was right now we have p So I gave him the proposal for the transcription conventions.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'He made his, uh, suggestion of improvement.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'The the It's a good suggestion.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So as far as I'm concerned those transcription conventions are fixed right now.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And so my next plan would be'",
        "'speaker_B': 'What what do they what do they cover?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'They're very minimal.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So, it would be good to just to summarize that.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So, um, one of them is the idea of how to indicate speaker change,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'and this is a way which meshes well with with, uh, making it so that, uh, you know, on the At the Boy, it's such a nice interface.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'When you when you get the, um you you get the speech signal you also get down beneath it, an indication of, uh, if you have two speakers overlapping in a s in a single segment, you see them one displayed one above each other.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And then at the same time the top s part of the screen is the actual verbatim thing.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'You can clip click on individual utterances and it'll take you immediately to that part of the speech signal, and play it for you.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And you can, eh you can work pretty well between those two these two things.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Is there a limit to the number of speakers?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Um, the user interface only allows two.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Hmm.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'And so if if you're'",
        "'speaker_A': 'using their interface to specify overlapping speakers you can only do two.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'But my script can handle any.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'And their save format can handle any.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'And so, um, using this the convention that Jane and I have discussed, you can have as many overlapping speakers as you want.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Do y is this a, uh, university project?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Th this is the French software, right?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah, French.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah, yeah, their academic.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'And they're they've been quite responsive.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'eh'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I've been exchanging emails on various issues.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Oh, really?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Oh.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Uh, did you ask them to change the interface for more speakers?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yes, and they said that's on in in the works for the next version.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Good.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Good.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Oh, so multi multichannels.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Multichannels was also Well, they said they wanted to do it but'",
        "'speaker_A': 'that the code is really very'",
        "'speaker_A': 'organized around single channels.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I see.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So I think that's n unlikely to ha happen.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Do do you know what they're using it for?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Why'd they develop it?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Are they linguists?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'For this exact task?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'For transcription.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'It's'",
        "'speaker_D': 'But I mean, are they are they linguists or are they speech recognition people?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I think they're linguists.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Ho Hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Linguists.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'They're they have some connection to the LDC cuz the LDC has been advising them on this process, the Linguistic Data Consortium.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Um, so'",
        "'speaker_C': 'but a apart from that.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'It's also All the source is available.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Great.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'If you if you speak TCLTK.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'And they have they've actually asked if we are willing to do any development and I said, well, maybe.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Good.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So if we want if we did if we did something like programmed in a delay, which actually I think is a great idea, um, I'm sure they would want that incorporated back in.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah, I do too.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Their pre pre lay.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Pre lay.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Pre lay.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Way.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Well, and they've thought about things.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'You know, I mean, they they do have So you have when you when you play it back, um, it's it is useful to have, uh, a a break mark to se segment it.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'But it wouldn't be strictly necessary cuz you can use the uh, the tabbed key to toggle the sound on and off.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'I mean, it'll stop the s speech you know if you if you press a tab.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And, um.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And so,'",
        "'speaker_E': 'uh, that's a nice feature.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And then also once you've put a break in then you have the option of cycling through the unit.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'You could do it like multiply until you get crazy and decide to stop cycling through that unit.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Loop it?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Or or'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yo you n you know, there's al also the the user interface that's missing.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'or'",
        "'speaker_D': 'It's missing from all of our offices, and that is some sort of analog input for something like this.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'It's what audio people actually use of course.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'It's something that wh when you move your hand further, the sound goes faster past it, like fast forward.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'You know, like a joy stick or a uh, you could wire a mouse or trackball to do something like that.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Why, that's'",
        "'speaker_E': 'That's not something I wanted to have happen.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'No, but I'm saying if this is what professionals who actually do this kind of thing for for for m for video or for audio where you you need to do this, and so you get very good at sort of jostling back and forth, rather than hitting tab, and backspace, and carriage return, and enter, and things like that.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'I see.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Uh huh.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Mmm.'",

        "'speaker_E': 'Uh huh.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I I just don't know how much it's worth doing.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Ye Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_E': 'So, uh, you know, I mentioned the looping option.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Another option is it'll pause when it reaches the end of the boundary.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And then to get to the next boundary you just press tab and it goes on to the next unit.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Hmm.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'I mean, it's very nicely thought out.'",

        "'speaker_E': 'and in that case I did a tilde arrow versus a arrow tilde, to indicate that it was continuation but it wasn't Oh, I guess I did equal arrow for the for the own for yourself things cuz it's the speakers the same.'",

        "'speaker_D': 's So it would c basically go on the diagonal here.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'It could go either way.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So why do we have sixteen channels instead of like some fewer number?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I guess.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Uh, because the'",
        "'speaker_B': 'How else are you gonna distribute them around the tables?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Because they're there.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Well, OK, let me rephrase that.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Why two each?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Oh, because then you don't have to just have one each.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So that if t if you have two people sitting next to each other they can actually go into the same box.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_A': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And certainly you could do a thing where all sixteen were plugged in.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Uh if if you ha if you had nothing else.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'thi this box is a one off deal.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Uh.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And, uh, it's function is to s to, uh, essentially a wire converter to go from these little blue wires to these black wires,'",

        "'speaker_A': 'So so you'd imagine some sort of'",

        "'speaker_D': 'Well I w I I the simplest thing I could imagine, i which is really, really simple is to quite literally that these things plug in.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Hmm!'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And there's a there's a plug on the end of each of these these, uh, ei eight cables.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Mm hmm.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Oh, then it comes on.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah, I mean, we I had that last time.'",

        "'speaker_E': 'Hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'No.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Uh,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'using using these'",

        "'speaker_D': 'It's a joke.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah, that's true but we haven't spent that, right?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'I have to do'",
        "'speaker_B': 'But once we once we've done the intellectual part of these,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'uh, we can just knock them out, right?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Cheap.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'We can start we you can make a hundred of them or something.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Oh, of the of the boards?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah, yeah, sure, right.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And then we could Washington could have a system that didn't have any wireless but would had what's based on these and it would cost'",

        "'speaker_D': 'Peanuts.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'But anyway you'd save, on the seven seven or eight thousand for the for the wireless system.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So actually that'",
        "'speaker_B': 'might be attractive.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'OK, I can move my thumb now.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'Oh, I thought like if we talked softer the disk lasts longer.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Well, actually shorten'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'There's a speech compression program that works great on things like this, cuz if the dynamic range is low it encodes it with fewer bits.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'And so most of the time no one's talking so it shortens it dramatically.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'But if you talk quieter, the dynamic range is lower and it will compress better.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_E': 'Oh.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Hmm.'",

        "'speaker_E': 'Oh, interesting.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And shorter words.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Shorter words.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Now, shorter words wouldn't would induce more dynamics,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'right?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'You want to have'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah, but if the words are more predictable.'",
