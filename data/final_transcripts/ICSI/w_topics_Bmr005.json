        "'speaker_D': 'Sure, because I I need a lot of time to to put the label or to do that.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah, I mean, we we know that there's noise.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'And'",

        "'speaker_E': 'There's there's uh continual noise uh from fans and so forth, and there is uh more impulsive noise'",

        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'We know that all that's there and it's a g worthwhile thing to study, but obviously it takes a lot of time to mark all of these things.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Now, why do you need to mark speaker overlap by hand if you can infer it from the relative energy in the I mean, you shouldn't need to do this p completely by hand, right?'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Well, that's'",
        "'speaker_G': 'That's what I was gonna bring up.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Um, OK, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So let's back up because you weren't here for an earlier conversation.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I'm sorry.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'mean, increased energy is sort of an obvious one.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'In the far field mike.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Oh, OK.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Um, and'",
        "'speaker_E': 'uh, it's not obvious, I mean, you could you could do the dumbest thing and get get it ninety percent of the time.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'But when you start going past that and trying to do better, it's not obvious what combination of features is gonna give you the you know, the right detector.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So the idea is to have some ground truth first.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And so the i the idea of the manual marking was to say OK this, i you know, it's it's really here\".'",
        "'speaker_A': 'But I think Liz is saying why not get it out of the transcripts?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'What I mean is'",
        "'speaker_C': 'get it from the close talking mikes.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Uh, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'A or ge get a first pass from those, and then go through sort of It'd be a lot faster probably to'",
        "'speaker_E': 'We t we t w we t we talked about that.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'And you can'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Yeah, that's his, uh'",
        "'speaker_E': 'We we we talked about that.'",
        "'speaker_E': 's But so it's a bootstrapping thing and the thing is, the idea was, i we i i we thought it would be useful for him to look at the data anyway,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah, I just'",
        "'speaker_E': 'and and then whatever he could mark would be helpful, and we could Uh it's a question of what you bootstrap from.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Right.'",

        "'speaker_E': 'then do your simple measurements, uh from the close talking mike.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'I mean, even with the close talking mike you're not gonna get it right all the time.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Well, that's what I wonder, because um or how bad it is, be um, because that would be interesting especially because the bottleneck is the transcription.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Well'",
        "'speaker_G': 'I'm working on a program to do that, and'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Right?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I mean, we've got a lot more data than we have transcriptions for.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'We have the audio data, we have the close talking mike, so I mean it seems like'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'one kind of project that's not perfect, but'",
        "'speaker_C': 'um, that you can'",
        "'speaker_C': 'get the training data for pretty quickly is, you know, if you infer form the close talking mikes where the on off points are of speech,'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Right, we discussed that.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'you know, how can we detect that from a far field?'",
        "'speaker_G': 'And'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Oh.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'I've I've written a program to do that, and it, uh'",
        "'speaker_C': 'OK, I'm sorry I missed the'",
        "'speaker_E': 'It's OK.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'and so but it's it's doing something very, very simple.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'It just takes a threshold, based on on the volume,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Uh huh.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Or you can set the threshold low and then weed out the false alarms by hand.'",

        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Well, it's definitely good to have somebody look at it.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I was just thinking as a way to speed up'",

        "'speaker_B': 'I told her that would be a little bit difficult to say.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So I think from a s practical standpoint, maybe we could have them do it once every ten meetings, or something.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'It won't be that many people who do it'",
        "'speaker_B': 'that often, but'",
        "'speaker_B': 'um just, you know,'",

        "'speaker_E': 'uh'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Well, do we have that much?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Not really.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'It's three to four per week.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So'",
        "'speaker_C': 'that's what You know, that'",
        "'speaker_E': 'uh eight weeks, uh is'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So that's not a lot of hours.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Um'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I was starting to think of some projects where you would use'",

        "'speaker_C': 'energy detection on the close talking mikes.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'There are a number of'",
        "'speaker_C': 'interesting questions that you can ask about how interactions happen in a meeting, that don't require any transcription.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So what are the patterns, the energy patterns over the meeting?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And I'm really interested in this'",
        "'speaker_C': 'but we don't have'",
        "'speaker_C': 'a whole lot of data.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So I was thinking, you know, we've got the room set up'",
        "'speaker_C': 'and you can always think of, also for political reasons, if ICSI collected'",
        "'speaker_C': 'you know, two hundred hours, that looks different than forty hours, even if we don't transcribe it ourselves,'",
        "'speaker_E': 'But I don't think we're gonna stop at the end of this semester.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'so'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Right?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So, I th I think that if we are able to keep that up'",
        "'speaker_E': 'for a few months, we are gonna have more like a hundred hours.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I mean, is there Are there any other meetings here that we can'",
        "'speaker_C': 'record, especially meetings that have some kind of conflict in them or some kind of deci I mean, that are less well I don't'",

        "'speaker_C': 'OK.'",

        "'speaker_G': 'That's That would be a good match.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So I I uh, I I'd mentioned to Adam, and that was another thing I was gonna talk uh, mention to them before'",
        "'speaker_E': 'that uh there's uh It it oc it occurred to me that we might be able to get some additional data'",
        "'speaker_E': 'by talking to uh acquaintances in local broadcast media.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Because, you know, we had talked before about the problem about using found data,'",

        "'speaker_E': 'in a, uh, uh or and and so it doesn't really give us the the the uh characteristics we want.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Um and so I do think we're gonna continue recording here and record what we can.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'But um, it did occur to me that we could go to friends in broadcast media and say hey you have this panel show,'",
        "'speaker_E': 'or this you know, this discussion show,'",
        "'speaker_E': 'and um can you record multi channel?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And uh they may be willing'",
        "'speaker_E': 'to record it uh with'",
        "'speaker_C': 'With lapel mikes or something?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Well, they probably already use lapel, but they might be able to have it it wouldn't be that weird for them to have another mike that was somewhat distant.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'It wouldn't be exactly this setup, but it would be that sort of thing, and what we were gonna get from UW, you know, assuming they they they start recording, isn't als also is not going to be this exact setup.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'No, I think that'd be great, if we can get more data.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So, I I I I was thinking of looking into that.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'the other thing that occurred to me after we had that discussion, in fact, is that it's even possible, since of course, many'",
        "'speaker_E': 'radio shows are not live,'",
        "'speaker_E': 'uh that we could invite them to have like some of their record some of their shows here.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Wow!'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Well Or The thing is, they're not as averse to wearing one of these head mount I mean, they're on the radio, right?'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Right, as we are.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Um, I think that'd be fantastic cuz those kinds of panels and Those have interesting'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Th that's an a side of style a style that we're not collecting here, so it'd be great.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And and the I mean, the other side to it was the what which is where we were coming from I'll I'll talk to you more about it later is that is that there's there's uh'",
        "'speaker_E': 'the radio stations and television stations already'",
        "'speaker_E': 'have stuff worked out presumably, uh related to, you know, legal issues and and permissions and all that.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'I mean, they already do what they do do whatever they do.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So it's'",
        "'speaker_E': 'uh, it's So it's so it's another source.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So I think'",
        "'speaker_E': 'it's something we should look into, you know, we'll collect what we collect here hopefully they will collect more at UW also'",
        "'speaker_E': 'and um and maybe we have this other source.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'But yeah I think that it's not unreasonable to aim at'",
        "'speaker_E': 'getting, you know, significantly in excess of a hundred hours.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'I mean, that was sort of our goal.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'The thing was, I was hoping that we could in the under this controlled situation we could at least collect, you know, thirty to fifty hours.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And at the rate we're going we'll get pretty close to that I think this semester.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And if we continue to collect some next semester, I think we should,'",
        "'speaker_E': 'uh'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah I was mostly trying to think, OK, if you start a project,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'within say a month, you know, how much data do you have to work with.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And you you wanna s you wanna sort of fr freeze your your data'",
        "'speaker_C': 'for awhile'",
        "'speaker_C': 'so um right now and we don't have the transcripts back yet from IBM right?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Well, we don't even have it for this f you know, forty five minutes, that was'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Do'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Oh, do we now?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So um, not complaining, I was just trying to think, you know, what kinds of projects can you do now versus uh six months from now and they're pretty different, because'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So I was thinking right now it's sort of this exploratory stuff where you you look at the data, you use some primitive measures and get a feeling for what the scatter plots look like, and'",
        "'speaker_C': 'um'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Right, right.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'and and uh and meanwhile we collect, and it's more like yeah, three months from now, or six months from now you can you can do a lot of other things.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Cuz I'm not actually sure, just logistically that I can spend you know, I don't wanna charge the time that I have on the project too early, before there's enough data to make'",
        "'speaker_C': 'good use of the time.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And that's and especially with the student'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'uh for instance this guy who seems'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Uh anyway, I shouldn't say too much, but um if someone came that was great and wanted to do some real work and they have to end by the end of this school year in the spring, how much data will I'",
        "'speaker_C': 'have to work with, with that person.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And so it's'",
        "'speaker_E': 'i Yeah, so I would think, exploratory things now.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Uh, three months from now Um, I mean the transcriptions I think are a bit of an unknown cuz we haven't gotten those back yet as far as the timing, but I think as far as the collection, it doesn't seem to me l like, uh, unreasonable to say that'",
        "'speaker_E': 'uh in'",
        "'speaker_E': 'January, you know, ro roughly uh which is roughly three months from now,'",
        "'speaker_E': 'we should have at least something like, you know, twenty five, thirty hours.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And we just don't know about the transcription part of'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So that's'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah, we need to I think that there's a possibility that the transcript will need to be adjusted afterwards, and uh es especially since these people won't be uh used to dealing with multi channel uh transcriptions.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'that, so.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I mean, it'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So I think that we'll need to adjust some And also if we wanna add things like'",
        "'speaker_B': 'um,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'well, more refined coding of overlaps, then definitely I think we should count on having an extra pass through.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I wanted to ask another a a aspect of the data collection.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'There'd be no reason why a person couldn't get together several uh, you know, friends, and come and argue about a topic if they wanted to, right?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'If they really have something they wanna talk about as opposed to something I mean, what we're trying to stay away from was artificial constructions, but I think if it's a real'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Why not?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I mean, I'm thinking, politically'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Stage some political debates.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'You could do this, you know.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Well yeah, or just if you're'",
        "'speaker_B': 'You could.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'if you ha If there are meetings here that happen that we can record even if we don't'",
        "'speaker_C': 'um have them do the digits, or maybe have them do a shorter digit thing like if it was, you know,'",
        "'speaker_G': 'We don't have to do the digits at all if we don't want to.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'uh, one string of digits, or something, they'd probably be willing to do.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Then, having the data is very valuable, cuz I think it's'",
        "'speaker_C': 'um'",
        "'speaker_C': 'politically better for us to say we have this many hours of audio data, especially with the ITR, if we put in a proposal on it.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'It'll just look like ICSI's collected a lot more'",
        "'speaker_C': 'audio data.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Um, whether it's transcribed or not'",
        "'speaker_C': 'um, is another issue, but there's'",
        "'speaker_C': 'there are research'",
        "'speaker_C': 'questions you can answer without the transcriptions, or at least that you can start to answer.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Yep.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'It seems like you could hold some meetings.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'You know, you and maybe Adam?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'You you could you could maybe hold some additional meetings, if you wanted.'",

        "'speaker_A': 'One is uh'",
        "'speaker_A': 'um without doing the digits'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Or, I guess the full blown one is where you do the digits, and everything, and then talk about doing it without digits, what if we had another level, just to collect data, which is without the headsets and we just did the'",
        "'speaker_A': 'table mounted stuff.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Need the close talking mikes.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'You do, OK.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I mean, absolutely, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I'm really scared'",
        "'speaker_G': 'It seems like it's a big part of this corpus is to have the close talking mikes.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Um or at least, like, me personally?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I see, OK.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I would I couldn't use that data.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I agree.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Um.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And Mari also, we had This came up when she she was here.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'That's important.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah, I I'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So it's a great idea, and if it were true than I would just do that, but it's not that bad like the room is not the bottleneck, and we have enough time in the room, it's getting the people to come in and put on the and get the setup going.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'b By the'",
        "'speaker_E': 'by the way, I don't think the transcriptions are actually,'",
        "'speaker_E': 'in the long run, such a big bottleneck.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'I think the issue is just that we're we're blazing that'",

        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'So it'll be early next week.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah, OK.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So early next week we send it to them, and then then we check with them to see if they've got it and we we start, you know'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Yep.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'asking about the timing for it.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So I think once they get'",
        "'speaker_E': 'it sorted out about how they're gonna do it, which I think they're pretty well along on, cuz they were able to read the files and so on.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Yep.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'What if'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Yeah, you we can't complain.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'But they But at any rate, they'll I I think once they get that sorted out, they're they're making cassettes there, then they're handing it to someone who they who's who is doing it, and uh'",
        "'speaker_E': 'I think'",
        "'speaker_E': 'it's not going to be I don't think it's going to be that much more of a deal for them to do thirty hours then to do one hour, I think.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Yep.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'It's not going to be thirty It's'",
        "'speaker_G': 'I think that's probably true.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Really?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So it's the amount of'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Right.'",

        "'speaker_G': 'Once the pipeline fills.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'you know, two or three more meeting a week, just to have the data, even if they're'",
        "'speaker_C': 'um not doing the digits, but they do wear the headphones?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'But the lunch meetings are pretty much one person getting up and'",
        "'speaker_C': 'No, I meant, um, sorry, the meetings where people eat their lunch'",
        "'speaker_C': 'downstairs, maybe they don't wanna be recorded, but'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Oh, and we're just chatting?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Just the ch the chatting.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Yeah, we have a lot of those.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I actually I actually think that's useful data, um'",
        "'speaker_C': 'the chatting, but'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Yeah, the problem with that is I would I think I would feel a little constrained to'",
        "'speaker_C': 'OK.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'OK.'",

        "'speaker_G': 'I guess none of you were there for our soccer ball meeting.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Alright.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Alright, so I'll just throw it out there, if anyone knows of one more m or two more wee meetings per week that happen at ICSI, um'",
        "'speaker_G': 'That was hilarious.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'that we could record, I think it would be worth it.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Well, we should also check with Mari again, because they because they were really intending, you know, maybe just'",
        "'speaker_E': 'didn't happen, but they were really intending to be duplicating this in some level.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So then that would double what we had.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Uh.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And there's a lot of different meetings at UW uh I mean really m a lot more than we have here right cuz we're not right on campus, so.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Is the uh, notion of recording any of Chuck's meetings dead in the water, or is that still a possibility?'",

        "'speaker_E': 'uh Jerry was open to it but I I s'",
        "'speaker_E': 'One of the things that I think is a little a little bit of a limitation, there is a think when the people are not involved uh in our work, we probably can't do it every week.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'You know?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'I I I I think that that people are gonna feel uh'",
        "'speaker_E': 'are gonna feel a little bit constrained.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Now, it might get a little better if we don't have them do the digits all the time.'",
