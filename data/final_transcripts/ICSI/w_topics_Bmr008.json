        "'speaker_A': 'You could say'",

        "'speaker_A': 'so'",

        "'speaker_B': 'uh, could be very very uh, strongly opinionated about something and somebody who's been twenty years out could be shy, you know, s'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So, maybe Undergrad, Grad, Post PHD and Other?'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Mm hmm.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Yes.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'So I'm saying there are going to be What I imagine once we've collected a lot of data, a chunk of it will be uh, the same people many times and another chunk of it will be people random meetings that we got with from different people and I think it's use We've talked about this before, it's useful to have both kinds of data.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'Well I think that if if we're planning to do that, then we should probably have another set of forms.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'You know, a single form that's the consent form and the speaker information form and not have them do digits.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'No, I like the idea of putting down the the status information because I think you probably can get a lot of interest there can be a lot of interesting research on that.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'I'm wondering could we add something to the form that gets filled out at each meeting that would somehow'",
        "'speaker_D': 'This is a topic I want to bring up after I get through this.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So, that that that's another form that I want to discuss.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'um, with the digits forms.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Well'",
        "'speaker_E': 'I guess I was thinking'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So, s can we get'",
        "'speaker_E': 'maybe, you know how you were taking information off of the digits and putting it onto that?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Could we put one more thing on here maybe?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'That's what I want to talk about in a Yeah, I'm I have that as a topic, also.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So, let's finish with the speaker form'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Cuz you said separate forms so I thought maybe'",
        "'speaker_D': 'speaker form and then we'll get over o get over to that one.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So, Education Level, Undergrad, Grad, Post PHD, Professor, Other.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'OK?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'um and then I put Optional\" with a big Optional\" in parentheses, Age.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Wait, why is that optional?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Because I think a lot of people are sensitive to it and won't want to write it down.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So I don't want to make them feel like they have to.'",

        "'speaker_E': 'Oh, right.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Well it'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Well, wait wait wait wait a minute, um, It's not illegal or anything right, it's not pushing on anything unethical or illegal, whatever, to ask for their age, right?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'You know, like'",
        "'speaker_A': 'No, not at all, every most corpora have that, you know, information.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I suggest you ask for their age and if they say I don't want to give it say OK.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'In in like the London Lund they they the researchers themselves estimate the age afterw after the fact.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_F': 'middle thirties, you know fifties or sixties, and they and they just they estimate for the person But'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Well, I think that just having on the form saying Optional, Age, again means I don't have to be sitting here and explaining the form every time we do this.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'yeah, that's OK.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'And it isn't it isn't that boldf'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And having a little instruction sheet and say If you're in this age range do this, and if you're in this rage do that.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I see.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_A': 'Well, those who don't give it we will be estimating your age for you'",

        "'speaker_E': 'You know?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I think you you give eh'",

        "'speaker_F': 'That is kind of nice.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'the the sort of the Steve suggestion, uh, as as an add on to it, right?'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'It's just the wording of it.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And then they they could s Right yeah, they could say it different ways.'",

        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah, y there is actu you made me think about another wrinkle in this whole thing, which is that just asking them where they grew up between certain ages isn't enough, because somebody could grow up in Germany but live on an army base speaking English.'",

        "'speaker_A': 'it it's sort of a general help'",
        "'speaker_A': 'but I think that anyone who's doing phonetics wouldn't rely on that, they would probably use it as a first pass or something,'",

        "'speaker_D': 'Well maybe should we just'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Then maybe we shouldn't just shouldn't ask.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Well, I think we do need to make sure about the f the non native accents because those are, you know but we don't need to ha be really really specific about the others, because it won't be very w helpful anyway.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Mm hmm.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'So, I didn't put Canadian, Australian, and all the other varieties.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'But Other is there, and people will fill that out.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'e But do you think those three are OK?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'They'll see by example.'",

        "'speaker_A': 'We could ask them for more information, but I don't think it's'",
        "'speaker_D': 'I thought this was be fast.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Well that's what the final the fin the third category was designed to do, because I mean, you have a bunch of different types of accents in New York'",

        "'speaker_F': 'It's a little bit unbounded.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'um'",
        "'speaker_B': 'so are you suggesting that you put something in about childhood in there.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'well, you know, there's this issue of of what age is relevant for the formation of your speech patterns, whatever they are.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Well you could distinguish between pre five and five t five to twelve, right?'",
        "'speaker_F': 'And'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So depending on what someone's interest was in the formation of the phonetic kinds of'",
        "'speaker_B': 'categories or whether or whether you're talking more about their'",
        "'speaker_B': 'linguistic speech patterns, you know'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Oh, that's interesting.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'uh'",
        "'speaker_B': 'so But, again, it depends how fine we wanna get, but we could say uh'",

        "'speaker_B': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I mean, I think the question on regions is really'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Right.'",

        "'speaker_A': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And then we'll have Southern English, you know, whatever'",
        "'speaker_D': 'whatever the TIMIT categories are.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So I think'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Or you could say to somebody, how do you define your your the accent that you have.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'i if you look at this fr'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'um And then you can ask these other questions as well, but what we don't want them to think is that they're living in a certain place'",

        "'speaker_D': 'some form about the individual meeting.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Now, the problem I have with that is I don't know who would be filling it out.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Well, that I think, someone internal to the meeting could do after the fact.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'And this would and and we discussed this, this is with reference to like the DTD, what you would put in the DTD that's meeting specific.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'And it could be something like, oh by the way, the guy giving the presentation today is the student of the professor who you know, whatever\".'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So, speaker A is his professor and they and he's preparing for his quals or some such thing like that.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Or it could be you know, so so and so so are married\".'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Hmm.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Just to pick up an arbitrary an example.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So so and so'",
        "'speaker_F': 'We this wouldn't be relevant all the time but you know, if there's a big discussion on you know, the the um, best way to move house,'",
        "'speaker_F': 'then and these people are talking a whole lot, then it might be interesting information to say oh by the way they're married, or'",
        "'speaker_F': 'I I don't mean, uh, you know.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So th so the sorts of questions I had were one'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Who's gonna fill it out, and who's gonna take responsibility for filling it out'",
        "'speaker_D': 'in each meeting, I mean, will we re will we require it.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'I would tend to leave that e spontaneous, I think that e at the stage of uh Uh, sc scanning the transcripts after they've been produced by by our by IBM,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'At that point, I think that some of these dynamics will appear to be important, and you could you could spend a lot of time enumerating all the different relationships that people have.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And that was my other question, which is um what sort of information do we want to record?'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'I mean, so I think pairwise relationships are pretty easy.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'You know, source, destination, relation.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Are there other sorts of things that might we might want to record?'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Well, I ju I was just thinking, with reference to uh, things that have that bear on the content or the status relations, would be the things'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Without being exhaustive, by any means, but just like I said, if there's a k a certain topic that comes up in the meeting, and that knowing their relationship will clarify it, or if there's a certain dynamic that comes up So, I mean, a person'",
        "'speaker_F': 'is asked a whole bunch of questions, more than you'd usually think they'd be asked, and it turns out it's because he's being prepared for a job interview or something like that, then it's useful to know that that relationship.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'I think that fits in well with the whole meeting map'",
        "'speaker_F': 'But, not to be exhaustive.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'mapping meetings concept is that's another way of looking at'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Interesting.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'looking at it.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'are there anything other than pairwise?'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Oh, well yeah, you could have people who are all part of the same football league, or'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Oh yeah, OK.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'uh'",
        "'speaker_F': 'or chess club, or'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So thi Isn't this an open ended, like basically a notes column?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I mean you can imagine wanting'",
        "'speaker_A': 'you should be able always to attach some'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yes, shirt certainly.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'notes to is this the the place where we would do that, or is there another'",
        "'speaker_D': 'I've been thi I it seems to be that there is We could attach more structure if we wanted to.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'place.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Especially because a lot of these relationships are pairwise power relationships.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I Maybe I was missing something maybe, but'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I mean'",
        "'speaker_B': 'this is something one would try to infer, but how do how would you'",
        "'speaker_B': 'How would you freeze that information about what, uh, I mean, we already have these things about someone's a professor and someone's a student, or something, but would you would you'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Some person would be writing OK this person was leading the meeting and that was or or is that what you mean, or'",
        "'speaker_B': 'What what what uh,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Um, just as an example, it would be, Source, Adam Janin\", Destination, Morgan\", Relationship, Advisor\".'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Oh, so you're just putting preexisting relationships that are'",
        "'speaker_D': 'that are relevant.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I think that starts to'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I see.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'There's definitely some clear cases,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'but there are a lot of gray areas, where'",
        "'speaker_B': 'yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yep.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'the context happens'",
        "'speaker_A': 'just in that meeting, or,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I mean, where you don't wanna sort of'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah, I m'",
        "'speaker_A': 'have to'",
        "'speaker_A': 'make a distinction between a pre existing relationship, or'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Well, realize, w this was the idea was that this would be meeting specific.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Otherwise, they would'",
        "'speaker_F': 'it would be possible to have a higher level thing.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'But I mean, there are some that generalize over many meetings and there are some that don't, and there are some things that happen in between meetings,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Right, but that example was not'",
        "'speaker_F': 'That's true.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Right, so my example was not a good one, because that's'",
        "'speaker_F': 'That's true.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So, I mean, for today, for instance, this is the second meeting recorded today.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'and'",
        "'speaker_B': 'The first meeting was a was a front end meeting, and in that one, the basic form of that was uh, I was the leader,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'and I was saying uh, what are the results you've gotten in the last week?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And they were and uh one person was sort of taking the lead, in describing what the results were,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'and then uh, Chuck was taking the role of saying, well, what did you mean by that?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'so he was sort of like the out s semi outsider, asking curiosity questions.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And then it would come back to me with saying well, you know, you showed me that but you know, I think you should do this in the future, so it was very much sort of'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Leader\" and and and and Led\" sort of relationship.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And um'",
        "'speaker_B': 'the guy I was primarily doing this with uh is is a visiting researcher, uh, in this l meeting, uh, you are my graduate student, but uh it's not taking that kind of role at all, right?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'You're you're you're actually leading the meeting for the most part, most of this meeting, so it's'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Well, it's just cuz it's my turn.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah, well, whatever.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Uh Yeah, so I I don't know, so you're suggesting'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I think this one needs to be open ended, completely open ended, and'",
        "'speaker_A': 'the only concern I would have is if there's something we wanna be able to say and we can't put it in that field.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Well, the there's'",
        "'speaker_F': 'I mean.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'I g you You're the expert on theDT, but'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Well, theDT mean we can do whatever however we want it.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'But what I what I was thinking uh the reason that I didn't want to make it completely open ended is that it does seems like there is some structure which is common.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Especially with these pairwise ones, where you can describe them and pairwise.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So you mean like'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And you might want a tool that used that information.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Is there a way that we can add keywords or sub'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I don't know what you would call them, but little labels'",
        "'speaker_A': 'for things that we decide are useful things to have'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Sure, absolutely.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'but'",
        "'speaker_A': 'You know, as long as we have this one'",
        "'speaker_A': 'place where it can all be stored, then we're fine, I think.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Right, cuz it seems like it's sort of a'",
        "'speaker_A': 'and those'll probably occur I mean, to us, we'll think of a few of them, some other researcher will think of'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'some totally different'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Exactly.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'It's sort of a research question, you you're analyzing the meeting and you're deciding, ah, there's this kind of structure to it.'",
