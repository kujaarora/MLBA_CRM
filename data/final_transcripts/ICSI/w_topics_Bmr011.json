        "'speaker_B': 'uh, there's a whole range of things there's a whole array of things,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'that people do on this.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So, um,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'the, uh'",
        "'speaker_B': 'the big arrays, uh, places, uh, like uh, Rutgers, and Brown, and other other places,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'uh, they have, uh, big arrays with, I don't know, a hundred hundred mikes or something.'",
        "'speaker_H': 'Xerox.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And so there's a wall of mikes.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And you get really, really good beam forming with that sort of thing.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Wow.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And it's and, um, in fact at one point we had a'",
        "'speaker_B': 'a proposal in with Rutgers where we were gonna do some of the sort of per channel signal processing and they were gonna do the multi channel stuff, but it d it d we ended up not doing it.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'But'",
        "'speaker_E': 'I've seen demonstrations of the microphone arrays.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'But the No, there are these commercial things now you can buy that have four mikes or something and and, uh,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'um'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So, yeah, there's there's there's a range of things that people do.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Huh.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Um, so if we connected up with somebody who was interested in doing that sort of thing that's that's a good thing to do.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I mean, whenever I've described this to other people who are interested on the with the acoustic side'",
        "'speaker_B': 'that's invariably the question they ask.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Just like someone who is interested in the general dialogue thing will always ask'",
        "'speaker_B': 'um, are you recording video?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Um, right?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Right, right.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And and the acoustic people will always say, well are you doing, uh, uh, array microphones?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So it's it's a good thing to do,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'but it doesn't solve the problem of how do you solve things when there's one mike or at best two mikes in in this imagined PDA that we have.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So maybe maybe we'll do some more of it.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Well one thing I I mean, I don't know.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'I mean, I know that having an array of I mean, I would imagine it would be more expensive to have a an array of microphones.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'But couldn't you kind of approximate the natural sis situation by just shutting off uh, channels when you're later on?'",
        "'speaker_G': 'I mean, it seems like if the microphones don't effect each other then couldn't you just, you know, record them with an array and then just not use all the data?'",
        "'speaker_H': 'It's it's just a lot of infrastructure that'",
        "'speaker_G': 'I see.'",
        "'speaker_H': 'for our particular purpose we felt we didn't need to set up.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Fine.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah, if ninety nine percent of what you're doing is c is shutting off most of the mikes, then going through the'",
        "'speaker_B': 'But if you get somebody who's who who has that as a primary interest then that put then that drives it in that direction.'",
        "'speaker_H': 'That's right, I mean if someone if someone came in and said we really want to do it,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_H': 'I mean, we don't care.'",
        "'speaker_H': 'That would be fine,'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So to save that data you You have to have one channel recording per mike in the array?'",
        "'speaker_H': 'Buy more disk space.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Is that'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Well, uh, at some level at some level.'",
        "'speaker_H': 'I usually do a mix.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'But then, you know, there's it there's'",
        "'speaker_E': 'What you save, I mean, if you're going to do research with it.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_B': 'There's'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I I don't know what they're going to do and I don't know how big their array is.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Obviously if you were gonna save all of those channels for later research you'd use up a lot of space.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_H': 'Well their software infrastructure had a very elaborate design for plugging in filters, and mixers, and all sorts of processing.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And, th'",
        "'speaker_H': 'So that they can do stuff in real time and not save out each channel individually.'",

        "'speaker_E': 'Mmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_H': 'So it was, uh'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'for optimum flexibility later you'd want to save each channel.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'But I think in practical situations'",
        "'speaker_B': 'you would have some engine of some sort doing some processing to reduce this to some to the equivalent of a single microphone that was very directional.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Uh, oh, OK, I see.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Right?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So'",

        "'speaker_A': 'You know, it'd be nice if we can have at least,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'uh, make use of the data that we're recording as we go since it's sort of this is the first site that has really collected these really impromptu meetings,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'um, and just have this other information available.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'if we can'",
        "'speaker_A': 'get the investment in just for the infra infrastructure and then,'",

        "'speaker_A': 'it'd be g it'd be good to have'",
        "'speaker_A': 'have the recording.'",
        "'speaker_H': 'You mean to to actually get a microphone array and'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I think.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Well, if'",
        "'speaker_H': 'do that?'",

        "'speaker_A': 'Even if we're not I'm not sure about video.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'That's sort of an video has a little different nature since right n right now we're all being recorded but we're not being taped.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Um, but it definitely in the case of microphone arrays, since if there was a community interested in this,'",
        "'speaker_H': 'Well, but I think we need a researcher here who's interested in it.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'then'",
        "'speaker_H': 'To push it along.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'See the problem is it it took, uh,'",

        "'speaker_B': 'to get together the hardware and the software, and debug stuff in in the microphones, and in the boxes.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And it was a really big deal.'",

        "'speaker_A': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'But, e I think for'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I mean, how we're gonna decide'",
        "'speaker_B': 'For for maximum flexibility later you really don't want to end up with just one channel that's pointed in the direction of the the the p the person with the maximum energy or something like that.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I mean, you you want actually to'",
        "'speaker_B': 'you want actually to have multiple channels being recorded so that you can'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And to do that, it we're going to end up greatly increasing the disk space that we use up,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'we also only have boards that will take up to sixteen channels and in this meeting,'",

        "'speaker_A': 'So suppose you can get an array in because there's some person at Berkeley who's interested and has some equipment, uh, and suppose we can'",
        "'speaker_A': 'as we save it we can, you know, transfer it off to some other place that that holds this this data, who's interested, and even if ICSI it itself isn't.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Um, and it it seems like as long as we can time align the beginning,'",
