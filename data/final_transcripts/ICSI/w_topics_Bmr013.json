        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Um, but, in order to do that we need to extract out the actual digits.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Um, so that the reason it's not just a transcript is that there're false starts, and misreads, and miscues and things like that.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'And so I have a set of scripts andX Waves where you just select the portion, hitR,'",
        "'speaker_F': 'um, it tells you what the next one should be, and you just look for that.'",

        "'speaker_F': 'firing up an editor,'",
        "'speaker_F': 'or, again, I can do.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Or someone else can do.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'But that's really your choice, it's your'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So are these two separate tasks that can happen?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Or do they have to happen at the same time before'",
        "'speaker_F': 'No they don't have this'",
        "'speaker_F': 'you have to enter the data before, you do the second task, but they don't have to happen at the same time.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So it's it's just I have a file whi which has this information on it, and then when you start using my scripts, for extracting the times, it adds the times at the bottom of the file.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'And so, um, I mean, it's easy to create the files and leave them blank, and so actually we could do it in either order.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Oh, OK.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Um, it's it's sort of nice to have the same person do it just as a double check, to make sure you're entering for the right person.'",

        "'speaker_F': 'either way.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'nicest part of the data, that is, where you've got training and test set that are basically the same kinds of noise and so forth,'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Uh but it wasn't artificially added to get some some artificial signal noise ratio.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'It was just people driving around in a car.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So, that's that's an indication, uh that was with, many sites competing, and this was the very best score and so forth, so.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'More typical numbers like'",

        "'speaker_C': 'You're right.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I think that we could have done better on the models, but the thing is that we got this this is the kind of typical number,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'for all of the, uh, uh, things in this task, all of the, um, languages.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And so I I think we'd probably the models would be better in some than in others.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Hmm.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Um,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'so, uh.'",

        "'speaker_F': 'strange.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So I'm I'm not sure how much of effect that will have.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'What do you mean, the prosodics?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'H how do'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Um, just what we were talking about with grouping.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'That with these, the grouping, there's no grouping at all, and so it's just the only sort of'",

        "'speaker_F': 'I don't know what they do in Aurora.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Uh, I'm not sure how no, no I mean it's connected it's connected, uh, digits, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Cuz it's'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Connected.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'So there's also the not just the prosody but the cross the cross word modeling is probably quite different.'",

        "'speaker_F': 'But'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Right.'",

        "'speaker_F': 'One and a half percent, two percent, something like that?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Uh, I th no I think we got under a percent, but it was but it's but I mean.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Oh really?'",
        "'speaker_F': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_B': 's.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'The very best system that I saw in the literature was a point two five percent or something that somebody had at at Bell Labs, or.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Alright.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Uh, but.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Hmm.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'But, uh, sort of pulling out all the stops.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'But I think a lot of systems sort of get half a percent, or three quarters a percent, and we're we're in there somewhere.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'But that I mean it's really it's it's close talking mikes, no noise, clean signal, just digits, I mean, every everything is good.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'It's the beginning of time in speech recognition.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yes, exactly.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Well you might be right that mi might be the way at getting at, what I was talking about, but the particular reason why I was interested in doing that was because I remember, when that happened, and, John Ohala was over here and he was looking at the spectrograms of the more difficult ones.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Uh, he didn't know what to say,'",

        "'speaker_C': 'you might have someone who just has a wor has words with states, and has uh uh, comes from articulatory gestures to that.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And someone else, might actually want some phonetic uh intermediate thing.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So I think it would be be best to have all of it if we could.'",

        "'speaker_F': 'But'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'What I'm imagining is a score like notation, where each line is a particular feature.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I mean this is the kind of reason why I remember when at one of the Switchboard, workshops, that uh when we talked about doing the transcription project,'",

        "'speaker_F': 'Right.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'And.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'On the harder ones?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'It, yeah I mean it was'",
        "'speaker_G': 'It depends how you look at it, and I I understand what you're saying about this,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'kind of transcription exactly, because I've seen you know, where does the voicing bar start and so forth.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'All I'm saying is that, it is useful to have that the transcription of what was really said, and which syllables were reduced.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Uh, if you're gonna add the features it's also useful to have some level of representation which is,'",
        "'speaker_G': 'is a reduced it's a pronunciation variant, that currently the dictionaries don't give you because if you add them to the dictionary and you run recognition, you, you add confusion.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'So people purposely don't add them.'",

        "'speaker_G': 'So it's useful to know which variant was was produced, at least at the phone level.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So it would be it would be great if we had, either these kind of,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'labelings on,'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah, no I I don't disagree with that.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'And Steve's type is fairly it's not that slow, uh,'",
        "'speaker_G': 'uh, I dunno exactly what the,'",
        "'speaker_G': 'timing was, but.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah u I don't disagree with it the on the only thing is that, What you actually will end en end up with is something, i it's all compromised, right, so, the string that you end up with isn't, actually, what happened.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'But it's it's the best compromise that a group of people scratching their heads could come up with to describe what happened.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And it's more accurate than, phone labels.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'But.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And it's more accurate than the than the dictionary or, if you've got a pronunciation uh lexicon that has three or four, this might be have been the fifth one that you tr that you pruned or whatever, so sure.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'The word.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So it's like a continuum.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'It's you're going all the way down, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'That's what I meant is an and in some places it would fill in, So the kinds of gestural features are not everywhere.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Well'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'So there are some things that you don't have access to either from your ear or the spectrogram, but you know what phone it was and that's about all you can'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'all you can say.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'And then there are other cases where,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'It's basically just having, multiple levels of of, information and marking, on the signal.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'nasality, voicing'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Well the other difference is that the the features, are not synchronous, right.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'They overlap each other in weird ways.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So it's not a strictly one dimensional signal.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So I think that's sorta qualitatively different.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'You can add the features in,'",
        "'speaker_G': 'uh, but it'll be underspecified.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Hmm.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Th there'll be no way for you to actually mark what was said completely by features.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Well not with our current system but you could imagine designing a system,'",
        "'speaker_G': 'And i if you're'",
        "'speaker_F': 'that the states were features, rather than phones.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Well, we we've probably have a separate, um, discussion of, uh of whether you can do that.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'That's'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Well, isn't that I thought that was,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'well but that wasn't that kinda the direction?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I thought'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah, so I mean, what, what where this is, I mean, I I want would like to have something that's useful to people other than those who are doing the specific kind of research I have in mind, so it should be something broader.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'But,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'The but uh where I'm coming from is, uh,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'we're coming off of stuff that Larry Saul did with with, um,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'uh, John Dalan and Muzim Rahim in which, uh, they,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'uh, have, um,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'a m a multi band system that is, uh, trained through a combination of gradient learning an and EM,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'to um,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'estimate, uh,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'the,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'uh, value for m for for a particular feature.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And this is part of a larger, image that John Dalan has about how the human brain does it in which he's sort of imagining that, individual frequency channels are coming up with their own estimate,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'of of these, these kinds of something like this.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Might not be, you know, exact features that, Jakobson thought of or something.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'But I mean you know some, something like that.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Some kind of low level features, which are not, fully, you know, phone classification.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And the the th this particular image, of how thi how it's done, is that, then given all of these estimates at that level, there's a level above it, then which is is making, some kind of sound unit classification such as, you know, phone and and, you know.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'You could argue what, what a sound unit should be, and and so forth.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'But that that's sort of what I was imagining doing,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'um, and but it's still open within that whether you would have an intermediate level in which it was actually phones, or not.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'You wouldn't necessarily have to.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Um, but, Again, I wouldn't wanna,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'wouldn't want what we we produced to be so, know, local in perspective that it it was matched, what we were thinking of doing one week, And and, and, you know, what you're saying is absolutely right.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'That, that if we,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'can we should put in, uh, another level of, of description there if we're gonna get into some of this low level stuff.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Well, you know, um I mean if we're talking about, having the,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'annotators annotate these kinds of features, it seems like,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'You know, you The the question is, do they do that on, meeting data?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Or do they do that on, Switchboard?'",
        "'speaker_F': 'That's what I was saying, maybe meeting data isn't the right corpus.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'W'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Well it seems like you could do both.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I mean, I was thinking that it would be interesting, to do it with respect to, parts of Switchboard anyway, in terms of, uh partly to see, if you could, generate first guesses at what the articulatory feature would be, based on the phone representation at that lower level.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'It might be a time gain.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'But also in terms of comparability of, um,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Well cuz the yeah, and then also, if you did it on Switchboard, you would have, the full continuum of transcriptions.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'what you gain'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yep.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'You'd have it, from the lowest level, the ac acoustic features, then you'd have the,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'you know, the phonetic level that Steve did, and, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Yeah that that's all I was thinking about.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'it is telephone band, so, the bandwidth might be'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And you could tell that'",
        "'speaker_D': 'It'd be a complete,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And you get the relative gain'",
        "'speaker_D': 'set then.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'It's so it's a little different.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'up ahead.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So I mean i see wha how much we can, uh, get the people to do, and how much money we'll have and all this sort of thing, but, Might be do both.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'But it it might be good to do what Jane was saying uh, you know, seed it, with, guesses about what we think the features are, based on,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'you know, the phone or Steve's transcriptions or something.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'to make it quicker.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Alright, so based on the phone transcripts they would all be synchronous, but then you could imagine, nudging them here and there.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Adjusting?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah, exactly.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Scoot the voicing over a little, because'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Well I think what I mean I'm I'm a l little behind in what they're doing,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'now, and, uh, the stuff they're doing on Switchboard now.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'But I think that, Steve and the gang are doing,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'something with an automatic system first and then doing some adjustment.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'As I re as I recall.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So I mean that's probably the right way to go anyway, is to is to start off with an automatic system with a pretty rich pronunciation dictionary that,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'that, um, you know,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'tries, to label it all.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And then, people go through and fix it.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So in in our case you'd think about us s starting with maybe the regular dictionary entry, and then?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Well, regular dictionary, I mean, this is a pretty rich dictionary.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Or would we'",
        "'speaker_C': 'It's got, got a fair number of pronunciations in it'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Or you could start from the if we were gonna,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'But'",
        "'speaker_D': 'do the same set, of sentences that Steve had,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'done, we could start with those transcriptions.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'That's actually what I was thinking, is tha the problem is when you run,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So I was thinking'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'uh, if you run a regular dictionary, um, even if you have variants, in there, which most people don't, you don't always get, out, the actual pronunciations, so that's why the human transcriber's giving you the'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'that pronunciation, and so y'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Actually maybe they're using phone recognizers.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Oh.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'they they I thought that they were we should catch up on what Steve is, uh I think that would be a good i good idea.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Is that what they're doing?'",
        "'speaker_F': 'They are.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Oh, OK.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah, so I think that i i we also don't have, I mean, we've got a good start on it, but we don't have a really good,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'meeting,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'recorder or recognizer or transcriber or anything yet, so.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So, I mean another way to look at this is to, is to, uh, do some stuff on Switchboard which has all this other, stuff to it.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And then, um,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'As we get, further down the road and we can do more things ahead of time, we can, do some of the same things to the meeting data.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And I'm and these people might they they are, s'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah'",
        "'speaker_B': 'most of them are trained with IPA.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'They'd be able to do phonetic level coding, or articulatory.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Are they busy for the next couple years, or?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Well, you know, I mean they,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'they they're interested in continuing working with us, so I mean I, and this would be up their alley, so, we could when the when you d'",
        "'speaker_B': 'meet with, with John Ohala and find, you know what'",
        "'speaker_B': 'taxonomy you want to apply, then, they'd be,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'good to train onto it.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Anyway, this is,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'not an urgent thing at all, just it came up.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'It'd be very interesting though, to have that data.'",

        "'speaker_G': 'Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'And this afternoon.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'and this afternoon, it drifted into the afternoon,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'uh, concerning this issue of, um, the, well there's basically the issue of the interplay between the transcript format and the processing that, they need to do for, the SRI recognizer.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And, um,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'well, so, I mentioned the process that I'm going through with the data, so, you know, I get the data back from the transcri Well, s'",
        "'speaker_B': 'uh, metaphorically, get the data back from the transcriber, and then I, check for simple things like spelling errors and things like that.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And, um, I'm going to be doing a more thorough editing, with respect to consistency of the conventions.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'But they're they're generally very good.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And, then, I run it through, uh, the channelize program to get it into the multi channel format,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And the, what we discussed this morning, I would summarize as saying that,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'um,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'these units that result, in a a particular channel and a particular timeband, at at that level,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'um, vary in length.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And, um, their recognizer would prefer that the units not be overly long.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'But it's really an empirical question, whether the units we get at this point through, just that process I described might be sufficient for them.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So, as a first pass through, a first chance without having to do a lot of hand editing, what we're gonna do, is, I'll run it through channelize, give them those data after I've done the editing process and be sure it's clean.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And I can do that, pretty quickly,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'with just, that minimal editing, without having to hand break things.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And then we'll see if the units that we're getting,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'uh, with the at that level, are sufficient.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And maybe they don't need to be further broken down.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And if they do need to be further broken down then maybe it just be piece wise, maybe it won't be the whole thing.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So, that's that's what we were discussing,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'this morning as far as I Among also we discussed some adaptational things, so it's like, uh'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Then lots of'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'You know I hadn't, uh, incorporated, a convention explicitly to handle acronyms, for example, but if someone says, PZM it would be nice to have that be directly interpretable from, the transcript what they said, or Pi uh Tcl TCL I mean.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'It's like y it's and so,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'um,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I've I've incorporated also convention, with that but that's easy to handle at the post editing phase, and I'll mention it to, transcribers for the next phase but that's OK.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And then,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'a similar conv uh, convention for numbers.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So if they say one three versus one eight three.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Um, and also I'll be, um,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'encoding, as I do my post editing, the, things that are in curly brackets, which are clarificational material.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And eh to incorporate, uh, keyword, at the beginning.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So, it's gonna be either a gloss or it's gonna be a vocal sound like a, laugh or a cough, or, so forth.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Or a non vocal sound like a doors door slam, and that can be easily done with a,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'you know, just a one little additional thing in the,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'in the general format.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Yeah we j we just needed a way to,'",
        "'speaker_G': 'strip, you know, all the comments, all the things th the that linguist wants but the recognizer can't do anything with.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Um, but to keep things that we mapped to like reject models, or, you know, uh, mouth noise, or,'",
        "'speaker_G': 'cough.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'And then there's this interesting issue Jane brought up which I hadn't thought about before but I was, realizing as I went through the transcripts, that there are some noises like,'",
        "'speaker_G': 'um, well the good example was an inbreath, where a transcriber working from, the mixed, signal, doesn't know whose breath it is, and they've been assigning it to someone that may or may not be correct.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'And what we do is, if it's a breath sound, you know, a sound from the speaker, we map it,'",
        "'speaker_G': 'to, a noise model, like a mouth noise model in the recognizer, and, yeah, it probably doesn't hurt that much once in a while to have these, but,'",
        "'speaker_G': 'if they're in the wrong channel, that's, not a good idea.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'And then there's also,'",
        "'speaker_G': 'things like door slams that's really in no one's channel, they're like it's in the room.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'And uh, Jane had this nice, uh, idea of having, like an extra,'",
        "'speaker_F': 'An extra channel.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'uh couple tiers, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I've been I've been adding that to the ones I've been editing.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'And we were thinking, that is useful also when there's uncertainties.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'So if they hear a breath and they don't know who breath it is it's better to put it in that channel than to put it in the speaker's channel because maybe it was someone else's breath, or'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Uh, so I think that's a good you can always clean that up, post processing.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'So a lot of little details, but I think we're,'",
        "'speaker_G': 'coming to some kinda closure,'",
        "'speaker_G': 'on that.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'So the idea is then, uh, Don can take, uh, Jane's post processed channelized version,'",
        "'speaker_G': 'and, with some scripts, you know, convert that to to a reference for the recognizer and we can,'",
        "'speaker_G': 'can run these.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'So when that's, ready you know, as soon as that's ready, and as soon as the recognizer is here we can get,'",
        "'speaker_G': 'twelve hours of force aligned and recognized data.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'And, you know, start, working on it, so we're, I dunno a coup a week or two away I would say from,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And'",
        "'speaker_G': 'uh, if if that process is automatic once we get your post process,'",
        "'speaker_G': 'transcript.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And that doesn't the amount of editing that it would require is not very much either.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I'm just hoping that the units that are provided in that way, will be sufficient cuz I would save a lot of, uh,'",
