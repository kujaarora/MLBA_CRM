        "'speaker_F': 'So then the then let's let's think about the practicalities of how we get to that master copy with reference to breaths.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So'",
        "'speaker_F': 'what I would r r what I would wonder is would it be possible to encode those automatically?'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Could we get a breath detector?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Oh, just to save the transcribers'",
        "'speaker_B': 'time.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Well, I mean, you just have no idea.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'I mean, if you're getting a breath several times every minute,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'and just simply the keystrokes it takes to negotiate, to put the boundaries in, to to type it in, i it's just a huge amount of time.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Oops.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Wh what'",
        "'speaker_F': 'And you wanna be sure it's used, and you wanna be sure it's done as efficiently as possible, and if it can be done automatically, that would be ideal.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'what if you put it in but didn't put the boundaries?'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Well, but'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So you just know it's between these other things, right?'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Well, OK.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So now there's there's another another possibility which is, um, the time boundaries could mark off words'",
        "'speaker_F': 'from nonwords.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'And that would be extremely time effective, if that's sufficient.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah I mean I'm think if it's too if it's too hard for us to annotate the breaths per se, we are gonna be building up models for these things and these things are somewhat self aligning, so if so, we i i if we say there is some kind of a thing which we call a breath\" or a breath in\" or breath out\", the models will learn that sort of thing.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Uh, so but you but you do want them to point them at some region where where the breaths really are.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So'",
        "'speaker_F': 'But that would maybe include a pause as well, and that wouldn't be a problem to have it, uh, pause plus breath plus laugh plus'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Well, there's a there's'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah, i'",
        "'speaker_A': 'You know there is there's this dynamic tension between between marking absolutely everything, as you know, and and and marking just a little bit and counting on the statistical methods.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'sneeze?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Basically the more we can mark the better.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'But if there seems to be a lot of effort for a small amount of reward in some area, and this might be one like this Although I I I'd be interested to h get get input from Liz and Andreas on this to see if they Cuz they've they've got lots of experience with the breaths in in, uh,'",
        "'speaker_G': 'I'",
        "'speaker_B': 'They have lots of experience with breathing?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'uh, their transcripts.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Actually'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Well,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'yes they do, but we we can handle that without them here.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'But but but, uh, you were gonna say something about'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Yeah, I I think, um, one possible way that we could handle it is that,'",
        "'speaker_G': 'um,'",
        "'speaker_G': 'you know, as the transcribers are going through, and if they get a hunk of'",
        "'speaker_G': 'speech that they're gonna transcribe,'",
        "'speaker_G': 'u th they're gonna transcribe it because there's words in there or whatnot.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'If there's a breath in there,'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'they could transcribe that.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'That's what they've been doing.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So, within an overlap segment, they they do this.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'But'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'But if there's a big hunk of speech, let's say on Morgan's mike where he's not talking at all,'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'um, don't don't worry about that.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'So what we're saying is, there's no guarantee that, um'",
        "'speaker_G': 'So for the chunks that are transcribed, everything's transcribed.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'But outside of those boundaries, there could have been stuff that wasn't transcribed.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'So you just somebody can't rely on that data and say that's perfectly clean data\".'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Uh do you see what I'm saying?'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah, you're saying it's'",
        "'speaker_G': 'So I would say don't tell them to transcribe anything that's outside of'",
        "'speaker_F': 'uncharted territory.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'That sounds like a reasonable'",
        "'speaker_G': 'a grouping of words.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'reasonable compromise.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah, and that's that that quite co corresponds to the way I I try to train the speech nonspeech detector, as I really try to'",
        "'speaker_E': 'not to detect those breaths which are not within a speech chunk but with which are just in in a silence region.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And they so they hopefully won't be marked in in those channel specific files.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Yeah, so'",
        "'speaker_E': 'But'",
        "'speaker_A': 'u I I wanted to comment a little more just for clarification about this business about the different purposes.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'See, in a in a way this is a really key point, that for speech recognition, uh, research,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'uh, um,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'e a it's not just a minor part.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'In fact, the I think I would say the core thing that we're trying to do'",
        "'speaker_A': 'is to recognize'",
        "'speaker_A': 'the actual, meaningful components'",
        "'speaker_A': 'in the midst of other things that are not meaningful.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So it's critical it's not just incidental it's critical for us to get these other components that are not meaningful.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Because that's what we're trying to pull the other out of.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'That's our problem.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'If we had nothing if we had only linguistically relevant things if if we only had changes in the spectrum that were associated with words, with different spectral components,'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'and, uh, we we didn't have noise, we didn't have convolutional errors, we didn't have extraneous, uh, behaviors, and so forth, and moving your head and all these sorts of things,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'then, actually speech recognition i i isn't that bad right now.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I mean you can you know it's'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'it's the technology's come along pretty well.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'The the the reason we still complain about it is because is when when you have more realistic conditions then then things fall apart.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'OK, fair enough.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'I guess, um, I uh, what I was wondering is what what at what level does the breathing aspect enter into the problem?'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Because if it were likely that a PDA would be able to be built which would get rid of the breathing, so it wouldn't even have to be processed at thi at this computational le well, let me see, it'd have to be computationally processed to get rid of it, but if there were, uh, like likely on the frontier, a good breath extractor'",
        "'speaker_F': 'then, um, and then you'd have to'",
        "'speaker_A': 'But that's a research question, you know?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'And so'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah, well, see and that's what I wouldn't know.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'that And we don't either.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I mean so so the thing is it's it right now it's just raw d it's just data that we're collecting, and so we don't wanna presuppose that people will be able to get rid of particular degradations because that's actually the research that we're trying to feed.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So, you know, an and maybe maybe in five years it'll work really well, and and it'll only mess up ten percent of the time, but then we would still want to account for that ten percent, so.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'I guess there's another aspect which is that as we've improved our microphone technique, we have a lot less breath in the in the more recent, uh, recordings, so it's in a way it's an artifact that there's so much on the on the earlier ones.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Uh huh.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I see.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'One of the um, just to add to this one of the ways that we will be able to get rid of breath is by having'",
        "'speaker_G': 'models for them.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'I mean, that's what a lot of people do nowadays.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'And so in order to build the model you need to have some amount of it marked,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'so that you know where the boundaries are.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Hmm.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'So I mean, I don't think we need to worry'",
        "'speaker_G': 'a lot about breaths that are happening outside of a,'",
        "'speaker_G': 'you know, conversation.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'We don't have to go and search for them to to mark them at all, but, I mean, if they're there while they're transcribing some hunk of words, I'd say'",
        "'speaker_G': 'put them in if possible.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'OK, and it's also the fact that they differ a lot from one channel to the other because of the way the microphone's adjusted.'",
