        "'speaker_F': 'Mm hmm.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'But but we would we should do the the latest version.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'You did you adjust the the utterance times, um, for each channel?'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yes, I did.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And furthermore, I found that there were a certain number where not not a lot, but several times I actually moved an utterance from Adam's channel to Dan's or from Dan's to Adam's.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So there was some speaker identif And the reason was because I transcribed that at a point before'",
        "'speaker_C': 'uh, before we had the multiple audio available f so I couldn't switch between the audio.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I I transcribed it off of the mixed channel entirely, which meant in overlaps, I was at a at a terrific disadvantage.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'In addition it was before the channelized, uh, possibility was there.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And finally I did it using the speakers of my, um of you know, off the CPU on my on my machine cuz I didn't have a headphone.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So it, like, I mean Yeah, I I mean, i in retrospect it would've been good to ha have got I should've gotten a headphone.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Fixed that.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Is that what you're referring to?'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Uh oh.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Right?'",
        "'speaker_G': 'And, like, there's an interruption.'",

        "'speaker_G': 'Is that what you're talking about?'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Or were there mislabellings as far as, like, the a Adam was?'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So, with under um, uh, listening to the mixed channel, there were times when, as surprising as that is, I got Adam's voice confused with Dan's and vice versa not for long utterances, but jus just a couple of places,'",

        "'speaker_G': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'But the other thing that I I hadn't thought about this, but I thou I wanted to raise this when you were uh, with respect to also a strategy which might help with the alignments potentially, but that's'",

        "'speaker_C': 'S so, like, someone says an and have you done the so so?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And then there would be backchannels, but it would be the person who asked the question.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Other people weren't really doing much backchannelling.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And, you know, sometimes you have the Yeah, uh huh.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Well, that's interesting.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I mean, i it wouldn't be perfect, but but it does seem more natural to give a backchannel when when you're somehow involved in the topic, and the most natural way is for you to have initiated the topic by asking a question.'",

        "'speaker_A': 'um, you know, comma and things like that, and we kept the and disfluency dashes'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Mm hmm.'",

        "'speaker_A': 'spurt overlaps sp overlaps, or'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Right.'",

        "'speaker_F': 'Actually, no, you do that before you merge the various channels.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So you you id identify by some criterion, which is pause length you identify the beginnings and ends of these spurts, and you put another set of tags in there to keep those straight.'",
