        "'speaker_F': 'Hmm.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'But it's not easy to do, because the whole thing gets offset, and basically, it's assigning the wrong speaker to the text, and it all gets unaligned.'",

        "'speaker_F': 'Hmm.'",

        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_F': 'Well, and then the other possibility was e that we provide them with a a file that already has the beeps in it or something.'",

        "'speaker_A': 'Well I I don't remember.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'They were three off, basically.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'And this is the mixed signal?'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Oh!'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So so if you get one uh, uh, excuse me.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'If you get one off, it t everything is off cuz of the alignment right?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yep.'",

        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yep.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So why don't you make it multiple files?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'How would that help?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Because then if they have one off, then then it would only screw up that file.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Oh, you mean just break the one hour into'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'a few chunks.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I mean, it seems now, if you just ha make one mistake then everything is off.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Well the only the only question about that that I have is, um, I think Brian has to put all this stuff onto a tape.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So I don't know whether'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I'm sure they would prefer it sort of one hour.'",

        "'speaker_E': 'tapes'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah, just say, OK, is\"'",
        "'speaker_B': 'ten minutes is\" I mean, maybe there's other things to do that are more clever, but this just seemed to be the sort of the obvious thing because, again, if you make one mistake, then everything after that mistake is off.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And, uh'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Well, the only other issue is we'd have to worry about reassembling them in the proper order.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Uh'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'That I mean, just naming schemes will get'",
        "'speaker_A': 'We can definitely do that.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So t so one question is, are there good places in the files where we can really do that?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Well, the other thing You can'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I mean, so so so someone will have to go through them and listen to them and pick a place to break them.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'The other thing you can do This is on the mixed signal, or are these the individual'",
        "'speaker_C': 'the ones with the beeps that they're getting, that they made mistakes on is'",
        "'speaker_A': 'They are played from the'",

        "'speaker_E': 'Individual channels.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Individual channels.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'individual.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Or they're indivi If it's individual, um'",
        "'speaker_C': 'y c we can'",
        "'speaker_C': 'probably run a forced alignment,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'where you c include the beeps as words'",
        "'speaker_C': 'and pretty much figure out where the errors are.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I don't think we could do it on the mixed signal, cuz it'",
        "'speaker_C': 'But on the individual channels that would probably work, if they have enough'",
        "'speaker_C': 'words in the transcript.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah, we In fact, that's Yeah, maybe we'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So, I mean, that's pretty quick to run.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'It it's, um'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I mean, we could try it.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Cuz if a beep is treated as a'",
        "'speaker_A': 'You mean, so, actually put put the wavefile in with beep in it.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'unique word,'",
        "'speaker_C': '\" beep\"'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Put in put beep\" in as a word.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'And pu and have a beep model.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'We have the original wavefile with all the beeps.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Well the beep model Actually, you could train a beep model.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'That that's a good idea.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'It would be very good.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Um'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yes, it would be, cuz it's very, very regular.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So, um'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Oh.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Kind of low variance, wouldn't that be?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'You sort'",
        "'speaker_B': 'of might end up with'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Um, that might actually'",
        "'speaker_B': 'some infinities there, but Can I see that?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'You have to may add some jitter to it.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I mean, that might actually work, because you'll'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Where's the case?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I guess the trick is figuring out, you know, where it doesn't align?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'But if it's a problem of extra beeps,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'rather than missing beeps, then'",
        "'speaker_C': 'um'",
        "'speaker_C': 'that's easier'",
        "'speaker_E': 'It could t it could There could be some missing ones.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'and it might work.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Oh.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'But'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So is this a seven or something?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'It's just in this case they were not.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Or What is it?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So I think uh, Chuck had a good explanation for it which I liked, which is these they're listening to it and so they write something down, and let's say they miss it, they rewind.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'M hundred.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Well, they hear the beep again.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Was that that beep, or was that a different beep?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Oh, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So that's why Chuck was suggesting different tones.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'My original thought was, you could have a different tone for each speaker.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'You know, there's plenty of tone space.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'And that might help cue'",
        "'speaker_A': 'the transcriptionist.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'You know, give them a little cue about where they are.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Or you could you could have ascending tones, or something.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'What do you mean?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Uh'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Or'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Increasingly high higher frequencies.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'You could have, um, each speaker in the meeting say beep\" and record it and that will be their pro'",
        "'speaker_B': 'No, I just thi I don't know.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'If you have a hundred or something just just sort of move them up i mu up a a half tone or something for for each one, and then'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'That's what I was saying.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Is that that you could have each speaker could have their own tone.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Oh was it?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Oh.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'See, I should listen.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Hmm.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'And you know, since there are no more than, you know, ten speakers or so per meeting,'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Oh.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Well'",
        "'speaker_A': 'there's plenty of tone space.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Uh, OK, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So the only'",
        "'speaker_B': 'That might work too.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah, I was just thinking that actually temporally just, uh, uh, uh, an increasing tones so that they would really have a sense of whether they were going, you know, forward or backward or Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'thing, you'd have to have the'",
        "'speaker_B': 'the tonal differences between the two kind of small, and actually you want them large.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yep.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_A': 'If they'",

        "'speaker_B': 'What are they doing?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Well, as I said, I think We don't actually know, but I think Chuck's hypothesis was a good one, which is, you re r you listen to something, you write down what you thought you heard, but you want to listen to it again, so you r rewind.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'What, uh'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And there are some'",
        "'speaker_A': 'And then you hear the beep again, and then you say well, is that that beep,'",

        "'speaker_A': 'I don't remember.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'And so, you know, a couple times they got it wrong.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And there are some cases where there's, um, very little speech before you hear a beep.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So you hear a little bit of speech, beep, a little bit of speech, beep.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Maybe three of those in a row, and was that three beeps, was that two beeps?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Um See, they have th Brian said the setup that they have is, um'",
        "'speaker_E': 'uh i um'",
        "'speaker_E': 'They've got headphones and then I guess they have a computer, and they have a foot pedal which lets them quickly scan back and forth through the tape.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'I i t i s makes the tape go real fast forward or fast backward.'",

        "'speaker_E': 'I think they're probably going over and over f sections.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And then they get confused about whether'",

        "'speaker_F': 'It's a shame we can't really give a number.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'OK, s'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So it would be a number and a beep.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'e'",
        "'speaker_F': 'It's a shame we can't do that.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Well, we could.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Oh, that's an interesting idea.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'We could, but then that starts getting'",
        "'speaker_A': 'pretty long.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'No, no, no.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'But wait, maybe'",
        "'speaker_E': 'maybe what we have instead of a beep is a, uh, synthesized number.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yep.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And they put the number in when they hear it.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'That'll work.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So, inst replacing the beep with twenty three\",'",
        "'speaker_E': '\" twenty four\",\" twenty five\" And then they have to transcribe what that number is each time.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Wow, that'd also be shorter to type.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah, just a two three, two four\", that would be'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Well, they would have to have a mark.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'There'd be some kind of mark in front of it.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Interesting.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Well, cuz they're s distinguishing between twenty three'",
        "'speaker_B': 'that's your indicator there, and twenty three that somebody happens to say in a meeting.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Oh, that's true.'",

        "'speaker_E': 'you know either obviously a s sounding synthesized, uh, little'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'But they might miss that, right?'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Or maybe could it be a click and the number.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Or a beep and the number.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Well, it's sequential.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Or a beep and the number, and then and then you just do the the num th you do it as a d a digit.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Right, you would go sequential.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So unless you got pretty unlucky,'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Uh, right.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'what the person was saying and the number'",
        "'speaker_E': 'In fact, we could put it at the beginning of each utterance.'",

        "'speaker_E': 'And then they'll hear the speech.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I think having a beep too is good.'",

        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah the It's just getting pretty long.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Or a number beep'",

        "'speaker_D': 'Yep.'",

        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'u I mean, it's not a bad'",
        "'speaker_C': 'idea to try the alignment.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'then'",
        "'speaker_C': 'if you align, the first point at which things get messed up is sort of the location of the first problem.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And then, the second p I mean, you could do it that way, or you could'",
        "'speaker_C': 'It's it's'",
        "'speaker_C': 'it would be'",
        "'speaker_C': 'able to handle any errors.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So if they make, on the average, that many,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'and it costs them more time to do something different than what they're doing, which I don't know, but if it does,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'then we could try doing that as a post process, and,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'um, have a student or a transcriber run this alignment, or we can do it and'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yep.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'You know actually, what all that we would'",
        "'speaker_C': 'then you can iteratively'",
        "'speaker_C': 'figure out where the problems are.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'You know, Liz, all we would re'",
        "'speaker_C': 'It would take a little work, but not any real human not a lot of human work.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I mean, that's what we want to avoid.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'I mean if in terms of the alignment, actually, all we would need is we wouldn't even need words.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'We would need a general speech model and a beep model.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Cuz all we're really concerned about is missing beeps or too many beeps.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Well, the for the forced alignment will run fa otherwise it'll take forever.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So if we had a'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I mean, to really run recognition?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Well l I guess what I'm thinking of is that w that a lot of times'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Or?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'there will be they'll put in question marks, that represent some unknown amount of speech, so we're gonna have to have some kind of'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah, then we just map it to a reject model.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'In and in fact, that's what we do now.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Cuz there's cases, even after Jane listens, where, you know, we have an expert can't even tell what they're talking about.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Right, h'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Um, so that's OK.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Just map that to reject and'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Well, what I was thinking is, map all the speech to the reject model.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And then you have a beep model.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'But that won't work because it's'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah, you're still talking a forced al'",
        "'speaker_C': 'The forced alignment might not work then, although we can try it.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Um'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Well, but, all we'll get'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Well, with the beep models, is what's really you'd have really g it would be really good though.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'The beep model is is gonna match, like, really well.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So'",
        "'speaker_B': 'so it's p so it's really just doing, yeah, a keyword, like a spotting for beep with'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'But it'll it'll grab the next beep, in other words.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'It'll be You'll get back another offset.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Um I mean, I was thinking of then I and then I realized Well, the recognizer will just go along and line up all the beeps, and then there'll be all the extra beeps at the end if there were more beeps then you'",
        "'speaker_C': 'wanted.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Right, you you need But you need the text'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So you need the word you need the word to c sort of control the relative location.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'to tell it where it got it wrong.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'No, I'm not sug I'm not suggesting that we don't have anything between the beeps.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'It will tell you'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Oh.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'But I what I'm saying is, what's between the beeps we don't really care about.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I think you do care about it.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Because you have to know which ones match which.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Unless you wanna know if they're Right.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Otherwise you just count up the total'",
        "'speaker_A': 'And we can do that with wordcount.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'number of beeps.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Right?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'We already know that that we're three short.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'And so if we just did'",
        "'speaker_A': 'spee uh beep and non beep all you would get is that you have three mistakes, but you wouldn't tell you which ones were wrong.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'You need some of the words in there, so that you can say well, this segment matches this one, this segment matches this one, and this one doesn't match at all,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'unless we insert a beep\".'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I mean the only thing I'm worried about with that approach is that if'",
        "'speaker_B': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'we need to'",
        "'speaker_C': 'figure out the beep'",
        "'speaker_C': 'alignment problem before the transcribers do the corrections here, then we're in trouble.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'In other words, if the transcripts aren't sort of'",
        "'speaker_C': 'good enough that the aligner'",
        "'speaker_C': 'constraints are good enough to sort of show you where the errors are, then it wouldn't work.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'But it might work.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'It might work to do this if their transcripts are pretty close'",
        "'speaker_C': 'on the words that usually get recognized correctly, which are the,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'you know, function words, the common words.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Well, actually, you know, there's an even easier way.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'We don't really need a beep model.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Um, just extract the segments and do a forced alignment,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Right, you can also'",
        "'speaker_A': 'and if the score is good, then you say it matches'",
        "'speaker_C': 'In fact that's what we do Right.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'The individual segments between the beeps'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Um, if beeps were like the segments that we get from'",
        "'speaker_C': 'um, the transcription tool already, that that's what we have done, and it works very well.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'You can see these'",
        "'speaker_C': 'segments align and these don't.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Um, then you just have to go back in and figure out where the endpoints of those segments are, cuz some of them will be wrong.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Because the bi the beeps were missing, by definition.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So do you get a score for each alignment?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So it might actually work.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Is that what you get?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Um, you ca you get, um'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Definitely when they don't align at all, it it it fails.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I mean, that that's how we found a lot of'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'problems before, with, um, words being on the wrong place or something.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So a failed alignment is a very good indicator that'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'that'",
        "'speaker_C': 'the words don't match up.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'I'm just wondering when wha what it means to fail.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Um'",

        "'speaker_B': 'And so, you know, we wanna be able to show off to somebody, you know, we have a base station somewhere, and you're wandering around,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'uh,'",

        "'speaker_A': 'Yep.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'I don't understand.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So so there's a mike that plugs in You're saying there's a mike that plugs in to the IRAM board?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'or'",
        "'speaker_B': 'No, no, what I'm saying is that we're gonna have to put together some kind of a little superstructure, d some sort of demo box that it that doesn't do a whole lot, but it somehow connects to'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Demo.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'uh, remotely to this IRAM board which will be doing the real computation.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Oh, I see.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'In other words, we're we're not gonna attempt to build, uh, it do the real work of building a portable device that's little, that is doing all the computation we wanna do for the recognition and the far field mike, uh, compensation and all that stuff.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So we're gonna do all that on this powerful board,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'and, uh, have some wireless connection to it.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And then the question is what is what does it look like, does it look like'",
        "'speaker_B': 'something that you you hold like this, or do we make a big deal out of it that you hold it arm at arm's length th so that you can see some display,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'or, uh,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'do we have one of these You know.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I don't know.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So, it th these are all possibilities.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yep.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I mean, what I was envisioning was a PDA with a cellular link in it.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'You know, with one of the r'",
        "'speaker_A': 'short range wireless.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'And let th Just do capture the audio on the PDA and send the audio over the'",
        "'speaker_A': 'wireless net.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So, is is Bluetooth the sort of thing that'd be, uh'",
        "'speaker_A': 'But.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Uh, Bluetooth is shorter range, but you could use Bluetooth.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Wh whatever the network guys already have hooked up for this floor.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I don't remember what it's called.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Hmm.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'OK, then uh, another issue on file reorganization is, uh, making data available to people outside ICSI.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So, specifically, theU W folks have been'",
        "'speaker_A': 'wanting to get access to it.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So I think the right thing to do for that, is figure out how to do CVS without'",
        "'speaker_A': 'uh, compromising security.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Some pass SSH tunneled'",
        "'speaker_A': 'CVS,'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Well, I I was'",
        "'speaker_A': 'and then give them access.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'I was reading through some of the CVS documentation and you can just substitute CVS for yourRS command.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yes, except that the command has to not take a password.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Hmm.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Because it it's non interactive.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'And so the only way to do that is with, uh'",
        "'speaker_A': 'S hosts, which is insecure.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Hmm.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So we still have to sort of look at it a little bit.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I mean, I'm sure it's been solved, and I just haven't found the solution yet.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'But I am sure that people have done it because it's gonna be a problem a lot of people have.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'But, um'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Who Well, we're s talking about a fairly limited group, are are is it a small enough group that they would could just have accounts?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Does that solve anything?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Uh, n n not really, because then we have the coordination issue.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I mean, so one thing they could do I mean, I guess that's true.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'They could simply log in to ICSI'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Well they're gonna have to have accounts'",
        "'speaker_A': 'and do everything locally.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'If they use SSH they have to have an account anyways.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah, except they could share one.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Well, but that's not'",
        "'speaker_A': 'The, uh'",
        "'speaker_A': 'the SSH accounts, and the'",
        "'speaker_A': 'user accounts don't have to be similar.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I mean, there are lots of ways of doing it, but w but if we can't figure out a remote way of doing it, just letting them log in to ICSI'",
        "'speaker_A': 'might be OK.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So the intention was to put everything except the audio files themselves under revision control.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'And the audio files, it's not worth doing cuz they're too big.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'You're never gonna be copying them around and making working copies of them.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'And then the other issue Jane and I spoke of briefly is just general permission issues.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'That right now, lots of people create the files and then we have group Meeting Recorder\".'",
        "'speaker_A': 'But that means anyone in the Meeting Recorder group can overwrite the files.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'And so that's a pretty coarse level of granularity.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So we might wanna think about doing a Meeting Recorder user'",
        "'speaker_A': 'owner for those files, and then doing group slightly differently.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'But'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I think what we have now'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Can you just do, like, SUX or something to modify'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I mean, if you just have one user that'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Another option is to m'",
        "'speaker_A': 'make a non'",
        "'speaker_A': 'make it owned by a not real user, and then root will be able to do it.'",

        "'speaker_F': 'I'",

        "'speaker_F': 'Would w would it be possi There are scripts that uh, run,'",
        "'speaker_F': 'and and when it's finished compressing, would it be possible for the script to change the permissions on the file to be more strict?'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Have them'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yes, but if you do that, then someone who isn't the owner can't'",
        "'speaker_A': 'unchange it.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'But after the meeting's done, would they want to?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah, as I said, it's just a question of,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'uh, do you wanna have to track down root if you have to make any change.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'But it doesn't have to be root.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Also it seems like once it's been stored that night, it's it's possible to recover from backups, so that the main risk is avoiding it being accidentally deleted during the day that it was recorded.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Well, and just You, then, also just have the general problem of permission on the other files,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'that, do you want people checking out a transcript file when they find an error, and correcting it, or do they wa do you want it to go through you?'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_E': 'Well, with CVS, though, you don't actually have to do it that way.'",

        "'speaker_A': 'Right.'",

        "'speaker_F': 'And then after that, then this would probably work.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So you would keep it in a separate file structure until you were ready to put it in the repository.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Good, good.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I mean'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Or just keep the lock on it.'",

        "'speaker_E': 'No, it does not the CVS doesn't work that way.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'There's no there's no lock when you check something out, not like RCS.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Oh, OK.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Oh.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'So why not use RCS at that point?'",

        "'speaker_A': 'No, because UW wants to have access to these files.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'That's the whole point.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'But not to modify them, right?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Just to read them.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Well, if they k en if they record a meeting, and they create a key\" file, and they find an error in their key\" file,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'they shouldn't have to tell us about that so that they can create correct an error in one of their files.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Well, the key\" file is ke key\" file's different.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So that's why I wanna do it'",

        "'speaker_F': '\" Key\" fi'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Different than what?'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Well, key\" file has the extra attributes that if you notice that there are lots of spikes on channel so so, useful as a repository for putting that there.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'And also if you notice that there was an extra speaker, and didn't get mentioned in the key\" file, but they were only there for a second, but it's t useful to mention that they were there.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So I th I think that the key\" file is usefu for notations related to the meeting,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Well'",
        "'speaker_A': 'B'",
        "'speaker_A': 'But, I mean, the meetings are gonna be the same way.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'but it's different from the transcript.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So UW records a meeting, we transcribe it.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'A few months later they listen to it and they say Ope!'",
        "'speaker_A': 'They got that acronym wrong.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Then they should send that through Well'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Why why sh'",
        "'speaker_C': 'It's sort of not really a question about permissions, but more of procedure.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Either those all go through Jane, or through someone, or they all don't.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'But it's sort of'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And if they all do, then there isn't a problem, right?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Cuz once they give us the data, it's'",
        "'speaker_C': 'ours, and if they wanna make changes I mean, ours to sort of'",
        "'speaker_C': 'transcribe and annotate.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'The the p the point here is that it would be nice t for there to be one repository.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_A': 'Or if we make it inconvenient for them to change their data.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So then if they do have acc OK, so what if they have What if they have accounts here, and they use RCS,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I I'm just looking at it the other way around.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So so let's say we k'",
        "'speaker_C': 'at that point, where you can l really lock a file.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I mean, I'm worried.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'If you can't lock a file, this this to me sounds very scary.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Hmm.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Um'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And if they have accounts here and they're modifying it If they're ac if they're so closely linked that they're actually modifying transcripts and key\" files,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'then they could do it'",
        "'speaker_C': 'by, you know, secure shelling into ICSI,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'under RCS, at that point.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Ye well, I don't see a real difference between RCS and any other system.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I mean, it's just mechanisms.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'The nice thing about CVS is that you can have multiple people modifying and if the changes don't overlap each other,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'they can just do it.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Hmm.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'That's interesting.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So the problem with RCS is that if two people want to modify a file at the same time they can't,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'because the granularity of locking is at the file level.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'What what does CVS do if they if they do overlap?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Uh, there're lots of different policies for dealing with it.'",

        "'speaker_E': 'But typically a person has to,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So'",

        "'speaker_E': 'uh, mediate'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Oh.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'you know, which changes actually get go through.'",

        "'speaker_F': 'Oh.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Oh, I'",

        "'speaker_A': 'At the repository level, there certainly is.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Uh huh.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'You can mark a file as as you can't check this out\".'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Oh.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So'",
        "'speaker_E': 'CVS is pretty good.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So then you could use CVS and, you know, just f have remote access, but then it's up to whoever is, sort of, responsible for that level of transcription to decide'",
        "'speaker_B': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yep.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'how and when to put these locks, or'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Well, it's it's just like source code, right?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So that, when you're developing it and it's really rough, you don't put it in the repository.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'You wait to the point when you're ready to release it, and then you put it in the repository and if other people wanna'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah, so the w In The Maybe the model It's a little bit different in CVS.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'When you check something out, you actually create your own directory with copies of everything in it, and that's what you work on.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Copy.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So, until you're ready to check it in, nobody sees anything you've done.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And then when you check it in, it puts, sort of, you know every change that you've done is goes into the central'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So if that's at an I guess it depends on Jane's Uh, you know, if that's if that model works for the transcripts,'",

        "'speaker_C': 'that's fine.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'you know, would have been better to wait until your version came out, then that's really up to you, not up to the software,'",
        "'speaker_F': 'I also think, um, that the type of change ch ch varies an I think it's a very good point.'",

        "'speaker_F': 'have input into that level of things, but I wouldn't want them to be changing'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I'm just Imagine that we reverse this and they were keeping the repository and we were d collecting meetings and sending them to them.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'If I found an error,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'and I sent them email and said here's this error\", and I didn't get a response for a couple weeks, I would stop sending them the my data and I would start collecting it here and we would end up with two corpora.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Well,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'And I don't want that to happen.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'yeah.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'I agree.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So we have to make it convenient for them to make changes that they wanna make.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Well'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Well, I see now, we're k back into the same situation as when we were, uh, talking about a allowing people to edit the transcripts before they become public.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So there's a question of how easy or how hard to modify, and how that impacts the amount of changing that's done.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'And I I think that it's, um,'",
        "'speaker_F': 'I I have received some suggestions for change, which I've made.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'And um, I think with an acronym, that's a clear case where it would be an easy change to incorporate.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'But it would worry me to have people, um,'",
        "'speaker_F': 'having free reign to change these things, because of the need to have consistent conventions.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'And people who are only just visiting the data might not have a sense of the larger system.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah, that's what I would be worried about too.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Well, I think yeah, I think there are probably ways that you can say that, you know, only certain users are allowed to change'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'things.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Uh, so we can probably restrict it to be'",
        "'speaker_E': 'You know, f casual users who are just browsing can just r get it read only, can't check in to the archive.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Mm hmm.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'I mean, I I think one thing that's probably everybody would agree on is that there will never be a point where'",
        "'speaker_E': 'you know, we can say that for sure there's no problems with any of the transcripts.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'I mean there's, uh f You know, something's going to get overlooked at some point, or somebody's gonna wanna make a change somehow.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So we need to'",
        "'speaker_E': 'have some mechanism for,'",
        "'speaker_E': 'um, handling changes in the future.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'I agr I agree but I have to also add one other thing which i before I forget it, which is Adam's point about when you were reviewing the IBM transcripts.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'u This was mentioned at the beginning of the meeting.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'You said that there were some places where it wasn't what y was written already, but you could see how they might have thought that's what it said.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So there it's not just a right and wrong thing.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Sometimes there tru there are absolutely stretches where there is no no k if you were at the meeting and you could ask the person, maybe, m you know, they could they could've told you, but five minutes later they might not have been able to tell you, even if they were listening to it.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Exactly.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Mm hmm.'",

        "'speaker_F': 'So, sometimes it isn't right and wrong, sometimes it's multiple interpretations, and'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Good point.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Now But of course, this does raise the possibility of allowing, um, an extra annotation for, you know, alternative interpretations of a stretch.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'But I just wanted to say it isn't simply right or wrong.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah, that's a good point.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Or overlooked or not overlooked.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Sometimes they're truly ambiguous, and'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'um, uh, um, nice to have a notation for that, but.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Gotta go.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I mean, I like that idea because even a casual user can always send email'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'to whoever's in charge, and say, you know, we'd like these changes\" and, you know, hopefully we'll give them a response.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Well'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I just I don't s'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And if they really do it a lot, and they say'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I don't see that this is e'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yep.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'we're a casual user but we want a chance to change the transcripts\" then we can'",
        "'speaker_C': 'face that if it happens, but'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Can you write unread\" on that?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah, thank you.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I don't really see the people at UW that I know of right now making huge amoun investing huge amounts of time in changing transcripts.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'But I could be wrong.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Probably not transcripts, but it would be nice to have one mechanism for all the files.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'And they're certainly gonna wanna change tools.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'And so you know, it's the same as source code.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'You you release source code at some point.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'And, either you have to do everything or you share responsibility.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah I mean a lot of the open source pro projects face this same problem.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'You know, p anybody can check out the code,'",
        "'speaker_E': 'but not everybody can check it in.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And there's some happy medium and we don't know what that is yet'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'until we get feedback from people, but'",
        "'speaker_C': 'what if it's OK to just handle it'",
        "'speaker_C': 'with'",
        "'speaker_C': 'sort of a person in charge of the philosophy behind the changes,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'and some people with permissions, maybe by request, to make changes, That we don't just give people permissions if they're not gonna make changes.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Because I've overwritten a a file by mistake, not wanting to have done that cuz I didn't think I had permission, when I did.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Um, and then just'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Mm hmm.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'to handle the transcript changes.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I'm just worried about letting everybody go in and make changes, cuz it's real easy when you're trying to, I don't know, run alignments and there's a word you wanna fix, to go in and do that and then mess up other things, if you don't know,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'you know, the overall philosophy behind the the conventions.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Then There is also the possibility Remember, in CVS, when we talk about making changes,'",
        "'speaker_F': 'And als it also Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'You can back everything out.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'there's sort of two types that can be made.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'To your local, or to the global.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And so people can make changes to their local and if they screw those up,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Exactly.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'that's, you know, in their that's only on them.'",

        "'speaker_E': 'So we can I think we can do this.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Or just, yeah, start by make it a really tight control and then as people really need the control you can'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'They can still check it out'",
        "'speaker_C': 'ascertain whether or not to'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah, cuz they can still check out full copies and make whatever changes they want to their local copies.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And it won't affect the the g the global, official, ones at all.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Right, but what I want to avoid is ending up with two corpora.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Definitely.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'And so if you make it too hard for them to check back in, they'll check it out once, they'll make all the changes, they'll never tell us about the changes, and we'll get two different corpora.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yep.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Right?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I think we're already gonna I mean there's already'",
        "'speaker_C': 'some chance that different annotations, different places, you know'",
        "'speaker_C': 'But you can'",
        "'speaker_C': 'control that by knowing you're making two corpora or knowing that you're adding'",
        "'speaker_C': 'um, annotations on one version and you don't have the latest corrections maybe at that point.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And then you finish the project and you realize that there were'",
        "'speaker_C': 'corrections made on your originals and then you have to merge them.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And the b'",

        "'speaker_C': 'knowing where the synch time boundaries are.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Cuz you can automatically pretty much merge things if you've only got twenty words or so in an utterance.'",
