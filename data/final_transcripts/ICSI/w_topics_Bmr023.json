        "'speaker_F': 'Right?'",
        "'speaker_F': 'I mean, y the'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Well, but if you add them all up you have, uh, almost five percent difference now.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'um,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'What's actually qu interesting is that with'",
        "'speaker_C': 'um, well, you m prob maybe another half percent if you do the VTL in training,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'and then interestingly, if you optimize you get more of a win out of rescoring the, um,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'uh, theN best lists,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'uh, and optimizing the weights,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'um, uh than Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Than you do with the standard?'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'But the part that's actually adjustment of the front end per se as opposed to doing putting VTLN in or something is it was a couple percent.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Right.'",

        "'speaker_F': 'One of them'",

        "'speaker_F': 'because it did it all at once, to uh, from bark scale to mel scale,'",

        "'speaker_F': 'which I really feel like saying in quotes, because'",
        "'speaker_F': 'they're essentially the same scale but the but but but any i individual particular implementation of those things puts things in a particular place.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So that's why I wanted to look I still haven't looked at it yet.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'I I wanna look at exactly where the filters were in the two, and it it's probably something like there's one fewer or one more filter in the sub'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'one kilohertz band and for whatever reason with this particular experiment it was better one way or the other.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Hmm.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Um, it could be there's something more fundamental but it you know, I I don't know it yet.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'And the other and the other that was like one and a half or something, and then there was point eight percent, which was what was the other thing?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Well, that was combined with the triangular.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Right?'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Those those two were together.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'We d weren't able to separate them out cuz it was just done in one thing.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'But then there was a point eight percent which was something else.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'The low frequency cut off.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Oh, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So that was that was, uh that one I can claim credit for, uh, i in terms of screwing it up in the first place.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So that someone e until someone else fixed it, which is that, um, I never put when I u We had some problems before with offsets.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'This inf this went back to, uh, I think Wall Street Journal.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So we we had, uh ea everybody else who was doing Wall Street Journal knew that there were big DC offsets in th in these data in those data and and and nobody happened to mention it to us, and we were getting these, like, really terrible results, like two, three times the error everybody else was getting.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Hmm.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Hmm.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Mm hmm.'",

        "'speaker_G': 'Huh.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'It's it's, you know, no big deal.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'It's you know, you could have ten, twenty, maybe thirty millivolts, whatever, and it's consistently in there.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'The thing is, most people's front ends have pre emphasis with it, with zero at zero frequency, so that it's irrelevant.'",

        "'speaker_F': 'we didn't actually have that.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'We had we had the equivalent of pre emphasis in a a, uh, Fletcher Munson style weighting that occurs in the middle ofPL, but it doesn't actually have a zero at zero frequency, like, eh, uh, typical simple fr pre emphasis does.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Hmm.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'We had something more fancy.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'It was later on it didn't have that.'",

        "'speaker_F': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah, I guess if he did it right, he did fix it and then and then it's taking care of sampling rate, which is great.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'What what is the parameter?'",
        "'speaker_F': 'He had a'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Is it, uh, just the f lower cut off that you want?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'It's called, uh,H HPF.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'H Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Does HPF on on his feat feature.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'I mean, frankly, we never did that with the RASTA filter either, so the RASTA filter is actually doing a different thing in the modulation spectral domain depending on what sampling rate you're doing, which is'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Mm hmm.'",

        "'speaker_F': 'primitive in many ways.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Y Right.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'And I think I agree with you that if we fixed lots of different things and they would all add up, we would probably have a a a competitive system.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'But I think not that much of it is due to the front end per se.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'I think maybe a couple percent of it is, as far as I can see from this.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Uh, unless you call well, if you call VTL the front en front end, that's, uh, a little more.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'One experiment we should'",

        "'speaker_F': 'But.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'we'll probably need to do though when'",
        "'speaker_D': 'um,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'at some point, is, since we're using that same the net that was trained on PLP'",
        "'speaker_D': 'without all these things in it, for the tandem system,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'we may wanna go back and retrain,'",

        "'speaker_F': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'do we expect?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'eh At this point I'm as I mean, you know e I'm wondering is it Can we expect, uh, a tandem system to do better than a properly trained you know, a Gaussian system trained directly on the features with, you know, the right ch choice of parameters?'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Well, that's what we're seeing in other areas.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Right?'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So, it's so, um,'",

        "'speaker_F': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Um.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Now the thing is, in some databases I wouldn't expect it to necessarily give you much and and part of what I view as the real power of it is that'",
        "'speaker_F': 'it gives you a transformational capability'",

        "'speaker_F': 'I wouldn't expect huge in huge improvements.'",

        "'speaker_F': 'OK.'",

        "'speaker_G': 'Well, right.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So wha w what an and you may not be in this case, come to think of it, because,'",
        "'speaker_G': 'It's indirect, so you don't know'",
        "'speaker_F': 'uh, you're just taking something that's trained up elsewhere.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So, what what you what you do in the full procedure'",
        "'speaker_F': 'is you, um,'",
        "'speaker_F': 'uh, have an embedded training.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So in fact you the the net is trained on, uh, uh, a, uh, Viterbi alignment'",
        "'speaker_F': 'of the training data that comes from your full system.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'And so that's where the feedback comes all around, so that it is actually discriminant.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'You can prove that it's it's a,'",
        "'speaker_F': 'uh'",
        "'speaker_F': 'If you believe in the Viterbi assumption'",
        "'speaker_F': 'that, uh, getting the best path, uh, is almost equivalent to getting the best, uh, total probability,'",
        "'speaker_F': 'um, then you actually do improve that'",
        "'speaker_F': 'by, uh by training up on local'",
        "'speaker_F': 'local, uh local frames.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'But, um, we aren't actually doing that here, because we did we did that for a hybrid system, and now we're plugging it into another system and so it isn't'",
        "'speaker_F': 'i i i it wouldn't quite apply here.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So another huge experiment we could do would be to take the tandem features,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Do y'",
        "'speaker_D': 'uh, do SRI'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'forced alignments using those features, and then re do the net with those.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Mmm, uh Exactly.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Exactly.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'So that you can optimize it for the word error.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'But'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Another thing is since you're not using the net for recognition per se but just for this transformation, it's probably bigger than it needs to be.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So that would save a lot of time.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And there's a mismatch in the phone sets.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Mmm.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So, you're using a l a long a larger phone set than what'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Actually all those things could could could could, uh could affect it as well.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'The other thing, uh, just to mention that Stephane this was an innovation of Stephane's, which was a pretty neat one,'",
        "'speaker_F': 'uh, and might particularly apply here, given all these things we're mentioning.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Um, Stephane's idea was that, um, discriminant,'",
        "'speaker_F': 'uh, approaches are great.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Even the local ones, given, you know, these potential outer loops which, you know, you can convince yourself turn into the global ones.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Um, however,'",
        "'speaker_F': 'there's times when it is not good.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Uh, when something about the test set is different enough from the training set that that, uh, the discrimination that you're learning is is is not a good one.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So, uh, his idea was to take as the input feature vector to the, uh, Gaussian mixture system,'",
        "'speaker_F': 'uh, a concatenation of the neural net outputs and the regular features.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Oh, we already talked about that.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'That Didn't you did you do that already or?'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'El Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'No, but we we when when we when I first started corresponding with Dan about how to go about this,'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Oh.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'That makes a lot of sense.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Huh.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I think that was one of the things that we definitely went there.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'I mean, I'm sure that Stephane wasn't the first to think of it, but actually Stephane did it and'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Uh huh.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And i does it help?'",

        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Oh, OK.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So that's that that's our current best best system in the, uh'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Oh.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'uh, in the Aurora thing.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'That makes sense.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And do you do a KLT transform on the con on the combined feature vector?'",
        "'speaker_G': 'As you should never do worse.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'I I, uh, missed what you said.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Do you d you do a KLT transform on the combined feature vector?'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Well, actually, I, uh you should check with him, because he tried several different combinations.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Because you end up with this huge feature vector, so that might be a problem, a unless you do some form of dimensionality reduction.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'I, uh, th what I don't remember is which came out best.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So he did one where he put o put e the whole thing into one KLT, and another one, since the the PLP things are already orthogonalized, he left them alone'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'and and just did a KLT on the on the on the net outputs and then concatenated that.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Mmm.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'And I don't remember which was better.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Did he did he try to?'",

        "'speaker_F': 'No.'",
