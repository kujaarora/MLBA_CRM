        "'speaker_F': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'that that's the intent of, uh, meaning here.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Well, the qu the question is just whether how active it has to be.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'I mean, because they they filled out a contact information and that's where I'm sending the information.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'And so far everyone has done email.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'There isn't anyone who did, uh,'",
        "'speaker_F': 'any other contact method.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'So it's unusual that that they, uh'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
