        "'speaker_B': 'What about the user who is switching from one let's say zero cost area'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Because they say OK I'm not willing to pay any back for this service, because I'm just watching uh you know the sports news.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So, if I switch If if, because of my motion, I'm switching, or I'm going out of the coverage of the of the uh wave uh wireless uh local area network, well, I I want the service to be uh stopped.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'of this adaptational layer'",
        "'speaker_B': 'on on the side of the proxies.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So the client or the server is not changed.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah b le let me let me ask you a question about eh UMTS or or third or possible fourth generation communic wireless communication systems.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Uh, from the point of view of the user,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'uh is there uh something more that'",
        "'speaker_B': 'nnn, that than more speed?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Is there any other advantage,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'from the point of view of the user or of of the terminals?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Users of of UMTS?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'You can request certain kind of QS.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'You can even request it in GPS but'",
        "'speaker_D': 'it's not end end quality of service.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Hmm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'It is only um what the gateways'",
        "'speaker_B': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'get.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And within the core network there are certain kind of tunnels set up'",
        "'speaker_D': 'in the core network itself of the access provider, not the internet backbone core.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And you use certain kind of tunnel mechanism to combine, in principle, the base station cluster control.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'But this is uh is controlled by a certain kind of node.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Hmm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And you have the gateway to the PDN, or the Public Data Network.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And between both there's a certain kind of tunnel set up.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'But in fact'",
        "'speaker_B': 'But in fact now, at the GSM level, what you have is that every voice channel you use'",
        "'speaker_B': 'provides a a p a pretty fine fixed'",
        "'speaker_B': 'uh data speed.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So, we can say that every voice channel has an i an incr uh implied um quality of service, which is nnn ninety six hundred bits per second.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Full duplex.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'You mean now for GSM, or?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Doesn't it?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah, what is what means quality of service.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'A certain degree.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Right?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Uh.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Sometimes we have some'",
        "'speaker_B': 'No, but um but not only because of of data speed, but also about delay, you know, because GSM networks were developed to y uh with a voice service in mind.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Ah, delay is also considered in these networks.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So, uh, in fact for every voice channel you have'",
        "'speaker_B': 'uh a pretty fine maximum uh delay and jitter, and a a a specified um data speed.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So'",
        "'speaker_B': 'you can scale up scale up this uh'",
        "'speaker_B': 'this um thing by using several channels.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So, in fact, you have,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'using just GSM technology, you have more or less the same building blocks as you can get'",
        "'speaker_B': 'uh with the UMTS.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I mean that one thing is that the technology is a little bit different, that uh the base station thing is different and maybe uh the the internal routing uh inside the network is different but from the point of view of the mobile things'",
        "'speaker_B': 'uh'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I'm not sure if if'",
        "'speaker_D': 'It's packaged data oriented.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'It's not really circuit switched.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'In UMTS you have always GPS as a'",
        "'speaker_D': 'a involvement in the core network.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'You have, in principle, the path which still is available for for the GSM network.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Also they use, in principle, the same'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'uh the same mechanism.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'But you also have a dat uh packet'",
        "'speaker_D': 'oriented communication that's on the GPS stuff.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And that's also related to UMTS.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah, but The You know, it is also being d uh developed, thisG uhP DPRS thing,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'that is'",
        "'speaker_B': 'GPRS thing.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'which is uh pack uh packet data over GSM.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I mean.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Uh, I don't see that'",
        "'speaker_B': 'a a lot of difference.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'We can expect a lot of differences'",
        "'speaker_B': 'f uh from the uh mobile terminal point of view.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Uh, when uh UMTS be deployed.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'What I'm trying to say is that is that well, uh maybe uh it is not a big problem that any of us uh be uh um were um a UMTS expert because uh I I don't see it I think that the UMTS thing is more a technology issue, than a research issue.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Maybe I'm wrong.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Just es um explaining my m'",
        "'speaker_D': 'No, I think there's a lot Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'I think there's a lot of research.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'But the question is is this uh a research wh in which direction we are going?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I mean to be done here, not not at the of course, you know,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And because For inf'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I'm I I agree with you that there are a lot o of things to be developed but But the point is that uh this is probably not here.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Because uh well, you know the the the orientation of our group which is uh Networks Services and Applications\", not uh wireless technology or the underlying wireless technology.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'You think more about hardware technology.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So, there is a lot of hardware to develop, but not'",
        "'speaker_B': 'You know, radio frequency technology, wide band w uh CDMA.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'These kind of things all have a lot of things to be to be uh researched.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'But uh I don't think w this is not something we are doing here.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Right, but bear in mind the picture is a is a little bit different.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'The picture I have in mind concerning UMTS is, first of all, if you use UMTS only for voice, Like you did it or are doing now for GSM, it's not worth to have this kind of network.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And, currently in Europe, where it will be deployed first, I believe, it will be very hard, in principle, to get some money back if you have only'",
        "'speaker_D': 'for using it for voice.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Voice, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Because they paid a lot of money.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'What is the point?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'The point is that you use the UMTS to connect to the internet and have certain kind of services which are still not available up to now.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'But the problem is if you have the internet content, and you have maybe your small uh um device of maybe only evolution based for for these uh new technologies, for for'",
        "'speaker_D': 'certain mobile'",
        "'speaker_D': 'phones, then you have certain kind of problems, you know, because you cannot use these things.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Hmm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And WAP is not an answer for for these kind of things, you know.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'The I believe there is a lot of research work and also if you see the end end scope of the internet, from the mobile node up to the certain kind of server, correspondent node\", or whatever you call this destination,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'then you have certain kind of models, for instance, for the quality of service and all these kind of things.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And then is UMTS only one link where you have certain kind of subnet layer technology.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And you have to match these things anyway.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'It's like a normal ethernet.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Hmm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Whatever you see, it is only an additional subnet layer technology.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And you have all the'",
        "'speaker_D': 'things mapped'",
        "'speaker_D': 'to the uh to to the to'",
        "'speaker_D': 'the the internet stuff, in principle, to this technology.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And furthermore, you see that the trend is to put more IP technology, really, really IP technology, and not certain kind of modifications and adaptations,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'to their access network itself.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And th there's a lot of potential, as I believe, for for uh certain research work.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'But the question is, first of all, Do we have the competence to do something like that?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'First of all.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Second, we are not hardware builders,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'in that sense to set up certain kind of'",
        "'speaker_D': 'end systems.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'We can design them,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'yeah, from the protocol layering and and maybe have some simulations, or whatever.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'But isn't the final outcome really such a device?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Prototype, Linux based.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And we go around here and we have maybe a GPS base station sponsored by Ericsson, since they are living not so far away and and maybeWaveLAN connection, here now a testbed and then then figure out that it works?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So, that's my point.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Well, just to make the list a little bit longer.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yep.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'May'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Um, you could also think about uh session management.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I do along with uh the network applications and services, uh'",
        "'speaker_C': 'as you might know.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'It's a a'",
        "'speaker_C': 'if you can do it in the end systems or'",
        "'speaker_C': 'at sp specific servers, then,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I'm in favor of that.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'But se session management, I mean uh the authentication, if you go from one network to the other, it's not solved.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'uh, Nobody really wants a a guest'",
        "'speaker_C': 'on your network.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Unless you get some money through some way uh through some way.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Then, there is also the session management in the sense that a lot of these things at the Barwan project, as you said, go through proxies.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'There might be kind of handoffs at uh at proxies, like the zip uh'",
        "'speaker_C': 's zip proxy that we also discussed before a little bit.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'That that's als I think also in the line of uh session management.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Then there is this uh perfect thing uh the Berkeley sockets.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'It's almost perfect.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'They s kind of skipped uh layer five,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'uh session management or session layer,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I think.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'That's um normally with if you do a socket programming, it's directly'",
        "'speaker_C': 'the prot application protocol on layer four,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'uh TCP socket, or layer five for UDP socket.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'There might also be some research Well,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'could you introduce such a session management, or Norm what they do right now is they'",
        "'speaker_C': 'make it part of the'",
        "'speaker_C': 'application level protocol.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'That's what they do most often.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Like with session management?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'for mobile the uh'",
        "'speaker_C': 'applications such as ist instant messaging or'",
        "'speaker_C': 'uh talks, and so on, uh like zip.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'It's just doing a a reconnect.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'If they think that the network is different or'",
        "'speaker_C': 'different capabilities come into play, they simply do a reconnect so it's part of the protocol.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'That's all what I think about session management, like'",
        "'speaker_C': 'part of in proxies or is it en embedded in application level protocols?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'But it's really higher level.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Right?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'It's no more related to a network.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I it's'",
        "'speaker_D': 'We are leaving the network area.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'That's dangerous.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So how do you want to focus on network services.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Cuz if you go to the app If you For me that's starting with middleware aspects, you know?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Well the So network applications\", if you look at the name of'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And'",

        "'speaker_G': 'But'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Yeah, that's that's clear, but then I don't get because when we were discussion discussing this uh stuff weeks ago,'",

        "'speaker_G': 'Ah but, it's also because I missed the last four weeks.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah, the problem is if you'",
        "'speaker_G': 'It's a a bit hard for me to follow the development what happened in the last four weeks, why it'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah OK maybe one sentence one sentence.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'changed so.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'If you're focussing on the argument chain as follows.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'I have an application.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'and That is it.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'I want to focus on it.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Then you have in mind that Or you must have in mind'",
        "'speaker_D': 'that all other applications and all other networking stuff is not affected by this.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'That you can use it with every application and if you introduce some new mechanism in the network, that is not related only to interactive multimedia applications like the classroom,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'it must be fit end to end.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And if you assume something, like we discussed it, very hard with with Multicast,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'that you assume that Multicast will be available at'",
        "'speaker_D': 'certain portions of the network or if you if you want to have it end to end, this mechanism must be applied really for all throughout of the internet.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Otherwise it makes no sense, and we come to the conclusion, OK, uh Multicast, we must deal with both approaches\", that you have eh application layer Multicast as well as maybe'",
        "'speaker_D': 'some other Multicast and maybe really Multicast'",
        "'speaker_D': 'and then the point is how to select these mechanism if you want to have not a certain kind of access to the'",
        "'speaker_D': 'server'",
        "'speaker_D': 'elsewhere in the network'",
        "'speaker_D': 'you want to use any application.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'So if I understandi it right, what has changed is before we were focussing on So Cuz what's difficult for me is what is meant by application\"?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah, and'",
        "'speaker_G': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Cuz I have sometimes the impression that everybody is defining application\" in different way.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'So, what exactly is mean by application\"?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'The application, for instance, here, that eh the'",
        "'speaker_D': 'interactive classroom.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'But elsewhere any application in in in any kind of'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'video audio or whatever kind of game server what'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Oh, OK.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'So, what has changed'",
        "'speaker_D': 'whatever kind of, application you can consider.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'So what has changed is that we're not only focussing on this intelligent classroom, but on everything.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Not on everything.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'That's not true.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'But we s'",
        "'speaker_D': 'That's why we say here, that we have a certain kind of eh possibility to change in the access networks.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'That means the wireless networks because that provides, in principle, the mobility.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And these mechan And you see that there's a trend to provide IP functionality more and more in these kind of networks.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'But the problem is that you could not focus on this kind of um'",
        "'speaker_D': 'technology only for the access network.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'You have to have in mind always the end to end scope.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And if you see, for instance We have routing algorithm but different protocols and whatever kinds of things, u especially also for Multicast,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'different things really for different providers, and uh and it's uh very easy to change it, maybe in the access network, for novel things.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'For instance, that's one provider domain and you can say well why not use active routing in that provider domain?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So it means that packet are delivering information, and you do not have the separation of routing and and and forwarding process.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'It's impossible'",
        "'speaker_D': 'to deal with that in the whole internet,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'because security reasons and whatever kinds of things make it impossible.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So how to combine these'",
        "'speaker_D': 'pos uh potential'",
        "'speaker_D': 'um'",
        "'speaker_D': 'extensions in the um access networks,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'and without losing the end to end scope in the internet.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Then you can have certain n novel features'",
        "'speaker_D': 'give the providers like KPN or whatever, the po the potential, in principle, to to uh'",
        "'speaker_D': 'see the building blocks for the future networks because there's a three g third generation like UMTS, a fourth generation more IP related.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'There will be a fifth generation, I'm sure.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And then you derive the certain kind of building blocks for this network, if you ever really full I'",
        "'speaker_D': 'uh uh fullI P, end to end.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'But nevertheless you can only not only focus on OK, I provide this mechanism\" because u you are accessing a certain kind of server node in the internet, using any application.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And then this mechanism must fit it there.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'But nevertheless eh internet backbone is in the meantime, based on its success,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'impossible to change.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'You see the difficulties with IP version six, eh eh you see the difficulties with Multicast.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'They are discussed since, you know, ten years or whatever.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'The specification are rather stable and and available'",
        "'speaker_D': 'but we have only islands in that.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'We cannot assume that everything is end to end available.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And so you have to mi to have to have in mind that certain kinds of mechanisms are maybe'",
        "'speaker_D': 'at a certain stage end to end available, maybe we have a lucky that the islands are connected to each other or the same applies for MPLS, for instance,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'maybe they are only portions available, how to deal with that when the islands are not available and'",
        "'speaker_D': 'maybe nothing is available.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'But you have to select it because I have a mobile phone, a mobile node or whatever kind of device, and I want to contact a certain kind of content in the internet.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So is it possible to d have certain kind of normal features in the access network without losing the end to end scope of with these difficulties we are dealing with.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'I always say that the success of internet make it unflexible.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'It's impossible to change something'",
        "'speaker_D': 'very easy.'",
        "'speaker_D': 's It's easy maybe more on the access network as in the internet backbone.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So that is eh overall picture'",
        "'speaker_D': 'that we have in mind with these things.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And we can not u We we are six people or seven or whatever if Hannes come, We are not able to solve the problems uh in in uh w in the few years or whatever what the whole internet community has um'",
        "'speaker_D': 'done in in si since uh since a decade.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'But we can f pick up some f some um potential and and and to start with something.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And that's my missing point.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'That we have here, in principle, really the description of this problem I mentioned'",
        "'speaker_D': 'and focus really on the reasonable size of the project maybe in the first stage fo for the NSA core itself,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'and maybe possible extension from, for instance, if KPN say yes, that's great,'",
        "'speaker_D': '\" that's the right direction.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'We will support that.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And if Siemens say OK, great, we will support it\", and and what it'",
        "'speaker_D': 'mmm University of Berlin or something and maybe University of Mannheim or Duisburg or in Spain oder whatever.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So if we have all the similar project then you have only to take care about that's a little bit aligned, that there's some transparency concerning the results and and'",
        "'speaker_D': 'the activities are literally going in the in the same'",
        "'speaker_D': 'um pace.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So that's the basic idea.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'But really it's to to figure out certain kind of smaller activities where we can start it.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'That's the point.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And if we get some funding back,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'and we have certain potent uh potential partners in the boat,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'OK, we can go to a broader scope of this whole thing, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'u Let me let me propose a a a a reasoning way.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Uh let's assume that we are successful with this proposal, so we get the funding'",
        "'speaker_B': 'to do whatever what we want to do.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So my question is, what we want to do is?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Let's assume that we have the funding.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'What will be our first and or or and second steps?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Ah, what kind of things uh we'",
        "'speaker_B': 'eh we will buy, what kind of things we will eh program or we will deploy?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Because answering this these questions we can'",
        "'speaker_B': 'know much better what the application we want.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So let's assume'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah, but the problem is'",
        "'speaker_D': 'that'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Mmm.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'f f f funding is the second step.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'N Well, I'm not sure.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I I th I think I agree with him.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'But uh'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'right now we're looking at b a th You want to do a big thing instead of a great thing.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So if you d assume that it should connect uh really good to Siemens and to uh KPN, and to the then it starts to get big we should all go to the in the same direction.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'If you already assume well, OK, they paid money\",'",
        "'speaker_C': 'and now you think, OK, what what great thing you want to do,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'then it gives you more freedom to think about this great thing you want to m do.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah, but we have no'",
        "'speaker_D': 'eh'",
        "'speaker_D': 'current no public funding, OK, everybody's paid here.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah, but but Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'But you but you don't get one if you if you try to to align KPN with Siemens, for instance.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'But for theoretical or for historical reasons a really good question, if we would have the money what would we do with that?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Uh.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So if we don't know what we would like to do with the money, we probably wouldn't get any money to do what we don't know.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Mm hmm.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Absolutely.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'These are my questions.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'then it is possible to raise some money.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Let let me put an example.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'this kind of things.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'But the point is eh, the only'",
        "'speaker_B': 'in here The only thing wireless thing I can put on on this is just uh this Omnisky modem,'",

        "'speaker_B': 'OK?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'A lot more expensive, but that's OK, I have the funding Then I can add a couple of cards at most, because mmm the majority of the of the notebooks only have two PC cards uh type two'",
        "'speaker_B': 'slots.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So'",
        "'speaker_B': 'In in the better case, maybe I'm only able to add two different networks to this thing.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So ah'",
        "'speaker_B': 'the difficulty I see is that ah if we are if you want to think in in two three four different technologies'",
        "'speaker_B': 'um, maybe we are uh'",
        "'speaker_B': 'too advanced too,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'um, let's say, uh too in advance for the current technology.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Which is not bad, but uh, I'm just saying that it will be able It will Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'It will be difficult for us to develop a a reasonable test bed with the available technology.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'If somebody tell us, OK, now here you have the thing, and just put these four networks you want on the thing.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'How can I do it now?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So'",
        "'speaker_B': 'mmm'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I'm still trying to'",
        "'speaker_B': 'you know, to get used to the uh all the ideas and to see that all the things are really connecting because this the eh most difficult'",
        "'speaker_B': 'thing I see to to to get this alignment to this connection point among the different things we are trying to align.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So that's why I was proposing this this question.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Let's assume we have the funding.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Now let's proceed.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'What what kind of things we can buy, we can put together, we can program.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Because oh at the end uh somebody will uh be asking us OK, did you do your homework?'",
