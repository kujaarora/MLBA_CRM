        "'speaker_D': 'And eh, well, mainly I will present uh'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Here you have more or less the sketch of the presentation.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'I will present some ideas and some concepts about what ad hoc networks are,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'about the issues in media access control in wireless networks,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'also about routing in such kind of networks'",
        "'speaker_D': 'and, eh, I will make some comments also about'",
        "'speaker_D': 'uh the current standards of wireless local area networks'",
        "'speaker_D': 'and finally, I will present the blueprint of of my research project or my research uh proposal here.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So the first thing is eh what an ad hoc network is.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'You know, uh, an ad hoc network is made of wireless nodes.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'These nodes of course can'",
        "'speaker_D': 'be mobile nodes,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'and, eh in this network there is no network infrastructure.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So'",
        "'speaker_D': 'eh the only active thing we have is the mobile nodes.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And eh'",
        "'speaker_D': 'end end communication, is sometimes, uh'",
        "'speaker_D': 'done by direct communication from one node to the other, because they can talk to each other.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'But sometimes it is not possible, this direct communication, because'",
        "'speaker_D': 'nodes, end uh source or and destination nodes are um are too far away.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And in this case, it can be done, communication can be done, by uh using multi hub routing.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So'",
        "'speaker_D': 'an intermediate, or a set of intermediate nodes will route or will forward the packet from the sender to the destination.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So'",
        "'speaker_D': 'uh in a sense, what we have in this kind of networks, is that, uh nodes are as both arced as both uh endpoints and also routers of other neighboring nodes.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And this makes a uh difference from other kind of network.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And well, regarding the purposes of'",
        "'speaker_D': 'what can this kind of network be used for,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'eh we can say that,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'well,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'cellular'",
        "'speaker_D': 'networks are infrastructure based networks,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'in this kind of ad hoc networks,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'we don't have'",
        "'speaker_D': 'anything uh, with the exception of the network nodes.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So, this uh network can be useful for eh'",
        "'speaker_D': 'uh occasions where no'",
        "'speaker_D': 'available infrastructure is present, like for example, in in eh after some kind of of eh'",
        "'speaker_D': 'um catastrophe catastrophic event,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'or, also when even when there is a network available, we don't want,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'for different reasons, to use the available network.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'This latt later case can be, for example, the use in military systems, where maybe we don't want to use the other the enemy network infrastructure, for evident reasons.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Hmm?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'But you can also, I believe, uh to have an ad hoc network, where one node is then connecting to the outer world.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'For instance, what I have in mind, you have a car, where you plug in different devices and they talk to each other, for instance, but one device decided to go to theGS network or GPS network, or whatever kind of things.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'That's OK.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So there's a certain kind of task uh, for one node within the ad hoc network to provide connectivity to the outer world, right?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'That'sO K.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'That's perfect, you know.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'This in this case, we will say that this node is acting as a as a gat external gateway, from this network to connect to other networks, and of course the underlying uh protocols can can be, of course, uh IP based.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Uh, OK.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Here you have several several uh, proposed, uh, scenarios for for used this networks.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'When no network is available,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'OK?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And another another application, for example, NASA is is uh studying, is uh the use of these networks, these ad hoc networks, for sending multiple probes, uh, um uh'",
        "'speaker_D': 'missions.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So, for example, all of you are aware of this uh the last Atlas, the last successful uh Mars mission, the cellular'",
        "'speaker_D': 'vehicle was only one, and was uh walking around, uh roaming around the base station, which in this case was the gateway uh node of this network, but it was only one mobile node, of course.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Nothing prevents, except well maybe the cost, to send not only one mobile rover, but ten tons of them, or or at least uh several of them.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So, uh higher area could be covered, could be explored'",
        "'speaker_D': 'and uh of course, all the different nodes could also use some kind of ad hoc networking, ad hoc routing,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'to extend the distance, the maximum distance, than uh a single radio transmission will would allow.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'OK?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And in the other case,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'or the other area uh of of of application,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'is the so called network of sensors, where we can deploy a set of sensors in a maybe uninhabited area, let's say, for example, the forest,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'and we can uh'",
        "'speaker_D': 'take some information'",
        "'speaker_D': 'uh, for example for for fire fighting, we can just launch from a plane, several small sensors, and uh'",
        "'speaker_D': 'these sensors can be for example, uh checking that there is no fire, they can have some kind of uh let's say infrared technology sensor,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'so we can cover a huge area with only a small set of of sensors, and without any other infrastructure.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Um, is that really an ad hoc network?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Because the sensors are not moving.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And I think it's makes no sense with moving sensors because then you don't know where the sensors are.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Well, You know, it's an interesting question.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Uh, the the main thing about an ad hoc network is not that nodes'",
        "'speaker_D': 'move.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'It is the way of topology changes can happen.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'The idea that'",
        "'speaker_D': 'mmm, any change is possible at any given moment.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'But you can of course ask, but if the nodes are not moving, what kind of topology changes can we expect?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'That's it.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Well, eh, the thing is that usually in in a n in a network of sensors, what we have, or the idea is to have'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'um, an important number of sensors, and maybe with a high filer rate.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'maybe the batteries'",
        "'speaker_D': 'are uh'",
        "'speaker_D': 'exhausted in some nodes because maybe uh they are not being able to take uh, let's say, any sun to recharge its cells,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'uh maybe some of them can be uh just uh'",
        "'speaker_D': 'out of order for other eh environmenta environmental conditions.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So uh the idea is that'",
        "'speaker_D': 'even when these nodes are not moving, they can start and stop working at uh, let's say, higher pace.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Then, uh what will happen in a in a regular network, uh in a network where you don't have or either mobility or uh this uh on off uh rate, high rate.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Let me go back to your uh uh example.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Hmm.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Have in mind some routers are burnt'",
        "'speaker_C': 'here, at ICSI or whatever kind of thing, what will happen then even in a fixed network?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'if some sensors are getting out of uh'",
        "'speaker_C': 'service and whatever kind of thing, so the topology has changed, even if no node is moving.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Mm hmm, OK.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And how to provide the connectivity and the intercommunication things wi within this network.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Thank you, Joe.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah, I see.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Well, uh, you know, and finally, uh, another non military applications, where uh maybe a network is available, like for example, a room like this, where we have, in fa in fact, a wired infrastructure, but this uh possible application of ad hoc networks could be uh, any place, any meeting room, where we arrive with our computers and eh we just can communicate seamlessly to each other without any kind of access point, any kind of uh external network, because the kind of work we want to do is just only local based, it's only to chat to each other or to exchange files with the person, which is in front of us.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'OK, but we n don't want to product pro provide, eh, access to the internet or'",
        "'speaker_D': 'something.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'OK?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And, of course, the same eh the same scenario,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'could also happen in a place where there is no uh, infrastructure available.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Let's say a meeting room'",
        "'speaker_D': 'uh, in in the middle of the desert, OK?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'without any other network.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So'",
        "'speaker_D': 'the point or or the question could be for some of us,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'the idea of saying OK, That sounds OK, but why'",
        "'speaker_D': 'not to use a longer transmission range, so we can reach any destination in just one hop?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'This seems to make sense because, well, uh we are this way'",
        "'speaker_D': 'avoiding all the routing problem that, well, we will talk a little bit'",
        "'speaker_D': 'uh, about routing later, but uh it it seems that i probably that the problem is is not an easy one, because uh a node's moving, the route is changing, so w one can think that routing in this uh scenario is is a complex thing.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'But the problem is if w we just uh try to put more power in each tr transmitter,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'so this uh transmitter can reach any destination in only one hop, what we are doing is'",
        "'speaker_D': 'uh to rising the power needs of each node, and also we are reducing the network uh throughput, because we are'",
        "'speaker_D': 'only allowing one transmissio one transmission at a time.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Because uh, well, we cannot allow several transmissions,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'several high powered transmissions at the same time because one is interfering with the other.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'OK?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'We are uh I think I'm not telling it yet, but we are assuming that we are using a single common channel for all the nodes.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'OK?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So that's why we cannot allow'",
        "'speaker_D': 'several transmitters in the same channel'",
        "'speaker_D': 'at the same time.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'OK?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So, the idea of hav having a longer transmission range is not a good one.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'or at least it has the drawbacks um, um, I was telling you.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Eh, let's speak a little bit about the media access issues in in wireless networks,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Uh, you know, the'",
        "'speaker_D': 'easiest eh way to to show how this works is or at least one of I think one of the easiest is that this drawing, or this picture, what what we have is a set of nodes, each one at a different location.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'At at at a at an'",
        "'speaker_D': 'at a given moment'",
        "'speaker_D': 'this eh node, this dash node is is transmitting'",
        "'speaker_D': 'and uh,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'the arrows are representing'",
        "'speaker_D': 'this transmission and the receiving nodes, these three nodes, are receiving the transmission,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'and I'm trying to uh show the area, the covered area, for of this transmission by means of this uh dashed eh line circle.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'OK?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So, uh, any transmission'",
        "'speaker_D': 'has a maximum transmission range,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'and uh in the simpler way, we can see this like a circle with the center in the transmitter'",
        "'speaker_D': 'and a certain radius.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'OK?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'The value of this radius is uh in principle, is a fixed value and it depends on the uh power of the transmitter.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Of course, uh this is only our uh simplife simplified model and of course this can be uh improved uh a lot, OK?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And in fact the real behavior is not exactly this one, but'",
        "'speaker_D': 'uh for for what I want to say it's it's OK, it's enough.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'OK?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So'",
        "'speaker_D': 'what are the differences'",
        "'speaker_D': 'uh, in this in this eh wireless transmission,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'regarding uh'",
        "'speaker_D': 'to the wireless to the wired ones.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'What what are the d the main differences.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Well, the main differences'",
        "'speaker_D': 'come from the fact that, uh in uh in uh wireless transmission we have'",
        "'speaker_D': 'a special domain we don't have when we are using a wire for transmitting a signal.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And the point'",
        "'speaker_D': 'I'm trying to show in this picture, is that if for example,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'this other node wants also to transmit while this one was transmitting,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'if we are using some kind of carry detect scheme, like for example, CSMA, or something uh uh derivated from it, the problem is that this node will hear the g the m'",
        "'speaker_D': 'the transmission media,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'it won't be able to hear anything'",
        "'speaker_D': 'so, he will conclude that no other transmission is going on, and he will start transmitting.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And'",
        "'speaker_D': 'if he does, what will happen is that this node and this other node will also receive this transmission, and this will produce, at least at these two nodes, a collision or a m a m a a re a bad reception.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'OK?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So none of these two simultaneous transmissions will be properly received at this node nor at this other node.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'OK, eh, this problem is what is called Oh, sorry.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'uh, the I think this is the previous one?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'This is the German'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Uh.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'One'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yes, this one.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'OK, thank you.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Eh'",
        "'speaker_D': 'this is what is called a hidden terminal\" problem.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'OK?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'because well'",
        "'speaker_D': 'uh'",
        "'speaker_D': 'this node is not able to hear this other node because of the distance uh, between them.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'But'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Uh, this problem, as you can see in the in the picture, is uh really producing at least some reception problem at these two nodes.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'OK, so'",
        "'speaker_D': 'it is it is a problem that we have to address and it is a new problem compared to wired uh media access control.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And, uh, well,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'some devel some protocols have been developed to avoid this problem and'",
        "'speaker_D': 'to try to address this particular behavior of wireless transmissions and the main idea'",
        "'speaker_D': 'is to use some kind of a reservation mechanism.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So'",
        "'speaker_D': 'we are'",
        "'speaker_D': 'um reserving a certain, and a specific uh, area of space so we can'",
        "'speaker_D': 'guarantee that nobody is trying to use the same space'",
        "'speaker_D': 'at the same time.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'OK?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'This is the basic idea.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Um Miguel, can you give some examples for such kind of protocols?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah, in fact'",
        "'speaker_C': 'One is really really'",
        "'speaker_D': 'This one.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'This one, n next slide is OK, in eh the the the main idea'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'and and the base of most of this protocols, is what this the so called RTS CTS uh dialogue.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'The idea is that, uh,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'of course, this is only intended for unicast transmissions, I mean, only for when a node wants to transmit something to'",
        "'speaker_D': 'a neighbor node.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'OK?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'But not to broadcast.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Uh, to all the nodes.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'For this for this eh, work, the transmitter has to send a a a reservation packet called RTS, Request To Send\",'",
        "'speaker_D': 'before'",
        "'speaker_D': 'eh being able to send data.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And the receiver is expected to return back another packet called CTS, Clear To Send\",'",
        "'speaker_D': 'to allow the transmitter to send the data.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'If the transmitter receives successfully the CTS packet from the destination,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'then it will be able to send eh the packet, the data packet.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'If not, it will h'",
        "'speaker_D': 'uh, back off, and it will retry uh sometime later.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'OK?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So the main idea'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And the media is is is still occupied during that period, or?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Uh.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'The idea is uh, if I want to send you something, I first of all, I need'",
        "'speaker_D': 'you to answer me'",
        "'speaker_D': 'to be sure that you are my neighbor now because maybe you are off or maybe you are uh too far away, and also because that way Miguel, for example, it may be is not being able to hearing me'",
        "'speaker_D': 'will hear your CTS and will know that you are about to receive uh data from me.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'OK?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So'",
        "'speaker_D': 'in fact, forcing the receiver to transmit for a short period of time is also uh, used to signal all the uh receiver'",
        "'speaker_D': 'neighbors'",
        "'speaker_D': 'that a recept a reception is taking place.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'OK?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I didn't get it.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Um, what happened when I sent an RTS packet?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Is then the media still occupied for me?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Or, is anybody allowed also to send RTS packets?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Or everybody'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Because if I go to an intermediate node, maybe you are communicating to me and I am the intermediate node to the final destination Michael.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And Michael send also some RTS packet in the time and and uh uh'",
        "'speaker_C': 'uh Jordi too and whatever.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Then you will never come to a really then you're always exchanging RTS and non acknowledgement packets for the RTS.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Two two things.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So that's uh that's uh, my my problem.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'First of all, eh, this this mechanism is only a media access controlled mechanism, so it is not connected with routing eh, anyhow.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Then, fine.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And, second point,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'eh'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So it's only related to the direct neighbor within the scope of the transmissions?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'RTS'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah, RTS packets can collide to other RTS packets.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So, this mechanism is not uh preventing collisions, it is preventing only data collisions.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'OK?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So the'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And and you can say OK, but what is the what the benefit is?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'The benefit is that, eh'",
        "'speaker_D': 'RTS packets and CTS packets are short packets, really short packets.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Let's say eh eh30 bytes or less.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I assume so.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'while data packets can be much mor much bigger.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Let's say uh oneK, OK?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Fine.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'a collision in this short packet is only wasting a small amount of time.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And, uh'",
        "'speaker_D': 'if that way we can warranty that there is there are there is no collision'",
        "'speaker_D': 'uh'",
        "'speaker_D': 'uh, between data packet,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'well, this this is this means a a huge eh increase in network throughput, because we well, we we only waste really small time colliding.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'OK, but that means, in principle, that on the MAC layer you have always a RTS CTS packet'",
        "'speaker_D': 'OK?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'between neighboring nodes, and you send afterwards the data.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'But the data will be maybe delayed in the intermediate node because you have always'",
        "'speaker_C': 'be assured to be uh s uh uh RTS and CTS packets are changed before before you can forewarning the data, right?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'It is a reservation mechanism, so if reservation doesn't work OK, if uh one reservation'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'don't succeed'",
        "'speaker_D': 'then,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'uh, this transmission should have to wait.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Now the p'",
        "'speaker_D': 'until the reservation OK, yeah, let me'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Maybe it's better to to uh,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'draw it on the'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Oops.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'l let me'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So, maybe my idea first.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So this is what,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'node one?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'This is node two and this is the source,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'and this is node three that is the final destination.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Fo fo for forget forget about routing.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'But but anyway, I would like to do that in the ad hoc network.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'This is maybe the sco this is within the scope'",
        "'speaker_C': 'of this, uh special network.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'That means here that is uh within the transmission'",
        "'speaker_D': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'power.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So if I send an RTS,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'and get back,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'um, a CTS, then he is allowed to send data, right?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'a CTS.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'That's OK.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'In the meantime, when he gets this one, he also had to send RTS'",
        "'speaker_C': 'and then CTS because this is the next next scope of the transmission area, and then he can send the data, right?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'That's the case?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'That's it.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'That's'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And that's what I mean.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'In the meantime, he c still can get some data here,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'where he try to get certain connectivity on the MAC layer.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah, but eh a node is only is only involved in one transmission at a given time.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So if now two has'",
        "'speaker_D': 'answer with the with the CTS, it will be waiting until the data that has to come.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'OK, and then he try to forward this data.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'OK?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'After that.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'But n not before.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So he is definitely first to stop.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'He has to collect all the data?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah, you cannot'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Could it not be a little bit strange because if that is starting a file transfer with millions of bytes, he have to collect all the bytes before he forwarding to to whatever.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'No, no, no.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'But we are we are talking only about a data packet.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Huh?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'One data p He have to do it for all data packets?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'at the MAC layer.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So but, in principle,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'when he receives the data packet then he'",
        "'speaker_C': 'The same applies for the next data packet.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'All the packets, all unicast packets.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'but anyway in the meantime he has to forward the packet to the final destination.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'That that true.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Right?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'That's true.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So it's acting, in in prin'",
        "'speaker_D': 'But not in the meantime.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'After receiving'",
        "'speaker_D': 'You know, in fact, probably the routing protocol will need to check the address the the let's say IP address,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'which is'",
        "'speaker_D': 'inside the data packet, so, you cannot u usually you cannot, uh,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'read the data packet until you the reception is over.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'OK?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'because usually your network hardware only provides you a copy of a packet after ou a a successful reception and usually you know that reception is successful if every bit has passed the CRC check.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'OK?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'You have checked that the that this frame has received uh without errors.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Naja to to Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'OK?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah, OK.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Um, a further question.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Um.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'That's OK.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Am I right that this um dialogue does not prevent'",
        "'speaker_B': 'um any disturbance of other nodes in the um sending range of, yeah,N one.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah, let me let me put some'",
        "'speaker_B': 'S'",
        "'speaker_D': 'special representation of what we are doing.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'This is the transmitting node,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'this is the receiving node,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'and these two areas, of course, there's something like this,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'are'",
        "'speaker_D': 'the uh'",
        "'speaker_D': 'places of the total space where you can hear the Here, this one is the RTS and this one is the CTS.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So, any node, for example, this node is a neighbor of the receiving node, but it is not a neighbor of the transmitting node.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'That's it.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So when'",
        "'speaker_D': 'this node hears the CTS transmission that is performed by the receiver,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'this will be uh informed, that a recev a reception is taking place in in in it's area.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'OK?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So'",
        "'speaker_D': 'in fact, this node'",
        "'speaker_D': 'will avoid any further transmission until uh this reception,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'that will start in in a moment, is over.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'But then this node, um, this transmission is uh aborted.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'OK?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And delayed.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And so there's no advantage to uh if it's aborted, by by any data packets.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So this um node has to stop each transmission.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'even the at ongoing transmission.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Is that right?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So, his transmission is aborted.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah, but this is typical for MAC layer protocols, you know.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Not No.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'That's'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Maybe maybe you are right.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'So what what we are assuming is that all the nodes behave exactly the same regarding to uh transmission and receiving signals.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah, but, Miguel, this is a good point from from Dietmar, but maybe here is a wall.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And this guy is behind the wall, so his transmission rate is something like that.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah but but yeah'",
        "'speaker_D': 'but the but in this case, you know this this idea, this uh geometric idea, can be can be, if you want, uh deformed because of some obstacles.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'OK?'",

        "'speaker_D': 'making this node not to hear this one, it's also making this one not to hear this node.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'But one of the'",

        "'speaker_D': 'Because of this wall, if they are not neighbors, well, we can represent this'",
        "'speaker_D': 'putting this node like here.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'But one of the um senders could be much stronger than the other one.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'OK?'",

        "'speaker_B': 'So'",
        "'speaker_B': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So that was my question.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'We are assuming all the nodes are exactly the same.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Mm hmm.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'And, we have, uh'",
        "'speaker_D': 'mmm, worked about this problem'",
        "'speaker_D': 'uh, in two different uh ways.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'OK?'",

        "'speaker_D': 'OK?'",

        "'speaker_D': 'OK?'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Yep.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Right.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'o of happening this'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Nee.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'That's really right, but what I would like to say is that besides the RTS CTS behavior, you need certain kind of additional MAC layer functionality to deal with these packet.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Hmm?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Hmm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'For example, with transmission or or whatever,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah, sure, sure.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Some protocols used uh in the same way as this RTS and CTS packet some of them use, an eh acknowledge from the receiver,'",

        "'speaker_D': 'some kind of acknowledgement back.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So, if this acknowledgement has to go through the process of a new RTS and a new CTS,'",

        "'speaker_D': 'So, I I I you know, ask uh'",
        "'speaker_D': 'You Feel free to ask uh whatever you want, but I I want to insist that it was just an uh a simplified uh version, a light version.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'OK?'",

        "'speaker_D': 'finally this algorithm, eh, as I was telling,'",

        "'speaker_D': 'I think that the answer to your question is'",

        "'speaker_D': 'that uh if you have an endless uh source of power, well, maybe it's not a problem, for the battery uh lasting.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'But, it is a problem because you are using more area than you should.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And therefore you are preventing other transmissions to take place at the same time.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And therefore uh the problem is not only connected to to the to the power'",
        "'speaker_D': 'it is also connected to the net to the global network throughput.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'OK.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'What I think that will happen is that they will try to get'",

        "'speaker_D': 'uh transmitted to the air.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'It is not power transferred to the air.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'But what you can avoid or you can reduce and probably because now it is the main factor, the main consumption factor, is the logic inside.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'uh, a packet to a a given destination, first of all, I have to figure out the proper route for this packet.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And then, uh I'm using soft routing.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'eh of course, uh these uh two approaches can be can be uh somehow mixed and some hybrid proposals are also on the on the paper,'",

        "'speaker_D': 'eh some sometimes making a kind of combination of of them uh, let's say, for example, using uh practive approach for the closer set of nodes, let's say for the neighbors and maybe the next level, and, using a reactive approach'",

        "'speaker_D': 'OK?'",

        "'speaker_D': 'I don't trust you can really provide quality of service, but of course'",
        "'speaker_C': 'That depends on the service level you want to be.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Definitely not a guarantee level.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'But maybe something like a control load level or something like that, seems to be for me'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'possible.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Right?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'You know, uh if you are curious, uh I can I can'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'I can provide you the n some of the proposals which include'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Hmm.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah, we can discuss later, off line.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And eh, finally, the other the other thing, which is also under research or under study is, uh'",
        "'speaker_D': 'to have some kind of a power aware routing.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'There are some proposals, too.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So that way you could'",
        "'speaker_D': 'routing function could be'",
        "'speaker_D': 'connected with uh global or local power consumption.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So, for example, you could ask to u nnn,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'the network to transmit your packet with the lowest uh global uh consumption or with your'",
        "'speaker_D': 'lowest local consumption, for example.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'OK?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'I mean,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'would the option for me to to use less power when sending a packet is to send it to the closest neighbor.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'OK, assuming that I'm I'm also using s or having some kind of power control thing.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'so that way transmitting to the closer close to my closer node,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'is, uh'",
        "'speaker_D': 'something that requires less effort than sending to a more distant node.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Maybe the closer node is not a good uh it is not in the good direction to the to reach the destination.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'But it is for sure the the less expensive uh thing for me.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'OK?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'But probably this uh this is not'",
        "'speaker_D': 'something really useful.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And that ca what can be u really useful is to reduce the global power consumption in the routing function.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'because in this way, well, maybe one node is is being forced to use more power but but if we take a look at the whole thing, well, we can ask for a a low consumption route, well, the same way as we are asking, for example, when we want uh some packet to be shipped in the real life, we can go and say well, we will we are happy with this UPS ground system.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah, but the'",
        "'speaker_D': 'What we want w is two day delivery service, or w twenty four hours'",
        "'speaker_D': 'service, and we are willing to pay more or less'",
        "'speaker_D': 'for this service.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah, but it's really happened also in the riot case, you know.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'If I get the wrong route with the RCMP redirects, it's, in principle, then the same.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'That'sO K.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So, these are more or less uh some open problems,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'and uh well'",
        "'speaker_D': 'just a quick comment about probably'",
        "'speaker_D': 'all of use are now aware'",
