        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah so, actually it it it decreased'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'the the accuracy.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Uh huh.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'tha this can help.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Perhaps, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Well, that's that's one thing, but see the other thing is that, um, I mean it's good to take the difficult case, but let's let's consider what that means.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'What what we're saying is that one o one of the things that I mean my interpretation of your your s original suggestion is something like this, as motivation.'",

        "'speaker_A': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And, um, if'",
        "'speaker_D': 'we get something that helps us when it's somewhat similar, and doesn't hurt us too much when it when it's quite different, that's maybe not so bad.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So the question is, if you took the same combination,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Mmm.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'and you tried it out on, uh on say digits,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'On TI digits?'",

        "'speaker_D': 'And so what is the range over these different kinds of uh of tests?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So, an anyway.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'OK, go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And,'",

        "'speaker_D': 'Slightly better.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'And and you know again maybe if you use the, uh, delta'",
        "'speaker_D': 'there, uh, you would bring it up to where it was, uh you know at least about the same for a difficult case.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah, maybe.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'um Suppose we said, OK, we've got these different features and so forth, but PLP seems pretty good.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'If we take the approach that Mike did'",

        "'speaker_D': 'And put put them together.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'something that was a modest amount of reverberation then you'd get some result in between the two.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So it was sort of behaved reasonably.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So you you think it's perhaps better to have severalML?'",

        "'speaker_D': 'So that I'm I'm I'm hoping that um,'",
