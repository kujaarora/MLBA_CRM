        "'speaker_C': 'Oh, wow.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So so, you know, sort of everybody is doing things between, well, roughly a third of the errors, and half the errors being eliminated,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Mm hmm.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'they they differed in some respects, but they e em one was called the French Telecom Alcatel System the other was called the Alcatel French Telecom System,'",

        "'speaker_D': 'But but there're there're there're some other differences, too.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Uh, and and, uh, they both did very well, you know?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Uh huh.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'um, my impression is they also did very well on on the the, uh, evaluation set, but,'",

        "'speaker_D': 'I I we haven't seen you've you haven't seen any final results for that yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And they used the main thing that'",
        "'speaker_C': 'that they used was spectral subtraction?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Or'",
        "'speaker_D': 'There is a couple pieces to it.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'There's a spectral subtraction style piece it was basically, you know, Wiener filtering.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And then then there was some p some modification of the cepstral parameters, where they'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah, actually, something that's close to cepstral mean subtraction.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'But, uh, the way the mean is adapted'",
        "'speaker_A': 'um, it's signal dependent.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I'm I'm, uh'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So, basically, the mean is adapted during speech and not during silence.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'But it's very close to to cepstral mean subtraction.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'But some people have done'",
        "'speaker_D': 'exactly that sort of thing, of of and the I mean it's not To to look in speech only, to try to m to measure these things during speech, that's p that's not that uncommon.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'But i it it so it looks like they did some some, uh,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'reasonable things, uh, and they're not things that we did, precisely.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'We did unreasonable things,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'which because we like to try strange things, and and, uh, and our things worked too.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Hmm.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And so, um,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'uh,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'it's possible that some combination of these different things that were done would be the best thing to do.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'But the only caveat to that is that everybody's being real conscious of how much memory and how much CPU they're using because these,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'uh, standards are supposed to go on cell phones with m moderate resources in both respects.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Did anybody, uh, do anything with the models as a'",
        "'speaker_C': 'an experiment?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Or'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Uh, they didn't report it, if they did.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'N nobody reported it?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'I think everybody was focused elsewhere.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Um, now, one of the things that's nice about what we did is, we do have a a,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'uh a filtering, which leads to a a,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'uh'",
        "'speaker_D': 'a reduction in the bandwidth in the modulation spectrum, which allows us to downsample.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'uh, as a result of that we have a reduced, um, transmission rate for the bits.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'That was misreported the first time out.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'It it said the same amount because for convenience sake in the particular way that this is being tested, uh, they were repeating the packets.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So it was they were s they they had twenty four hundred bits per second, but they were literally creating forty eight hundred bits per second,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Oh.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'um, even though y it was just repeated.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So, uh, in practice'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So you could've had a repeat count in there or something.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Well, n I mean, this was just a ph phoney thing just to to fit into the the software that was testing the errors channel errors and so on.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Oh.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So so in reality, if you put this this system in into, uh, the field, it would be twenty four hundred bits per second, not forty eight hundred.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Oh.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'um, so that's a nice feature of what what we did.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Um,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'but, um,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'well, we still have to see'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Hmm.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'how it all comes out.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Um, and then there's the whole standards process, which'",

        "'speaker_C': 'When is the development set I mean, the, uh, uh, test set results due?'",

        "'speaker_D': 'they, uh'",

        "'speaker_D': 'And the the, uh, results are due like the day before the meeting or something.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah, probably, well'",
        "'speaker_D': 'I th I think I I think they are, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah, well'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Hmm.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Might have something to do with electricity shortage.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'Uh, but, um'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Uh, I think, you know, the main reason for having I mean, it only takes w to run the the two test sets in just in computer time is just a day or so, right?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'it's very short interval.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So, I think the who the whole reason for having'",
        "'speaker_D': 'as long as we have, which was like a week and a half, is is because of bugs like that.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Huh'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So, we're gonna end up with these same kind of sheets that have the'",
        "'speaker_D': 'the percentages and'",
        "'speaker_D': 'so on just for the'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah, so there are two more columns in the sheets, two.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Oh, I guess it's the same sheets, yeah, yeah just with the missing columns filled in.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah, it's the same sheets, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Well, that'll be good.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'That's that's that's good.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So, Hynek will try to push for trying to combine, uh,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'different things?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Or'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Uh, well that's'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Hmm?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'um'",
        "'speaker_D': 'yeah I mean, I think the question is Is there is there some advantage?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'I mean, you could just take the best system and say that's the standard.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'But the thing is that if different systems are getting at good things,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'um, a again within the constraint of the resources,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'if there's something simple that you can do'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Now for instance, uh,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'it's, I think, very reasonable to have a standard for the terminal's side and then for the server's side say, Here's a number of things that could be done.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So, um, everything that we did could probably just be added on to what Alcatel did, and i it'd probably work pretty well with them, too.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'um,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'uh, that's one'",
        "'speaker_D': 'one aspect of it.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And then on the terminal's side, I don't know how much, um,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'memory and and CPU it takes, but it seems like the filtering'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Uh, I mean, the VAD stuff they both had, right?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And, um, so and they both had some kind of on line normalization, right?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Uh, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Of sorts, yeah?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So so, it seems like the main different there is the is the, uh, filtering.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And the filtering I think if you can'",
        "'speaker_D': 'shouldn't take a lot of memory to do that'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Uh, and I also wouldn't think the CPU,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'uh, would be much either'",
        "'speaker_D': 'for that part.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So, if you can if you can add those in'",
        "'speaker_D': 'um'",
        "'speaker_D': 'then, uh, you can cut the data rate in half.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So it seems like the right thing to do is to on the on the terminal's side,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'take what they did, if it if it does seem to generalize well to German and Danish,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'uh, take what they did add in a filter, and add in some stuff on the server's side and and and that's probably a reasonable standard.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Um'",
        "'speaker_A': 'They are working on this already?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Uh'",

        "'speaker_A': 'some kind of,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah, so that's that's that's what'",
        "'speaker_A': 'uh, filtering in the'",
        "'speaker_D': 'That would be ideal would be is that they could, you know, they could actually show that, in fact, a combination of some sort,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'France Telecom.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'any of the systems had.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And, um, then it would it would, uh'",
        "'speaker_D': 'be something to to discuss in the meeting.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'not clear what will go on.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Um,'",

        "'speaker_D': 'sometimes people are just anxious to get a standard out there.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'this process has gone on for a while on already and and people'",
        "'speaker_D': 'might just wanna pick something and say, OK, this is it.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And then, that's a standard.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Uh, standards are always optional.'",
