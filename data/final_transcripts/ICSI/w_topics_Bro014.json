        "'speaker_A': 'But So,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'this is why we we started to look'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Well, that's the rea w w what I'm arguing is that's'",

        "'speaker_A': 'sort of voiced'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I mean, uh, what I'm arguing is that that that's givi you gives you your intuition.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'phonemes and'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'But in in reality, it's you know, there's all of this this overlap and so forth, and But what I'm saying is that may be OK,'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Oh, sorry.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'because what you're really getting is not actually voiced versus unvoiced, both for the fac the reason of the overlap and and then,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'uh, th you know, structural reasons,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'uh, uh, like the one that Chuck said, that that in fact, well, the data itself is that you're working with is not perfect.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So, what I'm saying is maybe that's not a killer because you're just getting some characterization, one that's driven by your intuition about voiced unvoiced certainly, but it's just some characterization of'",

        "'speaker_B': 'something back in the in the in the almost raw data, rather than the smooth version.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And your intuition is driving you towards particular kinds of,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'uh, statistical characterizations of, um,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'what's missing from the spectral envelope.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Um, obviously you have something about the excitation,'",
