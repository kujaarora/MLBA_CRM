        "'speaker_E': 'of handling it.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So, um'",

        "'speaker_F': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'I mean, the other thing is, are aren't we seeing?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Y y I'm sure you've already looked at this bu in these noisy cases, are?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'We are seeing lots of insertions.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Right?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'The insertion number is quite high?'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'I've seen that with the mel cepstrum.'",

        "'speaker_F': 'I don't I don't know about the Aurora front end, but'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I think it's much more balanced with, uh when the front end is more robust.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I could look at it at this.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_E': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I don't have this in'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Well, this the whole'",
        "'speaker_F': 'problem with insertions was what I think,'",
        "'speaker_F': 'um, we talked about when'",
        "'speaker_F': 'the guy from OGI came down that one time and and that was when people were saying, well we should have a, uh,'",
        "'speaker_F': 'uh, voice activity detector that, because all that stuff that we're getting thr the silence that's getting through is causing insertions.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Right.'",

        "'speaker_E': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Mmm.'",

        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And it may be less of a critical thing.'",

        "'speaker_F': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So, I mean, the insertions is is a symptom.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'It's a symptom that there's something, uh, wrong with the range.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'But there's uh, your your your substitutions tend to go up as well.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So, uh, I I I think that,'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'uh, the most obvious thing is just the insertions,'",
        "'speaker_E': 'But'",

        "'speaker_E': 'If you're operating in the wrong range I mean, that's why just in general, if you'",

        "'speaker_E': 'Um, I mean we ca'",
        "'speaker_E': 'it's if we actually could pick a a a more stable value for the range of these features,'",
        "'speaker_E': 'it, um,'",
        "'speaker_E': 'uh,'",
        "'speaker_E': 'could'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Uh'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Even though it's it's it's true that in a real situation you can in fact adjust the these these scaling factors in the back end, and it's ar artificial here that we're not adjusting those, you certainly don't wanna be adjusting those all the time.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Hmm.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And if you have a nice front end that's in roughly the right range I remember after we got our stuff more or less together in the previous systems we built, that we tended to set those scaling factors at kind of a standard level, and we would rarely adjust them again, even though you could get a for an evaluation you can get an extra point or something if you tweaked it a little bit.'",
