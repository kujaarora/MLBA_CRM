        "'speaker_B': 'found that, uh, s single like, I just do a s normal Wiener filtering, like the standard method of Wiener filtering.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And that doesn't actually give me any'",

        "'speaker_B': 'So, um So that's The improvement is somewhere around, like, thirty percent over the baseline.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Is that using in combination with something else?'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So I just plug in the Wiener filtering.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Oh, OK.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'So'",
        "'speaker_C': 'But that's what I'm confused about, cuz I think I thought that our system was more like forty percent without the Wiener filtering.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'OK.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Oh, OK.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So, with the with the on line normalization, the performance was, um,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'ten OK, so it's like four point three.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Uh, and again, that's the ba the ten point, uh,'",

        "'speaker_B': 'uh Fifty seven is what you got by using the French Telecom system, right?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'No, I don't think so.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Y i'",
        "'speaker_B': 'No, this is over the wholeSpeechDat Car.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Oh, yeah, fifty seven Right.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'point'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah, so the new the new Wiener filtering schema is like some fifty six point four six which is like'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Uh huh.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'what you got using the French Telecom system.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'And'",
        "'speaker_B': 'and what I t what I tried was, by using'",
        "'speaker_B': 'the same thing but Uh, so we actually found that the VAD is very, like,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'crucial.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I mean, just by changing the VAD itself gives you the a lot of improvement by instead of using'",

        "'speaker_B': 'So I just used the channel zero VAD to estimate the noise so that it gives me some reliable mar markers for this noise estimation.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'What's a channel zero VAD?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I'm I'm confused about that.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Um, so, it's like'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So it's the close talking microphone.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah, the close talking without So because the channel zero and channel one are like the same'",

        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah, so actually I received a a new document,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah, that's'",
        "'speaker_D': 'describing this.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And what they did finally is to, mmm,'",

        "'speaker_A': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So that's the basic principle.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'What you do is you, uh'",
        "'speaker_B': 'b fff.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So again, I can write down some of these eq Oh, OK.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'You get an estimate of the clean power spectrum.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I see.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So but the thing is that you have to estimate the SF from the noisy spectrum, what you have.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So you estimate the NF from the initial noise portions and then you subtract that from the current noisy spectrum to get an estimate of the SF.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So sometimes that becomes zero because you do you don't have a true estimate of the noise.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So the f filter will have like sometimes zeros in it because some frequency values will be zeroed out because of that.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And that creates a lot of'",
        "'speaker_B': 'discontinuities across the spectrum because the filter.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'uh,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'so that's what that was just the first stage of Wiener filtering that I tried.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So is this, um, basically s uh, similar to just regular spectral subtraction?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'It'",
        "'speaker_C': 'It's all pretty related, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'It's it's there's a di there's a whole class of techniques where you try in some sense to minimize the noise.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Uh huh.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And it's typically a mean square sense, uh uh uh, i in in in some way.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And, uh'",
        "'speaker_C': 'uh, spectral subtraction is is, uh'",
        "'speaker_C': 'uh, one approach to it.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Do people use the Wiener filtering in combination with the spectral subtraction typically, or is i are they sort of competing techniques?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Not seen.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'They are very'",
        "'speaker_B': 's similar techniques.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So it's like I haven't seen anybody using s Wiener filter with spectral subtraction.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'O oh, OK.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I see, I see.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I mean, in the long run you're doing the same thing but y but there you make different approximations, and'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Mmm.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'in spectral subtraction, for instance, there's a a an estimation factor.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'You sometimes will figure out what the noise is and you'll multiply'",
        "'speaker_C': 'that noise spectrum times some constant and subtract that rather than'",
        "'speaker_C': 'and sometimes people even though this really should be in the power domain, sometimes people s work in the magnitude domain because it it it'",
        "'speaker_C': 'works better.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And, uh,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'uh, you know.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So why did you choose, uh, Wiener filtering over some other one of these other techniques?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Uh, the reason was, like, we had this choice of using spectral subtraction, Wiener filtering, and there was one more thing which I which I'm trying, is this sub space approach.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Stephane is working on spectral subtraction.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Oh, OK.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So I picked up'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So you're sort of trying them all.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Y Yeah, we just wanted to have a few noise production compensation techniques and then pick some from that pick one.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Ah, I see.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Oh, OK.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I m I mean yeah, I mean, there's Car Carmen's working on another, on the vector Taylor series.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'VA Yeah, VAD.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'w Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So they were just kind of trying to cover a bunch of different things'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Ah, OK.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'That makes sense.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'with this task and see, you know, what are what are the issues for each of them.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Um.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Cool, thanks.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So so one of one of the things that I tried, like I said, was to remove those zeros in the fri filter by doing some smoothing of the filter.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Like, you estimate the edge of square and then you do a f smoothing across the frequency so that those zeros get, like, flattened out.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And that doesn't seems to be improving by trying it on the first time.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So what I did was like I p'",
        "'speaker_B': 'did this and then you I plugged in the one more the same thing but with the smoothed filter the second time.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And that seems to be working.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So that's where I got like fifty six point five percent improvement onSpeechDat Car with that.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So the other thing what I tried was I used still the ten frames of noise estimate but I used this channel zero VAD to drop the frames.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So I'm not still not estimating.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And that has taken the performance to like sixty seven percent inSpeechDat Car, which is which which like sort of shows that by using a proper VAD you can just'",
        "'speaker_B': 'take it to further,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'better levels.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So that's sort of like, you know, best case performance?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah, so far I've seen sixty seven I mean, no, I haven't seen s like sixty seven percent.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'uh, using the channel zero VAD to estimate the noise also seems to be improving but I don't have the results for all the cases with that.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So I used channel zero VAD to estimate noise as a lesser frame, which is like,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'everywhere I use the channel zero VAD.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And that seems to be the best combination, uh, rather than using a few frames to estimate and then drop a channel.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So I'm I'm still a little confused.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Is that channel zero information'",
        "'speaker_C': 'going to be accessible'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Nnn, no.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'during this test.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'This is just to test whether we can really improve by using a better VAD.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So, I mean So this is like the noise compensation f is fixed but you make a better decision on the endpoints.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'That's, like seems to be'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'so we c so I mean, which which means, like,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'by using this technique what we improve just the VAD we can just take the performance by another ten percent or better.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So, that that was just the, uh, reason for doing that experiment.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And, w um Yeah, but this all these things, I have to still try it on the TI digits, which is like I'm just running.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And there seems to be not improving a a lot on the TI digits, so I'm like investigating that, why it's not.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And, um, um'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Well after that.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So, uh so the other the other thing is like I've been I'm doing all this stuff on the power spectrum.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Tried this stuff on the mel as well mel and the magnitude, and mel magnitude, and all those things.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'But it seems to be the power spectrum seems to be getting the best result.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So, one of one of reasons I thought like doing the averaging, after the filtering using the mel filter bank, that seems to be maybe helping rather than trying it on the mel filter ba filtered outputs.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Ma'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So just th Yeah, th that's that's the only thing that I could think of why why it's giving improvement on the mel.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Makes sense.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And, yep.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So that's it.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Uh, how about the subspace stuff?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Subspace, I'm I'm like that's still in a little bit in the back burner because I've been p'",
        "'speaker_B': 'putting a lot effort on this to make it work, on tuning things and other stuff.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'OK.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'And'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Mmm.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So the smoothing is I did a smoothing actually on this gain,'",
