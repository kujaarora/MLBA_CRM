        "'speaker_D': 'Uh,'",

        "'speaker_D': 'Um, but, u uh, yes.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'No, it is interesting.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And the other thing is, I mean,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'there's two sides to these really small, uh, gradations in performance.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Um, I mean, on the one hand in a practical system if something is, uh, four point four percent error, four point one percent error, people won't really tell be able to tell the difference.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'On the other hand, when you're doing, uh, research,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'you may, eh you might find that the way that you build up a change from a ninety five percent accurate system to a ninety eight percent accurate system is through ten or twelve little things that you do that each are point three percent.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'And it seemed like he chose it a bit informally.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So, um,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'with the with the HTK set up I should be able to do some experiments, on just varying that length, say between one and three seconds, in a few different reverberation conditions, um,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'say this room and also a few of the artificial impulse responses we have for reverberation,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'just, um, making some plots and seeing how they look.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And, um, so,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'with the the sampling rate I was using, one second or two seconds or four seconds is at a power of two'",
        "'speaker_C': 'um, number of samples and, um, I'll I'll jus f for the ones in between I guess I'll just zero pad.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'I guess one thing that might also be an issue, uh, cuz part of what you're doing is you're getting a'",
        "'speaker_D': 'a spectrum over a bunch of different kinds of speech sounds.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Um, and so it might matter'",
        "'speaker_D': 'how fast someone was talking for instance.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Oh.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'You know, if you if if if there's a lot of phones in one second maybe you'll get a a really good sampling of all these different things, and'",
        "'speaker_D': 'and, uh, on the other hand if someone's talking slowly maybe you'd need more.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So'",
        "'speaker_D': 'I don't know if you have some samples of'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Huh.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'faster or slower speech but it might make a difference.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'I don't know.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Uh, yeah, I don't I don't think the TI digits'",
        "'speaker_C': 'data that I have, um, i is would be appropriate for that.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah, probably not.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'But what do you What about if I w I fed it through some kind of, um,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'speech processing algorithm that changed the speech rate?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah, but then you'll have the degradation of of, uh, whatever you do'",
        "'speaker_D': 'uh, added onto that.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'But maybe.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah, maybe if you'",
        "'speaker_D': 'get something that sounds that that's does a pretty job at that.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Well, uh, just if you think it's worth looking into.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'You could imagine that.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I mean, it it is getting a little away from reverberation.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Um, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'It's just that you're making a choice'",
        "'speaker_D': 'uh, I was thinking more from the system aspect, if you're making a choice forSmartKom, that that that it might be'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'that it's it c the optimal number could be different, depending on'",

        "'speaker_D': 'Could be.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'I don't know.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And and th the third thing, um, uh, is, um, Barry explained LDA filtering'",
        "'speaker_C': 'to me yesterday.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And so, um, Mike Shire in his thesis um, did a a series of experiments, um, training LDA filters'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Is is that right?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Or for these long analysis windows, I guess, is the right way to put it.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'I guess, the the the issue I was the general issue I was bringing up was that'",
        "'speaker_D': 'if you're have a moving'",
        "'speaker_D': 'moving window, uh, a wa a a set of weights'",
        "'speaker_D': 'times things that, uh, move along, shift along in time,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'that you have in fact a linear time invariant filter.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And you just happened to have picked a particular one by setting all the weights to be equal.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And so the issue is what are some other filters that you could use,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'uh, in that sense of filter\"?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And, um,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'as I was saying, I think the simplest thing to do is not to train anything, but just to do some sort of, uh,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'uh, hamming or Hanning, uh, kind of window, kind of thing, just sort of to de emphasize the jarring.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So I think that would sort of be the first thing to do.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'But then, yeah, the LDA'",
        "'speaker_D': 'i uh, is interesting because it would sort of say well, suppose you actually trained this up to do the best you could by some criterion, what would the filter look like then?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Uh huh.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Uh, and, um,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'that's sort of what we're doing in this Aur Aurora stuff.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And, uh, it's still not clear to me in the long run whether the best thing to do would be to do that or to have some stylized version of the filter that looks like these things you've trained up, because you always have the problem that it's trained up for one condition and it isn't quite right for another.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'uh that's that's why'",
        "'speaker_D': 'that's why RASTA filter has actually ended up'",
        "'speaker_D': 'lasting a long time, people still using it quite a bit, because'",
        "'speaker_D': 'y you don't change it.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So here here I mean, I found that it's if I changed the noise estimate I could get an improvement.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So that's so it's something which I can actually pursue, is the noise estimate.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Yeah, I think what you do is in when when you have the the this multi condition training mode,'",

        "'speaker_G': 'But it was'",
        "'speaker_G': 'So, u u it it seems to be the best what wh wh what what we can do in this moment is multi condition training.'",

        "'speaker_G': 'introducing some some noise reduction technique we we introduce also somehow artificial distortions.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'And these artificial distortions uh, I have the feeling that they are the reason why'",
        "'speaker_G': 'why we have the problems in this multi condition training.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'That means theHM we trained, they are they are based on Gaussians,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'and on modeling Gaussians.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'And if you Can I move a little bit with this?'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'And if we introduce now this this u spectral subtraction, or Wiener filtering stuff'",
        "'speaker_G': 'So, usually what you have is maybe, um I'm I'm'",
        "'speaker_G': 'showing now an envelope'",
        "'speaker_G': 'um maybe you'll f for this time.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'So usually you have maybe in clean condition you have something'",
        "'speaker_G': 'which looks like this.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'And if it is noisy it is somewhere here.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'And then you try to subtract it or Wiener filter or whatever.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'And what you get is you have always these problems, that you have this'",
        "'speaker_G': 'these these these zeros'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'in there.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'And you have to do something if you get these negative values.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'I mean, this is your noise estimate and you somehow subtract it'",
        "'speaker_G': 'or do whatever.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Uh, and then you have'",
        "'speaker_G': 'And then I think what you do is you introduce some some artificial distribution'",
        "'speaker_G': 'in this'",
        "'speaker_G': 'uh in in the models.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'I mean, i you you train it also this way but, i somehow there is u u there is no longer a a Gaussian distribution.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'It is somehow a strange distribution which we introduce with these artificial distortions.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'And and I was thinking that that might be the reason why you get these problems in the especially in the multi condition'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'training mode.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Th That's true.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah the c the models are not complex enough to absorb that additional variability that you're introducing.'",
        "'speaker_G': 's'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Thanks Adam.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Well, that's'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So'",
        "'speaker_E': 'I also have the feeling that'",
        "'speaker_E': 'um, the reason ye why it doesn't work is yeah, that the models are much'",
        "'speaker_E': 'are t um, not complex enough.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Because I actually I als always had a good experience with spectral subtraction,'",
        "'speaker_E': 'just a straight spectral subtraction algorithm when I was using neural networks,'",
        "'speaker_E': 'big neural networks, which maybe are more'",

        "'speaker_G': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'But'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Then I tried the same exactly the same spectral subtraction algorithm on these Aurora tasks and it simply doesn't work.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Hmm.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'It's even'",
        "'speaker_E': 'it, uh, hurts even.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'We probably should at some point here try the tandem the the the system two kind of stuff with this, with the spectral subtraction for that reason.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Hmm.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Cuz again, it should do a transformation to a domain where it maybe'",

        "'speaker_B': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'um noisy situation.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Mm hmm.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'So'",
        "'speaker_E': 'If we look at the France Telecom proposal, they'",

        "'speaker_D': 'Hmm.'",

        "'speaker_E': 'They have some kind of mean and variance,'",
