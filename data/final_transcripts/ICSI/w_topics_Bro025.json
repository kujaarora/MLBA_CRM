        "'speaker_B': 'of of, uh, what things will be attacked.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'But I would I would I would thought think that what we would wanna do is not futz with this stuff for a while because what'll happen is we'll change many other things in the system,'",

        "'speaker_E': 'Mmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Well, depending on its size Well, one question is, is it on the, um, server side or is it on the terminal side?'",

        "'speaker_A': 'Mm hmm.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'We do still, however, have to consider its latency.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So the issue is is, um,'",

        "'speaker_A': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Um, what we've done in uh in the past is to use the neural net, uh, to transform,'",

        "'speaker_B': 'So this is done early on.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'This is essentially,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'um, um I guess it's it's more or less like a spee a speech enhancement technique here right?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'where we're just kind of creating new if not new speech at least new new FFT's that that have you know, which could be turned into speech'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'uh, that that have some of the noise removed.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Um, after that we still do a mess of other things to to produce a bunch of features.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And then those features are not now currently transformed'",
        "'speaker_B': 'by the neural net.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And then the the way that we had it in our proposal two before, we had the neural net transformed features and we had the untransformed features, which I guess you you actually did linearly transform with the KLT, but but but uh, to orthogonalize them but'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'but they were not, uh, processed through a neural net.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And Stephane's idea with that, as I recall, was that'",
        "'speaker_B': 'you'd have one part of the feature vector that was very discriminant and another part that wasn't,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'uh, which would smooth things a bit for those occasions when, uh, the testing set was quite different than what you'd trained your discriminant features for.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So, um, all of that is is, uh still seems like a good idea.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'The thing is now we know some other constraints.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'We can't have unlimited amounts of latency.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Uh, y you know, that's still being debated by the by people in Europe but,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'uh, no matter how they end up there, it's not going to be unlimited amounts, so we have to be a little conscious of that.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Um.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So there's the neural net issue.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'There's the VAD issue.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And, uh, there's the second stream'",
        "'speaker_B': 'thing.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Well,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'better ones are good.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'And so the w the default, uh,'",

        "'speaker_A': 'they're OK, but they're not all that great?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I guess they still allow two hundred milliseconds on either side or some?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Is that what the deal is?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Uh, so th um, they keep two hundred milliseconds at the beginning and end of speech.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And they keep all the Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Cuz I cuz it certainly always helped us before.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Uh.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'What amount of latency are you thinking about when you say that?'",

        "'speaker_A': 'Hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Um.'",

        "'speaker_A': 'Were you thinking of the two fifty or the one thirty when you said we should have enough for the neural net?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Well, it just it when we find that out it might change exactly how we do it, is all.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I mean, how much effort do we put into making it causal?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Oh, OK.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I mean, I think the neural net will probably do better if it looks at a little bit of the future.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'But, um, it will probably work to some extent to look only at the past.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'And, you know, how how much time should we put into'",
        "'speaker_B': 'into that?'",

        "'speaker_A': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Um.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'But I think, you know, at this point our major concern is making the performance better and and, um,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'if, uh, something has to take a little longer in latency in order to do it that's'",
        "'speaker_B': 'you know, a secondary issue.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'But if we get told otherwise then, you know, we may have to c clamp down a bit more.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Oh, oh.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So that's fixed in this.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'So,'",

        "'speaker_B': 'What about this?'",
