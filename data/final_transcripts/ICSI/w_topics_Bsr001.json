        "'speaker_B': 'Is that the channel limitation cutting in?'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Right.'",

        "'speaker_E': 'you know, we have these regular Wednesday lunches and you gotta plan a menu, right?'",

        "'speaker_F': 'Wizard of Oz.'",

        "'speaker_A': 'Uh, what's'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So basically, what wh people will see a spreadsheet and they can ask it to move numbers around.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So'",
        "'speaker_E': 'we thought that would be a be a useful kind of task for budget meetings or that kind of thing.'",

        "'speaker_E': 'So starting off we would start off definitely with a Wizard of Oz task but it would be something'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Oh, OK.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So a real computer but a w uh, someone driving it.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Uh yes, but it would be something uh but everything would be an agent.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'OK, OK, OK.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Mmm.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Uh huh.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And so it just be you know, we wouldn't have the recognition grammar to begin with.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'We wouldn't have the NL grammar to begin with.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Mmm.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'It's just a matter of of work.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So somebody will be playing the recognizer and then other agents will be doing their task independently.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So, sort of Right.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Something that can be built up, you know, relatively quickly and makes sense how to do.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So a fairly simple back end.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Um.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Good.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah, I I think that's close enough to what we're interested in that it would t it'd be useful for training'",
        "'speaker_H': 'Oh, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_H': 'Yeah, sure.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'uh, the acoustic models, without any question.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Uh huh.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Yeah, definitely.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'You p you plan to to train actually models based on this data.'",

        "'speaker_F': 'Oh, absolutely.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Great.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah, cuz if you don't the the accuracy's gonna be horrendously bad.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Or, I mean is the intention to do some som Right.'",
        "'speaker_H': 'I think No, I think the idea is to train on the, uh on these mikes but use these to get the alignments that we're gonna train to,'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Well, we'll definitely need to do both.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Understood.'",

        "'speaker_H': 'I don't know.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'It it really i'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Cuz that's actually my interest at the moment, so.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'It will really depend on if we have someone who really wants to do that.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Right, right.'",
        "'speaker_H': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_F': 'I'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_H': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_H': 'We may end up having to do that.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Well it's just as an example, I I've done some very simple digits recognitions where, uh, I said if I had known we were having this meeting I would have done this before, uh.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Having people read digit strings cuz digits are much easier.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'That was Morgan.'",

        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_H': 'Uh huh.'",

        "'speaker_F': 'just doing multi stream on the different mikes helped enormously.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah, so you so you'",

        "'speaker_B': 'So you're having'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Wh why?'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Why?'",
        "'speaker_F': 'I have no idea.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Because they're a little different.'",

        "'speaker_H': 'Hang on.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Right, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Absolute.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So that, uh, I think just just having stereo will help cuz they're a little different.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Hmm.'",

        "'speaker_F': 'I see.'",

        "'speaker_E': 'So, yeah, that's that's the way we've been approaching it.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Mmm.'",
