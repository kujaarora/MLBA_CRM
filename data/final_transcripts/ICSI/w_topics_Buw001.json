        "'speaker_B': 'Well, then you can go to the points where the you could actually go to those points in time and find out what they were talking about.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Well, what it does'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And you r'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_A': 'I don't think it gets at the'",
        "'speaker_A': 'the queries per se, but it does give us an information fusion sort of thing that, you know, you wanna i say'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'what were the hot points of the meeting?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'That that's what I mean, is that I think it gets at something interesting but if we were asking the question, which I thought we were, of of of, um, how do we figure out what's the nature of the queries that people are gonna want to ask of such a system?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'knowing what's important doesn't tell you what people are going to be asking.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'But I bet it's a good superset of it.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Does it?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Well, see, there are th'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Well, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I think you could say they're gonna ask about,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'uh, when uh, when did'",

        "'speaker_H': 'Mm hmm.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Um.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'i We we have five hours of pilot data of the other stuff but we have zero hours of of of queries.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'where do I start?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'w Well, th you could do I think the summaries actually may help get us there, for a couple reasons.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'One, if you have a summary if you have a bunch of summaries,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'you can do'",

        "'speaker_A': 'what questions might you want to ask about it to go back?'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Yeah, I think that's difficult because then they're not gonna ask the questions that are in the summary.'",

        "'speaker_A': 'That's one possi one possible scenario, though, is you have the summary,'",

        "'speaker_G': 'th Yeah, I think it has to be a participant.'",

        "'speaker_G': 'OK.'",

        "'speaker_G': 'But, uh,'",
        "'speaker_G': 'I guess if you had a meeting participant, they could use the summary to refresh themselves about the meeting and then make up queries.'",

        "'speaker_G': 'I don't know how to do it if until you have a system.'",

        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'But th there is this, um There is this class of queries, which are the things that you didn't realize were important at the time but some in retrospect you think oh, hang on, didn't we talk about that?'",

        "'speaker_G': 'Mm hmm.'",

        "'speaker_G': 'Right.'",

        "'speaker_G': 'Well, I think that's a little bit of a problem.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'It's it's not ideal, but we you know, we we have to get started someplace.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So I was I was just thinking about,'",

        "'speaker_D': 'I'd have to get started someplace.'",

        "'speaker_G': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I think it serves two purpo purposes.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Oh, OK.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Of how to how to generate queries from a'",

        "'speaker_G': 'I, uh'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'from the summary.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'That was sort of what my question was'",

        "'speaker_A': 'Hmm.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'aimed towards.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'There's no way that can happen.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Are we gonna later go over it and, like, make up some stuff to which these notes would be an answer, or or a deeper Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Or or just a memory refresher.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I mean'",
        "'speaker_B': 'But that's done off they have to do that off line.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Yep.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'I agree.'",

        "'speaker_H': 'thing you got out of this meeting?'",

        "'speaker_B': 'That's a good one.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'I would think that would be the most likely thing.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Dan doesn't know what sex he is.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah, really.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'But actually I would say that's a better thing'",
        "'speaker_A': 'to ask than have them summarize the meeting.'",
        "'speaker_H': 'I think you get two different types of information.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'You get two Yeah, that's true.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_H': 'Because you get, like, the general structure of important points and what the what the meeting was about.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Hey.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Ah'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'We're still here.'",
        "'speaker_H': 'So you get the general structure, the important points of what the meeting was about with the summary.'",
        "'speaker_H': 'But with the what's the most interesting thing you learned?'",
        "'speaker_H': 'Uh, so the fact that, uh, I know that Transcriber uses Snack is something that I thought was interesting and that and that Dan worked on on that.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Going to see the kids.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'You you can keep it on.'",
        "'speaker_H': 'So I thought that was really you know.'",
        "'speaker_H': 'So, I mean, you could ge pick up some of the micro items that wouldn't even occur as major headings but could be very informative.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah, that's actually a really good idea.'",
        "'speaker_H': 'I think it wouldn't be too, uh, uh, cost intensive either.'",
        "'speaker_H': 'You know, I mean, it's like something someone can do pretty easily on the spur of the moment.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Are you thinking about just asking one participant or all of them?'",
        "'speaker_G': 'As many are willing to do it.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Make it a voluntary thing, and then'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Cuz you'll get cuz you'll get very different answers from everybody, right?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So'",
        "'speaker_C': 'That's why I was wondering.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Well, maybe one thing we could do is for the meetings we've already done'",
        "'speaker_G': 'I mean, I we didn't take minutes and we don't have summaries.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'But, uh, people could, like, listen to them a little bit and generate some queries.'",
        "'speaker_H': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Of course Jane doesn't need to.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'I'm sure you have that meeting memorized by now.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'But actually it would be an easy thing to just go around the room and say what was the most interesting thing you learned,'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Mmm.'",
        "'speaker_H': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_H': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'for those pe people willing to stay.'",
        "'speaker_H': 'And that I think it would pick up the micro structure, the'",
        "'speaker_H': 'some some of the little things that would be hidden.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'And and that might be something people are willing to stay for.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Boy, I I don't know how we get at this'",
        "'speaker_H': 'That would be interesting.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Or want to get up and leave.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah, but when you go around the room you might just get the effect that somebody says something and then you go around the room and they say yeah, me too, I agree.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Me too, me too, me too.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'On the other hand people might try and come up with different ones, right?'",

        "'speaker_G': 'We'll I mean, we'll we'll be telling them that the reason we're trying to do this is'",
        "'speaker_G': 'is to d generate queries in the future, so try to pick things that other people didn't say.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'I mean,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'It seemed'",
        "'speaker_D': 'The kind of, uh, interest that I had in this thing initially was, uh, that i'",

        "'speaker_D': 'and you want to pick up something from this meeting related to the something else.'",
