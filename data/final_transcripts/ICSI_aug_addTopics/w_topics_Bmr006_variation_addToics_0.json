        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah, shoot!'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Right?'",

        "'speaker_E': 'being able to,'",
        "'speaker_E': 'uh Well, it just seems like to track track from one utterance to the next utterance who's speaking and who's speaking to whom, cuz that can be important.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'S i You know, You raised the point, So so\", it's be kind of nice to'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Shoot!'",
        "'speaker_E': 'be able to know who you\" was.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I I'm thinking too much.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And ac and actually you remember furthermore, you remember last time we had this discussion of how you know, I was sort of avoiding mentioning people's names,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah, I was too.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'and and it was and we made the decision that was kind of artificial.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Well, I mean, if we're going to step in after the fact and change people's names in the transcript, we've basically done something one step worse.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yep.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Well, I would sug I I don't wanna change the names in the transcript, but that's because I'm focused so much on the acoustics instead of on the discourse, and so I think that's a really good point.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Misleading.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'You're right, this is going to require more thought.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'L let me just back up this to make a a brief comment about the, uh, what we're covering in the meeting.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Uh I realize when you're doing this that uh I mean, I didn't realize that you had a bunch of things that you wanted to talk about.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Uh, and so, uh'",
        "'speaker_D': 'and so I was proceeding some somewhat at random, frankly.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So I think what would be helpful would be uh, i and I'll I'll mention this to to Liz and Andreas too,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'that um, before the meeting if anybody could send me, any any, uh, uh, agenda items that they were interested in'",

        "'speaker_D': 'I mean, I'm just always asking Jose what he's doing, you know, and and so it's There's uh, there's obviously other things going on.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'I just I just couldn't do it in two minutes.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'How will we how would the person who's doing the transcript'",
        "'speaker_B': 'even know who they're talking about?'",

        "'speaker_E': 'How do you mean?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I mean, so if I'm saying in a meeting, oh and Bob, by the way, wanted wanted to do so so\",'",
        "'speaker_A': 'They're just gonna write Bob\" on it or do'",
        "'speaker_B': 'if you're doing'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah, just gonna write Bob\".'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And so.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'They won't be able to change it themselves.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'If you're if you're doing discourse analysis,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'What ar how are they gonna do any of this?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Well, I I'm betting we're gonna have huge chunks that are just totally un untranscribable by them.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah, really.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'I mean, they're gonna say speaker one, or speaker two or speaker I mean I I'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Well, the current one they don't do speaker identity.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah, I think'",
        "'speaker_A': 'They can't do that.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'because inNaturallySpeaking, or, excuse me, inViaVoice, it's only one person.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'and so in their current conventions there are no multiple speaker conventions.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So it may just be one long transcript of a bunch of words.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Oh.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yep.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'I think that My understanding from Yen'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Is it Yen Ching?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Is that how you pronounce her name?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Uh Yu Ching, Yu Ching.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Oh, uh Yu Ching?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yu Ching?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'y Yu Ching.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'was that um, they will that they will adopt the part of the conventions that that we discussed, where they put speaker identifier down.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'But, you know, h they won't know these people, so I think it's Well, they'll they'll adopt some convention but we haven't specified to them So they'll do something like speaker one, speaker two, is what I bet, but I'm betting there'll be huge variations in the accuracy of of their labeling the speakers.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'We'll have to review the transcripts in any case.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And it and it may very well be I mean, since they're not going to sit there and and and worry ab about, uh, it being the same speaker,'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'they may very well go the eh the the first se the first time it changes to another speaker, that'll be speaker two.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And the next time it'll be speaker three even if it's actually speaker one.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'You know Uh huh.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'You know, that would be a very practical solution on their part.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And and but then we would need to label it.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'It's a good idea.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And that's OK.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah we we can probably regenerate it pretty easily from the close talking mikes.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah, I think'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yes, I was thinking, the temp the time values of when it changes.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'But I mean that doesn't'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'But that'",
        "'speaker_E': 'That'd be very efficient.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'This doesn't answer the the question.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'The p It's a good point, which what do you do for discourse tracking?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Because y y you don't know to know, eh you don't need to know what i what is the iden identification of the of the speakers.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Hmm.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'You only'",
        "'speaker_C': 'eh want to know'",
        "'speaker_B': 'For for acoustics you don't but for discourse you do.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Well, you do.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Ah, for discourse, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'If if if if someone says, uh, what what is Jose doing?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'and then Jose says something, you need to know that that was Jose responding.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah, yeah, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah,'",

        "'speaker_D': 'Uh, so.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Ugh,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'that's a problem.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Unless we adopt a different set of norms which is to not id to make a point of not identifying people by name, which then leads you to be more contextually ex explicit.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'That would be hard.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Well, people are very flexible.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'You know?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'I mean, so when we did this las last week, I felt that you know, now, Andreas may, uh,'",
        "'speaker_E': 'uh, he he i sometimes people think of something else at the same time and they miss a sentence or something, and and because he missed something, then he missed the r the initial introduction of who we were talking about, and was was unable to do the tracking.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'But I felt like most of us were doing the tracking and knew who we were talking about and we just weren't mentioning the name.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So, people are really flexible.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'But, you know, like, at the beginning of this meeting Or, you I think said, you know, or s Liz, said something about um,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'uh, is Mari gonna use the equipment?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I mean, how would you say that?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I mean, you have to really think,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'if you wanted to anonymize.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'you know, about what you're saying bef'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'Use the'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I think it would be really hard if we made a policy where we didn't say names,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah, darn!'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I mean, what I was gonna say is that the other option is that we could bleep out the names.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah, is'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Well, it'",
        "'speaker_A': 'plus we'd have to tell everybody else.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_A': 'Right.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'That's that's the issue.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I I think the I think I don't know, my own two cents worth is that you don't do anything about what's in'",
        "'speaker_A': 'the recordings,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'you only anonymize'",
        "'speaker_A': 'to the extent you can, the speakers have signed the forms and all.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Well, but that but that as I said, that that that works great for the acoustics, but it it hurts you a lot for trying to do discourse.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Well.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_A': 'Why?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Because you don't have a map of who's talking versus their name that they're being referred to.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Bec'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I thought we were gonna get it labelled speaker one, speaker two'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Sure but, h then you have to know that Jose is speaker one and'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Why do you have to know his name?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'OK, so suppose someone says, well I don't know if I really heard what uh, what Jose said.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And then, Jose responds.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And part of your learning about the dialogue is Jose responding to it.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'But it doesn't say Jose\", it says speaker five\".'",
        "'speaker_A': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So uh u'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Oh, I see, you wanna associated the word Jose\" in the dialogue with'",
        "'speaker_A': 'the fact that then he responded.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And so, if we pass out the data to someone else,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Someone who's doing discourse would wanna do that.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'and it says speaker five\" there, we also have to pass them this little guide that says that speaker five is Jose, and if were gonna do that we might as well give them Jose\" say it was Jose\".'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And that violates our privacy.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And within that, it may be that it's sufficient to not uh change the to not incorporate anonymization yet, but always, always in the publications we have to.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And I think also, when we take it that next step and distribute it to the world, we have to.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Making some decisions?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'i i it You know, it may be s that we we'll need to do something like actuallyX out that part of the um'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'For the public one.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'the audio, and just put in brackets speaker one\".'",
        "'speaker_C': 'the?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'You know.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'You know, what we could do also is have more than one version of release.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'One that's public and one one that requires licensing.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And so the licensed one would w we could it would be a sticky limitation.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Uh huh.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'You know, like'",
        "'speaker_E': 'I think that's risky.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Well, we can talk about that later.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'I think that the public should be the same.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'I think that when we do that world release, it should be the same.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'I I agree.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'I I agree with Jane.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'For a bunch of reasons, legal.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'I I think that we we have a need to have a consistent licensing policy of some sort,'",
        "'speaker_E': 'But I also think a consistent licensing policy is important.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'and'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Well, one thing to to take into consideration is'",
        "'speaker_A': 'w are there any'",
        "'speaker_A': 'um For example, the people who are funding this work,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'they want this work to get out and be useful for discourse.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'If we all of a sudden do this and then release it to the public and it's not longer useful for discourse,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'you know'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Well, depending on how much editing we do, you might be able to still have it useful.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'because for discourse you don't need the audio.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Right?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So you could bleep out the names in the audio.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'and use the anonymized one through the transcript.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Excuse me.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Uh.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'But if you release both'",
        "'speaker_E': 'We we do need audio for discourse.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'But, n excuse me, but you could bleep out just the names.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'She'",
        "'speaker_D': 'No, but she's saying, from the argument before, she wants to be able to say if someone said Jose\" in their in their thing, and then connect to so to what he said later, then you need it.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'But in the transcript, you could say, everywhere they said Jose\"'",
        "'speaker_B': 'that you could replace it with speaker seven\".'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Oh I see.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'But I I also wanna say that people'",
        "'speaker_D': 'I see.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And then it wouldn't meet match the audio anymore.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Uh huh.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'But it would be still useful for the'",
        "'speaker_A': 'But if both of those are publically available'",

        "'speaker_E': 'Well, you see?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So, it's complicated.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'what she might say is that she wants to look if things that cut across between the audio and the dialogue, and so,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'uh,'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'how.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'I think that this can't be decided today.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah, OK, good point.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'But it's g but I think it was good to introduce the thing and we can'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I didn't think when I wrote you that email I wasn't thinking it was a big can of worms, but I guess it is.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'do it next time.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah, a lot of these things are.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Discourse.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Well it Discourse, you know Also I wanted to make the point that that discourse is gonna be more than just looking at a transcript.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah, ab absolutely.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'It's gonna be looking at a t You know, and prosod prosodic stuff is involved, and that means you're going to be listening to the audio, and then you come directly into this confronting this problem.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Oh, yeah, sure.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Maybe we should just not allow anybody to do research on discourse,'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'and then, we wouldn't have to worry about it.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah, we should just market it to non English speaking countries.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Uh, maybe we should only have meetings between people who don't know one another and who are also amnesiacs who don't know their own name.'",
