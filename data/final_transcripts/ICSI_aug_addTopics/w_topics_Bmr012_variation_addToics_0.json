        "'speaker_C': 'uh reasonable to actually run recognition and be like within the scope of'",
        "'speaker_C': 'of r reasonable s you know Switchboard this is like h about how well we do on Switchboard two data with the Switchboard one trained mostly trained recognizer and Switchboard two is got sort of a different population of speakers and a different topic and they're talking about things in the news that happened after Switchboard one so there was so that's great.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Excellent.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah so we're in better shape than we were say when we did had the ninety three workshop and we were all getting like seventy percent error on Switchboard.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Um'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Oh yeah I mean this is really, and thanks to Andreas who, I mean this is a eh um'",
        "'speaker_B': 'you know'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'you the first run I ran of Switchboard I got a hundred twenty percent word error but'",
        "'speaker_C': 'yeah'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So and what al also this means is that um I mean there's a bunch of things in this note to various people especially I guess'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Right.'",

        "'speaker_A': 'Well it's'",
        "'speaker_E': 'News.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'um with Jane that that would help for since we have this new data now uh in order to go from the transcripts more easily to'",
        "'speaker_C': 'um just the words that the recognizer would use for scoring.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I had to deal with some of it by hand but I think a lot of it'",
        "'speaker_C': 'can be automated'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Oh one thing I guess I didn't get so you know the language model was straight from from bigram from Switchboard the acoustic models were also from Switchboard or or'",

        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_A': 'Well that's those are the only we ones there are, I mean'",
        "'speaker_C': 'so that's the on that's the only acoustic training data that we have a lot of and I guess Ramana, so a guy at SRI said that'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'um there's not a huge amount of difference'",
        "'speaker_C': 'going from it's it's not like we probably lose a huge amount but we won't know because we don't have any full band models for s conversational speech.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'It's probably not as bad as going f using full band models on telephone band speech right?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Oh yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Right, so it's so'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah, but for Broadcast News when we we played around between the two there wasn't a huge'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Right, it was not a big deal.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Like Trent Lott must have been from I guess Switchboard was before uh.'",

        "'speaker_A': 'Um'",
        "'speaker_A': 'By the way just'",
        "'speaker_A': 'for fun we also ran, I mean our complete system starts by doing ge a gender detection'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Good point.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'so just for the heck of it I ran that'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And it said a hundred percent male?'",

        "'speaker_E': 'Oh it did?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah so'",

        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'and that's interesting cuz I think the their language models are quite different so and I I'm pretty sure from listening to Eric that, you know given the words he was saying and given his pronunciation that the reason that he's so much worse is the lapel.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'That makes a lot of sense, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_G': 'Very possible.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah I I I would bet on that too cuz he certainly in that when as a as a burp user he was he was a pretty uh strong one.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Sheep.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah he he he sounded to me just from he sounded like a, what's it a sheep or a goat?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Sounded good.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_G': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'we'll have more data and we can also start to'",

        "'speaker_C': 'So this is only twenty minutes of one meeting with no no'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I mean clearly there are um'",

        "'speaker_A': 'with just a small amount of uh actual'",
        "'speaker_A': 'meeting transcriptions uh thrown into the language model you can probably do quite a bit better because'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Or just dictionary.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'The voca the vocabulary especially yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'the'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah, so.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Not that much the vocabulary actually I think um well we have to see but'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'it's uh'",
        "'speaker_C': 'It's pretty good um'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Have to add PZM and so on but'",
        "'speaker_C': 'so then'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And I have to try it on the far field mike yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'PZM and then there's things like for the transcription I got when someone has a digit in the transcript I don't know if they said, you know one one or eleven and I don't know if they said Tcl or TCL.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'there's things like that where, you know the'",
        "'speaker_C': 'um we'll probably have to ask the transcribers to indicate some of those kinds of things but'",
        "'speaker_C': 'in general it was really good and I'm hoping and this is'",
        "'speaker_C': 'this is good news because that means the force alignments should be good and if the force alignments, I mean it's good news anyway but if the force alignments are good we can get all kinds of information.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'For example about, you know prosodic information and speaker overlaps and so forth directly from the aligned times.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Um so that'll be something that'",
        "'speaker_C': 'actually in order to assess the forced alignment um we need s some linguists or some people to look at it and say are these boundaries in about the right place.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Because it's just gonna give us time marks so.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Well we've done that for one meeting.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'But you know'",
        "'speaker_C': 'For forced alignment.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Uh oh oh f not for words I'm sorry just for overlaps is we did it for not not for words.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Ye right.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So this would be like if you take the words'",
        "'speaker_C': 'um you know and force align them on all the individual close talk uh close talking mikes'",
        "'speaker_C': 'then how good are these sort of in reality and then I was thinking it'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So we might want to take twenty minutes and do a closer word level transcription.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Maybe actually mark the word boundaries.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Oh or i have someone look at the alignments uh maybe a linguist who can say'",
        "'speaker_C': 'um'",
        "'speaker_C': 'you know roughly if these are OK and how far away they are.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Um but I think it's gotta be pretty good because otherwise the word recognition would be really b crummy.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Right, right.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'It wouldn't necessarily be the other way around, if the wor word recognition was crummy the alignment might be OK but if the word recognition is this good the alignment should be pretty good.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So'",
        "'speaker_D': 'I wonder if this is a good thing or a bad thing though, I mean if we're pr yeah if we're producing a database that everybody's gonna do well on'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I r'",
        "'speaker_C': 'that's about it.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'That we're starting so well?'",

        "'speaker_H': 'yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I mean there's still just the w the percentages and, I mean they're not a as we've talked about before there's probably overlaps there's probably overlaps in in uh in fair number in Switchboard as well so but but there's other phenomena, it's a meeting, it's a different thing and there's lots of stuff to learn with the close talking mikes but uh yeah certainly I'd like to see as soon as we could, I mean maybe'",
        "'speaker_C': 'This i yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'This is not that good.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Right.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'work with a little bit'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'No I think it's really, I mean this way we least have a baseline we know that for instance the transcripts are very good so once you can get to the words that the recognizer which is a total subset of the things you need to understand the'",
        "'speaker_B': 'so'",
        "'speaker_C': 'the text'",

        "'speaker_C': 'converting automatically from the XML to the chopping up the wave forms and so forth it's not the case that the end of one'",
        "'speaker_C': 'utterance is in the next segment and things like that which we had more problems with in Switchboard'",
        "'speaker_C': 'so that's good.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And um let's see there was one more thing I wanted to'",
        "'speaker_C': 'to mention I can't remember'",
        "'speaker_C': 'um'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Sorry can't remember.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'anyway it's'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Congratulations is'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah, it's really good.'",

        "'speaker_A': 'U um'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Uh so well I can I can protect my directories through there.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah OK.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Yeah, we had to get them to approve em and then i cuz cuz the other question I was gonna ask is if we're having um you know it's but this this meeting that you have, no problem cuz I I well I mean I I speak for myself but but I think that we didn't do anything that but well anyway so uh I wouldn't be too concerned about it with respect to that although we should clear it with Eric and Dan of course but these results are based on data which haven't had the uh haven't had the chance to be reviewed by the subjects and I don't know how that stands, I mean if you if you get fantastic results and it's'",

        "'speaker_B': 'we get the transcriptions, people approve them and so on it's just that we're'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Alright we need to work at a system for doing that approval so that we can send people the transcripts and get back any bleeps that they want'",
