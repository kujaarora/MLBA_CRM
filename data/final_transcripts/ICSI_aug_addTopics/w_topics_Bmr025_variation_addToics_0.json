        "'speaker_H': 'So it's uh term frequency, inverse document frequency scoring.'",

        "'speaker_A': 'the basically Windows based'",

        "'speaker_A': 'Good.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'So,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'uh'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah, that soun that sounds reasonable.'",

        "'speaker_H': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'uh demo sort of format.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah that sounds good.'",
        "'speaker_H': 'And so I think'",
        "'speaker_F': 'That sounds really neat.'",
        "'speaker_H': 'there'd be minimal effort to get it to work, minimally and then we'd wanna add things like query by speaker and by meeting and all that sort of stuff.'",
        "'speaker_H': 'Um Dave Gelbart expressed some interest in working on that so I'll work with him on it.'",
        "'speaker_H': 'And it it's looking pretty good, you know, the fact that I got the query system working.'",
        "'speaker_H': 'So if we wanna just do a video based one I think that'll be easy.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Mm hmm.'",

        "'speaker_H': 'Windows might be challenging.'",

        "'speaker_H': 'It certainly helps.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Uh huh.'",

        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_H': 'But what those they what those do is provide sort of a BSD compatibility layer, so that the normal UNIX function calls all work.'",

        "'speaker_H': 'Um,'",

        "'speaker_H': 'different header files and th some things are defined and some things aren't'",
        "'speaker_H': 'and uh'",
        "'speaker_H': 'different compiler work arounds and so on.'",
        "'speaker_H': 'So the fact that'",

        "'speaker_H': 'And so my intention was just to base it on that.'",

        "'speaker_E': 'Well my thought was is that it would be nice it would be nice to have the running transcripts'",

        "'speaker_E': 'Right?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Do you have you have, you know, a speaker mark here and a speaker mark here?'",

        "'speaker_E': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Well that eh my thought was if you had like Multitrans or whatever do it.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'uh and part of that was showing off what the speech non uh nonspeech stuff that Thilo has done s'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_A': 'There is an alternative, I mean, it's still, there's uh you know, your point stands about there be needing to be an infrastructure, but it doesn't have to be synchronized with the little clock's timer on it.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'is on some set of meetings, some collection of meetings, maybe EDU is the right one or maybe something else,'",
