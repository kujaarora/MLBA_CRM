        "'speaker_B': 'And in my answer back was are you sure you just want one?'",

        "'speaker_A': 'So the question is where are you gonna hang them?'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'I don't know what the space situation is in the machine room.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So.'",

        "'speaker_A': 'Yep.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'I bet there are still some old, uh, like, nine gig disks, uh,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'around and you can probably consolidate them onto larger disks and and you know recover the space.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yep.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'No.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'But I I know that'",
        "'speaker_A': 'generally their first priority has been for backed up disk.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Basically, we can easily get'",
        "'speaker_B': 'one to four disks, I mean you just go out and get four and we've got the money for it, it's no big deal.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Uh, but the question is where they go, and I don't think we can solve that here, you just have to ask him.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Maybe we can put some disks in the in that back room there.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah really.'",
