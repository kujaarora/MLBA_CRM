        "'speaker_F': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'I see.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I mean'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So you want to cheat?'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'test set.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'We we simply wanna determine what's the difference in performance due to being distant versus close.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Oh, OK.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So, does that mean you turn off speaker normalization when you run it?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Or you just let it do what it would do, an?'",
        "'speaker_F': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'It means No.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'It just means'",
        "'speaker_F': 'you you group together'",
        "'speaker_F': 'the segments that by magic you know belong'",
        "'speaker_F': 'to one speaker, and and treat'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I mean to a lesser extent you had that same magic the other way, too, because you have leakage into other microphones.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Right?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'But, it's just you're using the fact that'",

        "'speaker_F': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Right?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'But, um'",
        "'speaker_C': 'It's just easier to do.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Well, in the new test, actually, that's not true.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Again, if this if these new segmentations work OK,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'then we then it's a fair'",
        "'speaker_F': 'it's a completely fair'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So, how do you determine what you use to group together to be a a?'",
        "'speaker_F': 'test.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'You group together all the data coming in through one channel'",
        "'speaker_F': 'and where Thilo's'",

        "'speaker_F': 'has determined that there is speech.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'And that speech is is deemed to come from that speaker, whether that's true or not.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So if you get some cross talk from another microphone, then you just process this it as if it were from that speaker.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'The only other alternative would be to turn off speaker adaptation in both.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Well, that's more of a problem.'",

        "'speaker_F': 'You can just pretend it's some kind of'",
        "'speaker_F': 'gene I mean you can pretend it's all from one speaker and do all this processing the same, but then you're gonna get results that are worse on account of not doing proper'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'speaker normalization and you're gonna have So, you could certainly do better than that by doing, for instance uh, cluster the segments, which is what we do,'",
        "'speaker_F': 'say, in a Broadcast News system, where you don't have speaker labels.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'But that would be another processing step that'",
        "'speaker_F': 'I'm I would have to debug first, and so forth, and so we wanna avoid that.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So I agree with you.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'We should'",
        "'speaker_F': 'we should, uh, do the'",
        "'speaker_F': 'you know, this sort of cheating experiment.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'OK.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'difference that we'd have to take care of is that, uh yeah, we we don't have a mike that, uh,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'is particular to a person.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And so we'll have to do some clustering, and that'll be another'",
        "'speaker_C': 'another, uh, issue, too.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'But, it it I could be wrong, but it seems to me that that'",
        "'speaker_C': 'the speaker the'",

        "'speaker_C': 'But but, I think that the kind of gains that we've seen from speaker adaptation'",
        "'speaker_C': 'on Hub five sort of things are like a few percent.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'And'",

        "'speaker_C': 'I would doubt that it would be a huge amount of difference for that.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'I think the main thing is to do something to do some cepstral mean subtraction on some level.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'OK.'",

        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah.'",
