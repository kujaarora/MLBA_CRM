        "'speaker_A': 'So'",
        "'speaker_A': 'yeah, then what else did I have?'",

        "'speaker_A': 'um another point'",
        "'speaker_A': 'yeah, and then there's there's another point like going out in Berkeley or what to do in Berkeley or in the neighborhood.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'We discussed it still a couple of weeks or months ago.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Uh, the point is normally it is an ICSI task anyway.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Mm hmm.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'But'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'mmm, I think be, uh, ICSI part, and not network restricted.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Well, th they have uh, a a white booklet, you know, probably'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah, that is from nineteen ninety one or nineteen ninety two, you know.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah, but it's not in the'",
        "'speaker_A': 'This is not on the web.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'A And this is not on the web, and the the the people normally that's was my my, uh'",

        "'speaker_E': 'deep'",
        "'speaker_E': 'outgoing'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah, but the point is that nobody feel responsible for that.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And if it's'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah, but eh but my point is that it should not be under the networking group'",
        "'speaker_C': 'It's a common'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yes, Uh, yes, I see there your point.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'thing.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'eh But'",
        "'speaker_E': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'That's right.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'But if it is under the networking points, the group leader is responsible to get up to date information.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'I believe, we are the group,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'where the people are,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'uh, changing much more faster to join the group and to leave the group as other groups.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And, so, the most problem'",
        "'speaker_D': 'as as of,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'uh, it's likely that uh, the people here in this group needs this information'",
        "'speaker_D': 'um, much more f'",
        "'speaker_E': 'But'",
        "'speaker_D': 'uh, often as as other groups.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'b'",
        "'speaker_E': 'But that could still be applicable if you put it under the ICSI site if you take the responsibility for that.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yes, I see th'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah, I talk to Jane about this.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Uh,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah, but we we can do that.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So I think th I think both arguments are not an ar are arguments against having this under the normal ICSI page.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Or only the networking, uh, page.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'But the problem is, are you allowed to change anything on the'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'general ICSI server?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'No, this is why I have to talk to Jane.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah, that's yeah, that's a'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So you may need just a link from the main ICSI page to the NSA page.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'He has access to theNS pages.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And, um,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'but I think that's an administration problem and that everybody agrees that the information'",
        "'speaker_D': 'page must be'",
        "'speaker_D': 'on the general, on the highest level.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'OK, I have no problem with that.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'But'",

        "'speaker_B': 'your argument is, uh, I think it we have to have the right to change it.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So if there's anything changing in insurances or something something like that,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'that we have access'",
        "'speaker_B': 'to this'",
        "'speaker_B': 'page further on'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'to chan to make any changes.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah, but this is not a problem at all, I I mean, if y you are coming from Germany and you know that there is something changed with the health insurance, then you send Jane an email like Could you please change this, blah blah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah, but it's much more complicated.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah, but that's that's effort.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'That's the whole problem, that nobody wants to do it.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah, OK.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'You know how it you know the process here within the NSA group.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'You know'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And and that was a reason I we finally decided'",
        "'speaker_D': 'here that we put it information on theNS'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I think'",
        "'speaker_D': 'A, couple of months ago ago.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'the best solution is really to put a link on the ICSI page to this'",

        "'speaker_B': 'stuff.'",
