        "'speaker_C': 'the maximum energy.'",

        "'speaker_F': 'So why does that m smooth things out?'",

        "'speaker_F': 'I don't I don't understand that.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Well, there's less difference.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'It's I think,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Right?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'it's whitening'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Cuz it's'",
        "'speaker_C': 'This the portion that are more silent, as you add a white noise that are'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So they have the trajectory are very, very similar.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And and'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So, I mean, again, if you trained in one kind of noise and tested in the same kind of noise, you'd you know, given enough training data you don't do b do badly.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'The reason that we d that we have the problems we have is because'",
        "'speaker_B': 'it's different in training and test.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Even if the general kind is the same, the exact instances are different.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And and so when you whiten it, then it's like you the the only noise to to first order, the only th noise that you have is white noise and you've added the same thing to training and test.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So it's,'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'uh'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So would that'",
        "'speaker_F': 'be similar to, like, doing the smoothing, then, over time or?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Well, it's a kind of smoothing, but'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I think it's I think it's different.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'It's'",
        "'speaker_C': 'it's something that yeah, that affects more or less the silence portions because'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Well, anyway, the sp the portion of speech that ha have high energy are not ch a lot affected by'",

        "'speaker_C': 'And,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'uh'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah, but you're still getting more recognition errors, which means'",
        "'speaker_B': 'that the differences, even though they look like they're not so big,'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Well, the other thing is that you just picked one particular way of doing it.'",
