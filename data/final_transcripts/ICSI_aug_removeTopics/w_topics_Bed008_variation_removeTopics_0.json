        "'speaker_A': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So this is not just a display, this is actually a GUI to'",

        "'speaker_A': 'OK.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Let's'",
        "'speaker_B': 'go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Well, I mean you've written in you've written in what uh seems to be required like what else is is do you want?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'If that's permissible then I'm happy.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Well yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So here's here's what's permissible is that'",
        "'speaker_B': 'you can arrange so that the um'",
        "'speaker_B': 'the value of that'",
        "'speaker_B': 'is gonna have to be updated and n it's not a belief update, right?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'It's you took some actions, you spent money and stuff, so the update of that is gonna have to be essentially external to the belief net.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Right?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And then what you're going to need is uh for the things that it influences.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Well let's first of all let's see if it does influence anything.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And if it does influence anything then you're gonna need something that converts from the the number here to something that's relevant to the decision there.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So it could be ra they create different ranges that are relevant for different decisions or whatever but for the moment this is just'",
        "'speaker_B': 'a node that is conditioned externally'",
        "'speaker_B': 'and might influence'",
        "'speaker_B': 'various things.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Hmm.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah this is where um OK anyways let's forget it.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Well that's fine.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Well anyway, go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'OK, and so this, oh'",
        "'speaker_D': 'The other thing is that um every time that's updated beliefs will have to be propagated but then the question is do you do we wanna propagate beliefs every single time it's updated or only when we need to?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'that'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah, that's a good question.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And uh'",
        "'speaker_B': 'does it have a lazy mode?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I don't remember.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Uh'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Well, I mean, in Srini's thing there was this thing there was this um'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Oh right.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'option like proper inferences which suggests that uh doesn't happen, automatically.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'S probably does.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah someone has to track that down, but I but uh'",
        "'speaker_E': 'I just accidentally'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And and and I think actually uh'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Oops.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'one of the we w items for the uh'",
        "'speaker_B': 'user'",

        "'speaker_D': 'Well'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Oh just uh accidentally erased this, I I just had values here such as uh'",

        "'speaker_E': '\" Is he staying with friends?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'and so forth uh'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'so we're'",
        "'speaker_E': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So'",
        "'speaker_B': 'it's clear where w w w where we are right now.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So my suggestion is we just pick'",
        "'speaker_B': 'uh'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Something down here?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'one, you know one uh particular one of the uh well let's do the first first one let's do the one'",
        "'speaker_B': 'that we sort of already think we did so w that was the of the endpoint?'",

        "'speaker_B': 'No, that's that's a'",

        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'OK.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'You know, you y you go first go the town square'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Well I'",
        "'speaker_A': 'No, I mean, if you go to re you know if you go to Prague or whatever one of your your key points that you have to do is cross the Charles Bridge and doesn't really matter which way you cross'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Anyway'",
        "'speaker_B': 'so let's just leave it three with three for now'",

        "'speaker_B': 'and let's see if we can get it linked up'",
        "'speaker_B': 'just to get ourselves'",
        "'speaker_B': 'started.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'OK, we'",
        "'speaker_B': 'You'll see it you'll see something comes up immediately, that the reason I wanna do this.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'w well the uh user was uh'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'definitely more likely to enter if he's a local more likely to view if he's a tourist'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Right.'",

        "'speaker_E': 'and then of course we had the fact that given the fact that he's thrifty and there will be admission then we get all these cross um'",
        "'speaker_B': 'We did, but the three things w that that it contributed to this'",
        "'speaker_B': 'in fact, the other two aren't up there.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'so one was the ontology'",
        "'speaker_E': 'We'll d what type of building is it?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And the and the third thing we talked about was something from the discourse.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'What he has mentioned before.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'OK, so this is w'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Right, so what w I what we seem to need here, this is why it starts getting into the technical stuff the way we had been designing this, there were three intermediate nodes'",
        "'speaker_A': 'mm hmm'",
        "'speaker_B': 'uh which were the endpoint decision as seen from'",
        "'speaker_B': 'the uh user model as seen from the ontology and as seen from the discourse.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So each of those'",
        "'speaker_B': 'the way we had it designed, now we can change the design, but the design we had was there was a decision with the same three outcomes'",
        "'speaker_A': 'mm hmm'",
        "'speaker_B': 'uh based on the th those three separate considerations'",
        "'speaker_B': 'so if we wanted to do that'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Uh we can load it up it you know very simple.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'would have to put in'",
        "'speaker_A': 'So'",
        "'speaker_B': 'uh'",
        "'speaker_B': 'three'",
        "'speaker_B': 'intermediate nodes'",
        "'speaker_B': 'and then what you and I have to talk about is, OK if we're doing that and they get combined somehow'",
        "'speaker_B': 'uh how do they get combined?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'But the they're they're undoubtedly gonna be more things to worry about.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So this was adjusted for this one mode thing.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Oh yes.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So that's w w in our uh in in Johno's'",
        "'speaker_E': 'sort of pictogram everything that could contribute to'",
        "'speaker_E': 'whether a person wants to enter, view, or approach something.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Oh, it was called mode, so this this is'",
        "'speaker_B': 'm mode'",
        "'speaker_B': 'here means the same as endpoint.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Is now this endpoint.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'OK, why don't we ch can we change that?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'We can just rename that, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Alright.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'You know, but that was actually, yeah unfortunately'",
        "'speaker_B': 'that was a um'",
        "'speaker_B': 'kind of an intermediate versio that's I don't think what we would currently do.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Can I ask about slurred\" and angry\" as inputs to this?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'That's a'",
        "'speaker_A': 'What why?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Like they're either true or false and'",
        "'speaker_E': 'The prosody?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'they uh'",
        "'speaker_D': 'oh I see.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'If the if the person talking is angry or slurs their speech they might be tired or, you know'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Drunk.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Therefore'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And, you know, possibly uh'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Less likely to enter.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'some, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'uh I was thinking less likely to view'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'But that's that seems to, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So so my advice to do is is'",
        "'speaker_B': 'get this down to what we think is actually likely to to be a a strong influence.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'But yeah, that was what he had in mind.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So let's think about this this question of'",
        "'speaker_B': 'how do we wanna handle'",
        "'speaker_B': 'so there're two separate things.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'One is'",
        "'speaker_B': 'uh at least two.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'One is how do we want to handle the notion of the ontology'",
        "'speaker_B': 'now what we talked about, and this is another technical thing Bhaskara, is'",
        "'speaker_B': 'uh can we arrange so that'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I think we can so that the belief net itself has properties'",
        "'speaker_B': 'and the properties are filled in uh from on ontology items.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So the let's take the case of the'",
        "'speaker_B': 'uh this endpoint thing, the notion was that if you had a few key properties like is this'",
        "'speaker_B': 'a tourist site, you know some kind of landmark is it a place of business uh is it something you physically could enter'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'OK, et cetera.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So that there'd be certain properties that would fit into the decision node and then again as part of the ou outer controlling conditioning of this thing those would be set, so that some somehow someone would find this word, look it up in the ontology, pull out these properties, put it into the belief net, and then the'",
        "'speaker_B': 'decision would flow.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Now'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Seems to me that we've sort of e em embedded a lot, em'",
        "'speaker_E': 'embedded a lot of these uh things we had'",
        "'speaker_E': 'in there previously in in in some of the other final decisions done here, for example if we would know that this thing is exhibiting something'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'um if it's exhibiting itself it is a landmark, meaning more likely to be viewed'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yep.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'if it is exhibiting pictures or sculptures and stuff like this, then it's more likely to be'",

        "'speaker_B': 'and um'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I think that's good, right?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So what what that says is that we might be able to'",
        "'speaker_B': 'uh'",
        "'speaker_B': 'take'",
        "'speaker_B': 'and'",
        "'speaker_B': 'in particular so so the ones we talked about were'",

        "'speaker_E': 'Accessibility.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'no, accessibility meant'",
        "'speaker_E': 'If it's closed one probably won't enter.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'w could you move those up about halfway.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Uh'",
        "'speaker_B': 'The ones that you th And selling I guess.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So here here's what it looks like to me.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'is that you want an intermediate structure which i uh is essentially the or of uh for this purpose of'",

        "'speaker_B': 'So that it'",

        "'speaker_B': 'that is, for certain purposes, it becomes important but for this kind of purpose'",
        "'speaker_B': 'uh one of these places is quite like the other.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Does that seem right?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So we di if we'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Basic you're basically just merging those for just the sake of endpoint decision?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So if well it may be more than endpoint decisions, so the idea would be'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'that you might wanna merge those three'",
        "'speaker_E': 'These three?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Eh ser s uh selling, fixing, and servicing.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'What ex um and so either those is true f or false?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Uh'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Uh well it it i here's where it gets a little tricky.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Uh from the belief net point of view it is from another point of view of course it's interest it's it's important to know what it's selling or servicing and so forth.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So for this decision'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'it's just uh true or false'",
        "'speaker_B': 'and in th this is a case where the or seems just what you want.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'OK.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'then it's the kind of place that you'",
        "'speaker_B': 'uh'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Um more likely to enter.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'are more likely to enter.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So you just wanna have them all pointing to a'",
        "'speaker_B': 'You could, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'summary thing?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah, so let's do that.'",

        "'speaker_E': 'So are they the is it the kind of object that sells, fixes, or services things?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Well, o open up object type and let's see what its values are.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Oh I just created it, it has none so far.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Oh, well OK first of all it's not objects, we called them entities, right?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And then we have sort of the um'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Let's say I put commercial.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah, I w I was just gonna commercial action inside where people p'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Well couldn't I do let's do commercial'",
        "'speaker_B': 'uh'",
        "'speaker_B': 'landmark'",
        "'speaker_B': 'and'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And where was the'",
        "'speaker_E': 'accessible, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Well'",

        "'speaker_B': 'this is a'",
        "'speaker_C': 'What would a hotel fall under?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I would call that a service, but but I don't know.'",

        "'speaker_E': 'Um things.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So places that service things'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Uh huh.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'sell things'",
        "'speaker_D': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'or fix things and pe places that e exhibit things.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'That also points to entity type I guess.'",

        "'speaker_A': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So'",
        "'speaker_B': 'uh'",
        "'speaker_A': 'I mean it seems like that's much more reliable cuz you could have outdoor places that sell things and'",
        "'speaker_A': 'you know indoor places that do something else and'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah, the problem with it is that it sort of'",
        "'speaker_B': 'putting in a feature just for one decision, now w we may wind up having to do that this i anyway, this i'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Hmm.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'at a mental level that's what we we're gonna have to sort out.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So, you know what does this look like, what are what are uh intermediate things that are worth computing, what are the features we need in order to'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'make all these decisions and what's the best way to organize this'",
        "'speaker_B': 'so that um'",
        "'speaker_B': 'it's clean and and'",
        "'speaker_A': 'OK.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Anyway so let me suggest you do something else.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Uh which is to'",

        "'speaker_C': 'OK, well, not a big deal then.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Let's do it then.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'uh'",
        "'speaker_B': 'so and and we assume that some of these properties would come indirectly through an ontology, but then we had this third idea'",
        "'speaker_B': 'of input from the discourse.'",

        "'speaker_E': 'yeah, yeah'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Well, maybe, I again, I d well, OK, put em in but what we're gonna wanna do is actually uh'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Well is'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Here this was one of my problems we have the user interest is a is a vector of five hundred values, so'",
        "'speaker_E': 'um'",

        "'speaker_E': 'Yea n is that'",

        "'speaker_A': 'Hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'OK.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Alright?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'One is um you could ignore it.'",

        "'speaker_E': 'Uh.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So you could have a k a fit\" node and again that would have to be computed by someone else'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'but uh'",
        "'speaker_B': 'so that uh'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Just as a mental note'",
        "'speaker_E': 'uh'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah, that's all.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And and should we say that this interests eh affects the likelihood of of entering?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I mean, we could.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'stuff, but'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Well, but'",

        "'speaker_D': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Well, that that's we can't do that, so we we're gonna have to'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'but this is a good discussion, we're gonna have to somehow figure out uh some way to encapsulate'",
        "'speaker_B': 'that'",

        "'speaker_B': 'relation to the time to do this to the amount of time the guy has or something like that is is the uh compatibility with his current state, so that's what you'd have to do, you'd have to get it down to something'",

        "'speaker_B': 'It does.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah, but'",

        "'speaker_D': 'No but, it's more than that, like the the more sort of you break it up'",
        "'speaker_D': 'like because if you have everything pointing to one node it's like exponential'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Sh sh yeah,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'S so we'd basically be doing subgrouping?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Subgrouping, basically into mo so basically make it more tree like going backwards?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_E': 'Bhaskara?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'uh CBT's, the other is it can be it presumably can be used for multiple decisions.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So that if you have this idea of the compatibility with the requirements of an action to the state of the user one could well imagine that that was u'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'not only is it sim is it cleaner to compute it separately but it could be that it's used in multiple places.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Anyway th so in general this is the design, this is really design problem.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'OK, you've got a signal, a d set of decisions'",
        "'speaker_B': 'um how do we do this?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'What do I have under user state anyhow cuz I named that already something.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Oh that's tired, fresh, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Maybe should be renamed into physical state.'",

        "'speaker_A': 'Hmm.'",

        "'speaker_A': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Whatever.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Then we can make a user state.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Uh or something, I don't know, but.'",

        "'speaker_C': 'It's hard for me to imagine how everything wouldn't just contribute to user state again.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Or user compatibility.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Oh but'",

        "'speaker_E': 'and also eh have the money to do so if it costs something so if you can afford it'",

        "'speaker_E': 'Viewing usually is cheap'",

        "'speaker_E': 'I don't know.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Well, with the way we're defining it I think yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'W w'",
        "'speaker_B': 'but that eh viewing it without ent yeah view w with our definition of view it's free'",

        "'speaker_E': 'Um'",
        "'speaker_E': 'so this might be'",
        "'speaker_E': 'What next?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Well you tell me, so in terms of the'",
        "'speaker_B': 'uh'",

        "'speaker_E': 'go there or not I think is a good one.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Uh'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Is a very basic one.'",

        "'speaker_E': 'what makes things more likely that'",

        "'speaker_B': 'uh we're gonna want to know'",
        "'speaker_B': 'you know, which constructions indicate'",
        "'speaker_B': 'various of these properties s'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'and so'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I I don't yet know how to do this, I guess we're gonna wind up pulling out'",
        "'speaker_B': 'uh discourse properties like we have object properties and we don't know what they are yet.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So that that the Go there decision will have'",
        "'speaker_B': 'a node from'",
        "'speaker_B': 'uh discourse, and I guess why don't we just stick a discourse thing up there to be'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'But the discourse we don't have it represented at all yet.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_E': 'This be specific for second year?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Um'",

        "'speaker_E': 'Hmm?'",

        "'speaker_B': 'For Go there, probably is true and false, let's say.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'That's what we talked about.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'um'",
        "'speaker_E': 'well, I think um'",
        "'speaker_E': 'we're looking at the the little data that we have, so people say how do I get to'",
        "'speaker_E': 'the castle'",
        "'speaker_E': 'and this usually means they wanna go there.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So this should sort of'",
        "'speaker_E': 'push it'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'in one direction however people also sometimes say how do I get there in order to find out'",
        "'speaker_E': 'how to get there without wanting to go there.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And sometimes um people say where is it'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'because they wanna know where it is but in most cases they probably'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah, but that doesn't change the fact that you're you want these two values.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Oh yeah, true.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So this is sort of some external thing that takes all the discourse stuff and then says here it's either'",
        "'speaker_E': 'yep,'",
        "'speaker_E': 'yay,A, or nay.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'now that kind of'",
        "'speaker_D': 'um what's the word um'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Hmm.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'the that interacts with the uh EVA thing if they just wanna view it then it's fine to go there when it's closed whereas if they want to um'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'so'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Right, so that's that's where it starts getting to be uh uh essentially more interesting, so what uh Bhaskara says which is completely right is if you know that they're only going to view it then'",
        "'speaker_B': 'it doesn't matter whether it's closed or not in terms of'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Mm hmm.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'uh uh you know, whether whether you wanna go there.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'It does matter though if there's like a strike or riot or something.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Absolutely there are other situational things that do matter.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So'",
        "'speaker_D': 'yeah, that's what I said just having one situational node may not be enough because'",
        "'speaker_D': 'this that node by itself wouldn't distinguish'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Well i i it can have di various values.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah, but we eh you you're right it might not be enough.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah, I mean, see I'm'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Well, what'",
        "'speaker_D': 'I'm thinking that any node that begins with Go there\"'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Whoops.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'is either gonna be true or false.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Ah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'I see that could be.'",

        "'speaker_A': 'Go sS node would just be fed by separate ones for'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Could be.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'you know, there's different things, the strikes and the'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Like situation traffic and so on.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'N'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah, the time of day.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So so now the other thing that Bhaskara eh pointed out is what this says is that'",
        "'speaker_B': 'uh there sh should be a link, and this is where things are gonna get very messy from the endpoint'",
        "'speaker_B': 'uh'",
        "'speaker_D': 'I guess the final'",
        "'speaker_B': 'decision maybe the t they're final re and, I guess the very bottom endpoint decision'",
        "'speaker_B': 'uh to the Go there node.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And I don't worry about layout, I mean then we'll go we'll go nuts'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Mmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'but'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Maybe we could um have intermediate node that just the Endpoint and the Go thereS node'",
        "'speaker_D': 'sort of fed into?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Could be, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Because that's what we, I mean that's why this situation comes up.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Well the Go there, actually the Endpoint node could feed feed into the Go thereS'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah, right.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'That's right, so the Endpoint node, make that up t t to the Go there then and again we'll have to do layout at some point, but something like that.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Now it's gonna be important not to have loops by the way.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'I was just gonna'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Uh really important in in the belief worl net world not to have loops uh'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'How long does it take you to to'",
        "'speaker_E': 'compute uh'",
        "'speaker_B': 'No it's much worse than that.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'It things don't converge, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'uh'",
        "'speaker_B': 'it it it it it's not def i it's not well defined if you're there are loops, you just you have to there are all sorts of ways of'",

        "'speaker_B': 'breaking it up so that there isn't'",

        "'speaker_D': 'we all love.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Right.'",

        "'speaker_E': 'OK, these have no parents yet, but I guess that sort of doesn't matter.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Right?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Well, the idea is that you go there, you go comes from something about the user'",
        "'speaker_E': 'I mean this is sort of'",
        "'speaker_E': 'This comes from traffic and so forth, yeah.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'What I was gonna suggest next'",

        "'speaker_A': 'Mm hmm.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'And belief nets have their own beliefs about uh what are good ways to do that.'",

        "'speaker_E': 'completely messy.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Well, here he here's one of the things that that I th'",
        "'speaker_B': 'you sh you no, I don't know how easy it is to do this in the interface'",
        "'speaker_B': 'but you it would be great if you could actually just display'",
        "'speaker_B': 'at a given time'",
        "'speaker_B': 'uh all the things that you pick up, you click on endpoint\", OK and everything else fades and you just see the links that are relevant to that.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'And I does anybody remember the GUI on this?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Uh d I would almost say the other way to do that would be to open u or make'",
        "'speaker_C': 'you knowN many belief nets and then open them'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'every time you wanted to look at a different one vers cuz uh'",
        "'speaker_E': 'It's probably pretty easy do it to do it in HTML, just'",

        "'speaker_E': 'Uh'",
        "'speaker_D': 'HTML?'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah'",
        "'speaker_B': 'the well the b'",

        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'I I let me consi suggest that's a s not a first order consideration, we have two first order considerations which is what are the'",

        "'speaker_C': 'I don't, yeah I just don't think this has been designed to support'",
        "'speaker_C': 'something like that.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'for our purposes.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Um I that seems like a perfectly feasible thing to get into, but'",
        "'speaker_B': 'um'",
        "'speaker_B': 'we have to know what we want first.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'OK, so why don't you tell us a little bit about'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Put it in your, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'I guess this board works fine.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'So as we discussed'",
        "'speaker_D': 'specifying this kind of thing'",

        "'speaker_D': 'a lot of numbers to write down.'",

        "'speaker_D': 'these all'",
        "'speaker_D': 'have values in the same set, right?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'These are all like saying EV orA, right?'",

        "'speaker_D': 'averages, right?'",
