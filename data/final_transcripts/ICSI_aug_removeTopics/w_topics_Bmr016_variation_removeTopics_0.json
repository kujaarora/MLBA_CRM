        "'speaker_D': 'It shouldn't take too long.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Um, so we're pretty much out of digits.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'We've gone once through the set.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Um, so the only thing I have to do'",
        "'speaker_F': 'No there's only ten.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah, that's right.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'so I I just have to go through them and uh'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Well, OK.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'pick out the ones that have problems,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'and either correct them or have them re read.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So we probably have like four or five more forms to be read, to be once through the set.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'I've also extracted out about an hour's worth.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'We have about two hours worth.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'I extracted out about an hour's worth which are the f digits with for which'",
        "'speaker_D': 'whose speaker have speaker forms, have filled out speaker forms.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Not everyone's filled out a speaker form.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So I extracted one for speakers who have speaker forms and for meetings in which the key\" file and the transcript files are parsable.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Some of the early key files, it looks like, were done by hand, and so they're not automatically parsable and I have to go back and fix those.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So what that means is we have about an hour of transcribed digits that we can play with.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Um,'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So you think two you think two hours is the is the total that we have?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Liz'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yep,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'yeah.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'And you think we th uh, I I didn't quite catch all these different things that are not quite right, but you think we'll be able to retrieve the other hour, reasonably?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yes, absolutely.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So it's just a question of a little hand editing of some files and then waiting for more people to turn in their speaker forms.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'I have this web based speaker form, and I sent mail to everyone who hadn't filled out a speaker form, and they're slowly s trickling in.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So the relevance of the speaker form here, s'",
        "'speaker_D': 'It's for labeling the extracted audio files.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Oh, OK.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'By speaker ID and microphone type.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Wasn't like whether they were giving us permission to use their digits or something.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'No, I spoke with Jane about that and we sort of decided that it's probably not an issue that We edit out any of the errors anyway.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Right?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So the there are no errors in the digits, you'll always read the string correctly.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So I can't imagine why anyone would care.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So the other topic with digits is uh,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Liz would like to elicit different prosodics, and so we tried last week with them written out in English.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And it just didn't work at all because no one grouped them together.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So it just sounded like many many more lines instead of anything else.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So in conversations with Liz and uh Jane we decided that if you wrote them out as numbers instead of words it would elicit more phone number, social security number like readings.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'The problem with that is it becomes numbers instead of digits.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'When I look at this, that first line is sixty one, sixty two, eighteen, eighty six, ten.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Um, and so the question is does anyone care?'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Um, I've already spoken with Liz and she feels that,'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'correct me if I'm wrong, that for her, connected numbers is fine, as opposed to connected digits.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Um, I think'",
        "'speaker_D': 'two hours is probably fine for a test set, but it may be a little short if we actually wanna do training and adaptation and all that other stuff.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Um,'",
        "'speaker_F': 'do um'",
        "'speaker_F': 'you want different prosodics, so if you always had the same groupings you wouldn't like that?'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Well, we actually figured out a way to'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah, the the'",
        "'speaker_G': 'the the groupings are randomly generated.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'No but,'",
        "'speaker_F': 'I was asking if that was something you really cared about because if it wasn't,'",
        "'speaker_F': 'it seems to me if you made it really specifically telephone groupings'",
        "'speaker_F': 'that maybe people wouldn't, uh, go and do numbers so much.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'You know if it if it's'",
        "'speaker_G': 'I think they may still do it, um,'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Uh'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Maybe some, but I probably not so much.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'What about putting a hyphen between the numbers in the group?'",
        "'speaker_G': 'And'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Right?'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So if you if if you have uh'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Six dash one, you mean?'",
        "'speaker_F': 'if you go six six six uh dash uh two nine three one.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'I well OK I it might help, I would like to g get away from having only one specific'",
        "'speaker_G': 'grouping.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'That's what I was asking, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Um, so if that's your question,'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'but I mean it seems to me that, at least for us, we can learn to read them as digits if that's what people want.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'I I'm don't think that'd be that hard to read them as single digits.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'I agree.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Um,'",
        "'speaker_G': 'and'",
        "'speaker_G': 'it seems like that might be better for you guys since then you'll have just more digit data,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'and that's always a good thing.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'It's a little bit better for me too because the digits are easier to recognize.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yep.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'They're better trained than the numbers.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So we could just, uh, put in the'",
        "'speaker_D': 'instructions read them as digits\".'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Right, read them as single digits, so sixty one w is read as six one, and if people make a mistake we'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'How aboutO\" versus zero\"?'",
        "'speaker_F': 'I mean, the other thing is we could just bag it because it's it's it's I'm not worrying about it I mean, because we do have digits training data that we have from uh from OGI.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'I'm sorry, digits numbers training that we have from OGI, we've done lots and lots of studies with that.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'And um.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'But it's nice to get it in this room with the acous I mean for'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'No, no, I guess what I'm saying is that to some extent maybe we could just read them have them read how how they read it and it just means that we have to expand our our vocabulary out to stuff that we already have.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'it's'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Just let them read it how they read it.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Well that's fine with me as long as It's just that I didn't want to cause the people who would have been collecting digits the other way'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'to not have the digits.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'So'",
        "'speaker_F': 'We can go back to the other thing later.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'I mean we s we we've'",
        "'speaker_G': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'We can do this for awhile and then go back to digits for awhile, or'",
        "'speaker_F': 'um.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Do yo I mean, do you want do you want this'",
        "'speaker_G': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Do you need training data or adaptation data out of this?'",
        "'speaker_F': 'How much of this do you need?'",
        "'speaker_F': 'with uh the'",
        "'speaker_G': 'It's actually unclear right now.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'I just thought well we're if we're collec collecting digits, and Adam had said we were running out of the TI forms,'",
        "'speaker_G': 'I thought it'd be nice to have them in groups, and probably, all else being equal, it'd be better for me to just have single digits since it's, you know, a recognizer's gonna do better on those anyway,'",
        "'speaker_F': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'um, and it's more predictable.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'So we can know from the transcript what the person said and the transcriber, in general.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'OK, well if you pre'",
        "'speaker_G': 'But if they make mistakes, it's no big deal if the people'",
        "'speaker_G': 'say a hundred instead of one OO\".'",
        "'speaker_G': 'and also w maybe we can just let them choose zero\" versusO\" as they as they like because even the same person c sometimes saysO\" and sometimes says zero\" in different context, and that's sort of interesting.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'So I don't have a'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Specific need cuz if I did I'd probably try to collect it,'",
        "'speaker_G': 'you know, without bothering'",
        "'speaker_G': 'this group, but'",
        "'speaker_G': 'If we can try it'",
        "'speaker_D': 'OK so so I can just add to the instructions to read it as digits not as connected numbers.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Right, and you can give an example like,'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'you know, six sixty one would be read as six one\".'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'And I think people will get it.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And i actually it's no more artificial than what we've been doing with words.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'I'm sure people can adapt to this, read it single.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Right, right.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'It's just easier to read.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'The spaces already bias it toward being separated.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And I know I'm gonna find this easier than words.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Oh yeah, absolutely, cognitively it's much easier.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'OK'",
        "'speaker_G': 'I also had a hard hard time with the words, but then we went back and forth on that.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'OK, so let's give that a try and'",
        "'speaker_D': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And is the spacing alright or do you think there should be more space between digits and groups?'",
        "'speaker_F': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'I mean what do other people think cuz you guys are reading them.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Or is that alright?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'I think that i it's fine.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'I it it to me it looks like you've got the func the idea of grouping and you have the grou the idea of separation and, you know, it's just a matter of u i the instructions, that's all.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Great.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Well let's give it a try.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And I think there are about ten different gouping patterns isn't that right, Liz?'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Let's try it.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Righ right, and you just they're randomly'",
        "'speaker_D': 'That we did.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'generated and randomly assigned to digits.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'I did Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So we have Sorry, I I was just gonna say, so we have in the vicinity of forty hours'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'of of recordings now.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'And you're saying two hours, uh, is digits, so that's roughly the ratio then, something like twenty twenty to one.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yep.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Which I guess makes'",
        "'speaker_F': 'makes sense.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'So if we did another forty hours of recordings then we could get another couple hours of this.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Um, yeah like you say, I think a couple hours for a for a for a test test set's OK.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'It'd be nice to get, you know, more later because we'll we might use use this up, uh, in some sense, but but uh'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah, I also would like to argue for that cuz it it seems to me that, um, there's a real strength in having the same test replicated in a whole bunch of times and adding to that basic test bank.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Hmm?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Cuz then you have, you know, more and more, u chances to get away from random errors.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And I think, um, the other thing too is that right now we have sort of a stratified sample with reference to dialect groups, and it might be there might be an argument to be made for having uh f for replicating all of the digits that we've done, which were done by non native speakers so that we have a core that totally replicates the original data set, which is totally American speakers, and then we have these stratified additional language groups overlapping certain aspects of the database.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'I think that uh trying to duplicate,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'spending too much effort trying to duplicate the existing TI digits probably isn't too worthwhile because the recording situation is so different.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'It's gonna be very hard to be comparable.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Except that if you have the stimuli comparable, then it says something about the the contribution of setting and'",
        "'speaker_F': 'No it's it's not the same.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'A little bit, but the other differences are so major.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'They're such major sources of variance that it's it's it's uh'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah I mean read versus not.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'What's an example of a of m some of the other differences?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Any'",
        "'speaker_E': 'other a difference?'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Well i i individual human glottis'",
        "'speaker_F': 'is going to be different for each one, you know, it's just There's so many things.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'it's it and and enunciation.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Well, and not just that, I mean the uh'",
        "'speaker_D': 'the corpus itself.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'I mean, we're collecting it in a read digit in a particular list, and I'm sure that they're doing'",
        "'speaker_D': 'more specific stuff.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'I mean if I remember correctly it was like postman reading zipcodes and things like that.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'TI digits was?'",
        "'speaker_F': 'I thought I thought it was read.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'I thought so.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Was it read?'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah, I think the reading zipcode stuff you're thinking of would be OGI.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Oh, I may well be.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah, no TI digits was read in th in read in the studio I believe.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'I haven't ever listened to TI digits.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So I don't really know how it compares.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'But it but'",
        "'speaker_D': 'But but regardless it's gonna it's hard to compare cross corpus.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'It it's different people is the is the core thing.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'And they're different circumstances with different recording environment and so forth, so it's it's it's really pretty different.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'OK, fine.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'But I think the idea of using a set thing was just to give you some sort of framework, so that even though you couldn't do exact comparisons, it wouldn't be s valid scientifically at least it'd give you some kind of'",
        "'speaker_F': 'uh frame of reference.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Uh, you know it's not'",
        "'speaker_E': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Hey Liz,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'What what do the groupings represent?'",
        "'speaker_B': 'You said there's like ten different groupings?'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Right, just groupings in terms of'",
        "'speaker_G': 'number of groups in a line, and number of digits in a group, and the pattern of'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'groupings.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Are the patterns like are they based on anything or'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Um,'",
        "'speaker_G': 'I I just roughly looked at what kinds of digit strings are out there, and they're usually grouped into either two, three, or four,'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Oh.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'four digits at a time.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'And they can have,'",
        "'speaker_G': 'I mean, actually, things are getting longer and longer.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'In the old days you probably only had three sequences, and telephone numbers were less, and so forth.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'So, there's between, um'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Well if you look at it, there are between like three and five groups, and each one has between two and'",
        "'speaker_G': 'four groupings and I purposely didn't want them to'",
        "'speaker_G': 'look like they were in any kind of pattern.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Mmm.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'So'",
        "'speaker_D': 'And which group appears is picked randomly, and what the numbers are are picked randomly.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So unlike the previous one, which I d simply replicated TI digits, this is generated randomly.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Mmm, oh, OK.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Oh OK.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'But I think it'd be great i to be able to compare digits, whether it's these digits or TI digits, to speakers, um, and compare that to their spontaneous speech, and then we do need'",
        "'speaker_G': 'you know a fair amount of of digit data because you might be wearing a different microphone and, I mean'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'so it's it's nice to have the digits'",
        "'speaker_G': 'you know, replicated many times.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Especially for speakers that don't talk a lot.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'So'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'um, for adaptation.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'No, I'm serious, so we have a problem with acoustic adaptation, and we're not using the digit data now, but you know'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah all we have for some people is digits.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Oh, you're not.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Not for adaptation, nope.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'v W we're not we were running adaptation only on the data that we ran recognition on and I'd As soon as someone started to read transcript number, that's read speech and I thought well, we're gonna do better on that, that's not fair to use\".'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Oh I see.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Oh yeah that's true, absolutely.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'But, it might be fair to use the data for adaptation, so.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'So those speakers who are very quiet, shy r Right'",
        "'speaker_D': 'That would be interesting to see whether that helps.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Do you think that would help adapting on Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Like Adam?'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Yeah, I have a real problem with that.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Well, it sh I mean it's the same micropho see the nice thing is we have that in the in the same meeting,'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_F': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'and'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Same same acoustics, same microphone, same channel.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'so you don't get'",

        "'speaker_E': 'You mean to start from scratch f in a brand new transcript?'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_A': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'That'd be excellent.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah, that'd be really great.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'As it stands we're still in the phase of sort of, um, cleaning up the existing data getting things, uh, in i m more tight tightly time uh, aligned.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'I also wanna tell um, I also wanted to r raise the issue that OK so, there's this idea we're gonna have this master copy of the transcript, it's gonna be modified by scripts t into these two different functions.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And actually the master Two two or more.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Two or more.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Two or more different functions.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And that the master is gonna be the channelized version.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'So right now we've taken this i initial one, it was a single channel basically the way it was input.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And now, uh, thanks to the advances made in the interface, we can from now on use the channelized part, and, um, any changes that are made get made in the channelized version kind of thing.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'But I wanted to get all the finished all the checks'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah, so that has implications for your script.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So, uh, have those e e the vis the ten hours that have been transcribed already, have those been channelized?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yes, they have.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'And I know I've seen I've seen they've been channelized, but'",
        "'speaker_D': 'All ten hours?'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Except for the missing thirty minutes.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Great.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'have they uh have they been has the time have the time markings been adjusted, uh, p on a per channel'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Uh, for for a total of like twenty m'",
        "'speaker_E': 'f for a total of Let's see, four times'",
        "'speaker_E': 'total of about an'",
        "'speaker_E': 'thirty minutes.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'That's that's been the case.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So,'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And plus the training, whatever you have.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I guess, I mean, I don't know if we should talk about this now, or not, but I'",
        "'speaker_D': 'Well it's just we're'",
        "'speaker_D': 'missing tea.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah, I know.'",
        "'speaker_D': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'No, but I mean my question is like should I wait'",
        "'speaker_C': 'until all of those are processed, and channelized, like the time markings are adjusted before I do all the processing, and we start like branching off'",
        "'speaker_C': 'into the into the our layer of uh'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Well, you know the problem the problem is that some some of the adjustments that they're making are to bring are to combine bins that were time bins which were previously separate.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'transcripts.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And the reason they do that is sometimes there's a word that's cut off.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And so, i i i it's true that it's likely to be adjusted in the way that the words are more complete.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'And,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'so I it's gonna be a more reliable thing and I'm not sure'",
        "'speaker_C': 'No I know I know that adjusting those things are gonna is gonna make it better.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I mean I'm sure about that, but do you have like a time frame when you can expect like all of it to be done, or when you expect them to finish it, or'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Well partly it depends on how um, how e'",
        "'speaker_E': 'effective it will be to apply an algorithm because'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'i this takes time, you know, it takes a couple hours t to do, uh, ten minutes.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah, I don't doubt it.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Um,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'so.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So right now the what you're doing is you're taking the uh, the o original version and you're sort of channelizing yourself, right?'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I'm doing it myself.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I mean i if the time markings aren't different across channels, like the channelized version really doesn't have any more information.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'So, I was just I mean, originally I had done before like the channelized versions were coming out.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Um,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'and so it's a question of like what'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So I I th I think probably the way it'll go is that, you know, when we'",
        "'speaker_B': 'make this first general version and then start working on the script, that script'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'that will be ma you know primarily come from what you've done, um, we'll need to work on a channelized version of those originals.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'And so it should be pretty much identical to what you have t except for the one that they've already tightened the boundaries on.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yep.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Um,'",
        "'speaker_E': 'Yeah, I mean yeah.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'So'",
        "'speaker_B': 'uh, and then probably what will happen is as the transcribers finish tightening more and more, you know, that original version will get updated and then we'll rerun the script and produce better'",
        "'speaker_C': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'uh versions.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'But the I guess the ef'",
        "'speaker_B': 'the effect for you guys, because you're pulling out'",
        "'speaker_B': 'the little wave forms into separate ones, that would mean these boundaries are constantly changing you'd have to constantly re rerun that, so,'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I know.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'But that that's not hard.'",
        "'speaker_E': 'But that Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'maybe'",
        "'speaker_C': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'I I think the harder part is making sure that the transc the transcription'",
        "'speaker_B': 'OK.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'So if you b merge two things, then you know that it's the sum of the transcripts, but if you split inside something, you don't where the word which words moved.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'And that's wh that's where it becomes a little bit'",
        "'speaker_G': 'uh, having to rerun the processing.'",
        "'speaker_B': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'The cutting of the waveforms is'",
        "'speaker_C': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_G': 'pretty trivial.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'I mean as long as it can all be done automatically, I mean, then that's not a concern.'",
        "'speaker_C': 'You know, if I just have to run three scripts to extract it all and let it run on my computer'",
        "'speaker_G': 'Right.'",

        "'speaker_B': 'Yeah.'",
