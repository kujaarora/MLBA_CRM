    "Public Hearing to Consider Approving the Housing and Community Development Needs Statement for the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Annual Plan for Fiscal Year 2016-17.  (Housing 236)": [
        "'speaker_1': 'These funds are to develop viable urban communities, primarily for low and moderate income persons. So as a reminder, these are funds for 80% and below am I. So, for example, a household of four would qualify under 80% at 71,600 or below.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It should provide decent housing, a suitable living environment and economic opportunity. These funds assist approximately 5000 to 7000 individuals every year. There are some requirements for these funds to receive the CDBG funds, we have to submit an annual action plan that details the programs and activities and resources to address our needs that are identified in our five'",
        "'speaker_1': 'year consolidated plan. In addition, there is a priority among the needs of non housing, community development, social services, also known as the public service category. The Social Services and Human Relations Board provides a refined priority statement. This is included as Exhibit one in your pocket.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This year, we decided to do something a little bit different. We did a community needs survey. It was conducted online for a period since October 26, 2015 to November 30th, 2015, and there was a press release and a public notice.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We did really well. We were seeking responses from residents in the community. Usually it's organizations that apply for funds, and we got 62 responses. I believe 56 of those were actually from residents. We ask questions related to HUD and the counties needs categories such as housing, homeless, public services, economic development and public facilities.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The result was a three top needs with housing, public facilities and infrastructure and economic development. So the needs process starts with step one, which is the Socials and Services Human Relations Board hears from the public what those needs are.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That meeting took place on January 7th. They refined their needs statement for the public service category, again included as Exhibit one. Step two is today. I would like for City Council to approve the needs categories that will be included in the notice of funding an RFP that will be released approximately on February 8th.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that's it for my staff presentation. If you have any questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Counsel, do you have any clarifying questions? All right. Well, we do have speakers on this item. So I'm going to go ahead and call the speakers, Doug Biggs and Liz Rella and Allison de Young and James Treasurer Jerry.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Need to get 3 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening, Madam Mayor. Members of the City Council. My name's Doug Biggs, and I'm the president of the Social Service Human Relations Board. The Social Service Human Relations Board advises the City Council on Social Service and Human Relation needs in the city of Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And since 1997, we've been involved in the CDBG process by reviewing and commenting on the public service needs and funding recommendations. And as we have in previous years, this year we met, we looked at some of the analysis that we've done in the years, including the homeless count, the quality of life count.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We held a public hearing of our own to receive input. And out of that we developed a needs statement and that meeting was held on. In January 7th and the needs that we're focusing on for this year. And it's been provided to you as exhibit one of your your package.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The Shrub recommends that funding should be directed to services for families and individuals who are vulnerable and in crisis, including domestic violence survivors, seniors and other groups. Faced with challenges to meet basic needs through programs that provide food and shelter for all residents with particular attention towards programs that address providing shelter to currently unsheltered homelessness.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Funding should also address homeless prevention, including but not limited to short term rental assistance, support, utility assistance and support for those in need of rapid relocation. That's the needs that we're focusing on. And I want to step back and kind of mark where we're at in the evolution of CDBG funds.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Years ago when I started on Shrub, we were funding some amazing programs that were looking at enrichment activities for youth. Girls Ink was doing some marvelous stuff. Boys and Girls Club had some just tremendous programs out looking at how we can improve our community by improving the lives of the youth we're serving.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That funding is gone now. So CDBG funding is eroded to the point that we are now looking at the thinnest of safety net services that we can provide. And I want you to think about what we're saying here for a minute.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We're no longer talking about how we can enrich the lives of our the members of our community. We're talking about how can we save the lives of some of the people who are the most adversely impacted by domestic violence, homelessness and other trauma?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's a huge degradation in the quality of life that we deal with on a daily basis. And those of you that I appreciate, the members of the council who have come out on our council attended meetings around that, you know, that we're in a crisis situation out there, and we're we're we're not moving away from it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's going to get worse and worse. And in the face of that, we're left with less and less CDBG funding. So it's a daunting task we have this year at the very thinnest of safety net that we could look at focused on and supporting for the year.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I wish that that wasn't the case. I really do. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hi. I'm Liz Brown, the.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Executive director of Building Futures. Mayor and Council. I'm happy to be in front of you once again. Building Futures has been a service provider and a recipient of Alameda CDBG funds for at least the last 15 years. We provide homeless domestic violence housing services here in Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And what we do in Alameda is we run the Midway Shelter for women and children.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We operate we are the leaders of the domestic violence task.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Force here in Alameda. We also provide housing services. So some of the services Doug just talked about of homelessness, prevention and rapidly rehousing people. We also run Bessey, Common Core on the base. It's 52 units of housing. So I just want to say the CDBG funding is so pivotal, pivotal to those services that we offer.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It is the core seed of those services. We use these funds to leverage the rest of the money and sometimes it's ten fold how much we give back. So I want to I just want to echo Doug that we are we're filling in the gaps.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We're making the connections. What we do is use this money to bring in county, state and federal money into Alameda so that we can serve. Alameda is so important, especially during this economic time. I also want to reach out that we not only could we not do these services without the CDBG funding, we could not.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Do these all these services without the really huge support of city staff and the.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Community here. They really pitch in and they fill in even more like this is CDBG funds.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Community support is like this. Much more dinners, volunteering.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Donations, just amazing amount of community support.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I just really want to say that all the clients we serve do feel part of Alameda. So thank you very much. I. Good evening. I'm Alison Young, representing Eden Air, the nonprofit organization that operates 211 Alameda County.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'For those of you who don't know 211 is the three digit number, phone number that's free available 24 hours, seven days a week in multiple languages for access to health, housing and human services. From our unique databases of more than 2900 programs and 82,000 housing units countywide, there are two one.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'One is available to everybody. It's most used frequently by the underserved and at risk populations. Last fiscal year, 211 provided nearly 4600 Health, Housing and Human Service referrals to City of Alameda. City of Alameda Calls 2371. Alameda calls, to be precise, and we're on track to exceed those numbers in the current year.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Alameda callers request information about such critical needs as food, utility payments, employment and physical and mental health care. However, as you can see from one of the two handouts we sent, the top need by far as housing. The percentage of calls requesting housing related information has been on the rise since 2014.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'City of Alameda callers are in need of affordable housing, emergency shelter, but also other housing related information that includes rental and deposit assistance, utility assistance, landlord tenant mediation and eviction defense. During the intake process, 211 staff collects information from callers that results in referrals, often over and beyond.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The original need called for. For examples, callers may learn they're potentially eligible for programs such as Cal Fresh, Medi-Cal and General Assistance, which quite literally can enable them to have more money to put toward housing expenses in 9 hours, the only agency in the county that maintains such a large updated database of housing units.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we're also the only agency that calls emergency shelters twice a day, every day for updated availabilities. Two on one takes these housing and other calls 24 seven to help alleviate the burden on city staff. You'll see from the second handout.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We included several calls to sort of illustrate the breadth of the types of calls we get from city of Alameda. And I wanted to close quickly with just one more example. A woman called for assistance with tenants rights, information and counseling because she felt her landlord was trying to evict her.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'He was making it difficult for her to stay in her home by avoiding repair replacement of a malfunctioning leaking water heater. Two on one referred the caller to Echo Housing and Bay Area Legal Aid for Tenants Rights and for building code violations to the city of Alameda Economic Development Division.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we just want to thank you again for your support of two on one Alameda County since its inception in 2007. We very much use these funds to leverage with the other cities, the counties and the private sector.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we're grateful for your support.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you. And then our last speaker on this item, Marjorie Rocha.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Good evening. Mayor and City Council. My name is Marjorie Rocher. I am the executive director of Echo Housing. And Echo Housing provides tenant, landlord and fair housing services to the city of Alameda, and we provide those services for about eight or nine years now.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We provide information, counseling and mediation for such issues as illegal housing discrimination, evictions, repairs, rent increases, security deposits, any type of issue that really has to do with rental housing. We also provide workshops, presentations and trainings on fair housing issues and tenant landlord issues because we believe that an educated public is really important, particularly so tenants and'",
        "'speaker_5': 'landlords will know about.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Their rights and responsibilities.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We appreciate the city's past support and we look forward to future support from the city to provide this these very important services to residents of Alameda. And if you have any questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Or here.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I think it would be valuable given the amount of time we've been spending on the rental issue to get the data that you have. Okay. And have our. Our staff analyze it in light of what we've been discussing, because we we don't keep.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Track of data as a city because we don't have this type of service, it's contracted to you. And our housing authority and I think our staff that's working on the ordinance and you as our contractor, I think I'd like this council to consider giving direction to obtain those data and to.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Look to see if they can inform us on. What are our next steps might be?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Sounds good to me.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So you could forward the data to the.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well they can communicate one staff specific.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Specifically there'll be a communication between staff. I'm sure they'll reach out to you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. Thank you. Debbie Potter, who's sitting right behind you, I think. All right. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. She's our last speaker on this item council comments. Oh, come on. Think there are.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Evening. Mayor Council members my name is James Sajan, the executive director at Legal Assistance for Seniors. I want to come tonight to first thank you for the support you've provided really to legal assistance for seniors over the years.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I wanted to give a brief overview of the services that we provide in the area of our legal practice. We provide services in full representation, including home visits in all of our areas, in the areas of elder abuse, including including removing an abuser from the home when appropriate, almost immediately a guardianship helping seniors gain guardianship of'",
        "'speaker_3': 'minor children to take care of them, remain safe in their home. Public benefits, including Social Security, some health care, and a limited immigration practice. And when I hear a little bit about creating that safety net, I really want to emphasize that our services are really providing basic critical services that are allowing your seniors to remain in their'",
        "'speaker_3': 'home with independence and dignity and without a lot of these services that could jeopardize their ability to remain in their homes. Besides direct legal services, we provide community education to seniors on a variety of topics, including Medicare, elder abuse, guardianship, all of the areas that we practice.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And those are typically out in the senior centers and community senior living facilities. And we also hold the county's health insurance counseling and advocacy program counseling at this point. To this point in the fiscal year, we've counseled almost 200 people in Alameda County regarding their Medicare rights and decisions to be made regarding plans for their care.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I have been in conversation with Claudia Young about that, and she's brought me up to speed about some of the rental issues that are coming up in Alameda. And I would like to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Provide an idea that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'LAS may be part of that conversation moving forward. I'm not sure quite how we fit in in terms of referring or if there's a way that we can leverage the services we provide to help and provide assistance to the city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, we're open to that conversation. Once again, I can't thank you enough for the support you have provided. And I can't emphasize how, despite legal services coming with a certain intonation, how critical these services are for seniors and how they really provide the safety net for seniors to remain in their homes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And if there's any questions, I'd love to answer them.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Also. Doesn't appear to be any, but thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It hit me that he's our last. And that's all right. Did you ask.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Me? I was just going to say, I want to thank everyone, our speakers and and all the people who are providing these very much needed services to our most vulnerable citizens. It certainly makes me feel better knowing that a population that can't always speak well for itself, whether it's people on the verge of homelessness or seniors who'",
        "'speaker_4': 'might feel isolated and, you know, not know where to turn to for help. Rapid rehousing to keep people from becoming homeless and on the streets is being provided for. And yet every year we know that those critical funds get cut back still further.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so is Liz Varella from Building Futures for Women and Children said that you have to leverage and these providers are very adept at leveraging what funds they get through the through from us through the federal government to get more funds and to to do sort of a triage.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that's what this the the the community development needs statement is all about. They've prioritized what they think are the most critical needs. We wish we had more money to go farther. As Doug Biggs noted, there were years in the past when we could actually look at enrichment and, you know, adding on some things it would be'",
        "'speaker_4': 'lovely to have. Now we're just trying to keep people's lives together again for these most vulnerable populations. So I am fully behind this proposal and I'm ready to support it with a motion. But I suspect some of my colleagues would like to comment, too.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And variety.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I thank you, Madam Mayor. First of all, I'd like to thank Trump for putting this together. Doug's here, right? And Jen Williams, is there anyone else from Shrub? Can this Shrub members that are in the audience stand up?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Just you two.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Which is the Social Services Human Relations Board, not a Bush.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I just think I want to give you a hand for for all the work you do now. And also I think the groups that came out today. And thank you for the services you're providing, you know, building futures, Eden I and R eco housing and legal assistance for seniors.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You know, sitting up here, I'm thinking, oh, I wish we could do more. And maybe perhaps my colleagues, instead of wishing we're going to be having a a budget review coming up in June, I don't know where we're going to stand financially, but as we as we look at our budget again, I wonder if it'd be worth'",
        "'speaker_7': 'considering actually trying to do more instead of just saying we wish we can do more, you know, actually getting some results and including some temporary funding that some of these groups or other community groups can use to leverage other funding.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So if my colleagues don't have any objection to that, maybe staff could put that on the list of things to consider when when we get the one year budget update, because I think we can do more. And if we're in a time, you know, where, you know, we're having surpluses or our budgets are coming in better than'",
        "'speaker_7': 'we expected, I mean, we should be able to find a way to take care of our most vulnerable populations because we're not really preserving the social service safety net. You know, has Councilmember Ashcroft said, you know, we're just plugging the gaps and triaging, you know, and working where we can.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I'm really pleased that this year, or at least able to find some funding for relief to some tenants that have needs for emergency relocation and then are getting evicted. So I'm also prepared to support this, but I really instead of wishing we can do more, I hope that, you know, we can commit as a council to'",
        "'speaker_7': 'do more.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember De Saag.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Just quickly, I want to say a special thank you to the service providers, as in the big picture of things, when you look at the amount of money that we're allocating through this process, oftentimes it's really not that much relative to the magnitude of their operations, and yet they still come and make a pitch for we're providing'",
        "'speaker_2': 'services. So we really appreciate the fact that, you know, you've hung in there all these years. And even if the amount of funds have been dwindling, you know, we appreciate the service that you're providing, the residents of Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Vice mayor.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I heard housing related services three times through the presentation. I think it's money well spent that were about to approve the plan for. I would like us to again do the follow up. Once the implementation is is being decided looking strategically on.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'How these at least those three independent providers can. Assist us in taking care of this, the population that's vulnerable right now. With that, we hear testimony from on on rental issues so that we know we've allocated the money, but we also can make sure that it's being spent in an efficient manner and.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It addresses the problem that we're experiencing now. And I'm hoping our our implementation plans are nimble enough to to adjust to what the crisis of the day is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I appreciate all the comments from council as well as the public that spoke. I wanted to add that I've had the opportunity to attend these private meetings and hear from the providers the presentations that are made there, as well as participate, at least from member Ashcraft when we go out for the homeless count.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I really want to commend Shrub, the providers. The work is critical and I would support this issue coming back as part of our parking lot when we look at the allocation of funds in the future to see.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But what we could do to further support, that being said.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I would love to move that. We approve the Housing and Community Development Needs statement for the Community Development BLOCK Grant CDBG Annual Plan for Fiscal Year 2016 17/2.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All those in favor. I motion carries unanimously. Thank you very much. Next item 6.'"

[The proposed amendment is categorically exempt from the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Section 15270 - Projects Which Are Disapproved.] (Community Development 481001)": [
        "'speaker_1': 'P.m. La Carey to consider Call for review and adoption of resolution upholding the Planning Board resolution to deny a use permit to allow the sale of beer and wine at a convenience store located at 1716 Webster Street.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Madam Mayor, my property is relatively close to this facility, so I'm going to have to recuse myself from this.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Council Member D So I had that done that check and your property. Are you referring to residents? And that is located more than 500 feet more than the outside of the 500 foot radius from the property. So I.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I don't think that's a. I'm looking at the city. Yeah. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah, well. Yeah. I mean it.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Madam Mayor. Members of the Council. So the item before you this evening is a call for a review of the Planning Board's denial of use permit requests to have off sale alcohol. So this is a liquor license to sell alcohol for off premises consumption at a convenience store at 1716 Webster Street.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And because I've done some questions before the meeting about the use permit in the process and for the benefit of the public audience here, what I'd like to do is just spend a quick moment to explain what a use permit is and the considerations that factor into that decision.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think that'd be great. Thank you. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So the city has a zoning ordinance. The zoning ordinance divides the land in the city into different zones, generally based on land use category. So you have residential zones, commercial zones, industrial zones for each zone. The zoning ordinance lists types of businesses and uses that are permitted as of.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Right. And those that are allowable under a use permit. And so the use permit is a discretionary action that provides flexibility in an otherwise very prescriptive set of zoning regulations. Now, because of this discretionary action, the city may choose to approve a permit for one business and deny it for another.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But in order to avoid these decisions being arbitrary and capricious, the decisions have to be supported by findings. And the findings here in Alameda generally relate to the use being compatible with the adjacent land uses, that it is consistent with the policies in the general plan and also that the use will not create any adverse effects on'",
        "'speaker_8': 'neighboring properties or persons. It's also important to keep in mind that use permits run with the land. So in making the decision to approve it, you submit a use permit. You want to avoid basing that decision on whether the applicant is a good business person or bad business person, and focus on the objectivity of the and the'",
        "'speaker_8': 'merits of the proposal. Now, with this particular request, the history goes back to 1995, when the applicant had requested approval of a use permit for a convenience store to the gas station and 24 hour operation, as well as an off sale liquor license.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The Planning Board in 1995 approved the convenience store and 24 hour operation, but the use permit prohibits the sale of alcohol. In 2012, the applicant, as part of remodeling the facility, had requested use permit to amend that 1995 permit to allow off sale alcohol and staff.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Initially in 2012 recommended approval because we thought that. The sale of beer and wine is is very common in convenience store locations. But after a public hearing, the planning board denied that request due to neighbor concerns of alcohol related nuisances.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The findings made by the Planning Board in the 2012 use permit were all in relation to public health protecting public health, safety and welfare of the immediate neighborhood. That decision was subsequently appealed to the City Council, who had unanimously upheld the Planning Board's denial in 2012.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Excuse me. Member ready to just ask a questions and.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Then a couple of questions. So, yes. Initially, when the first request was made for a variance, planning staff recommended that it be approved, correct? That's correct. And can you kind of elaborate a little bit more on what what the basis of that decision was?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yeah. So the city's general plan calls for maximizing opportunities for businesses and broadening the types of goods and services available to Alameda residents. And so that under that policy, in that direction, in the Journal plan, staff usually would recommend favorably to businesses that seek to increase the types of services they provide to residents, provided that, there's a'",
        "'speaker_8': 'set of conditions that can also control some of the nuisance factors.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And did we have data from the police department to support the complaints of, you know, fights and nuisance and loitering?'",

        "'speaker_8': 'I don't believe it's based on a specific radius. I believe it's based on police reporting districts. I mean, the police chief is here. I might defer that question to him for specifics, but I believe the report pulled incidents, alcohol related instances, I mean, that covered anywhere along Webster Street between Lincoln all the way up to Atlanta.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I mean, it was a pretty broad area. And that captured 29 incidents in 2012.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'That is correct.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. So there is a remedy if if if this is approved, there is an additional remedy that, you know, we're not going to allow 24 hour sales it can cut off at midnight. You know, there are certain restrictions that can be placed on on the business, like they have to, you know, hire somebody to pick up litter'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Right. But the ABC already has some conditions. Right, since the hours. So we'll be discussing that as.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Part of the liquor license. There are some state regulations that the business owner would have to follow.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And the city has an opportunity to weigh in on what some of those restrictions might be based on on some of the.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Cities. The city can impose additional conditions. Right.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But we could also, you know, write a letter to ABC and say, you know, we granted this conditional use permit, but some of the things that we'd like to see are, you know, A, B and C.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we could add additional for clarification. But there are some things from the ABC, for instance, the hours of sale. So are we still asking clarification questions?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'm asking work whether we can whether we could weigh in on on ABC and as a city and say.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We can add.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think that's the way the process works is the ABC has its own set of state regulations related to the conduct of business related to alcohol. So just very quickly, they require anyone involved in alcohol sales to take training classes, they have to card check for minors and so forth.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Those are standard regulations. In addition to those regulations, the city may impose conditions such as restricting the hours where the sale of alcohol can take place on the premises, as well as some of the others that you've mentioned.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And if ABC gets complaints from neighbors, you know, they can get this is the correct that they can conduct investigations and even impose even further restrictions if, you know, they're having some problems.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That is correct. But the city's use permit process also allow that to happen within our own discretion.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I have another question, but did you finish the 2012?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I was I just have a couple of key points in the now.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Because I have a question on that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. So just going through the timeline, in 2013, Safeway gas had applied for a similar request. And based on the 2012 decision, the planning board denied that request. So that essentially said a policy this decision listen in staff's respective that I'll save alcohol on.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Website continues on that point there's a question okay.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But a safe way the store which is a retail outlet on the West End, was given a permission to sell alcohol. Is that correct? That is correct. So how do you jive the fact that the denial was said because there were too many retail outlets selling alcohol in the Webster Street area.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But then if that was the case, why did we give a permit to Safeway, which is a large retail outlet on the West End bordering Webster? Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Excuse me, Madam Mayor, could we allow our staff, the staff to to finish their presentation and then do clarifying questions? I think he has more things to add and then finish up.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. Well, I.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Think it all.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Just at some point.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Perhaps we can all just make note of our questions and ask them when the presentation is done because I'm losing you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Remember that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Chair.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Chairs the chair.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I appreciate that you think you can continue.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Think so. The the request that we have today from the applicant is essentially the same application from 2012. Now staff had recommended denial of this current request to the planning board and the Chamber concurred because the neighbor conditions as we look at it, for which the Planning Board and counsel denied the request in 2012 really hasn't changed'",
        "'speaker_8': '. And yes, staff recognizes that since 2012 there is Alameda landing. There is new competition from safer gas, but changes in the business environment and added business competition doesn't doesn't affect the public health, safety and welfare considerations that really made up the findings of the 2012 city denial and.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And my last point really is that the decision for this particular property, as you can see on the map, there are other gas stations in close proximity and the fact that the findings for use permit relate to the use and its immediate vicinity.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Whatever decision the council makes tonight will likely have implications to those other businesses. And I can attest that I know Shell the Shell Station as well as safely gas, have asked about having a convenience store and selling alcohol from the premises.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So and and I think in the future, if those businesses do come in requesting a liquor license, it would be very difficult for the city to differentiate the findings when the businesses are so close to each other.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So thank you very much for that's your presentation, right? I think there's going to be quite a few questions so you could stay there.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Member Already I'm still because I want to go back to the the findings in 2012 planning board disagreed with the staff recommendation, denied the request, citing the following factors, and one of them was increase in the number of retail outlets that sell alcohol will adversely affect adjacent residents and businesses.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I mean, I'm not as much trying to find out, you know, ask you about whether or not, you know, competition was a good thing or a bad thing. But, you know, we made a recommendation while I was in here, but the previous council and the previous planning board said there are too many retail outlets that sell'",
        "'speaker_7': 'alcohol, but yet we gave a permit to a big box retail outlet, you know, not too far away from there. That's also adjacent to neighborhoods. And, you know, it just seems to me a little inconsistent that we have one set of rules for big box and another set of rules for small businesses.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'How do we do that and still jive with that statement?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And before you answer that, I just want to add that the city also gave a beer and liquor license to target right there. Both of them have it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. So, yeah, there's two. So.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, yes. So now may.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I add some clarification? I was actually.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Questioned. Answer any.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'More.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, let's go ahead and let him finish the question. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And try to clarify that point.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Then that staff clarified.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm going to I'm going to jump in on that one since I was the planner on that project. We originally approved the Catalyst Master Plan.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So Safeway gas is on what we called a gateway site. Safeway grocery store is on the Alameda Landing Retail Center, two separate sites. The retail center was approved as part of the master plan in 2006. The master plan vested a whole bunch of zoning rights in 2006.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'At that time, grocery stores were permitted by right and were vested with the Catullus Master Plan. You could have a grocery store in that site and grocery stores were allowed to sell alcohol. So they had a vested right to do a grocery store that sold alcohol as of 26.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So that's why that got approved. We didn't have the ability to say no alcohol in the Safeway store. Those entitlements and vesting rights did not apply to what we call the Gateway site, which was Safeway gas. And the big distinction there, of course, from in terms of the record and why the city did what it did is'",
        "'speaker_8': 'the city was making a distinction between the sale of alcohol with gasoline versus the sale of alcohol from a grocery store. And when Safeway gas came in the city, it was only a year or so.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'After.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The council had unanimously denied the sale of alcohol from this site. So. We felt the policy was established. We recommended denial. The Safeway Gas Planning Board upheld that decision. They contemplated appealing, but then decided not to appeal because the council's record of denying these things at gas stations had been fairly longstanding.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'll ask more later.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I will just add one last thing since that I mean, not because of this, but since this we grocery stores now in Alameda. This doesn't effect on me landing now.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Require a use permit.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So it was target part of that master plan also.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So I'd like to follow up on what member he was speaking to. Well, I appreciate that. Apparently sounds like the city didn't have as many options in regards to whether or not there was a change when it came back to the planning board.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It was addressed as though there was no change and. Carl. How do you do? How do you say that when in fact, you now have two large stores offering? It's not just beer and wine. They actually have the license that provides distilled spirits.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And and this liquor. This gas station is asking for beer and wine license.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I if.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm going to sort.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Of say, why is that not a change?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'What Alan was trying to explain is you're right, there is a change in the environment. There is more competition for this business. We acknowledge that. But competition was not the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No, no, my question is not really go to competition. I think there's a I think you could argue that there's a change in regards to the availability. True. It's different from.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's true. But the availability of alcohol and the fact that there's more.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Availability of alcohol because of Safeway gas doesn't change the underlying findings that the council made in 2012 for the reasons why they turned it down. They cited overconcentration. They cited the large number of alcohol related police incidences in that neighborhood as as the primary factors for the denial.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So when we went to the planning board last month and said we don't see a change in conditions, what we were referring to is specifically those conditions. We acknowledge that, you know, Alameda landing has been built since then and Webster Street is transforming.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Absolutely.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. What about regards to these off sale licenses? The report that was provided to us that shows out of the 54 active off site licenses, 16 of them were issued after 2012, which is a 30% increase. City wide of these licenses is offsite.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And and we're having that many more licenses issued citywide. How can this not be looked at as some sort of discrimination against this one retailer? That's a significant increase citywide during that time period. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think it depends on the types of businesses or Spirits Alley Alameda Point. I mean those those also would have off sale licenses. There are also businesses that can obtain off sale licenses without requiring a use permit. So good example would be some restaurants that have on sale licenses but also allows you to none.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Of the on sale licenses if I'm going to get to next. This is just off by not allows for.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Like a bottle of wine home with you. So.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So in regards to the answer, I'm glad you brought that up. There's been 41 new issued during the same time period. So we are now at 156, which is a 25% increase across the city of on sale licenses.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'How do you not think that it looks like there's some sort of something personal or a discrimination? We know our agencies.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The city doesn't issue those licenses. We have only had. I'm thinking outside my head, Alan There was the Walgreen's proposal on Park Street. There was this gas station. Three years ago, there was Safeway gas. Two and a half years ago.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So they're being issued by someone, though. That's in these reports and they're in our city.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yeah, but it's the. It's A-B-C.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's all right. Okay. So so when you're looking at whether or not to allow it in the city, you don't take it to you don't consider it a change when there's all these other businesses that are receiving these licenses, whether or not they're being issued by you or ABC, but they're coming to our city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And and yet for this one person, this one business. You've now you're now actually recommending not to approve it.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yeah. The on sale licenses are really transparent.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The question is not to you if you could hold.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Off and I was just asking for permission to speak whenever you're ready to let me have permission to. All right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. I was just going to keep going through our questions. Thanks. Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So Onsale licenses are generally regarded differently in answer. So what the city does is we when when a new business comes to town, they apply for a business license. They do go through zoning review. And what we look at is the type of business that's in operation.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Restaurants, for example, they typically can serve alcohol and that is recognized under the ABC rules. It's it's it's only usually the off sale licenses that require a conditional use permit. And so I think I think when you're looking at the list of ABC on sale licenses and the increase in the number, it just reflects the types of'",
        "'speaker_8': 'other permitted uses that are allowed in the zoning.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It doesn't go into consideration in regards to change, you know, because staff said that there was not a lot of change and.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The. The item before you is a use permit for a specific business on a specific site. We are. We staff can come could completely understand if the council says, you know what, we're we're weighing the pros and cons of potential issues related to the findings that the council made two or three years ago regarding health, safety, welfare'",
        "'speaker_8': ', the police reports and the overconcentration. But we've looked at it in two or three years now, at three years later, and we're thinking we're not as concerned about that. And we'd rather support a small business here in Alameda and make it easier for this business to compete.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And that's a that's a that's a fair balancing of of priorities, small business people, health and safety. And, you know, the day you can make that judgment call and you can if a majority of you feel like you want to rule in favor of the small business that's perfectly within your right.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Our our issue. And what Alan is trying to say is because your findings to approve that are documented and they have to be related to the conditions in the neighborhood, not the businessman himself, the conditions in the neighborhood, the number of police reports, the number of issues.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Our concern is that if you're willing to say yes to the others as well. You're you have no problem. But it's going to be very difficult if you want to say yes tonight and then say no to Safeway gas tomorrow night if they come in or the Shell station when they come in, because the conditions in this'",
        "'speaker_8': 'general area are the same for all three. And that's our concern, is that because as as Alan said, we have to be we can't just be arbitrary about this. We have to be very clear why we're saying yes to some people and no to others.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So if the council is comfortable saying yes to more off sales, alcohol sales from gas station convenience stores, that's certainly your prerogative. But it's going to be hard to say no to the others. That's our main point.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I appreciate that. And then I attended at least one of these planning board meetings on this. And I believe that there were statements made that we in the city do not have beer and wine sales at gas stations.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And could you clarify that? It's my understanding.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So that we do. There are currently three. They're currently located on Park Street. But but we do the there are convenience stores at gas stations here in Alameda that that sell alcohol.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And it's mine. Okay. And so the one on Park Street, Valero, has had it since 2001, which was before this thing came, the first go round one at Chevron since 1993, and the one since the other one on AMPM is 1988.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So so when representations are being made by the planning board that we don't have that, when in fact we've had it in our city since 1988. Isn't that? I think that may be considered a change that needs to be that could be a finding that contradicts the prior findings.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think that. So. So would that not be a finding that somehow contradicts these prior findings that were made that we didn't have it in our gas stations when in fact, we've had in our gas station since 1988?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We've we've never made the finding in a written document that we don't sell alcohol from. I was at that meeting. I didn't hear anybody say that, that we don't sell alcohol. Maybe what somebody said is we haven't approved any of these since.'",
        "'speaker_8': '2001. It was probably, you know, 15 years ago was probably the last one. And I think that was legalizing an existing condition. But, you know, as a once again, I mean, you can it's totally within your provocative to look at conditions now in 2015 or 2016 and say, you know what, we just have different priorities and different'",
        "'speaker_8': ', you know, and we wanna make a different decision.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. They just have.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'To hold it for everybody.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And. Ashcroft.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. And I will just note that notwithstanding what you might have heard and sometimes, you know, perhaps someone misspoke at a planning board meeting. But if you note, exhibit four of this staff report has a list of gas stations and ABC Alcoholic Beverage Control licenses, and there are none in Webster.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then, you know, there's a whole list of ones that don't have beer and wine sales. But I just wanted to clarify, because I was on the planning board in 2012 when we denied this license and the city council unanimously uphold upheld our denial.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And what we were looking at was that specific location. And so that and this is I feel like I'm getting into the remarks that I've made and we haven't even heard our public speaker. But I just want to clarify, because some some references were made to the 2012 planning board meeting, and I, for one, was there, and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'of course Mr. Thomas was too. But we were looking at this particular location. The 76 station applicant came in. He has built a very nice convenience store there, but we denied his application for beer and wine sales at the time.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And the reason was we were hearing from the neighbors, they're concerned with public drunkenness, loitering, littering, crimes being committed. And bear in mind, that intersection know, if if those of you who are familiar with Webster Street can picture the intersection of Webster and Bueno Vista, the 76 station is kitty corner diagonal from a liquor store that's a'",
        "'speaker_4': 'full service liquor store just down the block on Buena Vista there. The next parcel down from the liquor store is the 7-Eleven. They also sell alcohol across the street on Webster Street. Going toward the tube is the Chevron station, which has a convenience store.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And you can believe they'll apply. But even more significantly is I'm going to visit next to each of those gas stations, 76 and Chevron. The next properties are housing developments. And in fact, some of them are run by our housing authority.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I happen to know that they have families living there. They have teenage children. They are always trying to keep those properties in good condition. They don't want the the loitering, the garbage, the the crime that comes with those kinds of sales.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So our concern at the time in my concern still tonight is that if we approve.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'One.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Sale, one license for the sale of beer and wine at the time three years ago, I would say you get you approved one, you get three because Chevron and Shell will want them to. Now you approve when you get for.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Ashcroft, this is really.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Appropriate for. Okay. So I'm just trying to say these for our consideration.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You want to see that last time, but if you're arguing this time.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I know I'm not I'm just trying to say you were looking all the way down into Alameda, landing with Target saying we were much more focused on the neighborhood. But you're right, mayor spencer, i will take that of my rex.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you for the reminder.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I swear, no questions. And then we're already.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I guess. I'm sorry. Where did Allen go? So on the just to follow up on the mayor's point, the off sale licenses. I mean, you sent this around to the council. Can you kind of recap the places where we've issued off cell licenses in Alameda since this original application was denied in 2012?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I would say there are numerous locations I can think of. Spirit's Alley in Alameda Point. There's the Walgreens and the Walgreens here, that Park Street. Um.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I mean, I said this was unfair market.'",
        "'speaker_8': '25 unfair market. That's, that's, that's Neptune Neptune Plaza and on Webster Street.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So that's in close proximity to yes. This gas station. That's the neighbor that would.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Be a grocery store with or and the difference between grocery stores and convenience markets would be the variety of products sold and particularly having fresh meat, fish and poultry.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I mean, that that was issued on May 12th, 2015. Was that before or after we changed the rules for grocery stores?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I believe that was before. That was before, yes. 2012.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Now, there's one here that we were giving us at 2015, I guess. The question I have is I mean, is is the point that that area is saturated really a valid finding? If we've if we'd issued liquor licenses in that area since then and not made a similar finding, I guess that's kind of my my question.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yeah. Maybe it's a little rhetorical and it's more of a debate, but.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Did you want to respond to that or you don't? All right. I'm going to move on to our public speakers and thank you very much. All right. And each of these figures, you can have up to 3 minutes sound deep.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'David Franklin. Mike. Okay. It's epic. You you i r y a n a DeLong lilt lu.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening, Mayor and council members Sandip Joel, owner of Houghton Street Hotel on Webster Street. And I also serve as the President of the West Limited Business Association. Before I begin my prepared remarks, I'd just like to clarify one point that Andrew made in the original entitlements for limited lending, we had an you that specifically prohibited grocery'",
        "'speaker_3': 'stores. And so I don't think they had entitlement to have grocery stores at all. But, you know, let alone selling liquor. So Safer and Target would not have happened if the ammo you had not subsequently been changed, which we negotiated with cartels to change later on.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But so I don't think they were entitled to have those grocery stores in the beginning and then they started out. So I just wanted to clarify that. I'm here today on behalf of the Board Members to request you to approve this use permit application made by Circle K.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In our board meeting held on November 18, we unanimously voted to support this application for the following reasons. Most gas stations with convenience stores in California now sell beer and wine. And as you know, there are three gas stations on Park Street, namely the Valero, the Chevron and the Arco station that have been selling beer and wine'",
        "'speaker_3': 'for several years now. There are already enough places to buy alcohol on Webster Street and on the West End. And if anyone is concerned that allowing Circle K to sell beer and wine is going to bring in additional shoppers to the district, I think they are mistaken.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This circle k location is not a a location. It's it's a neighborhood location. And most of Mr. Lewis customers are residents of Alameda who already know where to buy alcohol. As you know, the 76 gas station was closed a few years ago and the previous owner could not make enough money to continue operating it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We had some really big concerns when that gas station closed. And luckily and the reason he closed what he did was he did not have enough money to renovate the station and to make the improvements that would have required a substantial investment of time and money.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But luckily, a few months after the gas the gas station closed, Mr. Liu and his brother stepped into that critical time to make changes to the Formula six gas station and build a brand new convenience store by investing over $1,000,000 in that location.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So as you can imagine, the addition of this new convenience store was a very important step in our efforts to prevent blight on Webster Street. With the recent addition of the Pacific Gas Station at Alameda Landing, it has become extremely difficult for local gas stations such as the Circle K to increase their sales through gas sales.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'On any given day. I'm sure you all know that if a gas station sells the gas at a much lower price than any other gas station in Alameda. The Circle K convenience store sold a variety of food and beverage items, and allowing them to sell beer and wine will help them increase their sales.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Our goal is to help our member businesses such as Circle K, to succeed in their business so that we can maintain a vibrant business district for the residents of Alameda. And we request you to help us achieve this goal by improving the use permit application tonight.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Mr. Franklin.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Councilman. I'm the owner of the building right adjacent to this property. And I spoke against it previously. And. Councilmember Ashcroft. Speaks for a lot of what I believe to be my tenants in the building. We're going to Billy's right adjacent to it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm sure we're going to have more loitering around there and with the liquor. I just kind of I don't believe that liquor and driving cars goes together very well. And there are plenty of places they can buy liquor.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I don't see that we really this the city really needs to make more of it available at this location. All opposed to it by tenants are opposed to it. They asked me to come here and speak to you and tell you that, you know.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They would rather not sell liquor. They knew when they got the permit to build everything, they weren't allowed to sell liquor. And if I'm going to have to come back here every couple of years, I guess I have to do that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I don't know. I guess I've said everything I really can't say. If you have any questions, I'm happy to answer.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mike. And then it'll be the long. And then trying Hong Lin in the not too long.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'What Circle K is all.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'About. We are a convenience store company. We, however, were not a typical convenience store company. Our focus is on growing healthy, natural organics.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Gluten free.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Products. That's unheard of in the industry.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So we're promoting these.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Type of products, gourmet food, product sandwiches, Jamba Juice, smoothies in our stores where Mr. De Long Lou has. So it's not a typical convenience store where per say, the lawyers, the troublemakers come and shop for a can of beer, for a bottle of beer.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'A beer is a very small portion of their total product mix in our store. However, we feel that it is.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'A it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Gives the business a competitive edge to stay. And compete in the very competitive environment that this particular store is. And we want them to succeed.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The store.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Has. Made progress by leaps and bounds.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'However, we feel that there is more that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They can do to to succeed, be more successful, be more responsible member of this community, a responsible retailer. We have very.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Extensive.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Restricted sales.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Training program that they have in this. Memories think that I would.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Be more than happy to leave with you and review.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That they can train their.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Staff, which is actually more extensive than what ABC requires. There are certain community police departments required. We stand behind them.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We refresh the training.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Program. So I'm here to support. Mr. Lieu and ask for your support to grant. Then his wishes and his application. Any questions? I'd be happy to answer.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The long loop.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening, Mr. Mayor. And council members. My name's Dylan Lou. I'm the owner of the 76th store at 1716 Webster Street, Alameda. I'm here today. Tried to appeal to you to give us the user permit for beer and wine license.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We you know, we like three years ago. We are going through a lot of change to build a big store. Big convenience store for the local resident. And I say to a city council member, Maryland and wobble board meeting, we build a store for like 21, 2300 square foot store to, you know, just for the local residents'",
        "'speaker_3': '. We're not a fee free gas station. We're not. We're not. We we we try to help, you know, us and help the local residents to get all their come in and stuff. And that's why we need the spear and wine license to to get, you know, to maximize our, you know, maximize our opportunity for the business.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And one thing I want to say for I have to talk to other harbor board members regarding the city of Maryland, a city council, Maryland. So the concern regarding if you gave to us, you have to give to Chevron, you have to go to Shell.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But Chevron Shell, is there a gas station with all the shop? Chevron is. It's an auto shop. They just closed with a snack shop like us before, before rebuild, before rebuild. We have the snack shop and closed all the store.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I would say I spent almost $1,000,000 to try to make to the beautify the Webster Street. And if they want a beer and wine license, they should have built another like 1800 square foot a beautiful store and make make a street beautify the street.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You don't have to give them because they want it, because you can put a condition out on their like. And and also for us and last three years just so much change before we build it. We we never know.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I first of all, I never know. Gas safely. Gas station going to be there if safely gas going to be. I won't even build because once I know safer gas stations, it doesn't matter what they do because they're big, but they don't need the money to make money on the gas.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They always ten, 12, $0.15 cheaper on us and they have huge gas stations and they have like dispenser 18 pumps fill stores and they have so everything's brand, you know a lot of like us, you know, they have everything I there's no way I can compete with them.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I really now but I, I don't regret I spent the money because we build a beautiful, beautiful store. No, I want it now. I need. I need your help. But I even. Look, look, go even look at safely gas station stores.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's not a convenience store. It's a snack shop. If you close like a snack shop or gas stations as a convenience store. Convenience store, usually 2800 square above they call a convenience store. So they give a lot of different, you know, local stuff to the to the customer safely how many square foot they have.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They probably only have a 1000. It's not a convenience store. This they are just a gas station but section.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you and member already has a few questions for you and I'm going to allow him to ask us questions if it's all right with you because you're the applicant.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So, Mr. Burgess, just quickly, so I'm looking at your your application for use permit, and it didn't really show any hours. I mean, are there some restrictions that that you'd be willing to agree to? Yes. We gave you like I mean, such as shutting off alcohol at midnight or, you know, not doing it until like 2:00 in'",
        "'speaker_7': 'the afternoon or something. Yeah. Could you share with some of and perhaps hiring security during the evening hours to make sure there's no lawyers? I mean, can you kind of give us some some ideas and some of the restrictions you may be willing to agree to?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes, even even before I get this, my garbage schedule, pick ups, it's almost every day. It's every day we have a schedule. Pick up all the garbage every morning. There's a either garbage truck or recycle truck coming to pick up our garbage.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I have my cashiers go out on the street every hour, pick up the garbage right now, every morning, every night, every hour we have one cashier. Go out, pick up. If you look at my gas station, if you look at other gas, you can see the difference.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If you go to my gas station, you go to like our restrooms. We are at a state art restroom. We are the cleanest, cleanest restroom ever there. If you go today, right now, even you can see it. And and we're willing to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah, of course. And we don't have to sell beer and wine after a certain time at night. I want to you know, if we can we have that, you know, we can lock the cooler doors. We can, you know, on, you know, automatic log.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I'll show you tomorrow morning.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We will. It'd be a good time. Like to to midnight to to ten to to 11.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Usually it's a 2 to 2 to I think a 2 to 6 or 2 to 8 in the morning. Yeah. Right. But yeah.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That's don't of what we want to. Oh like that would mean what would be a reasonable restriction for you on when you would be able to sell alcohol at 2 p.m. to midnight, noon to midnight, you know, 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. What type of restrictions would you be agreeable to?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Usually. Usually it's for a convenience store. They usually to sell their one, I think 8:00 to 2:00 in the morning AM to 2 a.m.. That's. That's usually. Well. Well, I, I listen to the console. I, you know, I, I take.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I take.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Would you be willing to hire some kind of man in the evening?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Can I. Can I make a suggestion? We have the applicant is going to be here throughout the hearing. I'd like to hear the other speakers who were behind him.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then we talk to the.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Applicant back up. That's fine, if that's okay.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm a.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. All right. Don't leave. I'll be calling you back, I think. Jang Hong Lin or. Hello? And then luxury long. And then Katharina Chen.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hello, everyone. Good evening. Today's I come here just for one purpose. That is. I suppose it's okay to have fair and wide license. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Now set a good example. You don't have to use all the 30 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Unlike me.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Last too long. Lap Geelong. And then Catharina chan. And then Jessica Zoll.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Like the evening. My name is Lamp, so I'm here today. I just want to support my circle K to get the power license because I think like on our neighborhood line or other time line because I just live.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Along over the course. If they have the allies and then use more U.S. allies, we can go, go, go there to buy something. I think like $1,000,000, they have everything. So, yeah. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Katharina Chien. You got, you all can be lining up. You don't have to wait from the last. So ready to go. Then, Jessica. And Cynthia Bonta. And then Stuart Chen.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So everyone I come here. I just want to support circle K to get the bear license. Oh, thank you so much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Jessica. And then Cynthia Bonta. And then Stuart Chen.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hi. My name is Jessica. And I want to say that unless a cashier has a Coke and a.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Wonderful present for a customer saying that it's okay, should have my license there, too. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Ms.. Ponta.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening. They're city council members. I am very appreciative of the care in which you have discussed this issue. I was very concerned that a real thoughtful decision will be made, and I do believe that a fair decision would be to approve the.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Application as it is from your level, you're able to also provide conditions, you know.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'As is my understanding. So I think that you can do that. You can approve and.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Provide conditions.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'For the applications approval.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Stuart Chen and then Keith Weiser. And then Karen Bass. And then those are the last speakers on this item. If you'd like to speak, please turn in a slip. Mr. Mayor?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes. Good evening, Mayor Spencer and members of the council. My name is Stewart Chen, 30 year resident in Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And a small business owner. I appreciate the.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Council taking time to consider this matter. I'm here speaking in favor of the seven six gas station on Webster Street. This issue at hand. Really it's not just about the beer and wine license. It goes deeper. It's about fairness and equity for all businesses to be fair and to be equitable.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It's about a policy that you guys set. That is fair to all businesses in Alameda. Specifically the West End.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'A policy that's fair for the big bucks. And to all the mom.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And pop stores in our.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'City, I believe that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Big boxes like Target Safeway should play by the same rules that all small business owners have.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To do. If the city.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Allows the gas station, gas stations with convenience stores along Park Street, the right to serve, sell beer and wine. Then why are we singling out 76 station on Webster?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The Safeway on the landing currently has 18 gas pumping stations.'",
        "'speaker_8': '18 more gas pump than any other gas station on the Webster in. If the city granted either through use permit.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Or by.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Other licenses, if we granted Safeway the license to sell gasoline. And at the same time, the license to carry beer, wine and hard liquor. Then again, why are we denying 76 station the same privilege? 76 station had invested $1,000,000.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'In Circle K convenient store to help revitalize Webster Street. Instead of commending him, we are penalizing him. This. It's sending a wrong message.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To all.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Future small business owners not to invest in Alameda. I do not see the logic. I'm sorry. Behind us, the city council. Either 2012 or beyond. Usually go along with staff recommendation.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I get it. Because we know that they know what's.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Best for our city. They are too hard to help with expertize in their respective fields.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But once in a while.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Along comes a recommendation that's completely flawed right from the get go. I implore this council to find the.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Courage to do the right thing. That is to allow.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The 76th nation the same.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Privileged that we have given.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Applicants at Chevron at AMPM, Valero.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, guys.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Keith Schweitzer and then Karen Bey.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Madam Mayor, I'm sorry. It's my first time addressing a council like this. Mayor Spencer and council members. I was really my primary purpose for being here is the rent control question later on. So you'll see me again. But I couldn't help but speak up this time.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'To raise it so we.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Can debate.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, no, no.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You're fine. Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay, you probably can hear me.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So go ahead. Go ahead and speak.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So what I want to talk to you about the liquor license is first off. My wife and I, we've lived in Alameda where we're at for 15 years and we live about a block and a half from the gas station in the in the new development and right down one of them.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we love the neighborhood. We really appreciate the 76 gas station that was built. It is maintained very well as that and said that someone comes up must clean up very, very early because it's very clean. The my concern there will was against the liquor license.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, I appreciate the business owners need to survive and need to compete. And the issue that there's a Safeway gas station down the street that opened up and they have many gas station pumps. That's that's about right. Which I respect.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But they put the investment in and there are several gas stations that were already there so that a gas station way down the street was opened up. But they have a gas station right across the street and one a block away.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'When he entered into a competitive threat, already lost, it was a business that was bankrupt. So it's very tough to renovate a bankrupt business. So you went into a competitive area. You went in with no liquor license and evaluated the business at the time and made a decision to invest a substantial sum.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's very true. But you knew the rules and were in there and you made the decision to do it accordingly. But I don't think someone should be permitted to revisit the council's decision and then maybe you guys reject it tonight.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Then he's going to come back in two more years and every two years and and revisit the same thing again. The decision was made. I don't understand why we're revisiting it. And my main point that I'd like to express is the liquor store that's currently diagonal from that from that gas station, this one that at night, when'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the sun goes down, there's a collection of people that hang out in that area. And it's my wife and I like to walk around, but we we don't we don't turn left. I mean, we we will avoid that corner because it's just not a comfortable collection of people are hanging out around liquor store.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I don't want to see that happening in 76 station because they don't know what they don't know until they develop it. But if you look right across the street, it's the same neighborhood and they'll see what's going to happen, I hope.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And here and Karen B and then she's our last speaker on this item. If you'd like to speak on this item, please submit your slip.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Briefing there, Spencer members of the City Council and staff. So I have two comments to make about this. The first thing is, I would love for you to uphold the planning board decision on this as a West ender.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'You know, I participated in the West End visioning, and nowhere in the visioning was an oversaturation of liquor licenses. And it's we're turning an important corner on the West End. And there was a time that. When I first moved here, people didn't go on the West and they didn't go to Webster Street, I was told, because it'",
        "'speaker_10': 'was, you know, lots of bars and sailors and tattoos, tattoo salons. But we're turning an important corner here. We're going to get a pizza. We've got some wonderful restaurants. And it's just it's it's wonderful to see what's happening on the West End.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And my concern is that, you know, we oversaturate the West and Webster Street with liquor stores. I'm sorry. I just don't want to see anything I don't want to mention is that two weeks ago and midnight, I woke up and I heard this car, heard screaming, and there was a drunk driver.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'There's a police report. You can look it up. Okay. It really hit three or four cars at my state, hit my tenant's car. She woke up the next morning. She was crying. I had to take off work to help her.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'She was from out of the country. And I had to help her, you know, solve a problem from a drunk driver. And I and I, I just I it's a problem and I don't want to see more liquor license issued.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I'm, you know, I think they made a great case, you know, for small businesses and and big businesses. But it's this is it's more about, you know, preservation of our neighborhoods and a safe neighborhoods. And so that's what I'm fighting for in the West End.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I want quality. I want I don't want a lot of liquor licenses. I don't want a lot of you know, I want more variety. And I want safe places for our children and our our visitors and and our neighbors to go and enjoy.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So I'd like you to consider that other argument tonight. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Nebraska.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mayor Spencer. I appreciate everyone coming out and speaking in and I want to say to Mr. Geelong Lieu and all the members of the Labor Board, because I did it and they were gracious enough to invite me to attend their last board meeting and I talked to all of them.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And Mr. Lou, you've done a lovely job with the Circle K Station and it's just what we hoped it would be when we approved it. But of course, as you know, we approved it without the beer and wine sale license.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I did sit down with all of you on the Wabash board, but I didn't stop there. I've talked with neighbors in the area. I've talked with our police chief. I've talked with housing providers. And it's something that the city council has called upon to do just about every time we make a decision and just wait until'",
        "'speaker_4': 'we get to the rent matter. We have to balance a lot of competing, competing arguments. And while some compelling issues were raised, I think my friend Karen Bay just did a nice summation for me. I have watched Webster Street over the years, my six years on the planning board and almost three years on the council.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I made a commitment to the business owners and the residents of the West End that we would not neglect. Webster Street in the West End at City Hall. Webster Street doesn't have the opportunity, the economic catalyst the Street does with the Army, the theater.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So they've had to try harder and work harder. And they're coming along, you know, maybe not as quickly as everyone would like, but they are. But I just feel strongly about what I said earlier, that I am concerned with what that corner will look like, that particular intersection that abuts residential areas.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that really the planning laws that we are governed by say that if we grant this license for one, the others will want it too. And there's been mention of Safeway and the gas station has a convenience store or a snack shop or whatever.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I also just want to share that when I was on the planning board, the head of real estate development for Safeway came to me because they were coming to the planning board to get permission to put in the Safeway gas station.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And, you know, not everybody wanted a gas station there, but I sat down and listened to him and I said, well, I think I could support it. And then he said, and it's going to be a convenience store and we're going to apply to sell alcohol.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I said, Oh, you know, hold the phone. Why would you need to sell alcohol when there's a liquor store at South Shore next to the bank, Trader Joe's and Safeway and Walgreen, also liquor. Why would you why would you need to sell it at the Safeway gas station store?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And he said, well, you know, somebody might want to pick up a sandwich and a beer and it's just more convenient. And I said, you know, I'm a former probation officer, and that was really the wrong thing to say to me.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I really don't like the juxtaposition of drinking and driving. And I wasn't a part of the decision for the Safeway, for the Park Street stores. But what is before us now and what was before my planning board three years ago was what what does what would this look like?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'What would this decision look like for the residents of the area? Because the West End isn't just our businesses. We value our businesses. We want to keep them thriving, but it's also our residents. It's also the visitors who come.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I feel that the planning board three years ago made a good decision. The council then upheld them unanimously. I feel that the planning board last months made a good decision and I'm going to vote to back that decision.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So thank you very much for sharing your thoughts. But we have seen Webster Street transitioning, as Karen Bass said, and I want it to continue to transition in a positive way. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Ben Brody.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Madam Mayor. Actually was one of the two councilmembers. The mayor also being one who pulled this for review. Because I didn't think that the applicant really had a fair, fair hearing. I think has the mayor kind of started to point out in her questioning earlier that conditions have changed?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I'm not I. I disagree with the contention that. Was given when this was denied that there's going to be a saturation. When we've used that for this particular business, yet we've allowed other off sale liquor licenses in the city, including in the Webster Street area.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So it's a little incongruent to me that we would do that for some and not for others. You know, even if some of them were grocers, which they're entitled to, but others of them apparently are grocers that were rented that license after we we didn't make that a guarantee.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I think we have a really good business person here. And if he's willing to agree to some conditions, I'd be willing to vote to overturn this decision. You know, for example, you know, perhaps there's no reason to sell alcohol before 2:00 in the afternoon.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think in consideration of the neighbors, you know, if you stop selling at 11 p.m. or perhaps midnight, I mean, those might be I don't see any reason why you need to sell at 1:00 or 2:00 in the morning.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And being that it isn't a residential neighborhood, I hope that the applicant might consider reasonable restrictions like cutting off at 11 or cutting off at 12. I also think that, you know, if you can commit to cleaning up the area and that being a condition like your employees are doing, you know, I'd be prepared to support that'",
        "'speaker_7': 'type of condition and perhaps even that, you know, you hire a security guard or another person, you know, in the evening to make sure that people aren't loitering around the circle. K And I will say to the neighbors, you know, the Alcohol Beverage Commission, you know, they do take complaints seriously.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So if you have issues with people loitering at a neighboring station or a neighboring liquor store, you can file a complaint and there'll be hearings and they can get restrictions placed on their license. So if yes, they do.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I mean, I see hand-shaking in the habit. I deal with these that agency, you know, in my day job and deal with people that have liquor license and then have conditions on them. So that can be done. And if you're not getting help, you know, call your state representative and they can help you guide you through that'",
        "'speaker_7': 'process. But, you know, I think that this is a really good business person. You know, he has helped with the revitalization of Webster Street, and I don't think that he's a hindrance to it. And I'm not convinced by the argument that the Chevron and the Shell are actually going to apply.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I mean, they don't have convenient stores now, if that is that correct? So I mean, suddenly that they're going to want to turn, you know, their auto shops into convenience stores. I mean, that's going to be a big process.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And they're going to have to do the type of investment that the long did in this store in order to have that. So we would have an opportunity to review that. So I'd like to see, you know, this council grant this application, but with some significant restrictions that take into account the concerns of the neighbors.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Vice Mayor. Thank you. I looked at this. Application very carefully and set my personal opinions aside and looked at what our task is and measured it against what the findings that are required to make in order to to a grant to use permit in this nature.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I have to say that things have changed on Webster Street and things have also changed on Park Street. The three that are referred to on Park Street are back from the nineties and some cases the eighties. And even that 2001, I was on the planning board when that was approved, but it wasn't approving the use permit'",
        "'speaker_9': 'because it already had a liquor license that somebody gave it before, not knowing that there was a requirement for a use permit and had been operating for quite some time and the planning board decided to allow the operation to continue just to legalize it.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So in fact, we have not granted a a convenience store at a liquor at a gas station, a license for since 1995. And that one point that change from from comparison Park Street to Webster Street. We've had a lot of time that has passed in between.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And we had a couple of process public processes for visioning and putting together a Webster Street plan. And one of the findings that we have to make is that the this proposed use relates favorably to the general plan.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And when you read the general plan, it has those two visioning plans embedded in it. And this does this does not seem to align. An application to put a beer and wine sales at a gas station convenience store, particularly in an area where within a block there's there's three, three other convenience stores because there are snack shops'",
        "'speaker_9': 'at those other gas stations that it's just not consistent with those plans. So I can't make that finding and the the concerns of the neighbors who are residents right. Abutting the property and abutting the Chevron property, which could be the next one, expressed concern.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And that condition, when you look at the neighborhood, is is another one that I can't I have to support the finding that was made by the planning board the last time around. And then lastly, I think the owner operator of this operation is conscientious, is done a great job in designing a building that's compatible for Webster Street'",
        "'speaker_9': ', but the owner is not being granted the license. The use permit goes with the land. So if Mr. Longo, Mr. Lieu goes away. And sells it to somebody else. We may. We may have someone who's not as conscientious come in because it does travel with the land.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And that's I think that's an that's another deep consideration that we need to make when we get these youth permits out and we can put conditions on it. But the enforcement of conditions. We have a hard time enforcing code violations as it is now to to pile that on top of a use that is is really not'",
        "'speaker_9': 'fitting for that area, I think is a problem. And then lastly, the the proximity of of the bonfire down in Neptune corner or the Alameda Landing gas station of that is a problem for people who sell gas. I grant that and I certainly wish we had not put a gas station there.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It's it's appalling when you come in, you know, welcome to Alameda and you have a gas station behind it. That's not. That's that's just not a good looking place. But it's there. And it's it is a fact of life that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You know, all the gas stations on Webster you'd have to deal with whether they're selling or not. So I plan to uphold the decision, the planning board.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right. I appreciate that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So in regards to bond fair market, does that license stay with that location?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The bonfire has been there for a long time. And we believe the new the new bond fair license was actually a transfer of a license from the prior owner to the new owner. I mean, so when you say there's 40 new licenses, a large number of those are probably just when a business is sold from one property'",
        "'speaker_8': 'owner or one business. When a when a business is sold, a new license has to be issued by it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But does it stay with this?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We don't. But the use permit follows with the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I appreciate that. But in regards to the impact to the neighborhood, does it stay with that business?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It stays with that land.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So it stays right where.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'They use.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That location.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Land. The the ABC license goes with the business.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right, now, all I can look at is the river. We were provided by these handouts that have says original issue date May 12, 2015. Urban Fair. So that's the information I have to work with, right. But in regards to the impact on the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I. I plan to. Well, there's we've already had, I think, three council members. Right. You know, two. Okay. Well, so I plan to support the the license in that I disagree that these holdings are not arbitrary and capricious.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think that this would this truly appears to be arbitrary and capricious. And in that, when I look at the licenses that have been. Originally issue date and what is in that neighborhood and what's new, whether including on sale and off sale and city wide as much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And there has been a lot of conversation about what's happening on Webster and citywide also we have in this city. Quite a few businesses that offer wine and beer and distilled spirits now. And what's interesting to me is the Safeway at the landing is a 24 hour Safeway.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That doesn't mean they're selling alcohol 24 hours a day because they're limited by the ABC in regards to their the hours they can sell. However, they're not limited in regards to any city limitations and they actually can sell distilled spirits, which I think I have a greater issue with than the beer and wine license.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And this vendor is asking for a beer and wine license and throughout our city. So if the city was taking a position that we are putting a freeze on beer and wine licenses across our city. And if the city had taken that position back in 2012, then I and I could understand.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'However, since it has and it continues to issue these licenses, I really think it appears to be discrimination against this one business. So I will not I will not be able to support the, I guess, the planning board's decision of not offering this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think that I have I just think a. If if people within our staff and our planning board continue to say this is wrong for this one location, but they are. But it's being offered down the street to a bar that's open until 2 a.m. or another store that's open until 2 a.m. where we round the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'clock. I think that's very inconsistent. And I think that that it does not support these findings because overall it cannot be arbitrary and capricious. And I think when if you had a map and you really put the hours of sale and what they're selling in that area and then across our city, it's very, very hard to say'",
        "'speaker_0': 'no to this one business person. My opinion. All right. That being said, yes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The question of staff, maybe the city attorney. So we obviously have an even number of council members here to vote. How does that work? If the vote is two to.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The planning board decision stands.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Because there's not a majority to overturn it.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Vice Mayor I'd like to make a motion then, and I think arbitrary and capricious and discriminatory are pretty strong characterizations of what the planning board did. Because I looked at that, I watched the hearing. I think they have a different opinion, but I don't think it's arbitrary, capricious or discriminatory.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I also think that there is a difference between all the other licenses and the license that allows you to drive a car up. Pump gas, buy a can of beer and get back in the car right away.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I think that's a distinction that some people have drawn in discussions with me. So and with that background, I'd like to make a motion that we uphold the decision of the planning board with regard to the use permit at 1716 Webster Street.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'In our second. And I also want to echo device mayors comments that I certainly appreciate differences of opinions and community issue an issue from different directions, but our voluntary boards and commissions take their tasks seriously and put a lot of time and effort into the decisions they make.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I know they do their homework. They go out and do their site visits and talk to many people. Arbitrary, capricious and discriminatory. I don't think so. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I'd like to add, it's my understanding the vote at the planning board was not unanimous and the word discriminatory did come up from the council member that opposed it. So I'm not bringing that up for the first time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That being said although some favor I. Oppose. No, no. So the planning.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Or.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Decisions.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The motion fails for the motion fails. We have another motion.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'It's like playing tic tac toe.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'll make a motion. Then I'd like to make a motion that we approve this permit. For the applicant was 1716 Webster. Are second. All right, then that motion fails. Okay. Then you move on to the next agenda item and the planning board decision stands.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Offers something meaningful to our Alameda community culturally and economically. And as someone who supports slow and well.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Contemplated growth for Alameda. I am here to request that unless you have.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'A specific plan in progress.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'For developing that site. Please don't hasten to close down Building 29. If the question tonight is whether.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To give them two or five years more. Make it five. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Chris.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In the evening. Mayor Council members. My name is Christian Eisen and I have a company called Vector Pickle and I'm one of the tenants of Building 29. I am I don't consider myself an artist, but I am a craftsman and a manufacturer.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I've been involved with industrial design and building things for pretty much all my life, and I run a business that out of Building 29 that is my livelihood and also employs other people, mostly on a part time basis at this time.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But as as I need them. My clients include many names that you guys have heard, both locally and nationally, from Artemus Racing to Facebook to Old Navy. A lot of large and small customers and also a lot of local designers that are doing cutting edge work in furniture design and product design.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'My location in our building allows me kind of a unique perspective on the nature that goes around behind Building 29, which the Sierra Club is referring to. It has allowed me to observe the abundant and ever growing amount of wildlife out there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I'm I've never ceased to be and may be amazed by how many animals are out there. We have geese, pelicans, hawks, even owls I've been startled by at night out there. Just the other day there were 20 herons standing next to the pond behind our building.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Also out there are squirrels, rabbits, raccoons, occasional house cat, even some stray dogs. And they all seem to be thriving very well. There are raptors out there which the Sierra Club has referenced, and they do do what raptors do.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And because of all the wildlife out there, that's why they're there. They they do go after most of the things they see them go after are the rabbits and the squirrels occasionally pigeons. I have not seen them do too many of the other birds, but it does happen, I'm sure, and that's kind of the natural way of'",
        "'speaker_3': 'things. Removing our building is not going to remove that. This is what this is what wildlife is. It's a natural occurrence. These birds nest our perch on our building. They perch on building 25, which is just down from us on the control tower, rock wall winery all down the row.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's it's a virtual smorgasbord for them out there. I mean, I hate to be blunt about it, but and removing our building is not going to change that. And I almost think that, you know, it's it's something that would allow people in Alameda to observe natural things going on.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I also want to say that this is not just a building full of people exploring their lives and doing pursuing their hobbies. This is viable businesses that employ people, that manufacture things for for companies in the Bay Area and beyond that desire our products.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I would urge you guys to please approve the five year lease and and let us stay there at least that long, if not longer.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you, Sean. And then Irene Deeter and then Richard Baer. And then there are final speakers on this item. If you would like to speak on this, please submit your slip.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening. Their council members. Thank you very much. You pronounce my name wonderfully, Sean Cronin. I am a tenant of Building 29, part of the community. It's it's been a pleasure being out there. I moved in five years ago when we when they moved over from the other space after being relocated.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I had recently graduated from the California College of the Arts, sculpture and furniture major, destined to be a full time artist. That's my dream. And I've I have sacrificed a lot to do that as my my community, my friends, my fellow tenants.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The building is my my livelihood. That space, that studio space, I make my living out of that space. The point they made earlier, Wolfgang made about relocating. Sounds easy for a big business. It's almost a killer for a small business if you're not prepared for it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Moving at this point, moving two years from now even is daunting. Five years is even scary, frankly. And we've moved into this space knowing that the the the redevelopment plan was in action. And I'm excited to see what's happening and the changes that have already been made.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But knowing that my time in Alameda might come to an end, because that's kind of the first thing to go in a big redeveloped redevelopment plan. When I heard the news that that Google was renting the big space right over from us, I was equally as excited as I was concerned that all of a sudden these big'",
        "'speaker_3': 'companies are coming in and that my MySpace. The days were numbered. So seeing this letter yesterday was a was a surprise. Recently, I've just reconfigured my studio space, which is a small part in the front of the building to have a a clean area, a space where I can actually have regular open studios, as I've had a'",
        "'speaker_3': 'number of over the years. I'm now encouraging more people to come and see my space and see my practice and the fact that the fact that now, you know, I'm nearly done. I'm nearly going to paint the walls white.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we are looking at a termination or an early termination of this lease. It's just it's just scary. So I invite you all out to see my work, to see what we do in the space and see the community that's out there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That, again, the low rent that Peter's provided in the space has really kept me in the Bay Area, frankly. West Oakland, there's still some spots here and there were small scale artists is the starving artist. I hate to say that, but that's that's what I'm doing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, I know a few that can survive right now in West Oakland, but it's happening over the Bay Area that artists are getting pushed out as as as what happens. So. I just encourage you guys to. Extend our time there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Five years, as Peter said, seven years. Ten years. I mean, really, I think the. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hello, Mayor and City Council. My name is Irene Dieter, and I'm here tonight to speak on behalf of the Sierra Club. We've sent you a letter which obviously the audience is aware of, too, which asks for us to shorten the term of the lease, to work with the tenant to find another location, and to set aside lease'",
        "'speaker_1': 'revenues from the building for demolition. And why did we ask for this? It's so that we're not here five years from now going through this exact same exercise. It's one thing for Dave Park to be on a planning map.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's another thing to follow that up with some action to actually make it happen. These tenants will eventually have to move if the city is serious about creating a wetland park there. So taking action tonight in some capacity to send a message to the environmental community that you are serious.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It will. It will also show movement in that direction, and it will show funding agencies that Alameda is indeed ready to move forward with getting some grant funding. The timeframe of two years is not carved in stone. It was something that the Sierra Club did talk about very closely.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We actually had the tenants in mind. We did it out of support to them because we felt that we wanted to give them first dibs on any available buildings out at Alameda Point before they're leased to somebody else.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we did not want them to be displaced should funding transpire in the meantime? Because I know that the lease, you can pull it at any time within five years. I think that's what it says in the least, that it's can be retractable at any time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I was assuming that was because of in case funding is available for the to create the park. So we certainly wouldn't want to displace the tenants in a hurry and we definitely do not want to lose these tenants from Alameda Point.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So the timeframe that we came up with was strictly in support of the tenants. And we it's unfortunate that it has come out that the Sierra Club is put in an animosity position because that was not our intention at all.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It was to be supportive. So that counts if the council has another idea to make the deep Dave Park plans solidified tonight that coincides with this lease. We are of course, open to hear something else. But. But. To continue the status quo without any action tonight will just show that nothing is going to change on the ground'",
        "'speaker_1': '. So we encourage you to do something tonight to show that you support De Pave Park. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And Richard Banger. And he's our last speaker.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I just have a clarifying question was, um, we're not considering Dave Park tonight. Correct. Okay. Just the lease for building 29. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mayor. Members of the council and city staff. This area on the west side of the seaplane lagoon. Currently there's a what I would call a conflict of interests. We have an approved plan, but we also have existing tenants.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And. I want these tenants to stay at Alameda Point. Small businesses like like theirs. They need help. They need help more than Google does. Google Mcconney. Is gambling with stockholders money that they may have something to sell. The artisans at Building 29 are actually producing products.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If people buy their viable business, they're not speculating that they might sell something. So I want them to stay. But the conflict here is that. The plan that was approved in 2014 for the waterfront at Alameda Point. That wasn't.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Created by the Sierra Club or by any other single individual or group. It was created by a consultant that the city hired and paid a quarter of $1,000,000 to. So the plan was approved. Building 29 was not part of the long range plan.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Now, I sympathize with with the the tenants and the landlord. It's not fun to move. But this, whether it's lease is two years, three years, four years or five years. It doesn't guarantee that they're going to be there five years from now, four years from now or three years from now.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Because, number one, there's a clause in the lease that says either party can cancel the lease without cause. Running in tandem with that is if the city is successful in getting grant money to build the park. The approved plans say that the buildings can be torn down when funding is available for the park.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So this lease will you if you approve, two years, three years, four years or five years? It's not guaranteeing that these businesses are going to be here in three, four or five years. In fact, if you don't start looking now, five years from now, they may be moving to Oakland, Hayward or Union City or who knows where'",
        "'speaker_3': '. So you can't package all this into this lease. But I think it is a good time right now to start thinking about how are you going to make a positive step to start implementing Deep Park? And some people may say, well, just.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Focusing on this one building. You're doing it piecemeal. Well, that hasn't stopped us from starting piecemeal with the sports complex. We're not going to wait till we have another $15 million to start sports complex. You know, there's $5 million coming from the developer side, and we're going to start that very soon.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we can take a small step here. And I hope you would figure out something that would get us on that path. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. All right. So he's our last speaker on this item, council members and vice mayor.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think the.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Two things that I want out out of this is one as I want the businesses to stay in Alameda point. And two is I want the park. And the park is in. The plan is a plan that was approved by this city after numerous public hearings and council approval.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And it doesn't include Building 29. So one of the things that I'd like this council to consider is and I think the five year leases is appropriate for what might have to be done to accomplish both of these goals.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'When I was looking at the revenues that this lease would generate. It's about $250,000, give or take, over those five years of the cost of demolishing. Building 29 is about $300,000, give or take. And that's a key step in getting grants and paving paving the way for the park, the park opening the opening the process up to'",
        "'speaker_9': 'establish the park. That being said, I don't want to lose these businesses or this community from Alameda Point and there are other buildings at Alameda Point that could take this, but it's not an insignificant effort to move an operation like this.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And that won't happen two years. So I think two years is an unrealistic time timeline. I think the five year lease gives us time to do a comp to do take steps to accomplish both of those goals. So I'm asking staff, oh, what would be the appropriate vehicles to to accomplish both of those goals with the goal'",
        "'speaker_9': 'number one, of moving the community to another location? Number two is removing Building 29. Setting the stage for expanding the wetlands and working on that southwest section of of this Pave Park.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Can I just ask a question that follows along with that? We've been talking a lot about or hearing a lot about Dave Park, and as I understand from Ms. Wooldridge, who is both interim assistant city manager, but also the director of Recreation Parks.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's a park that is under her department's jurisdiction. Could we just hear a little bit from her about the funding and just to enlighten all of us in making her decision.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'A good that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Until you hear the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Answer, I think it's appropriate to let the vice me.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Go. Okay. I think it's all related, but sure.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But I would like to take this in steps. And one of the things that I'd like to to understand is because one of the thoughts that occurred to me is, is the lease revenues that come from this building and be set aside for the demolition of the building.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I'd like to focus first on Mike Tyson shares comments. I think it's important to let the.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. Okay. So two questions. One, about relocation of existing tenants. And I'm going to refer that question to Ms.. Marcano about what is available out there. And I'm sure she's been thinking about this, the removal of Building 29 and the proceeds.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I would like to speak to that. I'll let her talk first. But I think it is related to vice mayor or excuse me, Councilmember Ashcraft question about other things we have in our list of priorities on parks. But I'll reserve that until Mr. McConnell is done.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I really want us to focus on the vice mayor's comments. Questions first. We can take them in order. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening, Annette Mchunu from the Community Development Based Fees Department. So relocating the existing tenants, that's always a priority for staff because it's the best economic strategy is to retain businesses versus going to try to recruit new businesses.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm. They're currently in our stock. There probably isn't a building that would meet the this this use. However, we are negotiating with a tenant a a developer who does exactly what these leases creates these creative spaces. It's not a food and beverage focus.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so there might be opportunity to do some sort of transition from building 29 to this new tenant if that lease is approved by the council. That would be the only thing that could potentially, I think, meet the needs.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I mean, the thing that most people think about allow me to point is that, oh, we got all those buildings. But we are actually in the process of moving people out of buildings to make way for development. So.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So our our stock is shrinking. And also these these tenants need they have a specialized need with overhead cranes and and also the ability to locate these uses next to each other. The requirement of the structure has to be just right.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So because building 29 is this big concrete thing, it works for them. And so it is a priority for us to think about trying to relocate these tenants. Vice Mayor. And it is something that we will we will continue to make a priority and.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There's some other things that we're trying to do to create more spaces at Alameda Point, more creative spaces, but I don't know quite the horizon for that. It's not it's not next year. It might be in the next five years.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Vice Mayor, did you have.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'No, I think Ms.. McConnell's last comment about the five year time frame. Is is two years is not enough to accomplish what? It would take to meet that goal. It would take something more perhaps in the next five years.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And then you had questions for.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right. So the second question, which is about removing Building 29 and and taking the proceeds over over the five year period to demolish Building 29. So I'm sure those proceeds are spoken for and I'm looking at Miss Ott.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I think the larger question is really for us on staff, and I think this is where Ms. Wooldridge can chime in here, which is we have some already some significant priorities in the area of parks and just to name a few, Jean Sweeney Cruise Park, which has been on the drawing board for a very long time'",
        "'speaker_1': '. We have estuary park, we have internal boat ramp. Those are all things that are already have we've already been directed to make sure those things are happening. Adding on to that now is Deep Park. Now does it mean that we are not permitted to be D Pave Park?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But there's only so much that we can do in the time that we have and with our limited resources. So I'm just putting that out there to this council. So you recognize we have a very serious plight not only to construct parks, but then to maintain them there.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes, and I understand that. And I think the horizon for executing D Pave Park in the Wetlands is a long one and we have to take steps to it. And I don't want to I would rather apply the logic that we did when we.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I spent $1,000,000 to buy the Beltline and invest the million plus in the legal costs to get us in the position to buy that. Even though we were strapped then because having 22 acres of park in the middle of the city was worth it and it's a long horizon.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We're also it's not a question of whether staff is committed or this council's committed. Our plan commits us to this park. And unless this council or a future council changes that plan, we're committed. So I'd like to get the ball rolling and.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Make sure that we've got real milestones that that put us along the path to get us to the park and the time that it will take to provide the time that it will be needed to provide money to maintain the park.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It's quite a ways out. But unless we start putting the pieces together, just like the acquisition of the Beltline property that sets up Jane Sweeney Park, the act was the execution of this plan depends on that building going away.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So what I would recommend, because we're talking money and money does come into your conversation soon because we're going to be doing, starting in March, our mid-cycle review for our next fiscal year, $250,000 is a significant amount of money.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I think what we can do is I can ask Ms.. Ott and Ms.. Marcano to take a look at that. But I mean, that means that now that money is not going into the base reuse department.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so there are other things that will have to come off the table. So that's something that this council has to decide if that's a priority, and we can bring it back at that time. All right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Any other council members member. Did you want to speak now?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'm just not sure if we're ready to have that discussion today as part of the lease. I mean, I think I'm happy we should consider the lease, you know, on its own, within the four corners of the lease, and then kind of defer that that discussion to another time without making any commitment.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I mean. The exact number is 258 to 4708. Just because I did add it up. Tony sorry to do it, if that's okay. But, you know, I see nothing that I've heard today that would make me want to vote against this lease.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I mean, I think these are the type of jobs that we want to not only create in Alameda with our maker spaces and our incubator spaces, but these are the jobs we want to keep in Alameda. And I haven't I have yet to hear a plan.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Mr. McConnell. You said we don't have a space for for these businesses now. So I mean. I'm perfectly happy with going with the five year lease and ready to vote to approve it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Member de.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'SAC. Thank you. The question before us tonight is whether to move forward with the lease or not, whether to move forward it as is or or not. And in a modified or in a modified fashion, I think the answer to that question stands on its own.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think this is a valuable project. I think the type of activity that's there is the type of activity that not just here in Alameda Point, but in the United States that we want to encourage in order to encourage small, artisanal craft manufacturing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You need to build the appropriate space for for such activities. It's very difficult. And fortunately, at Building 29, a number of like minded entrepreneurs found a place where they can work with each other and as indicated by the homemaker, you know, work with nature as well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I think for me, the answer to the question is that we should move forward. I would encourage vice mayor, Battery City or I don't know if you or council member Ashcraft, if they're so interested on a parallel track separate from this, to move forward with some kind of council community referral as to how to begin to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'implement the DE Pave Park. But at least, you know, we would have started this. So. I'm ready to move forward.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Remember Ashcroft?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mayor Spencer. Thank you for all the speakers. Whenever I'm out and about and this week, I've had an opportunity to visit some other job sites in our city and the main island. Not at all made a point, but it was really intriguing hearing from all of you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I am going to Google you, Mr. Brink, but the we have a lot of talent here in Alameda. And I do think that added Alameda point, we have a rather unique situation when you just think of all the creativity that's going on from the high tech to the Spirit Valley and the food and beverage purveyors and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'these artisans and craftspeople. And we I know a number of us on the council are concerned about the loss of jobs in the face of development. This is a little bit different because, yes, this is the future site of a park, but I don't see the D paved park plan and a five year lease for Building 29'",
        "'speaker_4': 'is mutually exclusive propositions. I spent a little time talking with Jeannot this week is the zero added Alameda point and and I also talked from to Ms. Wooldridge from time to time. We, we definitely have this park and many others on the horizon.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's another conversation for this council to make if we're going to take away money from the parts that are already in the queue. But Ms. Wooldridge is also quite a genius at getting us grant funding and perhaps the Sierra Club can be out there beating the bushes too.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I don't know what all the opportunities are for funding, but the point is that the work will most likely be done in phases when it comes to doing the park and there's nothing that says the first phases can't take place farthest out from the building.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so at this point in time, I, I prefer to follow the recommendations of our staff. They're out there on a daily basis. They know the situation. And yes, our lease revenues are spoken for. If we decide to defer divert them for some years, that's a council decision, just not before us tonight.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But at this point in time, I could not support eliminating jobs and lease revenue. And again, these are unique uses that are have found their their way to Alameda point it's it's recycling it's free use of existing buildings and so I'm going to support this ordinance in the five year term.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then I just want to add a little footnote. This is directed to you, Ms.. And Ms.. Mercado. You know, you've done a couple of really cool tours out to Alameda Point. We did a bicycle tour one time and we did a walking tour maybe a year ago.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So maybe the next time we do a tour, if we could. And if you all would be willing, it sounds like you'd be willing to open your doors and have the public come in, because I don't want you to be the best kept secret in town.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think not only our local residents, I think folks in the in the surrounding Bay Area would be very interested to see see what you're doing out there and maybe become your customers. So that's that's my ask. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I'm prepared to support this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So when you look at Deep Park, I have a question. So I think it was last council meeting, we had the speaker come and say that I think this is the area where they want to drive back. This is the area where you cut through the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Was it here it is right here. Okay. So this so personally, I would like us to try to take steps. While the building is there to make this area more accessible to the public.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We're in the process of removing the pedestrian gate to allow cars to go through.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So I think that's a big step. So I appreciate that. And then we'll be able to take pictures to that because that was another complaint that we've heard periodically.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Currently, people can walk through there and this was the area that we put the fencing in to try to prevent vandalism, car shows, things like that. But we hear the public and we hear from you. We want to make it more accessible.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we are going to to make it car accessible.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So I appreciate that. And that's important to me and I think it's important to our public. And so stop thinking that we have to demolish this building in order for the public to have access to this area.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is is not true. We are working on giving this area more accessibility, you know, giving the public more accessibility to this area. And I think that is a big step in regards to this building. I've never been inside this building.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I appreciate Member Ashcroft's idea. Maybe it could be like an open house or something. I don't even know that the city has to be involved in it, but I know that I've been there are open, you know, open studios throughout town, different artists have.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So maybe it's more like just like an open studio or something like that. That doesn't necessarily have to involve staff in regards to staff's plan of our steps moving forward with this park. I think that that's. Separate issue, and I don't know when that will circle back.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I do know that and I that we have many other parks, that we have a lot of work to do, significant work and. This is just one of them. So I think maybe it would be appropriate at some point to show us what the plan is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But there really is a plan. And not only is it limited money, it's also limited staff time. And we really do want the parks to be done well. And so I don't think you can doing all of them at once, as much as we'd like to have that done.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But that doesn't mean that we won't get to this just like it doesn't mean that we're never going to get to cruise the park even then, I think, which is where I live near. We've been waiting since my kids were little and now they're, you know, in their twenties.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So sometimes it takes a while to get to these parks. It doesn't mean that we're giving up on our parks. It just means that for us in this manner, you know, we have so much staff and so much money.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I do plan to support this and I appreciate trying to open up this area so that the public can have access in the meantime. And I'm confident that this doesn't that moving forward with this lease doesn't mean that we're not committed as a city to Deep Pave Park.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I am concerned about trying to find new space or these tenants. I think it's very important, as you've heard from other council members and I'm sure you'll hear from our community, we like having these craftsmen here. And so that to me has to be part of moving, trying, trying our hardest as a staff to accommodate them'",
        "'speaker_0': 'somewhere so that we don't lose that part of who Alameda is. But I do think that's real important. So I appreciate staff's effort, too, and trying to help them figure out how to relocate. And then I think it I think that they can stay there until we need them to move.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I don't think we need to demolish the building way ahead to being able to do anything else. And I think we can. Get access and improve access while the building is there operating supporting our craftspeople. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So a question to staff, maybe the city attorneys. How do we get that? That sentiment, the sentiment that that building is not going to be there forever. And at some point people are going to have to leave people who we want to have at Alameda Point.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'How do we get that high on the priority list so that there's a report back so that there's progress toward that goal? We have a five year window with this lease. So I personally am asking the question if we have this five year window with this lease.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'How do we.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I and from Mitch McConnell said it's going to take five plus years. How do we get that so that it's it's not just something that slips to the bottom of the pile, but is something that we actually accomplish as a goal.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think you do counsel referral because at this point I'm not.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Asking the staff.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To give direction.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, I'm sorry. Would that be in the form of a council referral? But because I don't think you really I don't think there's necessarily three councilmembers that want to prioritize demolishing the building ahead of being able to help it with the paperwork.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It doesn't sound like that's what the vice mayor is suggesting. I think he's just suggesting he wants to make sure that the tenant he just wants to make sure that the tenants recognize that at some point, you know, we won't be renewing their lease.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right. I think that's just want to moralize that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I think that's already in the plan. No, I don't know.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Let me just.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'A comment was made about being able to terminate the lease. There is a provision in the lease that either party on 12 months notice can terminate the lease. But so that I understand. But I think the point is that they have heard you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They've clearly heard you. They're all here nervous and telling you how nervous they are. So I think the tenants understand you've heard this Mchunu tell you how she's working with trying to come up with a plan on where to move these people.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So my recommendation would be not to try to do anything different to the lease, but go forward in approvals and that you will hear back from staff. And I think what the city manager was suggesting is we don't necessarily need a council referral.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We heard you will come back and report in leasing, leasing program and projects how we're.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Moving forward with that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Oh, okay. I, I understand that. And I think the five year lease is something I support. It's though I want the parallel track to be a little bit more than coming back and reporting to us. I'd like to.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I'm asking you what it's going to take to make it a priority and a priority, among other priorities that's ranked somewhere.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And just for clarification, that the priority you're speaking about is the paved park.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It's related to the paved park. It's more directly related to Building 29.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That is demolishing the building or is it figuring out where a deep park is in relation to other parks?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We know.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's what I'm not sure what you're speaking.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'About.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It's demolishing the building.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, so that's what I thought they might get about. But let me. So that's the first I want to clarify. You're really asking, how do we prioritize demolishing the building?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So that's why I said earlier that I don't think that we necessarily have three votes to prioritize demolishing a building ahead of coming up with when we're actually going to need the building demolished. In regards to how does that fit in with the building of the paved park?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Because I personally would not want to demolish a building just to have it be demolished when we haven't figured out when we're going to be able to do bigger improvements that require that. I think there are things that we can do to make that area more accessible.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we have a lot of other park work we're doing. So so that's why I was saying that. I don't know if that's the ask, how do we prioritize that? I would think it does need to be a referral.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It backs it back up a little bit from that because. If we have five years of five year lease and at the end of that five years we have no plan for what happens, then it kind of rolls out and the part gets rolled out with it because.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That that building is right next to the wetland. And part of the removal of that building is a key in getting outside funding to expand that wetland. So I think that it's not as simple as I just want the building torn down.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That's its that's not it. I want to make sure that when the building is ready to be taken down, we don't have a problem with losing tenants.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So Vice Mayor Matt, R-S.C.. I think the mayor is actually right. We are now veering too far off of what we have on the agenda.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And there'll be a council referral.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That made that yes member.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'd like to move approval of the ordinance approving a lease and authorizing the city manager to execute documents necessary to implement the terms of a five year lease for the Dreyfus Capital Partners of California LLC for Building 29, located at 1701 Monarch Street at Alameda Point second grade.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Any Council comments? All those in favor. I. I. Motion carries unanimously. And it's just this is require a second reading. I'll come back, right? Yes.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'To second reading.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Now settle. Come back. All right. We are moving through this agenda. We've made it to item six tonight.'",

    "Recommend Approval of the AC Transit Service Expansion Plans Buena Vista Avenue/Line 19 Alternative. (Public Works 310)": [
        "'speaker_1': 'Regulation recommendation to approve the AC Transit Service Expansion Plan, Buena Vista Avenue Line 19.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Good evening, Madam Mayor and members of the City Council. I am Gayle Payne, the city's transportation coordinator. And this agenda item is pertains to AC Transit Service Expansion plan and we are in a fortunate position and that AC Transit can fund one additional bus line in the city of Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And they have provided us with three options. And the city the city staff, as well as the Transportation Commission, recommend city council approval of the Buena Vista Avenue. That's one of the three routes. And we had Transportation Commission.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They actually approved this last week. And so verbally, we're providing you with their responses. And the second bullet and the third bullet pertained to two additional requests for your approval. And one has to. The second bullet has to do with funding.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Should stay local. If in the future AC transit were to cut and a bus line in Alameda. Then those savings should be placed into an addition. And only within the city of Alameda. The last bullet has to do with transfers between bus lines are no longer free.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so to cost out what it would take to have free transfers for Alameda is for clipper card holders. So those are the two additional requests that the Transportation Commission requested last week of you. So I'm giving that as a verbal.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so I just want to step back a little bit and just provide a brief a brief overview of the service expansion plans, goals, AC transit. With this expansion plan plan, they want to increase frequency, increase reliability. And keep in mind that back in 2010, they were forced to reduce bus service because of the economic downturn.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So now we are in a very fortunate position with the passing of Measure B in November 2014, it increased the transportation sales tax from half cent to one $0.01. And so that allows this service expansion plan to occur.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'AC Transit staff drafted a plan. They held community meetings, one in Alameda in October of last year and then in November held public hearings. They were going to AC Transit Board was going to be requested to approve this plan in December.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They did postpone that until this January. And it turns out they did approve the service expansion plan. However, they did vote to postpone the three Alameda alternatives to allow for the city of Alameda time to provide our highest priorities as a formal votes for a transportation commission.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They did that this week, and that's what we're asking you to do tonight. And then the transit board, they will approve in spring. And then this additional bus line will run either starting in summer or in December. What is he transit board did do?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They did approve the service expansion plan. A few items did pertain to alameda. One is to maintain the existing line o alignment on santa clara and also to modify line 31. And this map shows that line 31, which is the west end line would.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Travel in Alameda landing. And it also would be changed to go to Lake Merritt Bart and Laney College. And that allows for students traveling between College of Alameda and Laney College to just take one bus line to get between the two schools.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And that happens quite frequently. Students take classes at both schools. The third change for line 31 is now it goes directly to Highland Hospital, and that's our trauma center. So that's really important here in East Oakland. So that's that would be.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'City of Alameda is one and only direct bus line to Highland Hospital. Back to the postponed alternatives. There are three alternatives options that AC transit has presented us. We need to choose one and the first two pertain to across island connections to the Main Street Ferry terminal.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The second one pertains to restoring line 19 along the northern waterfront property development area. I was going to go real quickly through the three maps. This alternative number one is the first Main Street ferry terminal Cross Island connection.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And it starts will start here at Main Street Ferry Terminal. It goes right. It would run down stargell, Webster Street and then go by with school in the shoreline area where the dense housing is. And then Fruitvale Bart.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The second Main Street Ferry Terminal, Cross Island Connection. Again, it would start. Main Street Ferry terminal. Instead of going stargell webster. It would go. Main Street. And by the academy. And in front of internal high school and central.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then loop down to Fruitvale. Bart. The third and last alternative is the Northern Waterfront Alternative Restoring Line 19 along Buena Vista Avenue. And it would start instead of Main Street Ferry Terminal. It would start in downtown Oakland, where the downtown Oakland BART is run along Buena Vista Avenue to Fruitvale Bart.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'No staff and Transportation Commission. We we do recommend city council approval of the alternative number three, which is appoint a Vista Avenue alternative. We feel like it has more potential to relieve congestion because of all the connections in downtown Oakland, Easy Transit connections as well as downtown Oakland BART.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And there's also partnership opportunities with the developers. So AC Transit has they have enough money for a 30, 30 minute frequency with potential developer contributions. During peak periods, we can increase that frequency to say 20 minutes. And so that's a true public private partnership and that's much better we see than a bunch of different private shuttles that'",
        "'speaker_5': 'only are are meant for the individuals living in the new developments and for the street crossing shuttle right now. STAFF We go after grants every year, every other year to keep that shuttle running. It's we're really cobbling money together.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's not a long term solution to a better long term solution, we feel, is to hand pass the baton over to AC Transit. We do support the creation of a Cross Island connection to the Main Street Ferry terminal.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We do look forward to continued partnerships with AC transit as well as the ferry folks, the Water Emergency Transportation Authority, to continue to look for revenue sources and to really figure out what that route should be. Because there's we've had several requests from the Academy School and Tunnel High School and would school to have a Cross Island'",
        "'speaker_5': 'connection. And maybe there's a way to to meet all of their needs. The budget comes from Measure B, B and potentially developer contributions. If we can get that frequency up during the peak periods, that's that's how that could happen.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then the city would pay for the cost of restoring those bus stops and also making them accessible. And again, the recommendation, city staff recommendation, along with Transportation Commission requesting city council approval of that Cannabis Two Avenue Northern Waterfront development route with the additional Transportation Commission requests to have the funding stay local and also to cost out'",
        "'speaker_5': 'free transfers for Alameda. And that's the end of the report. If you have questions. I also wanted to say Jennifer. She is the management staff on this has been supporting me as well as Andrew Thomas. So we've been working together as a team on this effort.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We have Robert Del Rosario of AC Transit here in the audience. He is available to answer questions. He's the planning director. Thank you. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'A staff, do we have any speakers on this? All right. I have.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'A question.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Vice Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'A a question on the BP moneys that are funding this extension or this addition, are those Al Alameda City designated moneys?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. So district wide, what AC transit has is enough money for a 14% increase district wide. And so what what that provides in the city of Alameda is one additional bus line running at a 30 minute frequency.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So it's not that funding wasn't specific for Alameda, but the proportion that the money provided in additions. This is our portion of that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And this will start, if I understand correctly, in the summer cycle when they make the route change.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Early in the summer cycle. And then it could be.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And that's why we have to meet now, make the decision now so that they can hit that window. Correct. And not defer it to the fall cycle.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's that's what we're trying to do.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Real quick. As my understanding, the vice mayor and member de SOG are council members that serve on this committee. So they were able to weigh in on this plan.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Right. And so we do have an inter liaison committee between city council member representatives, as well as the transit board member. And we've had a October meeting and January meeting. We talked about this item.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes. And Madam Mayor, just to fill you in, because I think you were on your way to Washington. I gave the report. Is that councilmember disorganized? And I were both at the liaison committee when AC Transit made the request to Alameda to make a decision on the three options and a staff had.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Had arranged it so that the Transportation Commission could do their review and make a preference so that it could come to us before that deadline that AC Transit had of March, so that we could get in the summer cycle because they do route changes in the summer, in the fall.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And if we missed that window, we would miss out on our 14% of Measure B money for like six months. So without it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'When you're speaking says, is this something that this is what you wanted.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'This is what we.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Would be asked.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'To take back to this this council to make this decision?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. So this was your because I know you go to these meetings. This is why I want to just confirm that this was the last one.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'All right.'",
        "'speaker_9': '19 council member days.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, thank you. Right. Let's see. I just want to begin by saying a big thank you to AC Transit staff member who is here, Mr. Dela Rosa Rosario, as well as the board members, Mr. Chris Peoples and and and Mrs. Ortiz on the board on inter liaison on board with Alameda and AC Transit.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I also believe, I guess officially winter the water transit is there to or at least to attend the meetings. So we really appreciate them giving us this time to go over these three items. Back in, I believe, late fall staff presented this issue earlier, the recommendation of which was to go with the the bringing back the'",
        "'speaker_2': '19 line. At that time, I felt that I agreed with staff. And let me just make sure to say that tonight I still agree with staff. I recognize that residents would like to see the two lines that go towards the shuttle.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But my understanding is at least one of the lines isn't a new line altogether. But it's it's it's an enhancing a line that that's already there. But it's just, you know, change, maybe modifying the route and giving it more frequency.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But nonetheless, we wouldn't be taking away that line. But the challenge, though, is along the northern waterfront, there was a light line 19. And in my opinion, this is an area that is underserved when it comes to bus transit.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In addition, as we all know, development is contemplated in that area and we will need to have reliable transit solutions. So on that note, two quick two related questions is one is. The 19 lines. Should it be re re done?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Will it altogether relieve the developer of, say, the Del Monte Project or its now terminals or any other projects in that area? Relieve them of providing a physical shuttle, but instead have them contribute towards this new line. 19.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'A And the related question, follow up is B. I see that you're you're referencing a 20 minute headway, which is better than a 30 minute headway. But is there any calculations as to what it would take to get us to a 15 minute headway on 19?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If the 19 is to be renewed. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. So let me take the first question about the developers and that they have requirements, transportation demand management requirements, program requirements. Each development is a little bit different in the northern waterfront area, and yet they all have a transit requirement, so to provide some type of transit.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so the idea is that instead of providing their own shuttle peak period shuttle, that they would contribute to an AC transit and improve the AC transit route and to be in partnership. And we think that for the money that they're providing for the shuttles and it's just during their district wide peak period and that they we'",
        "'speaker_5': 'can get up to 20 minute frequency and and this they still would need to work with AC transit and now together with a memorandum of understanding with them to do that. But they we do have one letter of support from Tim Lewis and that says that we look forward to partnering with AC Transit to make this line'",
        "'speaker_5': 'a success. So we and they're the developer for the Del Monte Warehouse Project and it's an all terminals property.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Let me just quickly say, while I would love to see a 15 minute headway, I'm not tonight going to suddenly, you know, demand that we have a 15 minute headway. But I just want to know that that that perhaps that's something to consider if there's a funding or when it comes to negotiating further with the developers.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The final question is the maps that you had as the night. If the 19 is to be renewed, does it go up Webster Street after cutting through or does it go up constitution?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we're that's one request that we did provide to the is to AC transit is that line 19 we would want it to restore to go through marina village and so that we could try to capture more potential development monies and developer requirements there.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And that's also where Calder of Alameda they have an annex and so to try to connect keep the connection between valley MI two annex and college of Alameda. That would be a goal as well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We were cautioned. We were cautioned that we're not tweaking these plans. This is not a hearing to redesign the route. This is a hearing to pick one.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Member Ashcraft.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. And so I think you may have answered the question that councilmember did suggest that. I notice that on page eight of the staff report talks about an opportunity exists to pursue a partnership between AC transit, the city of Alameda in the northern waterfront PDA developments whereby the developments would provide operating funds for the line to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'increase frequency to 20 minutes. So that's what you're talking about, which I think is good. And also, when you talk about Marina Village, we all heard the exciting news recently that cost Plus is moving its headquarters from Oakland in about a year from now, I think, and bringing with it 400 jobs.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so, you know, presumably some of those folks will be will be riding the bus. I hope they'll decide to live in Alameda, too. Or maybe they already do. I you know, this is one of those items where you wish there were more money because all of the alternatives sounded good.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'However, I place huge stock in what our transportation commission, our council members on the liaison committee are recommending. I know that, you know, if there were more money, it would be nice to be able to serve some of these school routes, the ferry terminal, certainly.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I do recognize that the Northern Waterfront and Buena Vista are are not currently served by busses. And we do have new development already going in there. A long way to Vista. So I think that this can help alleviate some of that traffic.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I also want to just extend a thank you to AC Transit staff, Mr. Del Rosario and the two AC Transit Board members, as Ortiz and Mr. Peeples, who came to Alameda several times to meet with the different council members and answer all of their questions.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I am certainly prepared to support this this recommendation for the staff's choice and Transportation Commission's choice of the Restoring the Line 19. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Everybody.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. Just a couple quick questions for you. So can we where can we clarify with this encompassing the existing estuary crossing shuttle service actually means to the estuary shuttle? I mean, is it going away then or.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Right. So right now it's been in operation since 2011 11.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And it goes between Lake Merritt Bart and West Alameda and it turn it and Marina Village and it turns around at Wind River. Wind River does contribute 20,000 a year towards that shuttle. And the majority of that money, which is about 200,000 a year budget comes from grants.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And it's it's always we're always cobbling together to try to fund that shuttle. And it's been a great way to close the gap in that area and to provide better service for bicyclists because there's ten we retrofitted the bus, so ten bikes can be on board at one time.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And yet it's. It's not the best long term solution and that the air district is no longer looking to fund shuttles as much as they have in the past. And that's where a lot of our moneys have come from.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So this line 19, the route would be very similar and on the west part and within we're hoping within Marina Village. So it would capture those riders that are currently using it and the Wind River monies would go into increasing the frequency of that restored line 19.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So are they going to have a goal that the 20,000? Is that a commitment or is that a maybe or.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'For Wind River, you mean? So that's a special situation that happened a long time ago. That Wind River is required as part of their transportation demand management moneys to provide us about 20,000 a year to the city directly.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So it is up really up to us how we want to use that money. Yet we want to work with Wind River. So we we want to sit down with them and see if they want to maybe be part of a of an upcoming transportation management association and maybe have their moneys go to that entity that would'",
        "'speaker_5': 'then fund fund to improve a. Improved peak service, AC Transit, peak service and restored line 19. So that's one option or it's or the city could provide those monies directly. So there's there's options moving forward with that money from winter.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I think I understood from my colleagues that questions that there would be contributions from the developer to help with this line too. So it doesn't hurt overall this line 19 restore cause less for AC transit because if you put wind river money in there if you put.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Right so all these developer that's a that's a good point is they have enough money in transit to fund one additional bus line at 30 minute frequencies. If we have developer moneys that would improve that and we're thinking for peak periods, say up to 20 minutes is what we're hoping to achieve.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So that's what the developer money is would do is to improve the frequency during peak periods.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And one more question. This is more for AC transit, because one thing that concerns me about this alternative recommendation is that we're not servicing the ferry terminal. So, I mean, there's kind of a wishy washy, washy comment in the staff report that we asked them to continue to commit staff resources to plan across island connection to the'",
        "'speaker_7': 'main street ferry terminal to make what what is AC transit willing to commit on that today.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening, Robert De Rosario, Director of Service Development. So all these you translate has that we can't commit financially is to the additional one route for shall be can't commit to two other things but we're happy to explore funding.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Options with city of.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Alameda with we to look at different policies that we can encourage more revenue to be generated maybe from parking or some other revenue sources.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I mean, not to be harsh or anything. So then staff request that you commit staff resources on transit side to plan. I mean, is this basically. Sorry, we don't have the funding and we're not going to do that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I mean, the operating funds.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Do not exist for easy transit to do.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Although we love all three options, we do not have the revenue right now to do all all three. So we are asking the Council to select.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'One or even two to continue to plan this Cross Island connection.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Oh, we're constantly in coordination with Alameda staff on planning efforts. So yes, we would. We are committed to actively, actively planning and refining plans to figure out a way that we can serve the free, but we don't have the operating dollars to actually provide the bus on the road.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. Thanks for clarifying.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I mean, just add to that is that we are trying to come up with some funding options and one of which on us is how to generate money, additional moneys. And so we're we're looking and that's what we're brainstorming right now actively with them.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And one could be charging for parking to try to generate that revenue. And and then we can brainstorm a little bit more about what else to do on that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. But just that should be a priority of AC transit if we're going to adopt the restore of line 19.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Everyday.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So two quick points on the very interestingly on my office after the farmers market on Saturday, this past Saturday, I have the last Thursday of the month at Blue Danube Cafe on Park Street and also at the Saturday following Saturday.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Interestingly, there were four separate occasions when persons approached me about the ferry and and for the most part, I guess for whatever reason, there's a really big concern about the ferry down by along the estuary about parking. So that seems to be a hot button issue.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And in talking about busses, not everyone, but I think two of them mentioned that their experience with busses in the past is that sometimes the busses are on such a tight schedule. I mean, it is just the way it is.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And sometimes it doesn't necessarily work for the or the persons there. So if there were to be busses that go to this to the ferry, that one of the things that needs to be considered is making sure that bus drivers kind of understand that ferry people don't just come on and go off.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so so but the second issue I'm.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sorry to interrupt, I need to make have this motion made before 1030 and that clock is actually wrong. 1031 So, so we need a motion to consider. We actually have these remaining items 60 for the environmental cleanup, 6fa conveyance, six g rent and then we have two referrals and we need four affirmative votes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have a motion moved. So all those in favor of.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'How many of these are mandatory?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Correct. And I appreciate that. How many of these do we need to have heard tonight?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we have existing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That could be.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Moved. We have a guest on 66 F is. Virginia. We need to do that and we have to do rent stabilization. If you want to continue on the 16th and the referrals are probably the only thing that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What about the referrals.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We can we could, we know.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Use a.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Referral.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I, i. Okay. There we.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'All right.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The second point that I want.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To mention, Karis, thank you. You know, unanimously.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The second point that I want to raise is that in mentioning the bus going up Webster Street, it wasn't because I, you know, want to see a redrawn route for the 19 if it's to be adopted. I was just wanting to mention that, you know, as many people know, one of the things I've been doing since August'",
        "'speaker_2': 'is kind of tracking how long it takes to go through the tube at various points in times and videotaping it. But one of the things that that works incredibly well is the bus lane. I mean, for example, you know, if you get to the intersection of Atlantic Avenue and Webster Street and going towards the posi tube at'",
        "'speaker_2': '755, more than likely it's going to take you 10 minutes to go from there to to get to the highway onramp. 880. But as you're in the lot, the largest part of your wait is really not through the tube.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's really queuing up along Webster Street in the direction of the tube. So it does work when suddenly you see the bus go by. And and for those persons who are taking mass transit, I think it's appropriate that, you know, they're getting the this benefit.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So that was the reason why I was mentioning Webster Street.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's a good point. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I have a question. We received an email in regards to. Having the busses connect to BART or Ferry and will this route connect to any of those?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. So it will connect on both ends on the southern southern end or eastern ideal connected through our station, then in northern western. And it'll go into downtown Oakland. Connected to Wall Street by station.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And actually I kind of misspoke because their question went went to why does the line have to go all the way across the island? Can there be other busses that are shorter taking you up Broadway, for instance, or down, down Webster as opposed to having to go across the island?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah, I saw the email as well. It's I mean, I think when you think about the the planning of of routes within Alameda, you're probably most efficient ways to go from east to west because you can capture so much of the neighborhoods and so many of the neighborhoods and then get and get the passengers off of the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'island or to other destinations. I think if we did it the North-South way, we'd probably have to have a bunch more routes and it'd be less efficient.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So I appreciate that. And then in regards to connecting to the ferry, I thought there was discussion at some point just as trying to figure out as a city how to connect to Webster is something to connect to the ferry.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I do think it's important that we try to figure out a way to offer the bus service of the ferry, because that also connects to the shortage. We have not enough parking spaces. Um, so I appreciate that too.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That being said, I also want to commend our council members who serve on this. I appreciate you representing representing our city there. And we have a motion.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To move.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That recommendation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All those in favor. I motion carries unanimously. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Next Item six.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'EA Presentation on Status Report of Environmental Conditions and Cleanup at Alameda Point. And I'm sorry, I get your paraphrase. That's all.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Right. Good evening, Mayor. Councilmembers. I'm going to make a quick introduction. I know we're have a big agenda. This will make this quick. But because we're coming with the conveyance item, we usually every year also come to the council and to the community to give an update on the environmental program.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And I'll make the point. So we're going to make it fast. And I guess the good news and you'll hear from our expert, the city's independent consultant, Peter Russell, that, you know, we are starting to we made the Navy's made a lot of progress and we're receiving a lot of land.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And so there are the issues that are left to resolve are diminishing, which is good news. But the ones that are left are some of the harder ones, too. So Peter Russell is here to give you a quick update to answer questions.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And then our next item is on the conveyance of phase two. So they are somewhat related as well. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Very much. Wonderful. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It evening mayor spencer city of alameda council members and it is peter russell. I'm an environmental consultant for the city. And I my job is to engage with the Navy and the regulators in the decision making for the environmental cleanup.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Mm hmm. The the interest they have in working with me is that they want to know well in advance the ramifications of their decisions on cities ability to reuse the land. In addition, since I started working on this project in 1997, I've been there longer than any of the regulators and any of the Navy people that are'",
        "'speaker_3': 'working on it. So they usually give me a call when they don't know where to find something. And then finally I have the experience and the education to work on it. I have a Ph.D. in environmental engineering from Berkeley, and I worked on other large bases in Tustin and Fisker, Ford and other large, obvious projects like Mission'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Bay in San Francisco and the rail yards in Sacramento. So I am going to breezed through this rather quickly without reading every word because of the late hour. If you want to slow me down or ask questions, I guess that's fine.'"

    "Presentation on Status Report of Environmental Conditions and Clean-up at Alameda Point. (Base Reuse 819099)": [
        "'speaker_3': 'But the outline of the presentation is to go over the background history of the base a little bit and then discuss the various but the two important environmental programs that are being used to clean the base up. The status of the clean up and the transfer and land use covenants to restrict the land where that's necessary, where'",
        "'speaker_3': 'there's not unrestricted use. And then I'll touch briefly on the long term stewardship of the land. Next slide, please. I guess I can do that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I can. Oh, I went the wrong way then.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. So just so you know what Alameda used to look like in 1915, the Alameda point basically wasn't there. So. I guess I don't have a.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There's a laser.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There is I don't think have a battery in this either because they didn't advance it anyway. So. And the figure in the left, there's a North-South rail line or it looks like a road that's roughly where Main Street is today.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And you can see there's very little land that is. Yes. So this is the only land that was original part of the island. From time to time, people would say, well, why doesn't the Navy just go in and clean it up the way it used to be?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That would essentially involve removing Alameda Point, which nobody really wants. During World War two, the Navy started operations here. In 1940, they bought the land from the from the army, and they have expanded it considerably since the current outline over here goes something like this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's roughly a third of the city of Alameda. The Navy did everything from soup to nuts here. When they were here, they did refueling of aircraft, refurbishing of aircraft maintenance, had a large residential operation, automotive repair. But a fuel handling.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The total acreage is about four and a quarter square miles, but 2700 acres, about 40% of it's under water. The Feds decided to close the base in 1993, and the Navy actually left in 1997. So just for comparison of size, very briefly, on the left is a picture of like Merritt.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'On the right, of course, is me to point. Which is about 17 times the size of Lake Merritt. This. This is a little washed out, but this shows the. Various cleanup areas at Alameda Point. So what the Navy did originally, along with the regulators, has reviewed all the documentation that was available for Alameda Point, interviewed all sorts'",
        "'speaker_3': 'of people, decided where the potential to were problems and they investigated them, decided what to do about it if it wasn't clean. And then they have implementing the cleanup. So there are two parallel programs to clean it up.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'One of them is Superfund. The longhand name for it is Cercla or Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act. Where they have. We call it Cercla, but Cercla does not cover petroleum products. Congress specifically excluded that, but the state of California oversees the cleanup of the petroleum issues that at Alameda Point.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The circular part which is the non petroleum had 34 separate areas that were suspected needed to be investigated. Few of them needed no work whatsoever. Some of them need a little work and some of them needed a lot of work.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The decision making on how to investigate it and what work to do is carried out by BCT or the BRAC cleanup team. BRAC is an acronym for Base Realignment and Closure. It's the Navy, EPA, Etsy and Water Board and I attend these meetings as well, which I think is fairly unique among any Navy bases that that there'",
        "'speaker_3': 'are. The Navy's come to accept that it was a little tough at the beginning. We have a restoration advisory board, which is a formal community participation with community members on the board and the BCT members also tend. And participate.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Petroleum Cleanup has 23 corrective action areas, which are generally collections of issues such as a tank farm or whatnot. Here is an area where there was a rather large underground leak, and this is the cleanup operation. It has since been successfully finished.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Both the both the California and EPA have lots of support people both on staff and as contractors. With the state important roles are handled by. Not only the water board and ETSI, but also CDP, which is the California Department of Public Health, to deal with radiological issues and then see Cdph and California Department of Fish and Wildlife'",
        "'speaker_3': '. So the cleanups, the strategy for the cleanup should Alameda point are to use innovative technologies whenever possible ended up as quickly as you can and they usually are able to clean it up. If it's only soil contamination at 1 to 5 years, they can clean it up.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If it's groundwater contaminated as well. The initial active remediation is 1 to 5 years, but there's sometimes a tail where there's some residual contamination that gradually gets treated further over time, and there will be generally land use restrictions until that is completed.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They were also selecting a remedy. They're mindful of the energy impact. The majority of the base is being cleaned up to residential standards. That's unrestricted. The Navy has spent over half a billion dollars out here so far. That's supporting various regulatory agencies, their own efforts, their contractors.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is the amount that they're spending that they have strictly spent and what they expect to spend. They. They also do some local hiring for their cleanups. A lot of the people who do the work are highly specialized and are not from Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But they still stay at Alameda and they eat at Alameda while they're doing the work. So it's it is does have some economic silver lining to it. So the status quo in property transfer. Initially, the city leased about 1000 acres.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'A little over 300 acres were had been transferred before 2011 because of the term one, which was an area that had only been leased, Navy never owned it, which is down south easternmost portion along the shoreline, east housing, Coast Guard housing, all that was transferred before 2011.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'About 1400 acres were transferred in the phase one in 2013. The Veterans Affairs got a large chunk of the runways. Four years ago and about 200 acres are going to be transferred this spring. It's in the phase two.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So here's another washed out figure. So the the blue is the part that's already been transferred to the city. The white the large white part is the is the vai. The white to the north is the sports complex that was also transferred the the pinkish, which includes Seaplane Lagoon and the and the the piers and a few'",
        "'speaker_3': 'other areas around there are going to be transferred that spring. There's a small portion out on the runways as well that's in that transfer. And then the the red and purple or parts are going to be transferred in the future over the next.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Five years say. Another show, the environmental sites. We're going to talk about a few of them that have been particularly active lately. By the way, many of these have been cleaned up just because the colors there doesn't mean that is still a big problem.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Here's our site, one, which is a former landfill. It's the original landfill that was at Alameda Point and it's in the northwest corner of the runways. When they needed to expand the runways, they essentially dug it up and moved it to the southeast corner, which is seed for that landfill.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But at any rate, this this landfill had quite a bit of soil and groundwater remediation work that needed to be done. The groundwater work, as it looks like it's mostly done. There's a little bit more testing to confirm that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And except for revegetation, which is going on now, the soil cleanup is completely done. So the Navy is really proud of that. And they ought to be because they spent a huge amount of money doing it. Seaplane Lagoon has had its remediation essentially completed.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They dug out contaminated sediment in the northeastern north west corners that had become contaminated from from material that came down the industrial waste lines from building five mainly and contaminate the sediment. And the Navy moved about 100,000 cubic yards, tried it, tested it, disposed most of it out.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is part of the remediation landfill. Some of it got hauled off site. In the process of doing that, they found 51. Very small items embedded in the sediment that had radio luminescent paint on them like on it, like on a Timex watch or something in the old times.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'As a result of that which no one knew about when they did the original cleanup decision making, as a result of that, they are amending the the official cleanup remedy to require that any future dredging there be conducted consistent with a sediment management plan which is currently being drafted.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'An approved. And this is the third site that I want to talk about that is that is actually is active now just for reference. Seaplane Lagoon is is over. People going is here. Main Street is here. Atlantic is here.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This is the oval with the airplane right there. So this this blue feature here is groundwater contamination that came mainly from these brown. Hotspots, which is what we'll say, which are where solvents, mainly degreaser, is from. The Navy's operations largely related to this building 3060 got into the groundwater and very slowly migrated over to Seaplane Lagoon.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And Navy is has done considerable cleanup there. They are going to do quite a bit more cleanup above this line. Is land that's going to be transferred this spring. So there was that there was. Some saw contamination there, which the Navy has successfully cleaned up.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There is one small area here that has cobalt in soil that is unacceptable for residential use. So it's going to be used for a park, completely fine for a park. The only other area where there is soil contamination that requires a restriction upon transfer is the small area right here.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In both this case and this case, the reason why the Navy isn't digging it out and hauling it away the same as they did up here is because it is underneath buildings. If it ever makes a difference that this contamination here is actually quite shallow under the building.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It would not be a huge effort to clean it up. Anybody want to do that? But since you're going to put a park there, it doesn't matter. See, this is the. I guess we're talking about four sites tonight.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sorry. So this is this is building five. Which was this along with the site that we've talked about just before, or neck and neck for the most contaminated sites at this point. And that's why the ones that they're still working on.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Low hanging fruit has been already addressed. There is groundwater where these. Blue Circles are that still needs to be cleaned up in order for it to be acceptable for commercial use. Once that's done, the entire footprint of the building will be acceptable for commercial use but not residential.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Same is true for building 400 right here. Those slabs will have to be maintained intact because there is contamination in the soil under them, which is not a problem as long as these slabs are in place. But because they used to drive airplanes on, slabs are over a foot thick.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So nobody's really going to get to it. If anybody has to dig through it, they can get permission to do that so long as they, you know, provide a work plan that shows how they're going to do it safely.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Then restore the floor. Related to this building is an industrial waste line that is shown here. So is building five again. And again, in Building five, they used to work on radio, luminous radio luminescent paints for refurbishing dials and stuff like that that clean their brushes in sinks.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And before the Clean Water Act that all went out in the storm sewer and got routed down to Seaplane Lagoon where it contaminated the sediment. And as they told you, they cleaned that up for. So as a result, is the potential that these lines also were could have been contaminated.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They've done a lot of testing on them and they have shown that the contaminant levels are much lower than where than what they had feared initially. And we're looking at some use restrictions so that if they're all on the streets, if anybody ever digs there, they have to follow certain procedures.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Decision making is not quite done on it. So there's land use covenants in a few areas that aren't available for unrestricted use. This is run by Dtsc since after it's closed, EPA generally federal EPA generally balance out and involves annual inspections, at least in monitoring.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In some cases, it depends upon what the residual material is. And then ditzy sort of remains involved essentially forever if there if there is any contamination that that remains. For example, they they work with this outfit called Pterodactyl so that if anybody ever.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's a permit to dig in order to dig. You have to if to check with utilities and whatnot, it's he gets a call if that location is within an area that has a restriction on it. And then DTC gives me a call or somebody at the city to see whether they've actually.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Whether they're violating the restriction or not. Wherever there is any contaminants remaining, the Navy and the regulators do a five year review just to make sure that the remedy that they have selected remains protective, that there isn't any advancement in science that shows that it's worse than they had thought, or that some other reason, it's just not'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it's just not as protective as they had intended it to be. This is the last slide. So if people want to participate, I strongly urge membership and attendance to the RAB Restoration Advisory Board. The Navy's website is there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The information repository. This wanted me to point in building one. I think that room number may be obsolete, but I don't know the current one. But staff at Public Works and first floor. They'll tell you where it is in the library across the street also has many of the more recent documents.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you for the presentation and council comments. Remember Daisuke?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think the quick comment I just want to say is for the residents of Alameda who are watching or who might watch subsequently via the Internet. This is incredibly important. We, the City Council on behalf of residents, will soon be accepting certain properties.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We have accepted, gone through a similar process previously. Several years ago, I think it was two years ago. And now we're continuing that. So this is incredibly important that we exercise our due diligence and make sure to ask a lot of important questions.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I swear.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Can I ask if there is a any kind of funding from the Navy? Or Department of Defense just to pay for the sediment management that's now required because there was contamination that was previously not found and not remediated in the seaplane lagoon.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I understand that there is insurance or a future development. There's like three levels of insurance that the cleanup. But there's an added burden now of whoever takes that land, which our next agenda item is us for having a sediment management plan if we ever want to dredge it.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And that's an additional cost over and above a standard of. The regular bay restrictions that we have so can address.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yeah. No, no, there isn't. I mean, there's no I mean, the institutional control that was changed in the plans of Peter was talking about was to essentially require this added layer of review. I mean, so there and potential a work plan and approach to how we would do it if we were to dredge in one of so'",
        "'speaker_11': 'that they they are not I mean that's what's put in place is to have to follow those procedures if and when someone does and there is some additional costs related to managing that sediment. I will say, though, that we did as part of our, you know, analysis and due diligence of this whole process for the Seaplane Lagoon'",
        "'speaker_11': 'was actually had conducted a Bathymetric survey updated one which essentially means like a topographical survey of the bottom of the sea plate lagoon and determine that it is a very deep lagoon.

        "'speaker_11': 'And then the second issue is the Marriott ships are very big and require a certain depth. And so what we foresee occurring in the lagoon we have one benefit is it doesn't show very, almost very little falling to none.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'And if a landlord doesn't attend the hearing, the rent increases null and void, and the rent cannot be increased for another 12 months. That's already on our books. The one kind of nuance to this is that with the hearing process under the proposed ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If you've raised your rent, if you're proposing a rent increase 5% or more or above 5%, add someone with an ownership interest must participate in the racketeering. So that's another kind of piece that just kind of taken together with all of the other requirements is really intended to incentive incentivize property owners to keep rent increases at 5%'",
        "'speaker_6': 'or less. You go through a non-binding process if the parties agree. Great. If the parties don't agree and you are and you are in a unit that is subject to Costa Hawkins, is subject to rent control. You can go forward with the binding hearing process and if you are in an exempt unit, a unit that's exempt from'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Costa Hawkins, your appeal process would be to the City Council for a non-binding. Review of the Iraq decision. And then this slide just shows in a little more, you know, kind of going the next step if you end up if one of the parties requests.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The binding hearing process that which would be available for rent increases above 5% for units that are covered by Costa Hawkins. You can go through the back and go to a binding hearing. You have the hearing with the hearing officer.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The hearing officer's decision is becomes the imposed rent. And you. That's your rent. Unless you. Decide to go onto judicial review. So that is just kind of a recap of the the process charts that we had presented on the fifth and that we.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Believe. There was consensus on that. And so really staff is asking that that that that direction be affirmed for us. And then lastly on the data collection, the council felt very strongly about the importance of data collection. And we just wanted to clarify that because we're focusing on increases of about 5% or four tenant initiated cases, that'",
        "'speaker_6': 'that's where we would we would be requiring data for those increases, and we would not be requiring property owners to notify staff of increases that were less than 5%. And this is really kind of striking a balance about the amount of work and the cost versus the effectiveness of of the data collection.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So with that is staff's presentation. I will sit down, take public comment and then happy to return and talk about.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I appreciate that. Okay. And I'm going to call out names and if people could line up and then you have 2 minutes and you will just keep it moving. Okay. I really appreciate that. It'll be Eric Strimling, maybe you, Kevin Yi and then Keith White, Whiteson and then Amanda.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It looks like. Like. So you could line up on this side and then approach. Let's go, Eric. Thank you, sir.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening. Waste is not good morning this time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's right. Let's try to get all these through the evening then quickly.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So very interesting meeting. I just thought along the meeting, the people who are getting the community development block grant, how many of them are renters? How many of them will be able to afford 5% rent increases? How much of the money that we're trying to get to these people will be taken by rent increases by landlords?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'How many of the artists in on Alameda Point would be able to afford a 25 to 30% increase in their rent over the next five years, which is what a 5% per year increase would give them? They have a fixed rent.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's why they can afford to be there. It's why they can predict and build their business. I think tenants in Alameda should deserve the same favor. On the one year leases. The real question is at the end of that lease, is that an eviction?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Standardly a lease ends and it's the end of a contract. And you just say, I'm not really doing a lease and goodbye. If that's the case, then offering a one year lease is a trap. If you don't take it, then you get all of the protections of eviction control.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If you do take it, you're out after a year and you get nothing. So I'd like you to please explicitly put into your ordinance that termination of a lease is an eviction and subject to all of the controls.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Whatever controls you do choose to put on to evict on to evictions. I'd like to point out that 53% of our maidens live in rental units, or 52% of housing units are rental. More than half of your constituents are who you're talking about here.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Landlords constitute maybe 2%. So it's a lot of people and they're living with a 30 day. I mean, they're living with a 60 day possibility of eviction all the time. If you keep the four months, do the math, you're going to get a lot of evictions on December 31st because six months from then is the end of'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the school year. Parents will choose to stay in school and lose the money in order to keep their kid in the school. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Maybe you. Maybe you. All right? And I need you guys to keep going. I'm sorry. We are. You only get 2 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This is quite late and I'll try and keep. Let's see. Or with 2 minutes. And there are so many things we all want to talk. So I don't envy you guys. You have to weigh the delicate balance between apparently 53% of their constituency are tenants and maybe only 47% of their landlords.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So what I invite you to look at is, is a. That were mom and pop businesses. I mean, sure, there are. There are a handful. I think someone earlier said Don Smith had some security concern. Well, there are not a lot of Don Smith.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Most of us are mom and pop. My wife and I have lived in Alameda for 15 years. We we saved up our life savings and bought a property. We rehabbed it, spent literally two years because we bought it in foreclosure and spent hundreds of thousand dollars, including the foundation, made it we made it habitable where it was'",
        "'speaker_3': 'not before. So we're increased the housing stock but for Alameda and it was a Victorian home. So so it's got a nice statue on Lincoln Avenue. And so. The concern that I have is the controls that you're putting that you're considering putting in place prohibit us from being comfortable about being able to sustain our business.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You say, well, this tenant, if it's greater than 5%, will. The the normal landlord tenant relationship is to take care of the tenant because you want a long term tenant, you're going to do the repairs that are necessary.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And because a vacancy is is a big no in our industry. And so you're by putting that 5% threshold in there, for example, what you're doing is you're telling the landlord community to every year raise the rent by 5%.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I don't want to raise it by 5%. I'd rather most times leave it at zero or 2% or something like that. But I'm going to need to keep up with the because I don't know what's coming down the road.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I might have a bad tenant who destroys something. I might have a leaky roof or an earthquake that I can't fund without.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': '2 minutes and that's as much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Appreciate it. Thank you very much, Phoebe. Maybe you?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah. My name is Phoebe. You. Good evening to Mayor, Madam Mayor and the councilman. Thank you guys for staying so late and hear us out. Well, it is there are more than 50% of all Americans are renters. That means less than a little bit less than 50% of all Americans are homeowners.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm not sure 2% or 7% or any percentage of them are landlords. But I've heard enough of landlords telling their stories, just like the gentleman before me. So Alameda has a very tight community. Sorry to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Interrupt. I need you to lower your sign so the people behind you can see or you can go sit in the back row so you're not blocking anyone. Thank you very much. All right. You may continue.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. We have a very tight community here in Alameda and it shows by one example are a measure a parcel tax was voted by 68.1% of the voters in Alameda to pass. The special assessment to only the property owners, which we all voted yes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we will pay $0.32 per square foot by the properties that we own to support our school and our school district. And that means for a property owner who owns a 2000 square foot property, they will pay $640 more property taxes per year.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And for some landlords who owns about 10,000 square foot, maybe eight units are rental property, they will pay extra 30 $200 per year. That's a little bit too short in 2 minutes, I think. Can I finish? I'm just.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sorry. We need to keep moving along.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, you were. I were interrupted.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. All right, go ahead. Go ahead. That's right. That's right. I appreciate that. I don't know if you gave extra time. Right.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much. Thank you. So we voted yes to way more so the majority. Another example is if you are studying the thesis that our HCC has been reviewed for unreasonably increase rent, there are only a handful of landlords does that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The majority of the landlords in Alameda are very reasonable. By strictly rental control in one format is going to penalizing mom and pop landlords like us. So another point I really, really would like to make is the reason, another very valuable reason why we love Alameda is because we have all these historic homes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You know, they are in the styles of or different.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I appreciate that. We have 20 some more speakers to go. So thank you. Next speaker Kevin, you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you. Kevin. And then it'll be Amanda and then William, if I can. Okay. And then Franny and Mark.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Thank you, Major Spencer.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Mayor Spencer, council member of staff, city.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Staff for being here, just like hearing us out. My name is Kevin Yi, and I'm here on behalf of all the all the moms and pops owner in Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Like many, you know.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Small landlords. For years, my wife and I, we weren't able to refinance due to the market value at the time when the rental market was extremely low. And for many years, my wife and I, we were always in the red when we had to go into our own funds to pay the bills.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And it wasn't until one or two years ago that we were starting to break even. I mean, one of the main reasons my wife and I decided to invest in.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Alameda is because is a small towns, a close knit community. And, you know, like life was.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Simpler and there was no rent control over.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Here.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And what I see in bigger companies, corporation or owners that were thought to have 20 to 100 units in a same building.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You know.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They're having to pass, raise, rent.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Substantially or evict with no with no cost.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I mean, everyone knows that in general, cost has been increasing and still increasing everywhere from property tax, property insurance management fee, utility repair and maintenance. I mean, the 5% increase is quite low for small owners that have less units to work with.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I mean, just recently because of the storm, I put up a 20 foot fence with two gate and that cost almost $2,000. And I have several estimates I made that were from local, you know, a handyman. And I compared it with the estimates I had with the licensed contractor.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And they were like 3500 to 4000 for the same fence. I mean, and to get a plumber or locksmith into your place is like $80 just for them to show up. I mean, this is just showing that costs are still increasing and repairs are expensive.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I mean I mean, I'd just like to also mention to know just cause I mean, with my eight years experience that says land or I encounter like tennis that just aren't compliance with the building rules and no matter how hard I try or how do we solve this?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think all.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The tenants I mean, all the landlords had experience, like with tenants that are just noncompliance with the rules that everyone's lives miserable. And because.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Of this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'No, just cause it helped us out tremendously. I mean, I just want to say, you know, that your meeting is on February 16th. I just hope that my next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Amanda. Okay. Let's go. And then after your manabe. William and then Franny. And then Stephanie.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Good evening, mayor and council members. I'm here to represent the small mom and pop landlords, and I just wanted to give you, like, my my perspective of this as a property owner from mom and pop standpoint is hard, like Kevin mentioned and the previous owner, that landlords try to do their very best to accommodate everyone.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so it's not in their intention to increase rent or anything like that. But when. You know, things that come up, for example, just the basic of mortgage payment and property tax, you know, that increases every year, plus just homeowner's insurance that left alone.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But when something happens, like your roof breaks down, that's $20,000 of replacement cost right there. And then so I mean, just to bring up something like that, refrigerator cost replacement is two 500 plus stove a repair is $200.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So the list goes on. And so just to bring that up, it is hard for someone like that. So that 5% is kind of difficult to work with. I just I would just wanted to bring attention like, for example, like mom and pop struggles to, for example, I recall when we had to borrow to it, I mean'",
        "'speaker_5': ', financial aid for my daughter to attend college. And it wasn't an easy task, but luckily she was approved the financial aid and loan because of budget. But that's do because the rent did not cover the expenses that we had to incur.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so we didn't mind making the sacrifices. We knew what we were getting into and I and I'm happy about that also mentioned about the refinance it was it is difficult when you are going under the market, the value and your rent control.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It doesn't when you're trying to refinance a loan, they're going to decline you and then that's a possibility of foreclosure. So I just want to bring that to your attention to as well in terms and then I think somebody mentioned about she put on a slide show about the 5000 dollar moving expenses.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I like that option of perhaps considering relocating for 4 to 6 months instead of paying that 1500 dollars rent. If that's a consideration, the Times is up. So anyway, I guess that's about oh, like one last thing, but the mom and pop, she did statistics about it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I just want to bring like Mountain View in like Los Altos is a whole different market. I mean, the rent is outrageous.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So thank you. Thank you very. William is there. William, when you went home. Okay, Frannie.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We are not I'm not the time. You really are not. He get up 5:00 in the morning to go to work.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. And you're Fannie and Freddie or thank you. And then after Frannie will be Stephanie and then Don SC later. Go.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Evening, everybody. Good evening. I represent a group of small property owners in Alameda City. We are looking at a proposed rent ordinance. We did not see any exemptions, so we would like to respectfully request that if there's any proposed rent ordinance, there will be clearly defined exemptions.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We have night requests. Number one, new building after 1995. Second, substantial. We have dilatation of the 1995, especially the historic building, because when we restore them, we get to keep the outside and we do that foundation after the inside is extremely costly.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I have renovated two buildings like that due process. I spent $500,000 in each of the building. I'm a rent is about $3,000 a month. And historic home because we believe that under the California era Mental Control Act, historic home cannot have rent control without clear study and approval and special approval request exemption to single framing, home and'",
        "'speaker_5': 'due process. Because a lot of homeowners, elderly, family, they live in one in Alameda and the rent out the other. It's very common to rent a one unit of a due personnel I mean that to supplement the retirement income.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'House share situation. A lot of men and their relatives live the house. When a couple rooms subsidize the income, tenants own property within 100 miles of Alameda should not have a rent control apartment. I have a tenant works at Google making $103,000 a year and he rents one room from me.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I can tell you that in two years we'll be buying homes in other cities in California. So rent control should be income based. And finally, if the tenant refused to cite another lease, same length as a current lease should be exempt.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's it's the same as the San Francisco rent ordinance. And then. The Labor and material concession calls in the last four years doubled. I got a call from a licensed contractor doing four steps of Stairway for $5,000. So 5% is way too low.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And we do not have a lot.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Of evictions in Alameda when there's no rent.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Control. Q Is there, Stephanie? No. Stephanie. All right, Don Celotto. And then Katherine Pauling and then April ceded her time to Catherine and then Malcolm Leigh.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening. Thanks for your time and thanks for working so hard on this. Just a brief explanation of our situation. We are a mom and pop landlords. The biggest property we own has three units. Most of them are single family units.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We do own several units. We've invested a lot of money because they're older homes and maintaining them with roofs and in foundations and so on over the last few years. But most of our tenants, we try not to raise the rent.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We're very small and make very small rent increases. Just because they're good tenants and we'd like to keep them there. And usually if they leave, then we'll worry about market rate. They leave voluntarily. I have a couple of questions for you, though.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'How much is this whole rack process going to cost? And we did discuss it at one of the prior meetings. It seemed quite large. And then how are we going to pay for it? Are the landlords going to pay or the tenants are going to pay?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Are we both going to pay? But I think we need some clarification there from you. And then what happens when we have to sell the home for whatever reason? We'd like to be able to get the market rate for that home, whoever is buying it, if they want to continue to rent it out.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We're going to have other issues. So is there anybody thinking about what's happening there? You know, please take it into consideration. That's all I have. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Katherine Pauling. And she has someone saying a time to her. So it's 4 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I have two people sitting time to me at this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The other one. I have April and Malia. Thank you. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. Katherine Pauline, leader of Alameda Renters Coalition. Thank you. It's not quite. Good morning. We sent a letter responding to the staff report and I understand there was difficulty opening it. So I want to use the time to actually read our position.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We went over it very carefully. We have a number of questions and a number of concerns. Dear Mayor and Council Members, the Alameda Renters Coalition respectfully provides the following for your consideration regarding rent increases and evictions in Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We believe there are important principles that must be emphasized and kept in mind during your deliberations. They are that the ordinance regarding rents and evictions must, in the first instance, serve the dual purpose of keeping rents stable and keeping residents in their home.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Recall that it was renters. The majority of Alameda residents who brought the issues of excessive rent increases and unfair evictions to the council in 2014. Why do we say this? It's because too much discussion has focused more on landlords right to a fair return rather than on rent stabilization and tenant protections.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I will have to point out that that Debbie spent quite a bit of time expressing concern about how mom and Pops could pay even the small allocation allowed, and only a passing reference on what it might be like to be a tenant with none of those resources.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And that is to the core of this. This is becoming kind of a landlord protection act. 20. She she really she went on and on and on about the mom and pops and only a passing momentary reference to tenants.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The rent crisis was not created by the tenants, but by excessive rent increases and unjust evictions by too many Alameda landlords. Again, we ask that you keep this in mind. Regarding the cap on maximum allowable increases. Without a cap on rent increases, rents quickly become unaffordable and rent stabilization is not achieved.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We have consistently called for a rent cap of.'",
        "'speaker_0': '65% of the Bay Area CPI.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In line with numerous other California cities. Despite this, staff has never provided data indicating why it is not possible for landlords to make a fair return, with rent increases capped at 65% of CPI, nor even addressed it as a reasonable option for Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Neither staff nor council have provided a rationale for uncapped rent increases, nor provided data regarding the cumulative effects of uncapped rent increases. Uncapped rent increases this threshold that you mention do not stabilize rents and ultimately lead to displacement.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Similarly, the proposed 5% rent increase threshold to trigger a mandatory review by the Rent Review Advisory Committee rank is not related to any economic metric. Such as the CPI. And again, no analysis of the cumulative effect of 5% rent increases is provided.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Cumulative 5% rent increases show after only three increases, which can occur within 25 months, that on a $2,000 apartment will cost $2,315 within 25 months, a 315 a month rent increase with a 5% cap. And after five rent increases and when Don Lindsay did some of his stats, he showed that the average tenant stayed about five years'",
        "'speaker_5': 'and in an apartment. And then there was a natural move. After five rent increases, it would be a $552 a month rent increase. These are not affordable rents and increases like this do not achieve rent stabilization. The title of your proposed ordinance, on the other hand, rent increases at 65% of CPI so that a $2,000 a month'",
        "'speaker_5': 'rent amount increases to $2,098. It would be a $98 a month rent increase. After three increases, it would go up to 2160. Oh, excuse me. I read that amount increases after a 98 a month after three increases 165 a month after five rent increases at 65% of the CPI.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Stabilize rents and protect tenants from economic displacement. Meanwhile, the average income growth has been 2% per year, meaning that Alameda families with a 5% cap would be falling behind. To truly stabilize, rent increases must be limited to 65% of the Bay Area Consumer Price Index, which currently at 2.4% would make 1.6% the allowable increase.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We've been dealing with double digits now for year after year and the council chose, the landlords chose 10% and indeed that's what the RAC was imposing time after time, then arbitrarily 8% and the moratorium now arbitrarily 5%. It's still almost three times what is reasonable.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Somehow this disconnect where property owners, homeowners have twice had more than twice the income of renters, there is a disconnect here. So I'm going on with my second seed capital improvement plan.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's now 6 minutes, so that it was 6 minutes. But one more person has offered this time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You have another. That was 6 minutes. I'm sorry. At that time.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Because two other speakers said they wouldn't speak and let her speak.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But. Okay. So then I'm going to propose.'",
        "'speaker_5': '2 minutes to kind.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Of wind it up or you can come back around because I've got another 20 some speakers. I understand. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. So there's also the capital improvement plan. And we do not believe landlords should have should be able to evict tenants just for substantial rehabilitation. We've talked about this before. People stay in their homes when they do it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It should be a temporary relocation. What should the expense should be covered? No cause protections. An ordinance that allows no cause evictions does not provide tenant protection. A cap on the number because we oppose all no cause evictions.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We cannot of vision in circumstance of multiple evictions being acceptable relocation assistance. The current amounts mentioned are far below. It costs me 8000 to move the last time by the time you do first last deposit and the cost of moving.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm 67 it's and my friends with their bad backs. We can't do a U-Haul and do it anymore. The amounts of money. 1500 for moving. Are you kidding? Relocation assistance. So the benefit, the rent increase process and the rec individual, when you have 55.3% of households in Alameda are renters and you're going to do it individually through'",
        "'speaker_5': 'a mediation and arbitration process. And renters have to pay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Where I resolved.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And withdrawn.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I freaked out contact. All right. I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I actually don't have a gavel to gavel.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I don't count it out.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm quiet. Please.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I don't. I. I'm okay. I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We're going to take.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'A short recess. Thank you for taking a recess. I don't have a dog, and I. Yes, we're taking a recess. I'm sorry. I don't have a gavel. I need to calm this down before you can take. And you even hear me that I'm taking a recess.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Did we take.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Ah.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Easy way to get the gavel. Is that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The big.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think maybe it. Not seed time, I think, you know, the the stalwarts. Well, just in case anyone was thinking of doing that. Well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Otherwise, I don't think.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So he's.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Going to change the rules because of intimidation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Midstream.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay, that seems okay. Like Rule of riot.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, actually, Ms.. Ms. Wooldridge just pointed out that we probably can't change procedures that we announced at the beginning of a meeting.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Actually, something so. So we were on recess. Now we're going to resume the meeting. All right.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Member Ashcroft Well, I, I would favor not seeding time, but I understand some people might feel strongly about that, just that, you know, those of you in the room are the the stalwarts who stayed. So you should be able to have your 2 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then just a tip to all of you speakers, just launch right into your remarks. You don't have to greet the mayor, the staff, everybody else, because that's eating up your 2 minutes. So just go straight to the heart of what you want to talk to us about.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Any other council comments. Thank you. All right. So after Kathryn, I have Leah Vella, then Malcolm Lee. She ceded her time to Katherine to. All right. Now Malcolm Lee and then Tony charr yet it looks like. And then c h unchr.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I am a yes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Let me just cut to the chase. The a lot of folks, if you are not a homeowner, you don't understand. A lot folks will not understand this. It's not to blame them. But you when I'm a homeowner, I also am also a landlord.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Now, the when we collect rent, on one hand it goes out as a mortgage. Property taxes maintain the big ticket items, even maintenance. And a lot of us are all working class the homeowners. So what happened is this we go to work during the daytime and we stay working now.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The so the at the end of the day, we go to the building, we went to head of maintenance crew and sometimes we get where to head off the service people to clean up the cleaning crew. So as we go along some years, we have good tenants until we don't.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And someday we have a good economy, someday we don't. So let's just go back a little bit from 2006 all the way to 2010 and 11. Randall Market is very, very soft and is very hard for us to keep our buildings full due to that load at low occupancy during those years.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Who is out there to help us? No one is. We have to struggle extremely hard so that we can keep afloat. Otherwise, if we can't collect rent or if we have too much vacancy, then our we won't be able to pay the mortgage.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So what would happen? Foreclosure and lose. Just two years ago. We have a we have a chance to catch up and now we have this rent control imposed of us. Just like all my colleagues mentioned earlier, the the maintenance costs, everything goes up on top of that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'One thing that I like to point out to the council members is this. Recently we got some letters from a garbage company. They said you have to have compost and if you don't separate them, if your tenants do not do that, you as home owner, you will get dinged for it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we got caught in both ends. This is not right. So I'm completely against Franklin trial.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Tony.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This discussion started at 8%. I was okay with that. Now we're dwindling down to 5%. Landlords have a lot of expense here. We have property tax insurance. Maintenance on the properties. And, you know, there are rumors the Federal Reserve is worried that we'll might be going into a recession.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And if we do go into recession, I can tell you a lot of landlords will have a hard time when these tenants are not there and buildings are vacant and we have 20%, 30% vacancy rates. They will have a hard time.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And, you know, forecast is that at the end of the year we will be in a recession and things will not be as nice as they are now. What are you going to do for the landlords? What do they do?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Are we going to be supplemented in any way? Who can we take? Give us a break on our property tax? No, the answer is no. Will the banks give us a break? No. They'll foreclose our properties. So please have a little consideration.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We really come out like the bad person here trying to gouge everybody. It's not the truth. And you all know that we have a big financial responsibility and we're just trying to stay afloat. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And I want to clarify, we are not talking about a 5% cap. We are talking about a 5%, what I'm calling a trigger that if a landlord wants to do more than 5%, that they would go to rack.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But we are not talking about any cap. And when you compared it to the 8% that was during the moratorium and that was a cap 8% during the year that this proposal is has no cap. However, the landlord would have to come to our rent review advisory committee if they want to do more than 5%.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then that's when the the landlord would have the opportunity to share. But you're speaking of these additional costs or whatnot. So I just want to clarify that. So you're. You're welcome, Tony. I'm sorry. That was Tony. And now it looks like Cenci.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then Greg McConnell. And then Mimi.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good morning. So I guess you heard the latest news, Yahoo! All 1500 last week. We were. And then before that, GoPro, Twitter, IBM, HP, all announced layoff. No new IPO for a while. Chatter about Apple and Google have a hiring freeze.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Last quarter GDP point 7% or this number indicated basically economy inflection point is actually closer than many of us think. So actually when you made a decision, think about it. When you go through a downturn, you basically, as the Lord shared the responsibility to shoulder the responsibility that's no market economy, whatever, you know, free reign, one month's'",
        "'speaker_3': 'free reign for the tenant. Okay, you go ahead and do it. Nobody help us. But when the market is good, the economy's good. Then we have to go to some sort of control economy. So basically you have to have a cap.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's not fair. And then number three, I wish that the console can be a little bit more creative in terms of thinking outside the box. Like Redwood City, they actually have some sort of incentive for the landlord. If you offer volunteer rent control under certain limit, they give you some sort of incentive.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think there's something creative way you can think about it. And also single say they are considering rent control. They hired a consulting group to study it and the finding, you guys can also attend a meeting as well over there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Basically, what they found is really interesting. From 1990 to night, 2014, the 24 years, actually the rent increases for the unit that under rent control are higher than those that are not under rent control. So if you think about it, it really makes sense to to actually allow the market economy to do its work, don't mess around'",
        "'speaker_3': 'with it. So if you have interest in it, you can get a report from sellers they are willing to share with you. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I just.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm Debbie. Debbie Porter. Why don't you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right, Greg McConnell. Maybe. Is there a mommy war? Ah. Oh, there's like RH. Ah. Lester Cabral.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is he? Anyone else come up. Good evening. Manama City Council. Let's talk about resident of Alameda and a property owner. Been here for many years. You know, it's only been less than 30 days since we met on this issue.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And all of a sudden we've got all kinds of new things here. You know, 5% was 8%, you know, and these little notations and stuff. You know, with rental business. There's a lot in into doing rent here in Alameda and anybody that's if you studied the state real estate guide you'd notice there's quite a few there's quite'",
        "'speaker_3': 'a bit of information in there. I think we're acting too quick on this here. We need more time to really get into defining what's going on here and the best avenue. Like I said at the last meeting was we do have a rent for review committee here.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Let's utilize them. You know, you get into 5% and all these other little things, you know, they're just little tricks on there. It's really not going to work. We need to go case by case. They say there's better than 50% of the housing here in Alameda is rentals.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. That's a lot of people, you know, and not everybody is getting hit with hard rents. There are some out there. Sure. Those need to go before this rent review committee and get ironed out. But the majority of it out there is not, you know, I mean, that's just where it's at.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I've been in the business for over 50 years, you know, and seen a lot. You know, the market is from supply and demand. And, you know, you have to really look at that emphasis. You're going to put us little guys out of business.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, that's just what's going to happen. The mama papa clause here, nobody can define it. Come on. Anybody that owns less than five units, you know they're a mama. Papa, because they can't afford ten units. That's just way out of bounds.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But anyway, we need to do a lot more work here. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Dan Wang. And then Minha Yang in a yang. And then Tristan Schmidt.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And even he won't want me there. Yeah, I just wanted to echo the comment. You know, especially concerned about a court of arbitration. Is that taxpayer or a landlord? Landlords or renters. So, you know, wish that I chatted with real estate agent and he told me is that this will rent control will have a very negative impact'",
        "'speaker_3': 'on society in the city and especially in terms of income. And he predicted that the investors will have much less interest in buying rental properties and that and the value will drop. And as a household now I'm concerned about that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And also to the as the number of transaction in real estate sales are drop, this would reduce the income from transfer tax and the property tax and consequently we reduce the funding for schools and the public. So is I really like Alameda as a very charming city and a school system?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And, you know, I'm really concerned about that. I do want to our children, you know, they need to have early release because of lack of funding. That is really not good. And at that point, you know, I would like to echo that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, I have experience. I have a plumber who charges $200 for 40.'",
        "'speaker_8': '40 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'On clogging. And we have some guy come to change the tank or charge it, you know, $800 for the labor.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And, you know, who is going to cap that. And so, you know.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So in short, you know, cost is there. And, you know, once economy is not good, there's nobody protect the landlord. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Minor, Mina. I'm interested in Schmidt and then Rosalind mcCorvey.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hi.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Good morning. Mina Young. Um, as a mom and pop owner, we really need things to be flexible because we all to ourselves, I mean, we take care of.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The parties ourselves.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And we have parents to take take care of.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'My dad has.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Dementia and then, you know, we have to take care of him and have to take care of the properties. And so, I mean, whenever something happens, we have to take time off from work and take care of it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So either take care of the work or take care of the parents. So it's very important that we be flexible. And so by having more laws and more restrictions, it's very hard to run the business. So a lot of times we would rather not run the business, just not rent.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so you'll get less tax revenues and then we'll get less income. It's very hard to do that. And so and we are owners and and tenants and I mean, we are roommates sometimes with our tenants. So it's is very important that we be able to, uh, to work with the tenants directly, freely.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So by having more restrictions, it's not going to help and you'll you're going to take more units out of the market. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. First, Linda Corby. I'm sorry. Tristan. Tristan Schmitz. Next. Sorry. You're right.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'My husband and I have been mom and pop tenants in Alameda for 20 years since 1996. My husband's a teacher. I'm a childcare provider. I see a lot of classism going on here, a lot of implicit class values that are discriminatory.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'My husband's a teacher. I provide childcare. But the gentleman back here who told me to get a job at 20 years of employment experience, have a master's degree in psychology. And I'd like to know why the police don't respond to this kind of thuggery when innocent renters stand in the hallway and get sent to Santa Rita classes'",
        "'speaker_1': '. Okay. That's what I see here for the last nine years, before I got evicted by Gallagher, Lindsey, my mom and pop landlord never once came by. I had a leaking pipe for nine years. I had a crumbling wall.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We had two heaters, neither of which rarely, hardly ever worked. We had gardeners come in between grass of Tony's left cigaret butts all over the place and mowed down the tulips we planted. This is not market value service.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'How many of these landlords who claim to be mom and pops actually live in other towns? How many actually have other jobs? Other incomes? How many have properties in other towns? One of my landlord has a very lucrative restaurant business.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Another one was a car dealer. We need to take into account the fact that just because somebody already has money, had enough money to buy a property does not mean that they are guaranteed an unlimited raise every single year.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The economy has tanked because we had to bail out the banks. Okay. The economy is not getting better. I am not going to get a 10% or a 5% raise every year. I provide a valuable service here.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I do a lot of volunteer work.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Money is not my first priority, but my next home is going to be a tent. And you know where you go from the tent? The police come and take it away. Why? Classism.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'First, Linda Carvey. And then Lawrence Quintero.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening. I'd like to see if we can get exemptions for mom and pop landlords. We are small business owners, just like you were saying about Alameda Point. Say the small business owners retain them. You have to protect us also.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We. This is. This is not a hobby. This is our job. We are responsible people and we do the best we can. And as far as, uh, having rent control on the small, say, 5 to 6 unit buildings and under.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think it would be unfair. The. We don't have deep pockets like the larger investors. I personally know people that are in rent control units in San Francisco. They're laughing at the bank out there. They're planning on staying forever in these units.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They they earn each $150,000. They're married. And, you know, they're going to stay forever. And it's not fair that they're able to stay. So this rent control should be tenant income based and it should not be, you know, oh, just everyone.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It doesn't work that way. And also, historic properties are a lot more expensive to maintain. And just repairing anything is just a fortune. So that should be an exemption also. And, you know, one has the right to devalue my property when I go to sell this or what, you know, whatever I intend to do in the future'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that your 5% cap or or possibly more. It's not going to be convincing to the next buyer. So when the appraiser comes out, okay, when the appraiser comes out to do an analysis, they're going to take into all of this into account.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So you're devaluing my property, which is not fair.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you. Lawrence Quintero. And then Dan Zhang.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I just wanted to. Give you my interpretation of what's going on here. My wife and I have had a three unit place here in Alameda for about 25 years. And in that 25 years, we've had probably two evictions.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And they were because of the behavior of the tenants, not because we wanted to get the people out, because most of our tenants stay there, some, you know, seven, ten years. And we treated them right and they treated right, you know, treat us good as landlords.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We were always thinking of what they could afford. We try to keep our rents down as much as we possibly could because we wanted to keep them. So as a small landlord or mom and pop, as some of them say, we've had good experiences.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And our tenants have a good experience. Now, when we're talking about a place that has 50 or 100 units, that's something else. And I don't feel that. I should be put in the same bottle as somebody who has tenants and mistreats their their tenants.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I just don't think it's fair. I think the rent rent review board has worked well, and I don't understand why we have to change everything because of some people's concerns. I mean, I feel bad if somebody is having a tough time, but landlords can have have tough times also.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I just had to put a new sewer ladder. 9000 bucks. You know, I'm not going to go to the tenants. Say you have to give me so much to pay for this. I had to figure out how I was going to pay it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So as I say, the rent review thing, it doesn't bother me. Because if you do right, you're going to come out okay. I just don't like the fact that they're trying to box in with all these others. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Dan? And then Margaret Tong. And then Layla.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm here. I just want to express my.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Opinion about the No Cause.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Eviction because.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Alameda is different from San Francisco. Hayward, Berkeley is a way to want to be.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Another San Francisco or, you know, like a San Jose.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Or, you know, you know, Alameda. We have like 4000 buildings outside the historical buildings and study list. And the also we have to see, do you have a soft story list? So for the homeowner, I have to do the earthquake originally, you know, certain type.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So some of the job we need to evict, empty the whole building to finish the job.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So if we have the.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The limitation of the eviction, no cause eviction, then how could the homeowner do the job? So why here? So if we have five or four units, that means that the first to evict the one I pay for the, you know, something like the penalty or relocation cause the and the wait empty the unit and the with another'",
        "'speaker_8': 'year you wait another one and then after four years empty the building.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Then we I can do.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The earthquake a regional fee. So that makes no sense. So that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah, I just want to say.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That. So everything should be.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Case by case. We cannot deal with it just like it is with.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Margaret. And then Leila and then Daniel Lee.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, everyone. I am.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Mom and pop small shop and I'm single.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mom. I have a big mortgage to pay. I have a historical building. Maybe I have a brick foundation that on which I don't have money to replace. I just spend $20,000 on a roof and replace a roof because of the rain.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I have not increased by tennis rent for the last three years. So I treat them very well. And I if they have a hardship, I can delay their payments. So I think this rent control is really unfair to put us in a hardship.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We are responsible owner. We are. He kept everything all the way up here right away. Since the the market baby market is tied to the standard of living people, of income. So minimum wage went up 28% in Oakland in last two years.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I have not. I am sub engineer. I work full time. I'm single mom. My rent, my income have not increased for the last ten years, but I still keep up my rent. I'm not. I'm raising my child by myself.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I think this is rent.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Control is not fair for small mom and pop shop. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you. Layla. I'm sorry. What was your name? I'm sorry. Hey, come on. What was your name?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I live in Alameda for 20 years already. I have a house, a very old and the old house. You know those? Of those houses really near the coast right now. This is a business. Business would be outside. Happy then deal.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Right. Right now I feel this is not fair because the the thing is for tenant happy you have one side happy the others are not happy. You don't have a right to stop this business. They leave. We should pay them.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And moving fee. Up 5%. We have to file for a hearing under 5%. They can file for hearing. And when they move out, we have pay that we have to pay the moving cost and the month's rental cost.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We we pay too much and we earn so little because the slow time, you know, when the business is not not good, the houses empty. Nobody can they can choose us. We cannot choose them because our. Life saver already in there.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We cannot move the house away. We have a mortgage we have to pay every month. No matter this business, good or not. So I feel very, very sad. Okay, that's it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Lila. Before the incident, I was seated by someone.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Did they turn around? Yes, they.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Did. Masha. But I did it before that, though. So I think that I should. We've all been waiting for over 5 hours.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm sorry. I don't have a slip for that name.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Say it was. I thought I did.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Or did I already call it?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I don't know.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Ah, you try to do it in 2 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I will try. I'm going to be brief anyway. Thank you all. My name is Layla and I'm a realtor and longtime resident of Alameda. I'm here on behalf of myself, as well as clients I have closely been working with this past year who are mom and pop landlords.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I'm here to oppose this ordinance. And I'd like to give you one brief example of why, supported by actual numbers and this is, by the way, obviously one of many cases. My most recent example is the sale of a multi residential property.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'My buyer purchased this historic property at the beginning of this year for over $1.7 million, which is on par with current comparable home values in Alameda, where we all live. He currently has a longtime tenant and some of those tenants have been there for over 20 years, and they pay right now in amount of $880 a month'",
        "'speaker_1': 'for an apartment that is over 1000 square feet in a very nice location just a couple of blocks away from Park Street in Alameda. While I strongly do empathize with these tenants and their situation, I empathize even more for these home owners and landlords whose source of income and only source of income for many comes from these'",
        "'speaker_1': 'rents which they use for their own bills and livelihood. And this economy is has been and always will be extremely volatile. And it's incredibly unrealistic to assume one's rent will remain the same from year to year, let alone for decades.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The last time this particular property was sold was for $130,000 with an annual tax of $6,000. The current tax for this new homeowner is over $35,000 a year, with 5000 for insurance, 5000 for water, utilities, and a mortgage of over $100,000 a year.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So his total cost to own this property amounts to over $150,000 a year. The way current rents are at that property, he's making an income of under $70,000, which he now is experiencing a loss of over $80,000. This is a strong underestimation, by the way, and I'm almost done.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'At this time, the Bay Area is one of the most expensive areas in the entire nation. Home values are dictated by the market, not by individuals. And these home values are what govern the rental market. And these home values are also what makes our beautiful cities so desirable by many to live in, and which is what keeps'",
        "'speaker_1': 'our businesses here thriving. Again, although I do empathize with the tenants, I believe that the city should look elsewhere for solutions. Please do not punish the homeowners who are bringing up property values and paying exorbitant amounts of annual property taxes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. All right. And in the future, if you want to have someone cede your time to you, I need that person here so that I know. All right. Okay. Thank you. All right. Next speaker, Daniel Lee. And then it'll be Susan G.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'O. And then Jeff camera.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. So obviously you will see you have already seen that. How much how much friction we have right now by I go ahead and bring it up this ring control stuff in. In so many cities in the Bay Area.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I can see in Pacifica, San Francisco, Mountain View. And the river city in san mateo. Any city. This is a tenant, eva. Gays are fighting for their paycheck. They are not fighting for the tenants. They get funded by the city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They get funded by the state. They get funded by the federal ban. Also, probably. And they get a money from the corporation. So they are fighting for their paycheck. They are fighting for their livelihood. They are not fighting for the tenants.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We have a very good relationship with our tenants. So all these rent control is coming in right now is going to create a very, very bad relationship between Lando and the tenants. I won't say tenant. I will say our tenants because they are our customer.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They pay our bills. We also have to pay a mortgage as well. And just like my colleagues at one money, one side of the pocket, the money comes in and the other pocket I go still up because of the mortgage as well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'No. Earlier, one of the teachers say that she'd get evicted. I think. We do not evict any any rent paying tenants. Have you fire anybody who is doing a good job as your employee in piece? Of course not.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We don't. Anybody. Anybody? Any tenant? Any tenants that get evicted. It has to be none. And then rent paying tenants or they are behaving badly. Right.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Oh, thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much, Susan. And then Jeff. And then Karen Bay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I go to work last lastly late. Yeah. I'm a small landlord of Alameda. I'm strongly against run counter run trays made by market, not made by landlord or the government. I'm against it because it. It's not fair. They are poor people too.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We'll protect small landlord. By the way, I got the last 20% of my 41k and the savings. I cannot pay my son's college fee. Can you please tell me when we will have a city council hearing to get my money back from the stock loss?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I did an increase rent every year before. If there's a rent control, I must increase every year. Do you think gun control policy protect tenant? No, absolutely not. I have a full time job Monday to Friday, such like I have to get up sticks for my work.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'My husband and I spend much of our night time and the weekend to work as a handyman. I do a lot of work gardening, cleaning, painting, small fix, even toilet fix. I also take my 15 year old daughter to do yard work.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I let her come here to do the yard work. She asked me, Mom, why you don't hire a gardener to do this work? I say, Daughter. I want to save money. I want to lower my expense to keep this rental property.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Otherwise, I don't have money. I'm pro-people too. However, Pepsi's mortgage water power pigeon ye garbage insurance are all increased. Last year for the mint. For the Mint? Is it for the maintenance? I spend $20,000. I just got my water bill yesterday.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This must be increased to 5.8% than last bill. I cannot see till I'm out. I don't have extra money to pay. Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you. Jeff. There's a gentleman there. I did. I call your name already? Are you all right? All right. Come on up.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. My point is that I think there's not a tendency, not enemy. I think we want to do each other well. And I'm very good landlord. I have to say. Then I. I rent my room. Paul, my tenant.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's only $400 right now. So if I want to improve my. I'll pay my house, then rebuild the foundation. What happened? Think about that. The first. And the second is the. You get on the house and me on the house.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm retired already and my wife retired. We total income is that lower than $2,000. Okay. So. He would control everything we have to. Foreclosed in my house. The theory is that the only control that then you can do a Home Depot.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You controlled the contractor controlled the auditorium through that lets the builder and then you charge it up. Why you don't control them. They come to us. Right. Everybody need to free and then you need to. How many? To living together.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So everyday need to talk each other and don't make us strict nor a strict discipline then to who make us a hot time for when to sign and other sides happy. I have to say that my situation in finance is not written in my hand.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'My tenant. An $80 an hour. You know how much on the highest time. I'm on 40 in an hour and then is lucky. I'm a driving instructor. You're happier. $80 sell them. But they earn each day, each week and each week they then $2,000 each week.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And day a week. What happened? So you need to. Consider all the elements together and then make everybody happy.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you very much. Jeff Canberra and then Karen Bay and then John Klein.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good morning, Mayor Spencer. Council and staff. My name is Jeff Canberra. I am a.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Community facilitator and have privately mediated numerous tenant landlord disputes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Over the past.'",
        "'speaker_8': '18.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Months. I am here.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Tonight to draw your attention to a group of residents.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That the provisions that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You are discussing may not adequately protect. Our city contains a number of.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Groups of residents.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That would not.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Use the rec. They include families and especially.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Elderly tenants that are.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Fearful of even talking to their housing providers.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And the fear rest in rent increases, even within the limits that you are setting. Service reductions and subtle forms of retaliation that would not rise.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To the level of actionable conduct. This list also includes.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'non-English speaking and ESL residents that do not.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Understand the complexities of going through or simply fear Iraq. Hearing undocumented residents, tenants living in.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Illegal.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Units, and tenants that believe that property management companies regularly review the list of RAK applicants and blacklist residents. The raft, by its very nature, is confrontational. A trained mediator working a semi-private.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Environment can assist attended in opening the lines of communication.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'With the housing provider in a non-hostile, non-confrontational manner that can lead to a mutually. Agreeable resolution.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'This is the method I have used time and again. There are numerous cities using the semi-private mediation process.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The City of Mountain View just passed such a provision. The idea.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Of an optional.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'City sponsored semi-private.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Mediation being available to this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To the disputes would serve the most vulnerable yet vulnerable members of our community. As a city sponsored program, the committee would be able to oversee the mediation to assure that the tenants participated in a process that was fair and level the playing field.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'A city sponsored programs could still collect the data. Thank you very much. I will give you the rest of the time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Karen Bey and then John Klein.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Good evening. I'm here this evening to represent the small mom and pop landlords. We are going to be the most impacted of all the landlords by this proposed ordinance. If you own 20 units or more, you have the opportunity to spread out the cost.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But if you own 1 to 4 units, it's it's it's it's not feasible to spread out the costs without raising rents much higher than 5%. And if you own an older building 100 years or more, the cost to maintain and repair those buildings are significant.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I share the same story that this woman told. I'm a single mom again. I've got a brick foundation. I finally the rents have gone up. I can apply for a loan. The loan is 65% LTV. But with your proposed rent ordinance, our property values could go down.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We've been told that our property values could be lowered. So this is as if there's an earthquake. I and I need a foundation out of luck, right? To lease the Mountain View ordinance for the leases that terminate. Say that as long as both the tenant and the landlord agree.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I think that that language should be in the ordinance because most tenants are good. But there is the occasional problem a tenant that tries to gain the system relocation assistance. I think it should be means tested. The Mountain View ordinance requires you to qualify for relocation assistance.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So it focuses on working families, which is what we need to focus on. That's what this is really about, is the working families. And if they qualify for relocation assistance, can they get it? Finally, I just want to say everyone should pay for the cost of this housing crisis, not just the landlords.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It's unfair to make us pay for a regional housing crisis that we didn't pay that we didn't cause. So the Mountain View ordinance create the have a community rent relief fund and they use that fund to help to help tenants with housing issues.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I think if we need to find a way to tax everybody so that we all share the costs, not just the landlords. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. John Klein. And then Rita Hill. And then Maria Dominguez.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'My name is John Klein, and Charlie Edwards has succeeded some time to me as well. So the staff report I'm glad to see that it's proposed a and to talk to you about the mom and pop exception. I propose that that mom and pops are comprised of 2 to 4 units.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You have over 4600 units. That would be mom and pops. That's 28% of the rental rental units in the city. You are concerned about the large landlords with 50 units or more. That's only 17% of your units. The mom and pops are 28% of your units.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The fact that you're considering any kind of exemption for them is why we can't call what you're working on the Landlord Protection Act. It just shouldn't be happening. It just shouldn't be happening. But even so. No one's ever provided any data that substantiates the claims that they can't afford that and any benefits.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'As a matter of fact, that is that claim is contradicted by experts from the real estate industry. For example, just six months ago, in October 2015, as a research vice president at the National Association of Realtors said in August 2015, rent spiked 3.6% over the same time a year earlier, the fastest pace since 2008.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Naturally, people collecting rent are thrilled with the gains they are seeing. Both large part investors and mom and pop landlords are enjoying the best conditions they've seen in years. Similarly, a Zillow economist in an article about the Bay Area titled Best Cities for Small Landlords, the greatest returns are actually in the markets like San Francisco and San'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Jose, where there are short term monthly losses. But the long term earned equity makes them the best markets to invest in. So we say that Oakland, Alameda, real estate markets are virtually indistinguishable with regard to their profitability. So so these claims that they can't afford tenant protection benefits are unsubstantiated at best and in spurious.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So. Really? So that's what I have to say about the mom and pops. But so the data collection is what's important here. Right now you're talking about just collecting data on 5% rent increases. You must collect it all the the the the mom and pops who come in and say, we never raise our rent more than 5%'",
        "'speaker_3': '. You don't know that. And you don't even know who the mom and pops are you. And so the data collection needs to be all units. It needs to be by size 2 to 4 units, 5 to 9, 10 to 19.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And these categories are out of the bay report that I'm giving to you. So none of the claims that the mom and pops are making can be substantiated unless you do complete data collection for all types of units.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Rita. And then Maria Dominguez.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm talking about the displacing family and the low rent tenants with rent control. Number one, displacing family. You know, more landlords would only rent to the individuals sharing rooms instead of renting entire apartment to family. B Individuals have a much higher chance to move out due to a change of jobs and family size and etc..'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Number two, with rent control and we will spend more money to rehab the property, then rent at a market rent instead. And with rent control we can. No longer help people out and we must rent property out at above market rent, otherwise won't be able to raise rent in the future.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And number three, create tension between landlords and tenants. You know, we want to have a good relationship, working relationship with the tenant and also want to lay low. Landlords are human beings. We're not evil. We're not enemies. We bring the business to the city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And rental business, just like other business, is a very good business for the economy. The city too and also know no more long lease. We usually signed two years with a low increase in the second year only a few percent.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But now we will only do more one year lease. And that's why rental control does not set there. The rent law is that it push the rent higher. So thank you so much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Maria Dominguez. And then. John. John.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'My name is Mario Mingus. I'm an Alameda resident and a renter. I'm a very active member of my community. I'm part of the League of Women Voters, Alameda chapter and a member of Alameda Renters Coalition. I received a 60% increase in November, and I'm here tonight out of self-interest, but also and more importantly, my community's interests, including'",
        "'speaker_1': 'low income, working class and middle class workers. Are you willing to displace schoolchildren in the middle of the school year? Are you willing to lose schoolteachers? Just today in San Francisco? Tenant protections for San Francisco teachers are being proposed.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Why isn't Alameda looking to be an innovator in the Bay Area as well? If you don't do the right thing, you will contribute to increasing homelessness in the Bay Area and creating a less racially diverse alameda. This is Black History Month.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Housing is a civil rights issue. Do the right thing and be on the right side of history. Don't let Alameda history repeat itself like ten years ago when hundreds of black families were forced out from the Harbord Island Apartments, a complex that was then home to about a third of Alamitos black population.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Today, black and immigrant families are especially vulnerable, including Filipinos, Vietnamese and Latinos on the island. Again, do the right thing and be on the right side of history. Put a cap on maximum allowable increases of rent at 65% of the Bay Area.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'CPI is reasonable and in line with numerous other California cities. Don't look at San Jose. They're going to change it as well. They're going to bring down their numbers. Pass no cause eviction protections, provide relocation assistance, amend the relocation benefit exemption for so-called mom and pop owners.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mediation and arbitration is not appropriate here. Create an elected rent board that is accountable to the community, mandate data collection for all rent increases and collect an annual program fee so you can pay the costs of the hearings, the program staff, the data collection and all the other necessary administrative and enforcement costs.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Do the right thing and be on the right side of history. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. John. John J. I and G. John, are you here? Monte Hyang. And Monty on yours. It has Tristan sitting time to you, but she already spoke. So is there someone else that wants. If you need more time.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'll talk fast.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. I'm a 15 year resident of alameda. I pulled off some comments. Brant complaints from facebook. Alameda peeps. You may be familiar with it. This is deni. In October, our day care provider got her rent increased by $750 after another increase of $200 earlier this year.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'She'll be paying for 4000 a month. Our little one loves her. We were extremely happy with her. It would be great if she could stay in Alameda. This is the day care provider. This is Gillian from January. In writing, I'm writing on behalf of my dear friends who are a lovely family here in Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They are being evicted from their apartment of eight years because the owner is moving in the family and now we are faced with daunting rent increases we all know have caused so much duress here in the community. This is this is Maria from today.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We just received a 6.3% increase increase effective March 1st. It was a $90 increase last March and a 100 and hundred dollars increase this March. My husband refuses to go to the rack for fear of retaliation. But I can report the data, so why can't I report the data somewhere and have it matter to anyone?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This is Siena for January 31. Got a 8% rent increase notice yesterday. Less than six months ago, they added utilities to our lease. How long was slow response, a service request and poor upkeep of common areas. I feel like they've been holding us hostage because of threats of rent increases, because people are afraid to complain.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So when a hired lobbyist comes in here quoting. From a Cheyenne telephone telephone survey. I hope you'll think about people like Danny and Gillian and Maria and Sienna. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And our last speakers, Brian Maguire. If you haven't heard yours, it's time. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good morning. Didn't think I'd manage to do this later than last time. I'm impressed that after ignoring the buzzer for 4 hours, you managed to you chose to unilaterally give this item in particular 2 minutes only and start cracking the whip.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's seems kind of arbitrary and capricious, if you ask me. But for the people, the landlords complain that 5% is not, uh, functional for them. This is a very different than, say, two thirds or CPI like you see in some of our neighboring cities.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If the economy stalls like everyone likes to predict every six months, you still have the ability to catch up at basically double the rate of inflation over recent years. So it's it's a far cry from what, you know, the people are are trying to say what happened with, you know, comparing this to like a stricter voter driven'",
        "'speaker_3': 'policy. You guys should be championing you guys should be the ones endorsing this all the way. Because like some have said, this is this is going to protect you as far as some of the. Provisions as far as mom and pops, which we hear about all the time.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They don't have to evict the tenants if they don't want to pay the relocation costs, if they do need to evict the tenants. They have a pretty nice piece of collateral that they can use to finance that, you know, relatively moderate or minor cost, depending how long the tenants been there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If you can't make that work, you're in the wrong business. And no business owner deserves guaranteed success. Just look at the restaurants out here on Park Street. Property owners. Do not have a moral right to extract all of the income gains in the region from a booming economy.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If there are any exemptions considered from this council, I would suggest limiting it to something like owner occupied parcels with two, maybe three units capped. Anything beyond that? You're you're in the business of, you know, providing housing and you're a property manager.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But if you were living on that site, maybe there's some some differences there. But thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Any other speaker slips. All right. So he was our last speaker. Staff are going to come back up here now. Now, Miss Potter, do you have, like, a list? How do you propose?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So my recommendation is, if we could call back up the PowerPoint presentation, I would suggest that we just scroll through and we kind of like we did on the fifth issue by issue, if that works for the council, otherwise we can answer questions.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah. You know, we never did have an opportunity to ask questions on the staff report, I assume, just because we wanted to get into the speakers.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So can we ask the speakers as we go through I mean, ask for clarifying questions as we go through the items instead of all at once. You mind if we do it for item.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'On the staff.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Report? Um. Um.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'll do my best. But normally we do have a chance to ask clarifying questions of the staff report.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'She's going to be going over the report.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And it's going to be the bullets to it. But Mr. Spencer, she's this is not the standard we're looking at.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'See. Where do you want to start?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah. So I am prepared to talk on the PowerPoint slides, the staff report or the principles that were the exhibit to to the staff report. Um, but if we just wanted to start and take them in order, we would start with the one year at least and staff would request a consensus direction from the council about.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Um. Mandate and a requirement to offer a one year lease to in place tenants as well as the already agreed to offering of one year leases to prospective tenants.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right, Member Ashcraft, are you in a position to discuss that or you want to go back to something else at this point?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'll go with the flow, but I expect you to let me ask my questions at some point this evening and not to get to a point and say, okay, no questions, it's too late. But, I mean, I think we need to now have more council deliberation than hearing staff speak.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So. Debbie Ms.. Potter's presented this question.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In the frame.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So she's going to go item by item, and then we can respond and deliberate then at each item. I remember.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I like it. I prefer just to begin going item by item, asking whatever clarifying questions or any questions we have, and then and having an opportunity to the extent that council members so want to, you know, frame all the questions and comments and concerns.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All at once.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Everybody, whether you.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Agree with or dislike, I mean, as you suggested, Madam Mayor, we go through each item, liberate, give our comments and questions, and there's something we haven't done and we want to do a wrap up statement. Then we could kind of do that up there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Didn't you want.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Them okay with you?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I prefer that. I think it's orderly. I think I was very successful last time doing it that way. Did you want to weigh in by square or.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes. I like the idea of going through the points that need the staff feels it needs to get clarification on. But I do think we should be able to have questions or comments on the staff report. Or offer other thoughts at the end of this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah. And I'm I'm in agreement with the vice mayor if you know.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It necessary at that time.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I beg your pardon.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If we still need you at that time.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Right. But bear in mind, we're doing this cleanup session now so that when we come to the 16th, we'll be ready to move on with the first reading of an ordinance. We most certainly weren't ready to do that coming out of the January meeting.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Remember.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I believe that we were clear with staff when we suggested this meeting that it would be pretty much limited to these these eight items that, you know, not rehashing what we've already decided.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Absolutely.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I agree. Member de SAC.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So if I could just begin a quick, quick question on the one year lease, if it were all right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So at this point is go ahead with your recommendation. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So there was consensus on January 5th that one year leases be required to be offered to prospective tenants. There was a question about whether or not you wanted to extend that to in place tenants. Two staff's recommendation is that the one year lease offer requirement be extended to in place tenants to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Desai My quick question is, do we have, for lack of a better word, case history of how this works in other places, though? Do we know where other places have a similar feature?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah. So Glendale. Glendale is one of the cities that's had a longstanding ordinance regarding the requirement to offer a one year lease. The city of Palo Alto has this requirement and then Mountain View just put put an ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think it was effective last month.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And do we have any can we provide a 10/2 response as to if we know how effective that's been in addressing whatever their housing issues or.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, I would say the example of Glendale is that I'm in Glendale. If you offer a one year lease, you are exempt from all other requirements regarding relocation and all the others. So, so in Glendale, and if you go on to their website, they'll tell you that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You know, their their programing they have. There is very little activity because my guess is that they offer one year leases and they move forward. And that's what Palo Alto has had in place. But we have not researched the the the details are kind of beyond that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's fine. That was an interesting point about Glendale. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mm.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Any other clarifying questions or comments on this issue?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So notwithstanding your comment about Glendale, we're not proposing we're not even on relocation benefits yet.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Right. This is, you know, the recommendation to require one year leases was part of the package of sort of additional tenant protection measures. And from staff's perspective, the idea of offering one year leases is to bring some stability and some certainty to the process that if you have a lease, you will your rent will not go up'",
        "'speaker_6': 'for a while, for 12 months. And it's an opportunity to to introduce stability. The council already said that they wanted to do this for prospective tenants. The only question I believe that's on the table for for for further discussion is that if you extend that requirement to in place tenants and.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That that's what other jurisdictions who have this requirement they they offer it to in place as well as prospective tenants and the in-place tenants are only once because the or you know as. The ordinance is going to be effective.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then what we anticipate is that you would offer that the one year lease when either if you have a lease now 60 days before your lease expires or at that time your first rent increase. And it's a one time only.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Requirement. And if you've done that, you've you've fulfilled that obligation under the ordinance. And it seems to staff that the you know, it's equitable if you required of perspective as well as for the in-place tenants.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But we had a question from an audience member. If they offer a one year lease, does then become a month to month or is it one year and then done?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We'll roll to it. Typical residential rental leases in the state.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That it rolls.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes, roll to month.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But is that a requirement of this then? If there's a.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Requirement.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Is that it be if you have an existing lease and you're going to be offered, you're an in-place tenant with an existing lease and you're going to be offered one lease. It has to be materially the same. So if it rolled to month to month, it would roll to month to month in the new lease to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you for clarifying that. Remember, it's a quick.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Question. I think we decided last time, if I'm not mistaken, that you get one rent increase per year, right?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So, I mean, if you do opt as a tenant to go month to month and don't accept that lease, you're still going to get one increase per year. You're not going to get an increase every two months or three months or six.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And then we so our is your suggestion that, you know, we do this as a one time stabilization and then everyone whose lease expires and gets an increase within the next 12 months gets an option of one year.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And then we just we're one and done. Yes. Some people don't want I mean, this is what February.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Right. The recommendation is one day.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So anyone whose lease may have expired in January, you know, next January, they'd be subject no. But once the right for.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The first time, there's a notice of a rent increase after the ordinance goes into effect.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So what if they don't do it in the first year? But that only applies to rent increases in the first year after the ordinance goes into effect.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The way we are and the way we've drafted is the first time there's a notice of the first rent increase, whether it's a year from now, 24 months from now, if.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Or any other member.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Oh, I'll go.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'After.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Them. Just for clarification, a tenant could opt to, rather than if the tenant had some reason to not want to be held to a one year lease. Job relocation prospects are something they would don't have to accept the one year lease.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They could ask for month to month and they wouldn't be penalized.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But they would still have the rent increase then. Correct?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I remember they it I remember.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Just just to be clear on the policy. So on the rent increase, with the one time a year limit, you know, we've kind of taken care of the rent increase. The stability that we were trying to get with this one year lease was on the evictions because those that were on a month to month lease would then'",
        "'speaker_7': 'understand that at least for the next year, unless they do something like nuisance or don't pay their rent, that they're not going to get a no no fault eviction or, you know, some Omar or something like that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Evictions. It's things like provision of a parking lot or access to laundry facilities, things that are that are provided to via a lease that that you would have that kind of certainty or stability for for an additional year.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And then anyone that may, for one reason or another, you know, not have a formal lease or be on an oral agreement on a month to month, which, believe it or not, they're still out there. You know, we'd get them like with standardized terms.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You know, one thing we may want to think about, you know, is some type of model lease, but that's a discussion for another day.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You're right about that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, actually, I might have had some request about coming up with a model list once the ordinance is in place. And that's something I think that staff is interested in working on that would be available. Standard noticing, model list, those kinds of things that that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Could be helpful. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we're not we're not it's not a gender issue. We don't want to be here till four in the morning. So thank you. Another time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Every day.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So one last question for me on this topic. So with regard to going back to the Glendale model, are you saying that we anticipate implementing that feature of the model where if you implement a one year lease at the time that the lease is exhausted, if the landlord so chooses not to continue and the per the Glendale'",
        "'speaker_2': 'model that the landlord doesn't have to provide relocation benefits.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'No, we're not recommending that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. So then, are we ready to give direction? So this time we were just giving direction. We weren't actually taking emotion. So. Right.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Right. I think if there's a sense of the council or consensus that the clerk could capture, that would be all right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So council members, you just want to go around the table. How do you want to do whatever you want? I'm okay. I'll I'll go ahead and say I'm agreeable to staff recommendation. Anyone else want to weigh in?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I'd like to have it the way it was originally. Where it's just the first time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Nebraska. Did you want to weigh in? Do you want him to clarify.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'What's between.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The four? It doesn't apply to existing tenants.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You don't want it to apply to existing tenants. Oh, okay. I'm. I'm agreeable to what's on the screen before us.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To offer the least to existing tenants. I had never talked to. Any questions are going away.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No, I. I think. It's supply it to new tenants. But I will hold off as to whether or not existing tenants. I mean, I'll have to think about that more.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, is that an abstention then?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Because we know it just means that for sure and for.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Uh.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we're going to be able to craft an ordinance to come back to us. This is this is preparing for that. All right. All right, go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_7': '5 seconds. Yeah, I'm fine with the staff recommendation.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I would say that that is there's no chances.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To have this work and be a majority consensus.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Majority. So that's helpful. And B will be capturing the concept of the one time lease offer for a perspective as well as in place tenants in place.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's when there's a rent increase or not.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If they're on a month to month and then if they're already have an existing lease, it will be 60 days before their current lease expires.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Just once.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Just once.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'For.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Two years they would.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And just for technical clarification, Ms.. Former Madame. Referred to and b I don't see an.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Inbuilt in the staff report under staff recommendations.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Gotcha. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. I'm a. So this one, I don't think we're not asking for any action this evening. This was just an informational update. And so unless council had any feedback or input for staff, I'm.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Member Ashcraft Okay, so the direction I would like Steph to go in, in the ordinance you're crafting is that I think. It's important to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Um.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Not have the tenant bear the cost of arbitration. So I know there's been some discussion in the course of discussion of, you know, both sides maybe dividing the fee. I think I said this before in January, this playing field is not level.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If someone is, you know, coming forward saying, I can't afford this rent increase, how are they going to afford the. The the arbitration clause. But I think there is a you know, it's not wanting to throw a wrench into the works.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But as I listened to you, Ms.. Potter, explain that we can't say binding arbitration because there's legal implications, and you're right. And then you get into, you know, really having it be rent control. And there's other implications to that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So it's just a binding hearing process. But there's the judicial review. So just stop and think for a minute of how onerous a process that might be. So landlord comes forward wanting to have an increase of more than 5%.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'First you go to the rack. We all know that's not binding. Then we go to the arbitration process. But that's not binding either because it can still be appealed, so then it can be appealed to a judicial process.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we are requiring in some instances people to go through cross three hurdles.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So it's my understanding that's exactly what the City of Gardena has, and that still counts as rent control. By having this arbitration, it is considered some sort of rent.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Control by the and even it's clear what what Gardena does are, you know, Cucamonga or whatever. What I'm just concerned about is our renters here. And I just stopped and thought about that process, for starters. How long will that take?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And and then what's the cost? That what's the cost as a judicial process is this small claims court so parties aren't represented by attorneys or what's the. Can you walk us through that? Because I think we need to consider that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If you want me to jump in on that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Sure. Can I just one thing that I want to say about what's being proposed is that for rent increases that are being proposed, that are above 5%, that the rent increases not effective until the the that all of the processes have happened.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I understand the technicalities. I've read the report, but I'm just saying, what happens if I mean that conceivably a renter and a landlord could go through these three steps?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's correct. That is that is correct.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so, Vice Mayor, you I think Mr. Bash was going to chime in.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, I'm concerned about how much time we're going to spend on this part. Vice Mayor, did you want to comment?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I just want to comment very quickly on this whole notion of binding arbitration or binding. Hearing. Hearing and thinking about and then hearing your explanation. I'm not. I'm no longer supporting that because I don't think it provides enough benefit for the cost and the problem.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We've had a non-binding system when people are avail themselves of it or feel comfortable enough to go to it. It's been fairly successful at a fairly low cost, and there's still judicial review at the end of that process that's available to people.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I think this puts and maybe. A unwieldy and and maybe not beneficial step in between. A mediation. And if I was to say spend the money, I'd spend it for private semi-private mediation in front of the rack.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Before it becomes public. I think that has better benefit than putting a binding arbitration at the end of it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so with all due respect to and I'm concerned with the time to, but I would still like to have our attorney weigh in on this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Madam Chair and members of the Council, Michael Rausch from the City Attorney's Office.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The agenda report's going to indicate that the program fee will be such that it would cover the cost of the the hearing process. So, in other words, that we make some or certain assumptions that there'll be a certain number of matters that will go to the binding hearing process and that will have a cost.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And that cost will be built into the overall fee that housing providers will pay. The the persons or the housing providers who will be subject to that process will presumably pay a slightly higher fee than those that aren't, because those folks won't have the opportunity to go to the binding hearing process.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But if it does go to the binding hearing process, once that decision is done, it can be challenged judicially. But I think, as Ms.. Curran has indicated previously, it would be done by what's called a petition for writ of mandate, where basically a a trial court would review the administrative record that was had before the hearing officer'",
        "'speaker_3': 'would look at the transcript, would look at the evidence, and then based on that, decide whether or not that decision was upheld by by substantial evidence. I think the substantial evidence rule would apply there, not an independent judgment ruled.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I don't mean to be talking legalese here, but just for the just for what actually will happen. So the answer is, as staff is going to propose it there, there would be no cost to either the tenant or the housing provider to go to the binding hearing process.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But beyond that, if someone wanted to continue to challenge it, it would be on either the housing provider or the tenants costs to do the judicial process.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So there would be a cost to a tenant to to to for the court filing or.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Correct. I think the idea of much like, you know, to analogize it to when the council does a land use decision a person might not like, the planning commission's decision can appeal to the city council. City Council decides that if somebody is dissatisfied and wants to go to court, that person then has to pay the freight or'",
        "'speaker_3': 'attorney's and other court costs that would be associated with the writ of mandate process. And that would be the way it would be handled here.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Just just a point of clarification, a couple of things. This process that we're talking about right now is not really on the agenda right now. You all decided that process. We're not asking for any clarification on that process.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I would really I mean it with all due respect. Program fee is not even actually on this agenda because we're suggesting that we're going to come back in February 16. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that that's fine. Fair enough. But just I was trying to give direction because then when you come back, we may be sending you back again, but.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But that's actually not going to be separate and. That's correct. That's right.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And my question on this subject matter of program fee is simply this. In the case. I believe there are cases that we here in Alameda are probably looking to. Of cities that have that administer this kind of stuff.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Perhaps Los Gatos is an example. I'm not quite sure, but I think it would benefit the public and many people if we simply demystify this whole process and in addition to kind of, you know, discussing the mechanics of it, but kind of be able to point at, well, and this is how Los Gatos works for good or'",
        "'speaker_2': 'for bad, but just the facts or this is how did you say Gardena? This is how Gardena works, how much it costs and blah, blah, blah. So that we get we get the sense that, okay, this is something that, you know, that other places are doing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so we're not doing something that's so. No mystical.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, we were actually focusing on what or what the proposed ordinance looks like and what we think it's going to cost to administer our ordinance. But we we will have flowcharts and lots of information.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Just real brief. You know.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Personally, I think on a policy level, this is going to benefit tenants. And there's also going to be some some things in there that the landlords want. And I think the only fair and equitable way is to share that cost equally across all landlords and tenants.'",
        "'speaker_7': '5050. That's just my.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So actually, I, I I'm going to hold off because. Thank you. Thank you. That's what I heard you wanted us to do. So honor that. So you could just go straight to the next point that you need us to respond to in order to craft the ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Let's stay focused on that. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So the next item is that the council has already indicated that they want to allow no cause evictions with certain limitations. So the the only the only direction that we're really looking for this evening is what the cap what cap you would like to see for the next tenants rent increase if there is no cause eviction or'",
        "'speaker_6': 'an in place tenant.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. So my position on this one is that then the the rent to the next tenant would be whatever they could have gotten if they've kept that tenant. And so if they hadn't given had a rent increase within the past year or if they wanted to do more than that, go through whatever would have been the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'same. So.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So are you suggesting 5%? Because that's the that's the threshold.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Or it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Was that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They hadn't received the rent increase.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But how are we going to. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So whatever is not clear, sir. Really?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yeah. I mean, I. I see that it's a split the baby. So if you've had a run increase within 12 months and the new tenant, the old tenant couldn't get a rent increase until the 12 months is up.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But if you're evicting somebody at the end of their lease, then you'd be entitled to raise that rent 5%.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So you'd be entitled to raise it to an unlimited amount.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We're not paying a rent.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But if.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The thought was here that you could only charge what you would have, charge the tenant that was staying.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, know what that cap is really. The 5% is really equivalent to the trigger that we would require initiating the process. That's what the 5% was it. And in January we had it set at 8% because that was the percentage.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'For rent on a new.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Tenancies, rent on the new tenant.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And the whole point of this policy, if I remember correctly, was to disincentivise the rent evictions. That's correct. So if you allow somebody to evict somebody and then charge a 25% increase.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Exactly.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'A disincentive.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So that's why we're asking for a direction on a cap. Right.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I think the mayor's suggestion was. If you if the if they got their rent increase in the last 12 months, then you couldn't. Increase that existing tenants rent if they were on month to month. So that should be zero.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And correct me if I'm wrong, but if they were eligible for a 5% increase, you know, we would make at that flat 5%.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'What about instances where a tenant tenant a move is evicted for no cause and receives a relocation benefit? So are we saying that the landlord has to pay a relocation benefit and then where the new tenant is kept?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Because this is connected to that code section as my recollection.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Where. Yes, that's correct.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Next to that code section. In which case it's. Doesn't start brand new. So it would actually be. If if the code section is correct, if that's what this is, then it's zero. However, there's the next time they could give the increase would be whenever it would have been eligible for the prior tenant.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is it coming?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I understand. I understand the point about if the rent has been increased once in the past 12 months, you can't increase it again. So that might argue for a zero, you know, allowing for no rent increase. The part that I'm not quite following is that because there is no cap on rents, I don't know if they'",
        "'speaker_6': 'haven't done a rent. If they're if they haven't if they're owed a rent increase. It's been 12 months. They could do 20%, 15%. I mean, you would have to set a.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Cap purpose of.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I know. So that's why we need a cap hearing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Right. So we need a percentage cap.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So may I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Remember?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I'm going to suggest that we make it 5%. And it's part of the package of what you as a landlord, you have rights, but you have responsibilities. So you're going to come up with this. You want to turn it out.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Don't have to give a reason. Don't have to go to court and pay attorney's fees. But you will have to I know we haven't gotten to the relocation assistance, but we've talked about this. You'll have to pay the relocation assistance.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You'll have to pay the movie expenses. You can charge the next tenant, assuming they you evicted right at the end of the term or whatever the. What you were currently getting, plus up to 5% increase. And with that, I also expect to eliminate a lot of the arguments I heard tonight about how mom and pop landlords can't'",
        "'speaker_4': 'possibly afford all these various expenses because we are giving you a cushion is essentially what we're doing. But I don't see how we can. Well, I don't know. I mean, there may be legal ways, but I think if 5% was the trigger that we chose for taking, you know, a below 5%, 5% or below would stand unless'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the tenant took the the landlord to the rack. It seems like 5% is an increase that we found was reasonable.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And let me ask this question. So going back to real life examples, can you give an example where where such a clause exists?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'No, because this is this is kind of this is a good example of the hybrid ordinance that the Alameda is looking at. If most cities with rent stabilization don't allow no cause evictions, they they only allow evictions for just cause.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then if you don't have rent stabilization, you tend not to have eviction protections. So this is something where the city is kind of proposing to do something that is accommodating the request by a lot of the property owners that they be allowed to do no cost evictions, but are willing to put limitations on that to really'",
        "'speaker_6': 'address the very important issue of sort of the economic evictions, evictions strictly to raise the rent. When a tenant has been paying their rent every month, they've been, you know, abiding by their lease, that kind of thing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'My opinion is simply that to me, while we have. Discussions about the relocation assistance and maybe there are other benefits. To the extent that the tenant. Tenant A is moved and received whatever the relocation. The benefit is in my opinion that landlord, as so to speak, given to the church already.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So now we're doing a second penalty where they can't do some kind of rent increases because it's altogether possible that they have to do a rent increase for or some capital expenses. I know. That's just my opinion.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Right. So capital expenses would be a different type of eviction if you were to if you wanted to, to deal with a substantial rehabilitation. And you needed you were going to make a big investment and you needed a rent increase above the 5% that you would.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That would be a different grounds for eviction. This is evictions for for no cause where you don't have to show cause. And so the council had already agreed in January to. To doing the cap and to doing the in requiring the relocation.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And really what we're focused on is the very narrow question of what the percentage cap should be.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It was my understanding and recollection that when we did this, went through this, we were told there's a civil code section that says that you cannot once you have a city that has rent control, that and that's what this would be then that if you evict for no cause that that next tenant, you cannot increase the rent'",
        "'speaker_0': 'for that civil code section.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, you can rent.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You disagree with that code section that that does not apply.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Very.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I, I think our opinion is that the Council has the discretion if it wants to set that 5% cap, that it does that it. I don't think it's quite as black and white as that as it may have.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Self-represented.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So could we set 10%? 20%? You don't think it has any bearing on this at all?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I don't think it does now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So what do you think that code section speaks to?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, I think it speaks to situations. It it's a fairly narrow exception concerning single family residences. And this is going to apply more broadly than that. So, again, I just think that. It really addresses a different issue than than you're really kind of facing right at the moment.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I think if the council if the council wants to make it zero, it certainly can. If it wants to put it at 5%, I think it can do that as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I'm hoping we don't have very many no cause evictions and that's what I think we're trying to contain here. So I would like us to figure out a way that it can, in fact, be that they don't get to bite that they have.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I actually don't think this is about evicting someone. And then you could increase the rent all you want for a no cause eviction. And and. But. But should that number be zero 5%?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I, I feel I mean, I've heard the term split the baby. It's not my favorite term, but I guess it's biblical. But I do think we have to try to address interest on both sides. And what is that?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think there are different no cause evictions. And I'm just going from, you know, a lot of conversations I've had with housing providers. And one is that, yeah, we've seen egregious rent increases where a landlord came back with, you know, a very steep increase after they got charged twice as much or whatever.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I'm also told that there are times when you have a problem tenant that is, the other tenants don't want to testify against him in court, and that's what it would take. And yet it's causing a problem for all of the tenants.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And this is a way to get that tenant out. It's also a way to look at it charitably, to not put a black market on that particular tenant's record that would make him or her have a harder time renting a subsequent unit because there's you know, there's all different ways to look at this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I'm comfortable with having the No Cause eviction allowed. And I know the the landlord organization's really wanted that and they're not thrilled with relocation expenses, but I think that's equitable. But again, I do think that we need to take into consideration ability to maintain property, ability to put aside that reserve that you need for, you know'",
        "'speaker_4': ', unanticipated expenses or, you know, expenses going up. But I think then we're being quite fair. And again, the 5% figure, it is about twice CPI, but it's used in Los Gatos, you know, successfully in that well, that's their cap.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I, I, I would argue that we allow a 5% cap. I don't think that's egregious because again, it's something we agreed was the trigger beyond, which is a trigger to to go to rack.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Remember.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I mean, I'm fine with the 5% also. I mean, I don't want to get into a long discussion on the rest of it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So can I spare them? Yes, Jose. I am to them. There'll be a suggested cap. 5%. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But there's a double penalty. Relocation benefit was the penalty.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay, well, but then you could.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's all right. Next issue. Let's go.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Got it for next issue, then. Sticking with that, the concept of no cause evictions is to cap the number of allowable no cause evictions in it in a 12 month period.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This is one of my staff report questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Go ahead, Amber Ashcraft.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So my question was how? So Mr. Potter in the staff report and this is paragraph number five right now, the cap on number of no cause evictions. And the first sentence is to prevent a property owner from undertaking a mass eviction to renovate a building in lieu of preparing a capital improvement plan.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Why would we ever allow a property owner to do anything that involves involved evicting tenants without a capital improvement plan?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We we don't want to do that. We want to prevent that, which is why we are recommending that there be a cap on the number of no cause evictions. So there's not a workaround. And so you're really compelled if you need to evict your tenants or relocate them for purposes of substantial rehabilitation, you will have to go'",
        "'speaker_6': 'through the capital improvement plan process.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So do you ever envision? So. Okay, so how would I? It's maybe it's the IRA, but how would. Would this first phrase come to pass to prevent a property owner from undertaking a mass eviction, to renovate a building in lieu?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You mean to go away to do a mass? No. Cause.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah, exactly. That's why we need to cat. That's why we're recommending that it be capped. And so I think everyone was supportive of that concept and it was really initially staff had recommended it cap at 50% and I think the discussion was 50% might be too high.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Staff is prepared to go with it. We're prepared to say we agree that that probably was too high and that 25% probably makes sense for buildings with five or more units in that. For buildings with four or fewer units, it's just one one.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'No cause eviction here.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You have to fix.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You agree so I.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm sorry the.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Fix your math because if you have five or if you have five units 10% a month is. That is one and it's 20% one. So you just need to fix the math. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We will.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But what should it be?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We have a rounding up or rounding down. Right.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. So because you would get zero if you were only about 10% of one.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I'm agreeable with staff recommendation with tax return. Parts of this, correct. You're asking for both parts?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. I'm agreeable with that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So this mainly is speaking to preventing mass evictions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Masquerading as evictions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So this.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Is circumvent.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Kind of dealing with the harbor. This would be a tool to prevent Harbor Island happening again or for $0.70 on it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And it's also a nightmare.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I would prefer I would support this for units, buildings with units of maybe ten or 20 more, because that's where the problem's been. We have not had this problem. Or for the smaller buildings. And I think the we should recognize that difference.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'In fact, the two marquees that drive this are 30 plus.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I would say sell it for a price. Thank you. Okay. So I want to speak to that because part of the second part of this, no more than one unit per year for buildings with four or fewer units.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So if they have four or fewer units, you're okay with them doing evicting all of them at once.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You don't think anything.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'There on the circumstance and and I think.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hold on now. Aren't we entering into kind of.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hold on members? They let him finish his comment.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I think those are different circumstances than theirs. That's why I've been pushing for evictions to be within the scope of of Iraq, so that those those type of where there's untrue unfairness, people have a recourse.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right, remember, they suck it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think we run the risk of having the threshold too low if we do. Or units.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But no more than one unit if you only have four units in your building.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Just so basically.'",
        "'speaker_2': '20%, 20% conceivable that what you're saying is anyone who who owns a.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Building the four.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Plex. Anyone who owns a four plex at any point in time. Even if it's. They run the risk of doing a mass eviction by definition.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So these are for no cause eviction.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This or even for.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Nothing. Well, this is.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They would think this would cap this would cap the number of no cause evictions that you could do annually. Two one if you're doing four or fewer if you were had it for plex or smaller. And it would cap it to 25% of the units annually in buildings with five or more units.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The idea. Right. Once again, the idea is that you wouldn't do a bunch of no cause evictions as a way to get get. Get rid of folks and then and not sort of be required to do a capital improvement plan or something else in support of why you're evicting out all your tenants.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But it's completely possible that in a four plex or even a six plex, that you could remove a person following the rules, like moving in a family member. Correct. And and then it's also possible that. Some other thing happens such that you do another no cause evictions that that is conceivably have reasonable grounds that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The family member be.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Allowed and you'd be permitted to do that because family move in is a different it's a no fault eviction. It's not a no cause eviction. So you could do if you had a four plex, you could do three owner move ins theoretically and one no cause eviction.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You could do that. This is this is a cap on the no cause, not the no fault.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There are differences. Do you want her to go over that?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'One last question. It's a do it again. Do we have examples of cities having this kind of language?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'No, because once again, this is tied to the fact that we're going to be permitting no cause evictions. But we want to protect. And cities either have. Only just cause eviction or they allow evictions without regulating them. So we're really this is this is kind of new, new territory.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I wrote it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I think that was the policy. You know, the choice was doing just cause which. It's a controversial issue, but we made a policy decision not to do just cause. And landlords have told us, you know, we do these no cause evictions very rarely.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And they still wanted to have the ability to do with them. So this this gives them you know, this is kind of the tradeoff. This gives them the ability to do that. And, you know, we heard landlords here today say, oh, I never evict people.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'm not going to evict people. I want to keep my tenants. But that's true. You know, that's not going to really be a big deal. Right. And, you know, this is kind of the. You get one mulligan, you know, one bad decision.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You know, we can't protect landlords from making, you know, multiple bad business decisions. And like one of the tenant people said, you know, if you do that, maybe you're in the wrong business. So you get your one shot.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Use it if you need a second one. You go to court. You know, if if you need four or five, then, you know, maybe you're in the wrong business. So I'm fine with the staff recommendation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Member Ashcroft And.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I just want to chime in and say that I object to having any exceptions to this. I think that this needs to apply regardless of what the the size of the unit is. I really don't want to see us start carving out exceptions because we we came to this project to begin with because of the stories we'",
        "'speaker_4': 'had heard. We're trying to to correct that. And so I just don't want to create different classes of of tenants. And some are protected and some aren't. And again, we're going to do this. We're going to put something together.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We're going to have an annual review. We will have a chance to look back over a year's worth of work and see what works better than others. And and, you know, tweak as we need. But I don't want to start.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So this has to pass. And you're okay to march then.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So this is the yeah, I am. I want.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That to be the same.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Because part of what we want to do is also encourage people to take care of their buildings, to maintain them. So if you really have a substantial renovation you need to do, then you come forward with your capital improvement plan, but not just move people out so you can add in, not raise your rent a little bit'",
        "'speaker_4': 'more. But we're going to do that still. The cap is in place on this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Tent, right? Yeah. I think we have.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To be aware. You're aware? I support staff's recommendation. Remember? Did clearly remember Ashcroft. You just did. Vice mayor does not remember days ago.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, my concern, you know, part of my concern is. You just don't know what we don't know. And. All due respect to. You know our experts here. I don't think anyone is really. I don't know. Has anyone really incorporated such things and understand all the questions and the nuances?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that's.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So the birds are speaking about no cause evictions, about three of us that are comfortable with it. Let's move on.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I would just say that in cities with rent stabilization there, not a lot. There are no no cause evictions allowed. So you have jurisdictions where you only can evict for cause. And those requirements have been in place in many jurisdictions for many years.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So you do have the track record of not permitting no cause evictions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So because we are agreeing to permit no cause evictions, we're going to have rules that are a little different than than communities that only. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So it's a built in protection is the way.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I see it. Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. So actually on this one, we are looking for direction from the council about whether or not there should be any kind of exemption for mom and pop property owners on the relocation benefit requirement. And if there is if there is a recommendation to do that, and there's the secondary exercise of defining a mom and pop property'",
        "'speaker_0': '. So I'd like to speak to this. When we looked at this before. It was offering additional time because the concern has been that people are being forced out. And then we came up with this thing that they would buy certain months and then it was going to be the tenant's choice.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'However, my preference is to come up with something that is the same, whether it's a small, whatever you call because mom and pop or a larger one. But I'm wondering what if it's always going to be if you want to do and it could could we do it legally if they want to do any?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Any of the situations where this would apply. There's no cause, no fault that it would always be the additional time unless the tenant and the landlord agree that then it's money and or formula or something like that. But it's always the time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The primary default would be the time unless there's an agreement between the tenant and the landlord that it would be, you know, the dollars for each month that they would all down and then have that apply to all situations.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Because what I've been hearing is that mom and pop smaller landlords may not be able to afford given it to be the tenant choice, but if we made them all, the default is the additional time based upon how many years they've been there and then they agree to lesser.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But so then it would always be the same, whether it's a mom and pop or a larger landlord.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So may.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Speak to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That. Actually, is would that be legal for us to have something like that for these conditions? No fault. No cause if we could we do that. Additional time for the buyout based upon how long they've been there. But then if the landlord and the tenant agree that they if for whatever reason, the landlord wants them out sooner'",
        "'speaker_0': 'than the landlord has to pay the tenant the money based upon the rent that we had that same formula. That we had discussed before.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The the way that the ordinance is currently drafted it, it basically provides that there that at the choice of the tenant, the tenant can extend the time to remain in the unit and give up. Well, let me back up for a second.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The way it's currently drafted is that the tenant has the choice of remaining one month for every year that the tenant has been in the unit up to basically four years, four months. But it goes on to provide that the tenant at the tenant's choice, the tenant can remain in the unit beyond the otherwise vacation date in'",
        "'speaker_3': 'exchange. They basically exchange the month rent for an additional month to stay in the in the unit. So, for example, if the tenant had been there for three years and they wanted to remain an extra month, then they would only get two months worth of additional.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Relocation benefits. That's the way it's currently drafted at the council. But you can give direction in terms of how it wants to do that. But that's currently what would be before you if you leaving aside sort of the exemption issue.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And that was and I would just add to that and the reason the ordinance is being drafted that way is because that's the direction staff received on the 5th of January. So. Yeah. And really the only there was there wasn't consensus about doing anything differently from mom and pops, but I think there was a.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There was a desire to see if the council did because there wasn't consensus on the Fifth. Was there a desire to kind of revisit that idea of an exemption that. I think it was very narrowly focused on the relocation benefits and it was really around, as you were saying, Madam Mayor, that you have the cash in hand'",
        "'speaker_6': 'to do it and would time be preferable to cash. And the suggestion potentially is that in the instance of a mom and pop, you, instead of allowing the choice to be solely rests solely with the tenant but the mom and pop, they could make the decision about the cash or the time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right, Mr. Ashcroft.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. So one of my overarching principles for what we will achieve is that we keep this simple and streamlined. And I think the fewer. Permutations the better. But also again, we need to remember why we began this discussion in the first place.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Of course, we want to be fair to both landlords and tenants, but bear in mind we are allowing a rent increase that is twice the CPI. The the concept of mom and pop landlords in even defining what that is and then also doing a means test because some mom and pop landlords have on their properties long enough'",
        "'speaker_4': 'to own it free and clear without a mortgage. We and any business owner has to keep in mind that there are always unforeseen circumstances and operate with some sort of a reserve. I think we're giving the ability to raise rents in such a way that you should be able to create a reserve for yourself.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But what we also want to do with this is to make sure that this isn't being used arbitrarily against tenants. And so I think that what we had for what is in the ordinance currently in the draft with the number of.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Payments of a month's rent based on the years of tenancy. I think it's perfectly reasonable. I worry that and I wouldn't support leaving it to the landlord and the tenant to work out between themselves because that playing field is not is not level.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And if we only give tenants time and not money, how does that help them go to their next? They're paying rent and they're looking around trying to find another place in a tight rental market. But they still have to come up with the first and last month's rent and security deposit.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So there's no assistance for them. And the the landlord is not having to take responsibility for their actions. So I would strongly objected to any carve outs of any particular categories of tenants, because that's essentially what we're doing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So then leave it at the tenants choice.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Leave it just.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Because that's what we.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Have for.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The tenants choice. Just leave it for everybody. All right. Member Odie.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'll try to be brief and I kind of agree almost 100% with everything Councilmember Ashcroft said it kind of look at this house. How's it going to play out? I think, one, you leave yourself a huge loophole. So if the landlord knows I can trade for months instead of paying four month's rent, then if you're astute, you're'",
        "'speaker_7': 'going to say, okay, I want that person out in June. You know, I'm just going to start the process early. And then knowing that I want them out in June and I'll get them out in June, because in these type of cases, possession is king.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So you want possession. So the sooner you get possession, you know, the better it is. So you're going to want to. I think there's a lot of room for manipulation. You know, I understand the concept. I understand why idea is being brought.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But I think there's way too much room for manipulation. I think it's going to be difficult to define mom and pop because I think we said this earlier, not every 2 to 4 unit is owned by, you know, individuals like we've seen here today.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Some are owned by corporations and not every big building is owned by corporations. Some are built are owned by locally owned folks that, you know, have the same challenges that the 2 to 4 units have. You know, they're on premises.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'They manage their own property. You know, they have a handy person, you know. So I don't know how you can you can draw a distinction. And, you know, I think, Brian, Mr. Maguire said it best. I mean, if you know, if you don't want to do this, don't evict people.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And the folks that came here tonight said, I don't evict people. So if you don't evict people, you're probably not going to have to worry about this. And just this is important. So I just wanna spend a few more minutes on it, you know, think about if I do an am I.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So you say I'm going to move away? Yes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Move on and remove it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'm sorry, owner. Move in. So I can't afford. You're saying on one hand I can't afford to have a relocation, but on the other hand, you're saying I'm moving in or my son's moving in or my parent's moving in, you know, and.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But by just definition, you're taking that unit off the market so you can afford to take the unit off the market and change your cash flow. But you can't afford to give somebody, you know, four months. And the same thing with, you know, this this other type of fiction, this end, there's no cause thing that we're allowing'",
        "'speaker_7': 'this loophole on where we're giving the landlords. We're saying we're not going to do know cause or just cause because you want a cheaper way than paying an attorney $25,000. So, you know, there's a tradeoff there, too. And then the other one is, if you're taking it off the market, if you're acting it now, you're already making'",

So you're making a decision that I can afford to give up that income stream. So in my mind, if you can afford to give up that income stream, you can afford to pay more months relocation'",
        "'speaker_7': '. And you know, I understand everything everyone said, but, you know, there was a tenant. And his argument to me is why we shouldn't do it. And he exceptions. There was a tenant, 70 year old man, 70 or 73 year old man.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Seven year old wife. Small unit. Four Unit. One of these people that are mom and pop on Clinton Avenue and he got evicted because the owner wanted to move the son into the property. There's one vacancy and another vacancy on February 1st.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So two vacancies plus his. And it's like. Mom and pops violate these rules. You know, mom and Pops, despite every good intention that we heard today, there's going to be bad actors, and we have to protect our tenants from these bad actors.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Every day.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'A Thank you. I feel strongly about small mom and pop landlords because for the most part they've played fair by the sentiments by Alameda. And we should recognize that. You know, you take a look at, for example, the rent review advisory committee agendas for the past two years, and I've done that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You take a look at the agendas and there's been 40 cases that I bet that have come forward. And of the 40 cases. Clearly the vast majority are apartments. So what that means is that we're not talking about mom and pop landlords.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know, I've heard from them. And, you know, I think the arguments raised about the difficulty of spreading the cost, I mean, they're they are reasonable. Cases, there are reasonable arguments. And I think in Alameda, there's a special place that many of the mom and pops play, particularly in terms of the many of the historical buildings that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'they maintain. So we're not here tonight or for the past several months because of the small mom and pop landlords. And yet we're dropping the hammer on them, most especially. And they can't deal with the cost in the same way that a ten unit, 15 unit or 20 unit apartment can.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So, you know, I think people really should take a look at the rent review advisory committees agenda, take a look at each of the addresses that are there and just Google Earth them. And you'll see that they are by and large.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'More larger apartments. Now, I think there's a case to be made for for making sure that the small mom and pop projects in Alameda are not are exempted from from things like the relocation benefit. And if they're not exempted from the relocation benefit, that they be given consideration as contemplated here where I'm given.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right. Vice Mayor, did you want.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To weigh in?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I agree with Councilmember De Saag, and it's not the size of the building. It's the number of units owned by the individual. So that's another complication. That goes into the definition. But I think someone who owns. Five four unit buildings is not a mom and pop, but someone who owns an eight unit building could be.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I think we have to peg it and we kind of did in the previous discussion where there's a cutoff of five units. So I think the number is there and I think there are also financing. You know, how you get your your loans at one point, it becomes a commercial loan.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So that might be another way to identify. I'm sure there's a definition there. I do think that there needs to be a distinction because the larger the land owner, the more financial capacity they have to weather ups and downs and to have capacity to wreak havoc as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So this is for no cause and no fault evictions. So if you have a mom and pop land, whatever that is, a property owner who wants to do a no fault eviction. So then they go ahead and they evict the tenant.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that tenant doesn't get any benefit because it's a mom and pop. But if you have a land property owner that owns five units and they want to do a no fault eviction, that tenant then does get relocation and everything.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And but nothing goes to the tenant that is the mom and pop.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'My what is my stance if you can remember last time was that I think these. The evictions should be subject to mediation and required mediation so that there's accommodation either by finance or time or a combination of both.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That's worked out on a case by case basis.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Mayor. Amber Ashcroft, thank you. So the problem I have with citing the RAC statistics is that we've all sat here and listened to people tell us that people were too afraid to go before the market because again and even if it were to be used for evictions, it's non-binding.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'All you can do is, you know, everybody has to show up and then the landlord has the option to say, yep, nope, I'm I'm doing what I want to do. But to member disagree because I know you've asked several times for precedent of what other cities have done in this regard.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'In this particular instance, if you'll note on the in the staff report on page four, they're at the top of page four, the last sentence of the first paragraph. Staff has not found a rent review slash rent stabilization ordinance that exempts mom and pop properties from the requirements of the ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I think that's telling. And it's what the mayor just said, that you would give some tenants the opportunity to have relocation benefits and others not. And I, I know that there's you know, we want to believe that the mom and pops, who are the good guys and the large landowners are the property owners are the bad'",
        "'speaker_4': 'guys. The first case I saw when I first came on the council involved the four plex and involved four sets of tenants who'd been there from 7 to 17 years, and they got rent increases of 20, 30, 40, 50% and.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They really scrambled. So I, I think I think what we put together in the draft ordinance on this is a good one. And again, a year, let's give it a year's chance to prove itself. And at the end of the year, if we found some horrendous, unintended consequences, there's things that can be done.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So you're agreeable? I'm agreeable. You're agreeable. So three of us are agreeable to going forward with staff recommendations and not excluding them. Mom and pop. It's going to be fine.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you for moving us.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Let's keep moving.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. The second to the last issue, is it the issue of the rent increase cap and affirming that there is no cap on an annual maximum allowable rent increase, but there is a threshold amount above which a property owner must initiate the process and that that threshold amount was set at 5% on January 5th.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Remember.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This is one that I did correspond with staff about because I went back and listen to oh my gosh, the whole meeting that we had in that frigid auditorium. But I was particularly interested in this because we really didn't ever have the discussion about rent caps.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So it wouldn't really be fair to say there was consensus about this. However, I am the chair. As I said, I put in my notes. The tape of the meeting reflects that there was no consensus on this issue because there was no discussion.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I'm willing to accept the 5% trigger and require that landlords initiate the process, followed by, I said, binding arbitration. But that's not quite the right phrase. And then review the statistics again in one year to gauge its effectiveness.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It worries me somewhat because we are kind of saying there's no limits on what you can charge. However, I've also said in correspondence to staff that we want to make sure that both our RAC members and the arbitration arbitrators that we use have training and understand what the guidelines and criteria are that we expect them to apply'",
        "'speaker_4': '. But again, we are charting some new territory, so we're not going to be able to see every outcome. I think there's light at the end of the tunnel, but some of this you have to take that leap of faith or keep doing what we were doing, which is to say nothing, which was having its own negative consequences'",
        "'speaker_4': '. So I feel that this 5% trigger is very reasonable. It addresses the need for owners of older buildings to maintain them and mom and pops, whatever they are, to have reserves for relocation benefits and moving assistance. So in other words, I would agree with what's on the slide before us.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Anyone else wanna speak to this?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'What about provisions for when landlords had not increased rents in previous years? Are there. What consideration do we have for that? I mean, is it as a straight five, is the threshold a straight 5% every year or in the case of Los Gatos?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think what I read was that if they had not raised the rent for two straight years, then in that third year when they're raising the rent, that the threshold is actually higher.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Right. So that's when you have rent control. But all all that this is is a trigger threshold to get you to the rack. So if you haven't raised the rent in three years and you you notify your tenant that you're going to be increasing their rent 10%, you will then go to the rack.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And part of what you'll say to the rack is I haven't raised the rent for 3% for three years. I'm sorry, for three years. And the rack then will take that into account when they make a recommended rent increase.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, in the case of those guys, I think what it is. Don't don't raise the rent here. And in the third year, when you propose to raise the rent and it happens 5%.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This isn't a trigger. There's a.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Rent control. Those Congress has rent control. It's it's the it's the greater of 5% or 70% of the CPI. So they have they have rent control, which is 5%. And so you can't raise your rent. So and it's kind of like San Jose with their 8% rent control.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If you haven't raised the rent for two years, you get 20 something first, you know.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So the same living plan if you don't. Let me explain. If you don't raise the rent for several years, somehow have to take into account the cumulative effect of that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's why, for example, previously what I've always been arguing is that at in any one year. Threshold by which. The rent review advisory process ought to be 8%, with the caveat that over two years it is no more than 12%, so that on an annual basis really 6%.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So that's what I'm getting, that there might be some times when. And it is having this hard, fast 5%.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'With a hard, fast 5% is a requirement to go to go to Iraq to have your rent increase that over 5% be mediated. Right. So I think the rack would take into account you haven't raised the rent in three years.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You haven't raised it in two years. You haven't raised it in five, therefore. We are a reasonable rent increase would be 8%. And if all the parties agreed you would be on your way with with an increase of 8%.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But what I am saying is that if in one year in year one, someone raises the rent by 3%, that means in a year or two they can't raise the rent. More than 7% is three plus seven equals ten.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And over two years that averages out to five on average.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Member. You want us on this.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But that's not part of what what's currently being considered. I know.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Right? So what I'm saying is, ah, is it a hard and fast 5% or do we take into account these kind of. But the average there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is no our number here.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is 5%. This is a trigger. I know 5% is the trigger. So I know I want.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To move on to another council member. Member.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I mean, I guess not just because but if if we do a 5% cap and you also want to have some type of of consideration of banking. But if we don't do a cap, then maybe we don't need.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm not talking about automatic trigger.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm already about to express your.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Let's move on. Thanks. I guess. Quickly. Based on the process that we designed at the last meeting, you know, good or bad, like it or not, it's kind of not a cap driven process. So, you know, I'll keep my opinion to whether I wanted to or not, but I don't know if it fits into the process that'",
        "'speaker_7': 'we.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So are you agreeable to this? Are you able to use the trigger?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Not a cap.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Because I'm agreeable. I agree with member Ashcroft in regards to this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm sorry. Are you still speaking? Mr.. I mean.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, the.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There was a trigger on when the landlord had to initiate it and then they could prove that they were entitled to something higher.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Then that's what this says.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Cap.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right. But that's what it says. And so are you agreeable to this then? I suppose pretty much the summary was the fact that we all spent all that time on last time. It's these points.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I don't know, based on the process.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So that's what this is saying. There's no cap we have. So you are agreeable.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah, I agree.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There's not. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. That's what we need to know so we can move on.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So. And I just want to say that I, I, I understand you Christian Council member deserves concerns, and that's certainly something that a landlord could bring to the. I do hope, though, that in the criteria for the rec members making decisions, it's more than just, oh, I haven't raised the rent for two years, so now I want'",
        "'speaker_4': 'to raise it 15%. I hope there's more.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There's a there's we've identified in the draft ordinance a number of factors that the.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We don't want.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To wreck.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'll trust you on that but I just. And the.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Housing. Okay. Perfect.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. All right. All right. All right. The vice mayor said he's fine with us. All right, so we're get on this real.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Real consensus on this. Yes. Those to a majority. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So now we're.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Yes. So, um, and the last issue is the one of data collection. And I think, as we all acknowledge, everyone is keenly interested in the data collection, the annual review, the check in. And really what we're looking for is confirmation that what we would be proposing is to collect the data for rent increases above 5% because'",
        "'speaker_6': 'those are the ones that have to mandatorily you know, they have to mandatorily initiate the process. And then because tenants have an opportunity to initiate a process for increases less than 5%, we could also track those, but we're not recommending requiring landlords who are giving increases of less than 5% to report to the housing authority.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And in some ways, you could argue that's potentially an incentive to another incentive to keep your rents below 5%. Where your rent increases.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I'm okay with the rent increases above 5% because they'll all be triggered. It will have will have the information. I would say just to simplify this is anything that goes to rack we track.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that's what this means, actually. Yeah, you're right. You're right. That language is clear. I appreciate that clarification. That's real clean that anything that goes direct retract.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'In any way.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But all right. And I agree on that, too.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Member Ashcroft And I think it also goes to hopefully keeping the cost of the program fees down because if we get to to complex was it Byzantine I think was the term is it too late now? So but anyway, we wanted the.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah, the. I think that we definitely need the data collection and I think that a lot of this can even be done online when I think there's a process whereby the, the landlord can make this request and do some of this online and maybe even with the license payment, there's ways that you can probably collect a lot'",
        "'speaker_4': 'of information. And that part of that I haven't. But yes, I'm in agreement with this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And the other council member, they saw.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Questions, do we know how many rack cases to how many cases come to the rack for 5% rent increases right now?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You have? I don't believe that there have been a lot. I do think there's one case that's coming up, though, that's less than 5%, but there aren't a lot. But that's going to change if the ordinance is adopted, the way the direction was given, that's going to change because it's going to be a mandatory reporting for any'",
        "'speaker_6': 'rent increase, mandatory reporting and initiation of the process for any rent increase of over 5%. It will on its face. There's going to be more cases.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Not necessarily because we might have fewer rent increases above 5%.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'If we have zero rent increases above 5%.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Which would be great.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I mean, just to weigh in real briefly. You know, I think we should, at least in the first year, collect everything. You know, as the tenant suggested. So we have data and that's what we've been asking for. And after one year, we'll have data to evaluate.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You mean everything that goes through Rack.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But we should track everything for the first year. I mean, I don't think there's there's agreement with me on that one, but that's just my thought.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I think I think the four of us were. Did you say you're agreeable to the tracking number? Just like I'm not sure where you landed on. Okay. Okay. So there's four of us that are limiting data collection to what goes through rec mean.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Can we voluntarily have people report if they want to just so it can be tracked?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Absolutely.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I repeat that separate, though, because the credibility I don't know how you would confirm that. That's actual. Who's submitting.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'All right. I mean.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Versus right now. All right. What else do you need?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's it. Somebody.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we need.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'More. So I'm. That's what staff was seeking this evening. The feedback and direction is extremely helpful to us and I think that keeps us on track for being back before the Council on the 16th.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I want to clarify this then we'll be coming back on the 16th based on the direction that we've now been given as a first reading on the ordinance. And at that time, members of the public will again have the opportunity to weigh in.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Correct?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's correct. In the staff report and the proposed ordinance will be published. It's Thursday.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Member Ashcroft So I did have a couple of comments on this. Exhibit one, the principles of agreement in this party. So the on. Okay. So I do want to see a clear written standards and guidelines for Iraq and the arbitrator regarding what documentation a landlord is required to provide when making a request for increased rent, and probably'",
        "'speaker_4': 'conversely, when a tenant is making a request for a lowered rent. This will help assure that parties using this process are dealt with in a consistent manner. I think that's important. Um. And then. Um. So then down under the rack process and this was something that one of the landlord associations raised, it's the first bullet.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Under paragraph five, it's on page two. A person with an ownership interest in the property must attend the hearing. Tenant or landlord initiated. If not the rent increases void and no rent increase for 12 months. I thought that when we amended the rack ordinance we actually said the owner is somebody with the authority to make a binding'",
        "'speaker_4': 'decision because. The. It could be that. An owner isn't able to come, but shouldn't a property manager, as long as they had decision making authority.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'At that point, that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's the way the ordinance currently reads now for for under the current process. I had understood from the Council that there was a strong desire that for the rent increases above 5%, that there would have to be the actual person with the ownership interest.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we are looking at that. And although we you do have to legally you have to be able to make an accommodation if somebody can't do it so.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That a stay they have. Right.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So because we. Because there will be a mechanism for somebody to who represents though who's legally, you know, who's who has a legally binding authority to make decisions if if they can't make it because we have to be able to legally we have to make that accommodation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But other than that, we would see someone with ownership interest.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'For the increases above 5%. If they're under five. We're keeping it as the current status quo where you can send somebody who is authorized to negotiate and come to a mediated settlement.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then on the did you remember Ashcroft? You want to go through all of your points?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think I got them.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. I had a question. So at this point, we're reviewing these principles to. The fourth bullet here under the rack process on page to.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Drain from our men.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Ah, I think this was actually the topic.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Our agreed upon was to resolve the issues of staff's lack of clarity, not to.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Um. So it says in the first paragraph set forth below is staff understanding of the City Council's principles of agreement concerning a proposed Rent Stabilization Tenant Protection Ordinance that staff will use as a roadmap for the ordinance will be presented.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think it behooves us to get out there exactly.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Because I think this is going to be part of the ordinance. So we need to get feedback. The I want to clarify. So on the fourth bullet here, it says if the housing provider does not file such a petition.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Under RAC.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If the housing provider does not agree with the committee's decision unless the rental unit is exempt. The housing provider must file a petition to have a neutral hearing officer consider the rent increase if they are here. If the housing provider does not file a petition, the rent increases void and no rent increases permitted for 12 months.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think that that should actually be the amount of the RACK'S recommendations.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That is. I think this is. Okay. So that's that's like a typo or something.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'I appreciate I just want to make sure the agreement.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Path of the planes coming in and out. And it's the FAA who controls the air tower. And for Alameda, we need to think about this, especially because there are other cities, especially including Oakland, for example, where their own residents are organizing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And while we as a city are on regional committees that deal with airport issues like the Noise Forum or something called Calk, which monitors the city of Alameda, Oakland Class Airport Agreement. While we are on regional committees like Cork or the Noise Forum, it's completely possible that members in those regional committees might not necessarily understand where Alameda'",
        "'speaker_2': 'viewpoints are. Specific let me say this at the last noise for a meeting, there were a lot of Oakland residents who came out to talk about the impacts of the altered flight paths. Residents from Montclair, especially, there had to be like maybe 15 to 20 speakers who came out.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No one ever comes out the noise for meetings and they're gone. And they are talking about getting their own council members involved. So the question then becomes in working with the our congressperson, hopefully, and also getting this to the table with the FAA.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If we go in with Hawk or the Port of Oakland, we have to wonder whose interests are being best served in that way. We have to remember that, for example, that while the Port of Oakland is a quasi independent entity, its its leading members are appointed by the council members from Oakland.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So this is an important issue. And the window for this, for this matter, is a very tight frame because this is something that the FAA wants to deal with. And, you know, I and I think the arguments raised by members from class and members from the first know homeowners association made a pretty good sense as to why'",
        "'speaker_2': 'we need an Alameda specific entity, especially involving those persons who previously served on the airport operations committee, whose incredible knowledge of airport issues is just. Are reaching.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yeah. Just briefly. I joined Councilmember De Saag in this referral. You know what? I think it's a it's a short term committee, so it's something we can get done and get out of there. You know? One of the reasons I did it is because this is not theoretical to me.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I lived for 15 years directly in the flight path, and for those that actually do that, you know, you can argue, you know, you got disclosures, blah, blah, blah, you know about it. But, you know, it is an impact on your your quality of life.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And, you know, I want to make sure that, you know, we in Alameda have have a say in this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Rascoff I don't disagree with any of the comments about the impact and and needing to do something about this. I'm just wondering. That, you know, we we pay a federal lobbyist in Washington, D.C. and we do have. As Councilmember re noted, we have a congressional representative in D.C..'",
        "'speaker_4': 'He maybe we have some local representatives there right now. But the I I'm just wondering, you know, time wise, how long it would take to get a committee set up and started. And maybe it's a we take a kind of a shotgun approach and operate on more than one friend at a time.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I, I would at least like to know what is possible to be done from a lobbying level, the federal the federal government, because it's I think what we want is to get some make an impact and get some decisions made sooner rather than later.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I just would like to know the most expedited way to do that and effective way.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I swear.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'For that reason. For the reason that councilmember disorganized. Councilmember Ashcraft said as well, I would like to support this because this direction is to have this city manager prepare an analysis. And. And a recommendation with regard to stating this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Committee a.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Once upon a time with action. So I'm curious to hear what the outcome is. So I make the motion that we. Have it looked into as requested in this Council.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Referral.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'For a second.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'll second it. And I might also add that yeah, I think you know, it could all to get it could be parallel tracks of working with the uh, with a lobbyist. But I also think, and I suspect the city manager's staff know it worked closely with people like Walt Jacobs or Dave Needle, I mean, or Barbara to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'layer. They've got some ideas out as to how we might proceed most effectively. And and they see a table that will soon open up and is and they just want to make sure that in the same way that the FAA has been accommodating people on the peninsula, that people on the East Bay area, that perhaps we join'",
        "'speaker_2': 'up on that table, that that's been opened up for the people in peninsula.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I'd like to speak on this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so when you're done.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, you go ahead. You want to go ahead? That's right. So I haven't spoken before. You made your motion, but I'd like to weigh in that I support this, but I'm not familiar with what the dormant airport operations committee was.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I would like it when it comes back that it brings whatever, however. But that was how it was composed, whatever documentation we have as to that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I did have a conversation with Councilmember De Saag on this matter. But I think from our perspective, and I don't know a ton about this, just what I've been learning in the last couple of weeks, there are about six committees that we monitor, and that's very time intensive for our staff.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Doesn't mean that this is not important, and I think it is important. And I think as Councilmember De Saag said, I think we would need to rely heavily on these citizen citizens who have this expertize. And I think absolutely, as Councilmember Ashcroft said, we would probably want to connect our citizens with our lobbyists and our representatives.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I just also want you all to realize there are about six committees that we monitor just on airport noise. And it is, you know, we have limited capability to continue to, um, um, add to that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And in fact, I want to add when I was in D.C. for that U.S. Mayors conference, we had a speaker come and say that the mayor of San Leandro was connecting with the FAA and she reached out to include me to do that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'However, we got snowed out. So what she's tried to do is set up a phone conference to hook up with the FAA and stuff will be part of that. That might be an act for this. Share that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It just seems to me that it would be logical to probably join it. But and notwithstanding what you said, Councilmember de SAC, about the port having its own interests, but, you know, the airspace that these jets fly over doesn't just go along city limits.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so there is strength in numbers. So maybe we want to look at what San Leandro and Oakland and whoever the you know, our neighbors who are also affected are are doing and, you know, get a little stronger in in.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Concert with our our colleagues.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I agree with that. All right. So we have a motion you want to make. Okay. All those in favor. I. All right. So thank you on that one. The next line be.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Can we move to the special meeting? Is that okay? Let's just move this agenda item. Yes. It's 230 in the morning.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'll move to do that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You went under.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'February 24th.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Or.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It'll be 230 in the morning again.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I got it. We got a media.'"
