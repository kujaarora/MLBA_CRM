    "Presentations by Four Developer Finalists for Development of the West Midway Project at Alameda Point (22-Acre Mixed Use Project, Construction of Backbone Infrastructure, Up to 291 Residential Units, including Commercial Development) and Provide Direction on Next Steps in the Developer Selection Process. (Base Reuse 819099)": [
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening. Michelle Giles with the base we use in Community Development Department and we're here tonight, as you said, to hear four presentations from developer finalists for the West Midway Development Project in the Main Street neighborhood of Alameda Point.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The 22.8 acre West Midway site is made available through the consolidation of the 34 acres of currently leased land and buildings occupied by the three supportive housing providers Alameda Point Collaborative Building Futures for Women and Children and Operation Dignity.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This consolidation into a 9.7 acre site is part of the rebuilding for supportive rebuilding the supportive housing project at Alameda Point. It's called Reshape. So in May of last year, the City Council approved a disposition and development agreement for the Reshape project.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And under that DDA, the city is required closer.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I know. I'm so used to this. I think a little closer. Yeah. Okay, try that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Under the DDA, the city is required to make commercially reasonable, reasonable efforts to identify a market rate developer to construct and finance the necessary backbone infrastructure for the reshaped project. So on July 10th of last year, the City Council approved a request for qualifications process to identify market rate developer.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And in August, the city issued the request for qualifications and it advertised regionally and nationally, and also sent our teams to an extensive list of potential developers. In September of last year, seven statements of qualifications were received and an initial review team consisting of City and Housing Authority staff evaluated them and recommended for teams to move on'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to the interview process. The finalist teams that you'll be hearing tonight. Our Catullus, Alameda Point Partners, Jamestown, Cyprus Equity Investors and Brookfield. The four teams were interviewed in October 2018 by a team of staff and a representative from Renewed Hope.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We used a specific scoring rubric to test this fact in your staff report. Each team also met with representatives from the Collaborating Partners and Mid-Penn Housing their nonprofit housing developer to discuss phasing of the Reshape project infrastructure, relocation and their financing milestones.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Tonight's special meeting is to give the City Council the public and the public an opportunity to hear from each of the developer about their qualifications to make this process as equitable as process as possible. The order of the presentations were randomly selected by the city clerk and each team will have exactly 15 minutes to make their presentation'",
        "'speaker_3': '. We respectfully asked the City Council to hold questions until all of the teams have made their presentations. After council questions, public testimony and council discussion, staff request that council give direction on the next steps in their selection. The selection process, for example.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'A direction could range anywhere from requesting additional information about specific developer teams selecting two development teams to go to the next level of evaluation. Or tonight you could select one developer to enter into in any negotiations. So I'm happy to answer any questions.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Now, before we go on with the presentations, if you have any.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Do we have any questions of Miss Giles? Okay. Well, seeing none. Why don't we get started?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Tell us, Tim. Thank you so much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, so then first step is I could tell it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'll do it for you. Okay? You can just tell me to advance. Okay, well, we'll get going.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening, Mayor Ashcroft and members of council. My name is Sean Whiskey and I'm senior vice president of development with Catullus. And I'm joined here by several members of my team. But first, I wanted to commend your staff for running a very effective and efficient selection process.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we're certainly honored to be one of the finalists presenting tonight. So go to go to the next one, Laura. Okay. So in the next one. And so I'll just you know, we're we're a known entity, I think here we've been here working on the island with you for 18 plus years and excited to still be doing'",
        "'speaker_2': 'here, here. And so, but I wanted to give you a real brief background. I could tell us for some folks that aren't familiar with us and members at home. So we've been in in a master development capacity for over 30 years.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We've developed numerous projects here in California and throughout the country. And we've also been involved in ten projects that are based re-use or government public private partnerships and happy to to talk more about those as we move through here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We are a TPG capital company that is important because they are a $17 billion private investment firm. They're a wonderful partner of ours. And all of our projects, including the one tonight, will be self-funded, which we'll elaborate on a little bit later.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Alameda Landing and Bayport are certainly two Pride and Joy portfolio projects for Catullus and TPG, and we understand the importance of developer diversity. It was certainly identified as a as a key component. And and we wanted to point out that through these two projects, Bay Port and Alameda Landing, we've brought Warmington homes to the to the island'",
        "'speaker_2': '. We brought tri point homes to the island. We're working with the new homebuilder out at the waterfront. Certainly Target Bay, Ship and yacht and three affordable home developers have all joined forces to build great projects out here at Alameda Landing and Bay Port.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we're looking forward to bringing one more out to the waterfront as we move forward with that project here in the coming years. So real quickly by the numbers, we're proud of it and we wanted to just run through this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So 873 residents have been completed, 197 of those are affordable involved. The construction of Ruby Bridges, School and Park, 300,000 feet of retail, which I think is also worth pointing out that several residents of the only two point collaborative site have worked at the shopping center over the years, and I understand that six are currently working there'",
        "'speaker_2': 'now, which is obviously fantastic. The maritime commercial component, which we've all worked on together out at the Waterfront, is is going through a redevelopment phase that's nearing as if you go out there today, you know, those buildings are well on their way to being transformed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We certainly have the waterfront phase, which we've talked about, and over $200 million in infrastructure to date and stalled out at the West End and another $50 million in infrastructure plan for the waterfront. So a couple other highlights that we're certainly proud of.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Alameda landing a bay port, the first fiscally neutral project here in Alameda, a standard that is now set for all big feature projects here and the island as well as we launched the first transportation demand management program that's now seeing over 5000 boardings a month, which is impressive.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we're very proud that we've got we've upsized our bus twice and considering doing it now a third time just to handle the traffic. And we're also really working on some cross estuary transit solutions that we're proud of that will be part of the waterfront phase as we move forward.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So one of our taglines, we're proud of a vision into reality. That's when we put it on all of our marketing brochures. And so 2012 Alameda landing look like this in 2018 it looks like this this is and I'm just happy to love these aerials the foreign afters.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They're fun to show off. 2012 and 2018. So and we all have likely been out there and experienced the shopping center, the public art. Willie Stargell, Memorial Anchoring Star Plaza was was an idea driven by by folks that played baseball with Willie Stargell events and all.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They brought the idea to us and we turned it into this plaza and public art piece. We think it's really important, the waterfront which all ships through here. So moving on to West Midway, we are a little bit different than some of the others tonight were before you and in a master developer role.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We think that's really important, too. And it's really important to also to know that all of our project costs are 100% funded by us. We don't need a financial partner where all of our money comes from within or TPG.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We will run this entire process from seeking community stakeholder interest. It's it's critically important to have that that outreach in building up the entitlements, all of the remediation, all the demolition, completing all of the infrastructure, and then executing a land sale RFP process, which we'll talk about here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In a minute. Our core team has been together for over 18 years here. Many of these names on here are familiar to you. I wanted to point out one in particular. Landsman sitting right over here. She's been with us for over 14 years.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Been involved in all of these complicated projects and will be with us tonight as our project manager for West Medway going forward. And our consultant team. Some familiar names here, too, but couple that I wanted to point out.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The community outreach piece is super critical. And so we felt one of our one of our first consultants that we added to the team was Becca Parata and her company to run a very effective community relations and outreach program.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And one thing that wasn't part of our RFQ that we've added here, because we believe in the public art component of this project and know how important it is. So we've reached out and they have accepted the role of community arts programing and that's being and Janet from the max and they will be a big part of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'our community outreach as we look to implement a real strong public art component into West Midway and Alameda or Alameda Point. And this project of such a great historic story to tell, and we wanted to do it both in temporary and permanent art installations within this project so that the the business structure, the deal structure of this'",
        "'speaker_2': 'deal is critically important. So and it's a little bit different than than some of the others. And we're the city. And Catullus together decide the project's vision and its priorities. We build it together and we'll go out and execute that vision.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And and Catullus earns a fixed return on our capital. So it's all known. That's the only thing that that we're expecting. And if there's any cash flow over and above that fixed return, that cash flow is split between the city and Catullus.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And this ensures that the city is is involved in all major project decisions. And it's not just the entitlement on the upfront, but selection of the homebuilders, which, you know, in some cases that homebuilder process based on on whatever, whatever we decide together as our as our project priorities, the selection of the homebuilder might not be the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'homeowner with the highest bid. It might be somebody that meets some other qualities that are more important to the city and to the project. And Catullus is completely indifferent. As long as we have our our fixed return and we're.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But we will be fronting all of the money. It doesn't matter to us if. If the project team, including the city, would like to make, uh, we'd like to make decisions that, you know, again, might not result in that is better of out of that process.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So these couple, these couple of pictures represent a something that happened at our Miller Project in Texas, where these couple trees there are these old historic oak trees that are in different parts of of the project needed to be moved.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Uh, seemed kind of silly but they're very important trees to spend the amount of money that we spent. It was a project priority that the city and the stakeholders wanted to do. So we found a way to do it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We wrapped up these trees, we rolled them over a mile to now they're permanent location. They're called the twinkle trees. And the city is is incredibly proud of it. So and we are too. And that matters that are a result of the steel structure and the project priorities that we built together with the city of Austin.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So the West midway it build out. This is all in our package. I don't want to run out of time. So but this is the makeup of the residential units. Again, during the the process, the entitlement process, we would sit together with with the city, with the stakeholders, and we would build this together.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There's been a lot of talk about commercial. How important is the commercial piece? We certainly recognize that commercial could be a big component of of the West Medway project. We've we've rattled off some of ours in our and our in our package in here, restaurants and food and beverage and production testing that's already out there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Now, that certainly could be enhanced fitness, creative office, assisted living, we understand that could certainly be if that's identified as a project priority, that could be added into. Again, it's it's all about managing revenues and expenses. And if we can make it work and it's a project priority of the city and the stakeholders we can deliver.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And and certainly it's critical that the open space network here be the connective from Alameda point side all the way through this project, through the receipt project and through the Main Street neighborhood. And so those would be certainly project priorities as we begin the design phase going forward.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So this is all about infrastructure and all about infrastructure and its execution. We understand what this project does. It unlocks the RESHAPE project for the collaborating partners. It's critical. That's what we've done here. We've spent $200 million to date delivering infrastructure and and we're proud of that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we know how to do it. And and managing those sources and uses here is absolutely critical. And and so it's something that we've been very proud of over the over our last 18 years here, working on the island.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We know your dirt. You know it very well. You know, there's this is all of the bullet points up here or the variety of different dirt types that we've run across out there, deep mud and liquefy, friable sands, undocumented fill with shallow groundwater, wharf reconstruction.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Talk to us about the work reconstruction effort with our waterfront project. It's just been unbelievable. We've been through all kinds of different types of soil types out here, surcharging and wicking, all of the utility removal and demolition, the piles, supported buildings, all of the lightweight fill and you name it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We've done it out here. We've damaged buildings that are environmentally sensitive. We've removed the materials to two sensitive landfill areas. We've recycled and ground up. It's so much material and we've reused it in a base. We know how to do that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We've done it here. We've buried a few tractors along the way. This this is sitting knee deep in a bunch of bay mud. What's not shown here is, as this excavator is the second excavator that came around here in a little bit to pull this guy out and it's sunk to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So this is complicated. This is complicated soil conditions. But we've done it and we know how to do it. And and we'll bring that experience to out to West Midway. Certainly the backbone infrastructure, it is all it's it's complicated.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's not like building in Arizona or in Texas. This is a different type of dirt that takes a lot of experience. And we're proud to have had a chance to to work through it. And and what you see out there today is, you know, something that, you know, we're very proud of.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'A couple of relevant project examples here. I think these are we picked these two because they're under the same deal structure that we've proposed here. Our Miller Project in Austin, Texas, it's a 700 acre sites, the formal former municipal airport that serves Austin.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's two miles from UT, three miles from downtown Texas or downtown Austin, 6200 single family homes. 25% of these are affordable. I'd love to rattle off the awards that that Miller has won over the years. That certainly have been a great project for us.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's about two thirds of the work completed. And and I won't spend too much time on this, but it's it's a great project and but it's one that is built on this on the same deal structure that we're proposing today.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'A great community spaces, public art, open space is a huge part of this. It's a huge part of what we want to bring to West Midway. The Novus Innovation Quarter is a partnership with ASU in Tempe, Arizona. It's a 330 acre redevelopment site of of some, you know, underutilized university owned land that's currently housing a lot of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'athletic venues at at all build out. This will be 8 million square feet of office, multifamily, residential, hotels, retail and open space. Again, it's right up next to ASU. It's a project that's just begun. And we are underway with about $12 million in infrastructure.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And and we. Are getting ready to start construction on the first hotel deal, which is a 259 Room eight story high place in Higher House Hotel and 170,000 square foot office. So these are the types of projects, again, that have been built under the same deal structure that are up underway and and thriving.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we're very proud of that. And thank you very much. I did it. I have a minute. 12 to spare. So how about that. I really appreciate the time and we're all here for questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Mr. was going to as we noted in the beginning, we will hear the presentations of all four development teams and then we'll take questions from the council. And I imagine there's public speakers as well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. All right. So next step is.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Aluminum Point Partners.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Pardon me.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Third point partners. Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good afternoon, Madam Mayor and council members. I'm Bruce Dorfman with Alameda Point Partners. And I want to introduce my team, Joe Ernst, also of Alameda Point Partners, Yvonne Armitage from a collaborative, Christopher Koester of SB Architects and other members of our team include our DDA counsel Stice and BLOCK Lane, Environmental and Bcf engineers.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'These groups all worked with us collaboratively on site A We were pleased and honored to be selected to enter into a public private partnership to redevelop City of Alameda Point in 2014. In the past four years, we've made tremendous strides to redevelop the base, leading to a construction start this past March, an event that our meetings have'",
        "'speaker_4': 'been waiting for for decades. In the next several months, the first phase of infrastructure will be completed and six city blocks will be under construction. The ferry terminal has been ordered. This is a huge development for us and for the community.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'These achievements haven't been easy nor straightforward by Alameda Point Partners, who has worked diligently, invested significantly, and engaged the city to overcome many unanticipated obstacles. Through the relationship we have developed with elected and appointed officials and city staff.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We have accomplished much and we look forward to closing on phase two of site this coming fall. We believe that West Midway should be developed in concert with site A. This will allow these projects to be highly integrated and allow the plans and users to collaborate and not compete with each other.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Given the nascent development available made a point, a competitive development could be detrimental to all. Although we don't disagree with the city's overall objective to engage multiple developers on the base, reuse development and in fact, on site we have six different developers that have been engaged on the various blocks.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We believe there's a better way forward for the Best West Midway project. Specifically, we've engaged a different and award winning design team with significant local experience to create a new, yet coordinated vision. We're balancing the introduction with a new.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We are balancing the introduction of a new design team with our significant, significant site experience that will allow us to execute quicker. Joe will discuss the Innovation District in his remarks shortly, but this idea would be a turning point in the job creation efforts on Alameda Point.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We have already negotiated DDA with the city. We know the regulatory and permitting process. We have developed required relationships with the numerous agencies and with Labor, and we have the capital commitments and construction experience to move the West Midway project forward.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Based on our site experience, we can execute on a shorter timeframe with lower costs. This provides the city with greater certainty. Now I'd like to turn it over to Joe once.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the Council. You know, from the start, we do recognize that a key goal of this project is to get this infrastructure built and to get the Collaborating Partners project underway and successfully completed.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We will not lose sight of this, but we also cannot lose focus on our major economic development goals for Alameda Point, namely job creation. We have to use the land efficiently toward these goals because this land will go quickly.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We need to continue to build on the innovation and manufacturing base that it is evolving. The question for many businesses, why come to Alameda? What is the value proposition businesses considering? Thank you. Businesses considering alameda have a different perspective on it than those that live here.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Historically, we compete on low cost. That will not work at alameda point. Simply building for the sake of having space to lease using conventional design, placemaking leasing management will not achieve a broad, sustainable jobs base, nor will it generate the above market rents needed to support Alameda Point going forward.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We can only look at Marina Village and Wind River to show examples where we have project sitting directly across from arguably the hottest office market in the country and we have 20% in nearly 100% vacancy respectively. We need to develop a brand at Alameda Point.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In short, it says, If I bring my company here, it will be better. We have a better chance to succeed here. My company needs to be here. When pitching the plan for site. We sold housing as a means to an end, which were jobs as a catalyst.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'City primarily delivers people amenities, housing and the value from it to pay for the critical infrastructure. Where West Midway should continue to be a part of this chain of catalyst, it should be the next step on a path toward this major goal a good, durable, sustainable jobs base, which can also benefit the collaborative partners.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So when I looked at the Main Street and Messed West, Midway plans their location, their adjacencies to what we were doing out there today. It creates a real opportunity and a create and it serves a real critical need.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It presents the opportunity to create a true innovation district, its central location between our existing projects in the Adaptive Reuse District, our innovation businesses, other innovation businesses at Alameda Point and site a allow us to lever and better coordinate what these can bring.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'An innovation district is a place based development. Some of it's organic, some of it's engineered. It's combining a variety of assets to create a culture for innovation and collaboration. It is intended to replicate the success of spontaneous districts like Silicon Valley, the Mission District, but do so in a more dense urban mix, setting its economic gardening, a'",
        "'speaker_5': 'community proactively collaborating to grow a variety of innovative businesses and jobs and harvest those jobs and businesses for further expansion. At Alameda Point, the environment and physical space of the district must promote clustering and collaboration, and the district thus supports the brand.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Come here and be better. Economic assets include a variety of organizations. This this district should include private entities for profit and nonprofit, and should include educational institutions and housing as well. The city will be an economic development partner with us as we go through this process.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'By way of example, Fremont, a large manufacturing, advanced and light lab hub, has developed a innovation district. They are our greatest competitor in this quarter for the types of jobs we want. We have to have a horizontal perspective and reach across many different industries, networking assets.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'These are different industry groups. We've been working with S.F. Made, among others. We have developed venture capital relationships. We are talking to various incubator and accelerator groups that would be necessary here for again, making businesses better. We should include social organizations both as beneficiaries and providers of services in the district.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And we will be working with social capital so that we can deliver space cheap for some of these more cost effectively for some of these enterprises. This district should be mission driven, managed, executing the vision as a steward of the collaborative environment.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And we have mission driven capital. Goldman Sachs is a partner of ours on this project, big investor in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. They have a mission driven strategy for this very type of program. The physical place is very important.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Attract, facilitate collaboration, create a competitive environment for these companies and attracting employees. We can best lever what we've achieved at Citi, what we've achieved in the Adaptive Reuse District for the benefit of West Midway. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to our planning team to talk a little bit about the place that is West'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Midway.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thinking on how to establish the.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Distinct identity for the Innovation District. We're envisioning the central open space that would provide opportunities for collaboration. That would be a mixing ground and a common room where the cross-pollination of ideas can occur. All right. The open space will provide a.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Quality working.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Environment for the employees, but would also provide amenities for the residents of the surrounding areas and their.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Visitors.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'By strengthening the connections and linkages with collaborating partners with Site A and the surrounding other areas, the innovation district would, through a complementary programing, help with an integrated, larger urban district.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There will be plenty of.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Opportunities for recreation. The space would be used before, during and after work hours. There will be plenty of opportunity for quiet social gatherings, but also for special events, for industry events or makers markets that could put the Mid West Medway project on the larger map of the Bay Area.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The open space will.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Create a distinctive setting for the Innovation District buildings so that these buildings can be quieter. They can be background buildings. The use of the engineering building pre-engineered buildings can reduce the costs of the ground improvements, reduce the construction costs and operation and maintenance costs while still delivering a high quality work environment.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The buildings will be filled with light and be visually transparencies so as to engage the public with the work that is conducted inside.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But these pre-engineered structures in the Innovation District can be simple but elegant and well executed buildings that integrate into the existing fabric at Alameda Points, but provide a fresh dialog with a new structure. Some say they.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They could provide the.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Opportunities for a mixed build businesses of different types for the combination of small and large and plenty of opportunity.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'For growth.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And with flexible floor plans, these structures can be a hub for activity and creative businesses to innovate and create attracting investors or the public, which help bolster retail activities within walking distance of the site.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They can provide.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'A wide range of opportunities for different jobs and different commercial activities.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The buildings being open, plan and flexible create opportunities for enhanced engagement for entrepreneurs and startups with space to generate ideas and rapid prototyping to test these ideas in real time. Housing contributes to the creation of Innovate the Innovation District, providing a mix of all densities and types to fit a range of needs from small lots to multi-family'",
        "'speaker_4': '. This housing will provide a mix of traditional and industrial character with innovative design and materials to blend the surrounding context and provide a transition from site a all the way up to the Main Street neighborhood. The design is yet to be determined, but our goals are to do so with community input.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We want to integrate into and be complementary to the mix of users of our project team. And ultimately we want to create a pedestrian scale community that engages with, with and fronts residents on the streets. We want to create a walkable community where people can live, work and collaborate.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So in closing, we firmly believe we have the vision to, one, deliver the critical infrastructure for the collaborating partners so they can finally get the proper home they deserve. We have the vision to deliver good jobs and the environment to sustain it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We've been active in this market delivering jobs for well over 20 years. We really understand how Almeida is perceived in the market and what benefits an innovation district can provide. We have the local critical relationships. The decision makers are right here, and we have strategic, strategic capital to make it happen.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Both the infrastructure and the vertical. And, you know, with our Goldman Sachs relationship, we who you know, and their experience with the Brooklyn Navy Yard, we've even recruited a few a person recently from the Brooklyn Navy Yard to join our team and strengthening our ability to envision and deliver this innovation district.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You know, our organization and team structure delivers this diversity where needed in the design, in the placemaking, in the job creation, in the capital. We are very diverse on those fronts, but we bring critical continuity where it's needed most.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think we are in the best position to move quickly. The wheel does not need to be created. We understand the agencies, the issues, the soils. We have good relationships with staff. We can move this project together quickly.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And, you know, with that, I think, you know, product development projects have challenges. I think in the definition of development, it's probably in the first sentence. I hope, you know, through the course of Saturday that folks have found us to be very transparent in how we deal with challenges that we've maintained.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The integrity of the project that we have not made egregious asks when it comes to resolving a problem that we we find a solution that meets the community's objectives. And we will continue to do that here. So, you know, we can hit the ground running.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We are committed to the success of Alameda Point. We are committed to the success of the collaborative. We're ready to go to work.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And our next development team is. Is Jamestown.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Madam Mayor. City Council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Good evening.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening. I'm Michael Phillips, president owner of Jamestown. I'm here with Michael ORANSKY from Cypress Equities and Remi montano, our product project manager at Jamestown.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Oh. So this is the two page one get. Let's sit and get it right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we will reset your timer.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Don't worry. Yeah. I only got two pages.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Great. Thanks. Jamestown and Cypress Equities as a great deal of experience on Alameda Island and our collaborative partners on this project, Jamestown being a private equity firm with 10.1 billion in assets under management and have owned Alameda Southshore Center for quite some time and Cypress Equities.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'll let Mike so just can give you a little background.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. Good evening, Madam Mayor and council members. I'm Michael Torchinsky.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm the founder and CEO of Cypress Equity Investments.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Started the company back in 2001.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'With a vision of investing in and developing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In primarily multifamily residential.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Projects. Since then, we have invested in and developed over approximately 12,000.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Apartment units.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Around the country with the value or the cost of over $5 billion. And one of our current developments is right here inside a in Alameda. We bought block nine and are about to break ground in the next 60 to 90 days on 200 apartments.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think maybe the first ones out of the ground on one.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We also were able to invest in the infrastructure, the horizontal infrastructure of site and able to get that project finally going after a lot of years. And we're also co-developing a block 11, which will be another 220 units of site.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So obviously, certainly putting our.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Money where our mouth is on in Alameda and and in Alameda Point, when we looked at this RFQ, you know, what.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Was very apparent to us is that we needed if we were going to respond.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'To the RFQ, we needed to team up with a best in class commercial developer for for this project. This commercial is very important and in the right commercial mixes is critical to the project. And so when we looked around the country and one name kept popping up and as the most really dynamic and cutting edge commercial developer'",
        "'speaker_8': 'around the country and that's that's Jamestown. And we met and we hit it off and formed our venture.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And here we are all together. And I'll let Michael Phillips.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Maybe describe to you the commercial vision for the project.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So obviously West Midway is essential in developing the statewide infrastructure for the reshot project and we as a as a sponsor feel like collectively we have the capital backing through our our fund structure and our own balance sheet equity and our ability to deliver the infrastructure through the total site to balance both commercial and residential.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We think that our tenant relationships nationally lead or lend our to our ability to attract tenants to the site. We've been a market leader in terms of taking adaptive reuse projects and industrial sites and attracting innovation, economy, tenants, advanced manufacturing, 24 hour urban manufacturing zones.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We, our team collectively has led about 12 million square feet and an adaptive reuse in the last ten years. Andrew Kimball, who's on our team who's here tonight, is actually was the lead on Brooklyn Navy Yard and brought Goldman Sachs to the table as well as the main tenants that are there today.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We we have sort of prided ourselves in job creation as a key driver to all the things we're doing and creating jobs in the innovation labs. So we think as we move through West Midway, it's an essential point as one of the front doors to the community to do something that that makes a difference.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But we're. Okay. Okay. So we believe in Alameda. We we accelerate commercial development. We do that through placemaking and activation. We do that through partnerships with with the community. We always deliver on our commitments. We have. We've been developing for 36 years in all 16 states in the United States, in all manners of of densities.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We went through the 2008 downturn, as did many others. And as we look forward in Alameda Point and the future and the current sort of geopolitical situation, we think that being able to stand behind our commitment to deliver here and deliver in a dynamic way that helps builds jobs for the island is essential.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so that's something that we pride ourselves in. For the last 36 years. We're trusted partners to government. We've we've obviously led the adaptive reuse of the Brooklyn Navy Yard. We also have worked with cities, both Boston and Atlanta, in major public private partnerships and adaptive uses.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And and I thought to be a great partner to them. So we prioritize, prioritize, job prioritize job creation. As I said before, we took Industry City in Brooklyn from 1900 jobs to over 7000 jobs and from 150 businesses to 450 businesses in the last five years.'",
        "'speaker_4': '35% of all the workers come from the local community. We've had 300 job placements in our with through our job training lab, and we have 350 local internships and youth internships on the property. So our approach. I'll hand it over to Remi to give you a walk through the details.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Great. Hi, everybody. I'm going to talk to you a little bit about our approach to the West Midway project. So we have a few foundational elements to our plan. And the very first is that we want to deliver the infrastructure for reshape as soon as possible and complement APC's existing programs since we know they're doing so much'",
        "'speaker_3': 'already. Secondly, we want to catalyze large scale commercial development and make a really lasting impact on jobs across the educational spectrum. Third, our planning efforts will be really carefully considered with our partners CEI and site A as well as would be neighbors to ensure that the district evolves as an integrated neighborhood with shared amenities and a shared'",
        "'speaker_3': 'sense of identity. That's very important to us. In addition to a meaningful base of jobs, we anticipate community facilities such as a jobs training center like we have experience developing in industry, city, as well as possibly step up services for APC.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Possibly a larger commissary kitchen. I think that might be useful to them or other services that we think would complement their facilities that they have planned for their APC site. And then lastly, but absolutely not least, we would build on Alameda Point's unique history that I think we all love so much and use our track record of'",
        "'speaker_3': 'enhancing brands through investments in Placemaking, which I'll talk a little bit about later as well. So in terms of the actual program, we would provide a robust mix of commercial products from smaller office condos to live work spaces to larger floor plate buildings to attract a really wide range of businesses and support entrepreneurship for about 400,000 square'",
        "'speaker_3': 'feet of additional commercial square footage. Back here we go. And on the housing side, we would also provide a large a wide range of housing types, including senior assisted living, in order to create a diverse, mixed income community that allows Alameda residents to build families as well as age in place.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So in terms of how those uses would lay out across the site, we've done a little bit more thinking since our first proposal to you in response to your RFQ. And I want to share that this is very preliminary and conceptual in nature.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And the whole idea is that we would want to work very closely with the community and stakeholders and the city in order to refine this plan. But we certainly want to preview it with you here. So the first thing that we thought about most was the public realm.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we would anticipate a network of streets and open spaces that create a distinct district, but that also create linkages to other sites around Alameda Point, probably most importantly, the ferry landing site as well as the Central Gardens.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The uses, as you can see here in the different colors are distributed across the site to reinforce a sense of creative and an organic neighborhood rather than a series of distinct districts. And then the whole area is anchored by that building in blue.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They're building 78, which isn't designated historic, but we think might be lovely to preserve and create as a community hub and job center. So our whole site is anchored around the re-use of that building. In terms of phasing, as I described before, our first priority would be actually delivering the infrastructure to reshape.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we have consolidated the townhomes in phase one there and the light gray on the bottom of the screen. But we've also included some commercial development on the other side of the site, so that as early as phase one, we're already activating the entire site.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then the other phases would happen in quick succession from there. But before phase one, what we really would anticipate is a phase zero in which we do some temporary programing to establish a sense of place while the DDA negotiation is is underway.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we would want to make the site an interim home to allow me points fabulous resources already potentially including Plowshares and other organizations. You guys have done a lot of great work here already. There's no need to reinvent the wheel and we can engage with those resources that are already here to create something fabulous on this site'",
        "'speaker_3': '. And then we really think that West Midway has the potential to be the first property at Alameda Point to create a pedestrian scale environment with pop up activations while infrastructure is delivered. So we really don't feel like we need to wait for phase one for a lot of great activity to happen on this site.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We believe that our strengths complement the work done to date by the city, the Alameda Point Partners and our community organizations. And we're really eager to get off the ground with this project. Here you can see a summary of our team.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We think we have the expertize and the resources and the relationship relationships necessary to finance, construct, lease and operate this project. We have the company leadership who's obviously here today. Andrew Campbell, the CEO of Industry City, would be our economic adviser throughout the project and we're excited to work with him on that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then the rest of us, you see here from Cypress and Jamestown, would be excited to be your day to day contacts. So as we think about possibly getting started on this project, a few questions came to mind for us and would probably be the first place we would start in terms of engaging with the city and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the community. And some of those questions are what community process the city and the community would envision for this project. We'd really love to start thinking more about that. We also love to understand a little bit more about the specific aspirations for the site and how it would weave into the rest of Alameda Point, as well as'",
        "'speaker_3': 'how West Midway would catalyze more commercial development across the rest of Alameda Point and how it would really fit into the sites that are surrounding it. So with that, I want to thank you very much for your time and look forward to answering questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Okay, 3 minutes to go. Okay. Well, that would leave our our last team to present is Brookfield.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening, Madam Mayor. City council members, city manager and staff, and John Roden, the president of Brookfield Residential in Northern California. I thank you for the opportunity.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Which I think is important.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So a complicated.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Site such as this. And in general.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'When we're going through the design development process, our construction group is able to help better help inform the design component of it. Joe Guerra, the lead project manager, isn't here tonight.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Coach for a high school basketball team as well. And they have a game tonight. So if Joe's not here, you get me and I'm happy to be here. So the the Brookfield Family of Companies offers a very wide range of disciplines, knowledge and expertize.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We are involved in retail, commercial, institutional, mixed use, residential infrastructure. And it really all comes together here in San Francisco. Recently, we acquired four city development and around the Bay Area. We have a variety of mixed use projects that have over 6 million square feet of office, 4 million square feet of residential and 2 million square feet'",

And before that process began in 2003 and 2004, when the Army first approached the city with the idea of taking a portion of the military base and converting it to residential.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Commercial public uses. This project allows us the opportunity to bring in. How do you know we don't have any more energy as well in the way that. I think probably the most important part of it is the interaction between the participants and the U.S. military and civilian world to try to bring the crucial officials involved as a'",
        "'speaker_1': 'long standing relationship, the project to build and years to develop and design and negotiate. It was a very complex arrangement. Property is different for a variety of reasons. One of them is the sheer density of thought involved a lot of work city to understand the constraints that we have involved because with the farming the developer like us'",
        "'speaker_1': 'would normally find. By. So this program allows us to build comfortable for the military. We give land. Once we took the land. No exclusive opportunity for us, to be honest enough, with the horses from so far away from the buildings on the northern side.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's important that we have a team that the Obama team. Third class. Schools plans, administrative offices are also building. On steroids. Part equipment. Very interesting. We provide for the Army in one time, but it's been.'",

        "'speaker_10': 'You really wanted to create a story and experience the miracle of.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Our modern community. You want to interact. How are they going to interact with the stuff that we're developing? But also. Provisions for electric cars in the home and public realm. So if your own mom doesn't want to work or even cars, you can actually park in the parking lot and charge.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All. Our project kind of allows. The development. You should be in. They were really happy about the number. But the fact is we have to talk the network of dialog. The location of your job in the city to see this project put it all together and we got it done.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The nice thing about the way we. Preserve. My help in the ballpark as it was built out in a neighborhood where people feel like people.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we believe in a strong commitment in partnering with stakeholders to deliver not just a project, but a unique community that builds on the surrounding fabric to enhance the experience and engagement of your community. With that very. We'll talk more about the vision.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Josh. Good afternoon. Mayor. Council members. I'm going to beat the clock. Just a little bit about you. We are the city's master planners. We do peer review here. We've done a number of master plans. We work for you at Alameda Point before, and we're currently working on the A North-South housing site with HB running a'",
        "'speaker_6': 'community engagement process and master plan. So we're very familiar with the city, the context here. Is unique. The specific plan sets out goals related to mixed use and mixed income and also putting in the infrastructure for reshape. What's around it though is unique on every side.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So the context and what we're going to be creating in terms of a vision need to take both of those things into consideration as the case. As far as collaboration goes, a lot of community engagement is already going on in the creation of both the specific plan and the RESHAPE plan.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We don't want to reinvent the wheel. However, we know that community engagement is important here, having done it and will work with the city to define the correct process. What needs to be done as supplemental community engagement for West Midway?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The vision. The vision starts with reshape to ensure that the supportive housing as we rebuild, we work with the partners and we care very much about this. But our commitment goes beyond this. We see this from a planning standpoint as an opportunity to integrate the broader plan for West Medway, together with a reshaped plan to create one'",
        "'speaker_6': 'community for all the residents. We work with their architects. We're going to have many architects. They have one architect, David Baker, to make sure that we develop a common architectural vocabulary. But most importantly, we'll work with the collaborating partners to make sure that the residents feel that they're part of one community.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We support transit oriented development. We believe in transit oriented development. Mixed mobility is built into this specific plan, and we will make sure that as a cue, it's taken throughout our planning initiative. We have an opportunity at West Midway to create many levels of affordability from supportive housing to market rate.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Our vision includes everything in between, including workforce housing and senior housing, and we have the opportunity to serve multiple generations from our children to seniors. As community should be. And that's a reflection of Alameda and the building types which are proposed and they'll be a broad mix are also a reflection of that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'As we said, there'll be multiple architects. That's how Alameda was built. It has a diverse, very authentic architectural character. Sometimes that's lost in larger developments, but we're committed to creating that here. Mixed use. One of the things that makes Alameda so quirky and interesting is its mixed use.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's integrated into neighborhoods. Brookfield does this. We see West Midway as an integrated mixed use district and the Brookfield family of companies. This is one example. Playa Vista has done this in a number of urban context, adaptive reuse.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We're committed to keeping Building 35. We've met with the preschool operator. We think this is an appropriate use if we can work out an arrangement for them to stay a local food and entertainment hall. This is part of our proposal.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We've been working with Main Street Property Services, Craig Semel Myer and one of the great things about this concept is that we can work with the collaborating partners to create opportunities to use and buy food grown at ABC Urban Farm and an opportunity to work with collaborating partners to provide jobs and job training.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Maker and start ups. Space and live work is part of what always seemed appropriate at Alameda Point. There are good examples of this type of use, like the active space in Berkeley on the left there. And we see this as an opportunity for entrepreneurs and startups to start out and then move out into site A and the'",
        "'speaker_6': 'the enterprise zone where more intense commercial uses were proposed in the future. But we think this is a wonderful neighborhood use. So in conclusion, we see this as the opportunity to create a vibrant urban place with authentic experience, as a place for a mix of generations.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'A place for shared workspaces. A place to socialize. A place, actually, that you and we would work and live a neighborhood first. And that's consistent with a specific plan. This specific plan saw this as a neighborhood first and then a commercial use the second.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And we look forward to working with Reshape. And with that, I'm going to turn it back over to Josh with just under a minute.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Talk real quick, quickly.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Westman. When we will be funded by our own equity, we don't need bank lending or other partners because of that. We've actually gone through the last recession and are actually.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Building out a couple of our master plans that we did have through the recession.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We have not walked away in a recession on projects here in the Bay Area. We are excited about the opportunity of working with the collaborating partners, the city and the community of Alameda to create a truly authentic mixed use and mixed income neighborhood in West Medway.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Our experience with designing and construction of complicated multi-phase projects on former military property is key to understanding the urgency of the Reshape project and the need for infrastructure so they can begin building the new homes for their residents.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you for the opportunity to present tonight and look forward to your questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Perfectly timed at this point. I know we have public comment and and I know we're going to have a robust council discussion. Does anyone have pressing questions they want to ask now or shall we move forward with our with our public speakers?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm hearing speakers, speakers, speakers. Okay. That's what we'll do.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And did you know we still get 2 minutes because it's okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So each speaker will get 2 minutes and let me call the first three so you can just edit your way out to the aisle if you need to. The first speaker is Jeff Miller. Mr. Miller is followed by Malika Chop, if I'm getting that correct.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then Michael Taaffe.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hi. Thank you. I'm Jeff Miller. I'm the CEO for the Alameda Boys and Girls Club. In my two minute I got here tonight, I want to share with you a little impact that could tell us has had with the Boys and Girls Club.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I first came here in 2012 and I reached out to tell us. Sean Westerman came out and visited with me for a while. I knew that they were major sponsors of our events, and I wanted to get a better understanding of their relationship with the Boys and Girls Club.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We had a issue come about where we identified that teens needed space at the club and they needed and we needed to do a better job of going out and getting the teens. What we were lacking was funding at the time I shared that with could tell us and Sean and they came forth and provided major funding'",
        "'speaker_4': 'for the Alameda Boys and Girls Club, which allowed us to hire a full time team director, implement programs. And we've been able to retain and build the teen membership. My 31 years with Boys and Girls Clubs, the one thing I do understand is, is that the little kids come to the club because the parents ask them to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'or want them to. The bigger kids, they vote with their feet. So we have to be on our game. What I can say is, is that we were averaging about 175 teens a year before we implemented the program sponsored by could tell us today we're serving 700 teens through the program and the retention is remarkable and the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'average daily attendance for our teens is remarkable as well, too. So they tell us is a great partner. They don't do it for recognition. They do it because it's right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And then Malika Chope, did I get that correct?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'More like a.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Shop.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Like us. Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hello. Mayor and Council Members. First, I'd like to start by saying thank you because you approved the lease of our use of Building 35 this summer and we were able to get access at the end of August. In a short three months, we were able to totally renovate a building that had been vacant for some nine years'",
        "'speaker_2': ', create immediately a middle income and high income jobs, and provide 60.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'School spots for children and families.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In the area. We also serve a total of 4040 families right now, and in the next couple of weeks it will be up to 60. Many of those families actually use the ferry. It's been a key draw for that use of the space.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I'm here to put a few sticks in the ground.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'One is a stake.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Of gratitude for making that space available to us and giving it some life in the community. The second stake is to say that we are committed to trying to have a long term positive impact on the community in that space.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And also to say that I see you have many wonderful development opportunities with great partners that have all shared excellent qualifications.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I do want to say that Brooks.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Field, both Barry, Josh and Keith were the one group that reached out to us and had an active, engaging conversation. I've had some interaction with all of them and they seem to all have great qualities. But I did.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I was excited about the fact that one of them was interested in preserving that historical building, which was previously the radio station. We've preserved all the architectural features of the building and we think we have a wonderful use for it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think it's also extremely complementary to the long term use of residential and employment. Not only are we creating immediate employment in.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The space, but one key concern.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'With families that are coming to Alameda is a way to get to work efficiently, easily, which is the ferry in many cases, but also to find high quality, great education and child care for their kids.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so we're going to be with the new ferry about a block and a half from.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you so much. Her next speaker is Michael Taft.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hello there, counsel. My name is Michael Taft. I'm the owner of subpar miniature golf, currently open, really square in San Francisco and formerly open on Park Street in Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm here today to speak in.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Favor of Jamestown LLP, who is my landlord and property manager at Gridley Square and was nearly my landlord at Alameda Southshore Center. Two years ago, Jamestown reached out to me and made an offer for us to open. A second location of our business is that they saw something special in us and they saw us out.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I've never heard of a landlord doing that for a one off local business such as ours. Jamestown offered a lease that was mutually beneficial. And this has been our central growing central to our growing relationship. I know they want me to do well because when my business makes more money, they make more money.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They backed up that sentiment then as we built out our Ghirardelli location by developing the space to suit our very unique needs. And after we opened it up, they continue to back it up by working with me on my business development and marketing, preparing the space, and consistently improving the already world class square to our mutual benefit'",
        "'speaker_4': '. During all of this, Jamestown saw that we were struggling with a broken tenant landlord landlord relationship in Alameda. They had space at South Shore Center and offered yet another lease that was mutually beneficial. And the offer would have included another buildout suited to our, again, very specific needs.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We would have carried through, but our tenancy was blocked by a current tenant that liked to throw its weight around. Jamestown, fought for us, and though they were not able to get them to change their mind, we never doubted that they were always in our corner.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'In summary, from purely a tenant landlord relationship perspective, Jamestown has shown that they are ideal. I believe I have experienced both extremes in how good or bad a landlord can be, and I'm happy to say that with Jamestown, things have never been better.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And I forgot to call the next three speakers, but they are in disorder. Tina Blaine, Janet, Corky, and Courtney Shuffler.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good afternoon, Mr. Ashcraft, and City Council members. I just wanted to speak for a moment about corporate citizenship and at Red Mix we have had the pleasure of being supported by two of the developers that made proposals here today, both Alameda Point Partners and Catullus.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I wanted to speak in particular about catalysis, very long time support of the work that we do in the community at rhythmic cultural works to support the arts in a variety of ways. But they've been a major sponsor of ours for a long time and really have reached out to us.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'A lot of employee engagement and presence at events and activities that we've sponsored here in the community. And it's not only a support of our organization, as you've heard Boys and Girls Club, but a number of nonprofits here on the island.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I just wanted to say that's meaningful and important, and they understand the importance of the arts.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Ms. Craigie. Craigie.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Mayor Ashcroft and City Council. I just wanted to be here to say that as an artist, I'm really enthusiastic about the development on the point on this huge chunk of land that's so important to the city of Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I'm excited about the role the arts can play in conjunction with that development. Currently I'm in the process of envisioning Island City Waterways 2020, which I hope to stage out on the former Naval Air Station. And it's given me cause to learn more about the history and about what's going on there now.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I have to say, reading the city's vision plan for that chunk of land is for for a layman, really impressive, and especially the adaptive reuse section and including the Alamo Alameda Point Collaborative. So I would just like to applaud you for that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And as past island city waterways, it will be a vehicle to share and celebrate our unique history with the rest of the Bay Area. I'm hoping and in dialog with Oakland Dance Collective Odyssey Dance to incorporate them, which would be a huge visibility for the arts in Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'An example of how the arts can work with developers would be staging the gathering area of this of island city waterways at site A at the Seaplane Lagoon, which we've spoken a little bit to Joe Ernst about. And that would help to introduce visitors from across the bay coming in the new ferry terminal to see this wonderful'",
        "'speaker_3': 'new development, introduce him to the businesses and what what the point has to offer. So just to say, we need to share our history with all the influx of newcomers to Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Courtney Shipler, who apparently made it out of the mountains.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Good evening. I am a resident of Alameda Landing and we've been down there about three and a half years now. As you know, Cattell us was the master developer and is also developing the waterfront portion. So I've had the opportunity to engage with Cartel as quite a lot over the last couple of years and just'",
        "'speaker_3': 'wanted to speak to the level of responsiveness and community engagement that we've had with cartel us. They have come to our meetings to present on developments with the waterfront. When there have been questions about the shuttle that they've operated, they make sure that they come to the meetings.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They're very responsive, literally on weekends. If something has popped up, that's a question or a concern of a resident. I get in touch with one of them and I'm usually not expecting a response until Monday, but I usually have a response within hours, which really says a lot about their level of engagement, their willingness to to put'",
        "'speaker_3': 'up with us. Sometimes this section of the community is going to be an important neighbor for Alameda Landing and for Bayport and will definitely enhance our quality of life. Catullus has shown the ability to innovate with regard to transportation, with the shuttle, with the water taxi that's planned for the waterfront development.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So those are two very important things to enhance our quality of life in the West End. Additionally, Catullus, as numerous others have mentioned, is such an important community partner and they have supported Alameda Education Foundation, which I am on the board of.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They have contributed to the development of Estuary Park, which we all can't wait for the next phase of that to be developed. But they their long track record, I think, really says a lot about their commitment to Alameda, their ability to make things happen here, and their sensitivity to making it a good place for the residents.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Okay. And our next three speakers and you're all doing really well. Staying within your time limits are Michael McDonough, Doug Biggs and Rachel Campos Day. I've enough is enough.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening, Madam Mayor. I don't know if I've said that to you. Yeah, this is awesome. And the rest of the council and staff. I'm Michael McDonagh, president of the Alameda Chamber of Commerce. So this is an interesting place that I am today because three of the candidates tonight are chamber members.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'One of them is our landlord. And we hope that the fourth becomes a chamber member, especially if they do in their consideration. But so I'm not here to say and if I did, they would all kill me to try to recommend one or the other.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I am here to talk about the fact that we just need to choose the best project. And I think one of the things that may be under consideration as well, a couple of people already have projects in the nearby area and so maybe we should give it to someone else.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I don't think that's really a great way to make the decision. It should be the best project no matter where. Maybe it sounds like they all have financial arrangements, so I don't think that we can make a decision based on financial decisions and certainly not on past history of such considerations because this is a project in and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'of itself. But of course, as the Chamber, we're very interested in jobs. It sounds like a lot of the all of the projects have mixed use, both residential and commercial, and I think that's a big waste. There is are we looking for more residents because we need more housing?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Or can that area actually handle more housing? And what was the naval mandate about replacing the jobs that came out of that area when the bay is closed? So from the chamber standpoint, we would recommend you pick the best project for Alameda and the best project that provides the most jobs.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It sounds like they're all wonderful projects. I don't know how you're going to make the decision, but I want to make sure that we consider the job aspect of what's going on out there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Doug Biggs.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Good evening, Madam Mayor. Members of the City Council. My name's Doug Biggs. I'm executive director of the Alameda Point Collaborative. I'm also like, Michael, going to duck the question and not pick a winner where we've met with all four of the development firms, we feel they're all four highly qualified to do their.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Part and all.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Four have a very good grasp of the situation that their first priority.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Is us and we appreciate that, is getting the reshaped development moving forward and the infrastructure and for that. At the same time, we also.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Appreciate that each of the development agencies.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Or organizations.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Have looked at value added as far as creating additional job opportunities.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Revenue opportunities, space sharing opportunities with the collaborative to make it one, one community. And we appreciate.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That. The one thing we will ask you is we cannot move forward until you move forward. We are waiting on this infrastructure to get started, the.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Planning to get started for that before we can move forward.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So we do ask that you make a decision as quickly as possible. We're at a good time now.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'For building housing.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The state has come out with additional money and we want to be there. Get ready, be ready to apply for it. So I encourage you to move forward as quickly as possible on this decision. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And before Miss Compass Avenue speaks, my next three speakers are Karen Bass, Brian McGuire and Vince Smith. Those are both the next and the last speakers. If anyone wanted to speak and didn't take our two speakers live, it's not too late.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening. Good evening.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Madumere. My name is Rachel Campos de Ivanov. I am a Western resident who knows Alameda Point very, very well. I've walked the streets every day for the last ten years with my dog and I have been intimately.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Involved with the planning.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Early stage execution of the project with this site. So I do.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Know the Army two point Partners team well.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I also know the opportunity and the vision that the site has and the city's vision that they have for economic growth. These aren't just numbers of units or thousands of square feet of commercial space, but it's absolutely crucial that we pick the right partner who can help us stand out from creating jobs and also supporting the existing'",
        "'speaker_10': 'projects that we have already underway. And so with that, I.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Wanted to lend my my my support to the Alameda Point Partners team, enabling them to expand the footprint of the project, gives them the opportunity to create a coordinated.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Approach between site A's, retail.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And commercial, and also enables them to focus on the job development that is absolutely needed. So thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So thank you, Karen Bay.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Good evening, Mayor. Council member. This is my first meeting since you've been sworn in, so congratulations. Really glad to be here. I'm here to support Almeida Point Partners for the West Midway Project. We are in the early stages of developing the final finger point and in my opinion, now is not the time to bring in new developers'",
        "'speaker_7': '. We need. We don't need diverse developers, but we need diverse buildings. And that's what Alameda Point Partners has brought us. We are also 3 to 4 years away from a potential slowdown. And so I think we need to be strategic and use this time wisely to build on our successes, to build on what we already have.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I made a point. What I love about their concept is the Innovation District. Over 80 cities have created innovation districts. Companies like Mattel, Energy Sail, Drone, Wright Speed, Kairos Energy, Astro Space. These are just some of the startups.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'They have created hundreds of jobs and an innovation district will create hundreds more. It will build a strong foundation for creativity, collaboration and expansion and closing. Our Alameda Point Partners is already mobilized at the site, and they spent the last two years engineering, designing, constructing, demoing.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'They have a strong knowledge of the site, and they will be able to mobilize very quickly and move right into the next phases of development. So I urge you to select Alameda Planning Partners. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And Brian McGuire.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening, everyone. It must be nice to be courted and got to know a lot of good suitors here tonight. It's clear you guys have a really tough decision, I think. So obviously it's a big one. I think obviously getting the collaborating partners going as soon as possible has got to be, if not one, two and three'",
        "'speaker_4': ', you know, the absolute top priority here. So, I mean, whatever it's going to take to get that job done, I think it's important. You've got a couple of developers that have a long history with Almeida and know the groundwork.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think, you know, everyone knows Joe Ernst and everyone knows Sean Westerman from Catullus. And, you know, they've been through it. They know the community really well. You've also got a couple other very what appears to be not that I'm qualified to judge, but very attractive looking groups and proposals from the other two applicants.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I think one thing I did want to mention just personally is that I hope when we do move forward with this, I know there's a lot of tricks and and details with how the unit counts work at the point and what units we can allocate.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm curious to see if there is any single family or maybe even in the townhome style units that get built at site or at West Midway. How does how how would a to use figure into that could 80 would 80 use count as units.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Because I know there's opportunities these days to build a to use into new construction single family homes. So I'd be interested to hear more about that. And hopefully the city is is thinking about these questions and whatnot as we go forward.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I wish you really good luck trying to figure this one out.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Vince Smith.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You mean mayor and council? I am the founder of the 523 nonprofit Blue Endeavors Our Mission. We do ocean and bay conservation, restoration and education. So locally we work with Alameda High School students, middle school students doing beach cleanups, bay cleanups.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We host our version of TED talks and events like our October fest at Southshore Center. We also do a lot of monitoring. Our eight year olds even go out and collect plankton and we monitor water quality and work with programs like the Wild Oyster Project.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We actually are in multiple states. We are international. We started in Silicon Valley. The reason we came to Alameda is because of not only the maritime history of of Alameda, but also this really is the hub of marine innovation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I would encourage you, as you're making this decision, to to really factor that in as well. So we hear a lot about job creation, entrepreneurship. But what makes Alameda truly special is how much actual innovation does happen in this city.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so one of the things myself and a lot of people are always pushing for is also working waterfront access and that to be a consideration with all developers. Today I actually am here also speaking our land. The word is Jamestown.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And when we moved to Alameda, we actually did have a difficult time finding a home here, even though we had a lot more support on the peninsula. I will say I haven't really had any interaction with the other developers, but from day one of talking to Remy at Jamestown, they immediately embraced us, our mission and since then'",
        "'speaker_4': 'have continued to work with us to really set up Alameda as the Northern California Community Hub for conservation, restoration and Exploration and education. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. All right. I don't see any other speakers left, so we will close public comment. And let me just say at the outset, before the council starts to deliberate, that I want to thank all four development teams for all the time and effort and energy you put into not only preparing to go through the process that'",
        "'speaker_0': 'brought you here today and you are the short list, but also for for meeting with us, I think. I know I've met with members of all four teams and and to thank you for all the good work you were doing in our in our area in other states.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So and I will just say at the outset that we have four very impressive qualified candidates. So with that. What we're being asked to do if we perhaps just start with the the end in mind is we are being asked tonight to provide direction to staff on the next steps in the selection process.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that could include direction to enter into negotiations for an end to an exclusive negotiating agreement with the developer. And if I recall correctly, that would be for a years term with the possibility of a couple of extensions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So starting with the end in mind, how would Howard Council like to like to proceed? Do you want to talk about different elements of different proposals? Do you want to talk about different applicants? Let me know and we're going to be a little bit flexible on them.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Time for comment. I mean, don't feel like you have to take your whole 9 minutes. But this this merits a full discussion. So you are uncharacteristically quiet, everyone. Okay. Councilmember Desai, when you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thanks. I'll just, uh, address maybe one or two points. I think the nature of the RFQ process is such that it lends itself to want to know more versus, you know, from the RFP process, you come up with your nice designs and and kind of commitments that you're going to make and you know what kind of capacity'",
        "'speaker_5': 'you have to deliver. You know, there are a few processes. You know, you kind of saying, this is our company, these are our qualifications. That's what we've done. But the difficult part is in doing Alameda Point generally or even west of Main Street specifically, we have such as a city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Over the many years, we've had such lofty ambitions as to what we want to accomplish. And because we want to accomplish something very unique with regard to not just economic development, but a kind of social economic development where you're not just coming in and wearing your developer hats, but you're going to we expect you to partner with'",
        "'speaker_5': 'entities like the Alameda Point Collaborative and the other nonprofits there, as well as any of the innovative businesses that are in unique economic sectors. So to me, what that means is that I'd want to hear out, hear more how, you know, a certain number of entities would flesh that out.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'How would you work with people like the Alameda Point Collaborative? You know, what has been your experience and previously in working in this kind of environment and moving people from people from places of incredible economic and social need to to achieving their individual capacity.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'What had been your experience in working in that kind of environment? So that's that's why I think to me, it lends itself to wanting to not just choose one, but flush out more from others. So that would just be one area that I want to hear more about.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And and I think the nature of the RFQ process is, is I can't really hear that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Who else wants to? So let me ask and interject a question. You want to know more? Would that be by narrowing the list down or you want to know more from.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'All or exactly by lowering the list down?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'By narrowing the list down. Okay. So do you have some criteria in mind?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, definitely, you know, proven capacity in working in this kind of environment that we're setting up for the Midwest and West Midway and anything west of what I call west of Main Street. You know, for example, when we did Bayport and you know, pardon me when we did Bayport, we did it in a silo because we wanted'",
        "'speaker_5': 'it to be a residential development that's going to generate, you know, value that we can ultimately jumpstart. Alameda Point. Likewise, when we did Alameda landing, it was kind of in a silo. Likewise, west of Main Street. Ever since, you know, the mid 1990s, I think Alameda Point Collaborative had kind of in conjunction with their partners, have been'",
        "'speaker_5': 'kind of working in a silo. But now we want people at, you know, the developers and their financial partners working with these entities. So I wanted. So in narrowing down the list, I would certainly want to know more about, you know, who had demonstrated capacity experience in working in this kind of environment.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So that would be one area.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Odie, would you like to go next?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sure.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Now I'll learn that for next time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That won't help.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I guess I was intrigued by my colleague's comments. I know he's gone through this a couple of times, right? You went through Bayport and did you go through site at that? You went through site also. So, I mean, it's kind of hard for us to sit up here and pick winners.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You know, I, too, like want to know more than than we've gotten today. And some of those areas are around the finances. I mean, one thing I've noticed in these projects, and that's through no fault of the developers.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So it's not a slight to them at all. But, you know, the finances always seem to, you know, change. And we don't know what's going to happen with the market. And, you know, we've had good times now and still had issues with two of these projects out there.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So how are we going to do this with, you know, a negative forecast on the horizon? So I know some of them are talked about. You know, they're I look at my notes here where they have their financing.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You know, they're funded by their own equity. I think there was one of those that said that, you know, one of them, Goldman Sachs, was a partner 100% our cost funded by them. So that's that's the important thing.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You know, I think it's important for us to to know that, you know, what we see in these these pretty pictures right now, you know, that's not going to be what's there. And, you know, we've seen these projects from, you know, pretty picture phase to DDA phase to even, you know, amendments one, two, three, four, where it'",
        "'speaker_8': 'changes. So I don't want to get too hung up on, you know, expecting, you know, something that's in this picture. And it, you know, again, Tony, you've been doing this for a long time. And I think you probably remember back in the nineties, you know, we didn't envision this thing called innovation and, you know, incubator spaces.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That was not what we were targeting. So we were targeting things like genetic companies and high tech companies, you know, and now we've moved. And, you know, that's where we're at now. I mean, is that at the top of the curve?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And is some is the next big trend something else in five years? Because it could be more than, you know, more than time that we want to before this happens. So I'm curious to hear more and I like the fact that three of them actually have relationships with Alameda, you know, even even the Jamestown partner.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I mean, they're the landlord, but the group that they're partnering with is actually doing some of the construction work. So and I know Brookfield has a really positive reputation. So I mean, I'll I'll hear more from my colleagues in my other 6 minutes, but, you know, I'm not ready to like pick pick one yet.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Counsel, can I just add. But, but sorry, but cognizant of the two of the speakers said we need to do something quickly for Alameda Point Collaborative so I can be convinced, but I'm not quite there yet.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Avila And.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Apologies for snacking up here. I'm six months pregnant. My baby has decided that morning sickness should come in the second trimester. But I think that there's a few things that I'm looking at. One of them is finances. I do think that making sure that the financial aspect of the projects is there, that it's dependable, that we know'",
        "'speaker_10': 'that the project is going to be able to come to fruition. I'm not so much interested in starting it right away as I am in making sure that it's completed in a realistic and accessible time frame. That's going to mean that we actually have housing units and commercial space that is ready for tenants, and that's what our'",
        "'speaker_10': 'need is. Our need is providing housing as soon as possible, not just for the residents at APEC, although that is a huge need and. So lately critical part of this project, but also providing additional housing units out there.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Some of the things that I'm looking at is, you know, are we contemplating outside of the units that are being designated for APC? Are we providing housing at all levels? Are we meeting our regulation? And in 2017, in the fall of 2017, this council passed, I think the BIA called it the most restrictive universal design ordinance in'",
        "'speaker_10': 'the state of California. To quote them, I think so, they said. But part of that audience was really geared at a couple of things. It was geared at visit ability, making sure that the units that we're building for residential and also for commercial were visible, that people of all you know, all people could go and actually use'",
        "'speaker_10': 'the space and use it in a meaningful way and be able to visit friends and family who might reside there. That goes not just for the units, but also the connectors between them. It also goes to habitability and livability for folks who are disabled.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I think that, you know, what that ordinance said was that we want 30% of our units to have that. And so that's a key component for our new construction. And it's something that I know that this community cares about.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And there was several meetings on it. And it's something that I, I would like to see more of and that I'm looking at. The other the other thing that I'm looking at and I think everybody who came out tonight at all, all of the finalists show that they're good community partners.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That's great. That's something we want. I encourage it. I'm glad that it's happening and I'm glad that there's a continuity of it and people looking forward. But I also want to make sure that the connectivity kind of when we look at connectivity, it's not just with our community partners, but it's with the other neighborhoods in Alameda, not'",
        "'speaker_10': 'just in Alameda Point, but throughout Alameda. The point should not be the point that's over there. That's not part of the overall community. It should be part of our community. And it should we should be thinking about things of, you know, transportation issues.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I'm glad that we're talking about pedestrian based design. Bike mobility is very important, and it's something that we've spent a lot of time on, especially when we have things like the ferry terminal out there. How are we going to make sure that we can create safe bike routes for the folks that are going to be living in'",
        "'speaker_10': 'these areas to those transit connectors, whether it's the the new ferry terminal, the existing ferry terminal. How are we going to get AC transit to do that last and first mile? How are you going to partner with us to make sure that we can meet those transportation demands that we need to problem solve around, not just in'",
        "'speaker_10': 'your neighborhoods that you're going to create for us, but among the neighborhoods that exist. And how are you going to help us get people on bikes and on foot through your neighborhoods and to these transit connectors? And I think that, you know, we heard a little bit about that tonight.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I know that there's more information and what you submitted. And I think that, you know, those are the types of things that I'm really looking at.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Vice Mayor Knox, wait.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you. I'll start by saying, echoing, it's clear that all four of the teams that were here tonight have strong ties to our community. It was pretty impressive. I can't remember how many of the speakers said, we have a hard choice.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I was hoping that the presentations was going to make this an easier choice. If anything, it made it more difficult. So well done to all of you. I think I could probably go through all four of the presentations and point to things that I very much liked.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I'm trying to remain mindful that at the end of the day, we're not developing a plan tonight. We're choosing somebody who can deliver a project, a project that is not designed in a project. So it's really trying to trying to see if we can come to a place where we think that we have somebody we'd like to'",
        "'speaker_11': 'move forward with. I do appreciate also that all of the teams highlighted our commitment to moving forward with the Army two point collaborative project. That project is decades in the waiting, and as Mr. Biggs mentioned, this evening, has to wait further until we make this decision.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The city has been, I think, a really good and strong partner in the last few years in moving this part of the project forward so that we can move what we need to do for our made a point collaborative.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But we have 500 who have been waiting over 20 years to move forward. And so I think to the extent that we're doing our fiduciary and and good government diligence, I think trying to find a way to get going.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'First, I have a couple of questions. I was wonder if we could ask staff to, of course, try to avoid asking for pride. But if somebody from staff. I have a couple of questions that if I could ask.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Um, perhaps Ms.. Ms.. Giles and Ms.. Potter as needed. Okay. We'll have right back up. Okay. Your question.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So I think, you know, we have we have a number of developers who have varying degrees of experience working in Alameda. And we've heard everything from we can just use our existing DDA partners to we have lots of experience in other bases, but maybe not so much local experience.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I know that before this came forward, staff has done a lot of analysis on the financials, on the ability to perform, etc. And my understanding is staff, rather than asking questions I know the answer to, feels that all four are qualified developers that we could work for.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I want to I'm curious from staff's perspective, because you are the ones who have to work with the developers on the day to day to get things done. How important in moving to Vice Mayor Vela's point, how important to moving a project forward through the process?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Is that experience, that past experience? Where do you feel that all four of these have enough experience with development that Alameda is not so unique, that that's important?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I would say that we're probably not that unique in our process for coming up with a disposition development.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Agreement, going through the the.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Planning process. I think it's all pretty similar in other jurisdictions. And I think we as a staff have learned a lot for how to push it forward with our our last couple of. Experiences with developers.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Right. And then to the to the question that are the point that Councilmember Odie raised, which was definitely high on my mind in terms of I get outside of a lane I'm comfortable with in terms of capitalization and financing, etc..'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We heard and obviously you wouldn't have brought it forward for teams that have financing to do this. Is it fair to assume that all four of these teams have the money in place and do not need to go find it?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Or do they have partners who will then have to go to? Sometimes what happens is we have the money, whatever else, and then you spend 12 months or 18 months while somebody goes to the market to identify where that money's going to come from.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And then it becomes a negotiation and then your project changes because all of a sudden the people who are financing it don't like exactly what's already been negotiated with the community. Where are we in terms of the four different teams?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'On how they're financing the project and how certain that money is?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I would probably bring up our consultant who did some initial financial analysis. James Uh.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, I'm beckoning him up.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I don't know, I'm blanking on his name, but.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'James Edison. Mr. Edison. Yes, it's it's because we put you on the hot seat, but. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you, Mr. Giles.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Sure.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Good evening. Do you want to introduce yourself?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes. I'm James Addison. Will then financial services, also a resident. Mm. I've been working with staff on this and other projects. Tell me the point of the things. Animal shelter, lots of different stuff. And please let me say congratulations to all of you for I don't think I've addressed you as a the new council and nice to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'be working with you. So in answer to your question, in October, I put together a memo for staff looking at this issue of capitalization. Who's got the finances? Where's the money coming from? As you said, I think a staff is a the short answer is there's no reason to think that that any of them doesn't have the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'capacity in one way or another to finance it. The one distinction I think is important is is the difference between the ones that really have the capital of themselves versus the ones that have to go get it. Although I think that sounds like more of a distinction.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It really is, because even the ones that are self-financed, they have an investment committee. And when it comes time to cut the check, they're going to look hard because, you know, I mean, yes, they have a contract to develop.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But when it comes time to actually cut the check, they're going to look around and make sure that they're not walking into something because they've got responsibilities. You know, they're all they've all got fiduciary responsibilities that, you know, they fully intend to perform in every case.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But as we've as we found at the base and at other places, you know, circumstances change. So I would say that the thing to look at I mean, I do think, though, it still is a significant distinction that, you know, when you're when you're going through the DDA process and when you're getting to your entitlements, you know'",
        "'speaker_4': ', the ones that are self-financed cannot come to you and say, well, if we have this partner and they say we have, they're not, you know, they're going to, you know, that little that sort of two step, you get a little bit sometimes that we're self-financed.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You can say to them, what do you mean you don't? You know, you're not. It's your money, as you said, in front of us several times. You're spending your own money. So we're expecting you now to spend your own money.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So, I mean, like I said, that sounds like a big distinction. But the fact is that that in every case, you know, they'll can get the capacity. They've all got a record of performance. You know, the level of investment required here is something they've all performed on before.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There's no reason that they can't do it again. They're all experienced. I mean, so in that sense, I think there's not really much to distinguish among them. You know, they're all capable and qualified developers.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'In terms of the ability to move forward quickly. Do you think that there's a distinction between those two self capitalizing versus having to go out?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I don't think so in either case that they if they've got a yes, I mean, for example, you know, you've heard Goldman Sachs come up several times. I mean, Goldman Sachs they've they can move fast and they've got lots of money.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There's no question of that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right. And I think Councilmember Desai has a question on.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The issue of financing and self-financing. Is it what is your experience? If someone is self-financing, might they have higher expectations of return and when they get the money? And could that have an effect on what we expect in terms of, you know, the money that we want, not just for infrastructure but for other public benefits?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Could that be the scenario versus, let's say, someone who, you know, gets the money from from the markets, from Goldman Sachs? Right.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So a big distinction there is the source of the money because whether it's third party or self-financed, that money in turn is from somewhere. I mean, it can be it can be a mutual fund. It can be family money, you know, a large family trust.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There's lots of sort of structures which are more or less patient and more or less demanding in terms of returns. I think in my experience, the ones that are internally financed, that are using their own money are a little more patient.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I mean, they think a little longer term, you know, they don't have someone who's whose only investment in the in the project is an investment. There isn't a sort of a larger picture of sort of long term ownership.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You know, there are some differences in the in the candidates in terms of some that really, you know, they're in the business of financing, building and operating real estate. And that doesn't mean they never sell anything. But. I mean, they continue with it and they own it and they operate it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's their business. And they they use the money to achieve that versus some of the others where their business is really to make money. And so they're a real estate operation and it doesn't mean they're fly by night operators.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I don't mean that. But that's their business. Their business is to develop the property and turn it over to somebody else who's going to either on the vertical side or they sell homes. You know, that's that's how they and that's how they get their capital back.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Right. I mean, they've got to they have to turn their capital over and use it somewhere else. You know, neither of those models is superior, I would say. The but they they do give a different kind of psychology of how they do their business.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Sure.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Does anyone have a financial question? Yes.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So on one of the proposals, there was a comment that they were going to the net cash flow after payment of the fixed return would be shared between the city and the developer. I mean, did everyone come up with that and only one of them shared that or.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You know, I didn't remember that detail from looking at the proposals. And to be honest, that wasn't I wasn't actually asked to evaluate that issue. I was asked to look at the financial capacity. You know, that's that's a fine thing to say.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I mean, the devil's in the details there. And.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yeah, my follow up question would be, I mean, do we know what that rate of return is? You know, in the past we've seen it at like the DDA process during the price in terms of negotiation. But, you know, we don't we don't know if, you know, we just don't know.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah, we don't know. I mean, that that rate can run, you know, a vertical developer who's just a builder might want to see in the low teens on their investment speculative, you know, some of the projects like other other based reuse projects might they might want to see in the twenties, which is, you know, pretty high.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I don't think that number I don't think they're looking for that number anymore. And that's not to speculate. I'm not speaking for anyone here, but just that's the sort of general range of what I've seen. But what what they have in mind, I mean, that's something they would have to tell you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I don't know.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Any other financial questions? If not, we'll thank Mr. Edison for your time. Thank you. But I believe Vice Mayor Knox White has another question.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I have one last question. I don't know which.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Staff member you can flip a coin and see who wants to come back.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'When I ask it, and then you can decide who's the right person to do it. But but this process started sometime in September with submittals. There has been a, you know, I'm glad we're here, but there's a lot of you have had the information for a long time.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Mr. Edison's done his analysis. I would like to hear from staff as to whether they have any ideas of which developer they think meets the needs of the of the community. If they were to have to make a recommendation, which is often times where this goes, what recommendation?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And I'll ask you to show your work in doing so.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And do you notice no one is jumping up to answer that? So whoever loses the coin flip, please. Temporary. Miss Potter, it's you.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Hi. Rose up hill.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening. I'm Debbie Potter, the city's base for youth and committee development director. And it is true that initially we had a process that was outlined in the staff report about how we were evaluating the the proposals, the request for qualifications and the submittals that we got back.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we did convene two panels. Ultimately, the final panel went through a process of ranking all of the proposals. We had a criteria matrix that we used an evaluation matrix which was included in the staff report so that the Council, as well as the public, can see the evaluation criteria that that was used when the panel met'",
        "'speaker_3': '. We. We were prepared to make a recommendation to the council. It sounds this evening as if the Council is interested in more information about all of the proposals. However, if the Council is interested, we can absolutely share where staff's recommendation was.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If that's what the Council would like to hear, I just don't want to. If there's a desire to seek more information from all of the proposal proposers, I don't want to get necessarily sideways of that process.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Actually, I'd like to have my comments before we get to that point. Councilmember de SAC.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Let me ask a question on that point. So what would your recommendation be then? Not in terms of who to select, but how to proceed?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'What I have heard. I know the mayor hasn't made her comments yet, so perhaps she would like to weigh in. But today, you know, so far what I've heard is that there is a desire for more information and how to balance that desire for more information against a desire to move quickly, because the Reshape project is dependent'",
        "'speaker_3': 'on us selecting the developer and moving forward with those negotiations. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So with that, I would thank you, Miss Potter. I'm going to make my comments. So I'm going to wait for the door to be closed so we can have some quiet. Okay. Okay. So everyone who's coming in now, we're still in the middle of the meeting that started at 5 p.m., so you'll have more space, I'",
        "'speaker_0': 'think, to actually sit. But if there aren't too many of you, you can come in. Otherwise, we. It's better not to be standing in the aisle. Thank you. I don't think we're too far away from starting, so I come for you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, so my comments, this is a tough decision. We can unanimously agree on that. We were, on the other hand, elected to make decisions. And they're mostly tough because the low hanging fruit has already been been picked. And so this is the directions that I would take.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I have to admit, I'm extremely intrigued to hear what Miss Potter would tell us about the staff's perspective. But I will also share that initially that was the process that staff was going to come forward with the recommendation to the council to approve any and a and moving forward to negotiate an exclusive negotiating agreement with one'",
        "'speaker_0': 'development team. I felt that that was more appropriately a decision to be made by the council, that the input should be heard by the public. And I appreciate the way this process has played out so far and any way it goes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think we've done a great job staff in bringing this to us and great candidates. So here is my, my, my thoughts. I know all four of these teams. I've spent a lot of time talking to them actually over the years and going out and visiting projects even out of town.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'For some of them, I feel that at Alameda point it is time to diversify just in the way that you would diversify your investment portfolio. It's good not to put all your eggs in one basket. And especially as has been noted, more than once, we are heading toward an economic downturn of some sort.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We just we know we can't keep going up, up, up in the trajectory trajectory we've been in. And we know that there have been challenges. I think, Mr. Ernst, from our middle point partners, said, you know, challenge must be in the definition of what a developer does.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I feel that we heap even more challenges on developers that are currently completing projects in Alameda, and that would be Alameda Point Partners and could tell us and I will hasten to say I agree with everyone who highlighted the contributions that these developers have made to our city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I acknowledge that. I appreciate that. I also expected of anyone who comes here to do business and develop. I expect whoever you are, you will be a good community partner. I don't feel it is a criteria upon which to base the selection of this very important development team.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What struck me about the two newbies, if you will, but not really because they're working in some way, shape or form in Alameda or have in the past. Is that Jamestown's emphasis on job creation the example of of the industry city in Brooklyn, New York.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It was something that they talked to me about when I met with them and also that they want to do a job job training center in addition to the job creations that they want to do. They want to have a job training center.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And this is very important not only for our residents at Alameda Point Collaborative in the whole Reshape neighborhood hood, which I think most of you in the room understand is the combination of Alameda Point, Collaborative Building Futures, Operation Dignity and I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I'm I'm very intrigued by that. I also think that Brookfield is worth taking a closer look at. I appreciated them saying that their vision starts with the reshape opportunity. They want to create a feel of one neighborhood being a part of the other.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And they also looked at the opportunities for job creation that makerspace and startups could eventually move on to our enterprise district, which will be maybe the next phase we start to work on. And and both both of these developers talked about a diversity of housing that we want to create, not just housing for families, but also housing'",
        "'speaker_0': 'for people to be able to age in place. And if I'm recalling correctly, I believe they both talked about doing a. Living facilities. I will very quickly echo what my colleague, Councilmember Otis, said. This was a request for qualifications.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Staff purposefully did not do a request for proposals because that is where you get the pretty pictures. We got a shortened version tonight, but at this point we are only selecting a team or teams to move forward, to negotiate, to begin.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It would be a one year process, one year and maybe a little more with some extensions of working out an exclusive negotiating agreement, what it would look like to move forward. I, I think we almost can't make a bad decision.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I feel from my perspective, it's time to get maybe some new perspectives, but also with track records of what they've done in other areas. So my proposal would be in council, see what you what you think would be that we ask staff to work with these two teams to get more information and answers to the questions you've'",
        "'speaker_0': 'raised. But I want to hear from my colleagues. Who wants to go first? Councilmember Desai.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'll go first. You know, to me, the both cartels and Alameda Point Partners have demonstrated their abilities in a difficult environment that Alameda has. And I know that obviously the other two developers and their teams are incredibly great developers and you've done wonderful projects.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But all I know is that at the end of the day, ABC took the time to hammer out a DDA that really took into account community needs. And and while I wasn't there when certain issues had arose, I was very supportive of the Council's actions that you took in furthering the DDA along.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Likewise, cartels cartels has been around for so many for several decades now. And and I think there's something to be said about about the work that they've done in the city of Alameda, in the base conversion process, particularly.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I mean, I really appreciate, you know, the the expertize that the other partners bring. But I have to go with what I know. And these guys have proven themselves. So I would encourage us hammering out or fleshing out issues that are of interest to us with to find lists.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'My my and I was at my mind is APEC in Qatar. And then after coming back, then we'll select one person who will enter into it in a with.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And just for clarification, you've said APC, which is Army two point collaborative. I think you may now be the point partners. Okay. Our next speaker. I'm not looking to volunteer.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I made eye contact, so I did. I mean.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I've been listening to everybody. You know, I think there are valid points made by all of my colleagues so far. I do think the two new people that haven't worked in Alameda as much, you know, do bring an attraction to us.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But on the flip side, you know, they haven't worked there yet, Alameda Point and developing our naval base. And I still believe even though I think one of the speakers said we're not that unique, I think with staff it is kind of unique, you know, because we have our own soil.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We have our own community. You know, we have our own process. So I don't want to undervalue that experience. I also am cognizant of of the potential risk of putting all your eggs in one basket. So if I personally is still not ready to narrow it down.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I'd like to hear from the two AP and can tell us if they are moving forward, you know, how they would mitigate that potential risk because that that could be an issue. But I don't want to undervalue, as my colleague Mr. Daisuke said, the work they've already done in Alameda, an experience that they they've they've gleaned'",
        "'speaker_8': 'from that work. So I'm not ready to pick two. I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Who's next? Vice. Maybe that's why I'm dead. No. Yeah. Okay. All right.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I'm struggling with. I guess I'd like to I'd like to hear more from the three of you and maybe.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Councilmembers about.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It, because all three of you have said you're not ready to to move forward. You'd like to hear more. I'd like to hear more about what is the the dove in them. I'm not I'm not clear what what we're at what direction and specific things we're asking that are not in the in the reports that we got'",
        "'speaker_11': 'and whatever else. I don't have any really. I personally don't have any burning questions. I'd like to hear more.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think. Villa, do you want to add something before we hear from my colleagues? Yeah, go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And this may get to Vice Mayor Knox White's question, but one thing to get to my point earlier about, you know, I want to see the project actually be completed. I want to see it's not just start. I want to see us finish and I want to see it flourish.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I would like to know specifically, are there any projects that have been performed here in in the Bay Area or here in Alameda, where any of the four have been involved, where there have been significant delays? Because to me, that's a track record that I would like to look at.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Have are there any projects where there have been significant delays, whether it's in the negotiations portion of it or it's in the the actual project construction portion of it? And what were those delays? Were they hold ups based off of labor issues?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Were they hold ups based off of financials? Were they hold ups based off of some sort of deliberation between a couple developers trying to figure out what's going on with the project? Those are the types of things that I want to know because we have a number of projects that are currently also underway.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I think if we are going to look at folks, that's part of their track record that I would like to know about. I also think that there's a reason that the city decided to not hire a master developer.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And part of that was to have a bit of diversity out at Alameda Point so that we can make sure that these projects, if there's some sort of issue that comes up with one, that it doesn't impact the other.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It's not to say that I but I also expect that whoever goes in there is going to be working among the various projects that are going in. So, you know, I think, at least from my perspective, I'm willing to and I think we should move forward with two tonight.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But I have seen catalyze complete projects and actually get them done. Here in Alameda, I'd be willing to consider them as well as one of the other newer applicants. But I do want those questions asked and answered in full about, you know, any significant delays that have come up.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I would just interject a comment on that. I that's certainly, I'm sure, information we can determine or find out about what projects have had delays. My only caveat would be there are so many reasons unique to a project that could cause delays that I'm not sure.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, that's information we can gather, but then I'm not sure how much weight it would be fair to assign to that. So just something to keep in mind. I think it.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Depends on the nature of the delay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If it could. Let's see who had the hand up. Councilmember Desai, just quickly.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Vice Mayor Knox White had asked, well, what do you mean, Tony, by like, you know, wanting to hear more information? I think that was the gist of your question. So here's an example. You know, what we're trying to achieve at Alameda Point, west of Main Street, we all agree, is something unique with regard to not only economic'",
        "'speaker_5': 'development, but social economic development in the way in which we're integrating the Alameda Point Collaborative, I call them homeless collaborative into the mix of things. So what I would want to see in talking with two people is how do you flesh that out?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'How, you know, a what is your experience in working in this kind of, you know, this kind of of a vision and B, you know, what kind of projects had did you have that move? You know, people on to, you know, gainful employment, career pathways, etc. because and then see, you know, what do you envision doing with'",
        "'speaker_5': 'regard to bringing to life the whole desire to better integrate the Alameda Point Collaborative and their different nonprofit partners in the Reshape program? That's what I mean. I mean, I think on paper, you know, we all see this as a, you know, geographically reshaped project here.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You got you a west with me here. But at the end of the day, we don't want people just walking by each other. You know, we want maybe the the incubator space has dedicated space for for people who are, you know, trying to, you know, achieve economic security.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's that level of thinking that I want to see.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So Councilmember Rody.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I guess to the vice mayor's point, I would like to see a little bit more financial data. I know we're not going to get pro forma based on fees and you know how much you're going to sell each unit for.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But kind of compare what, you know, what each team is looking for as far as the finances. And you know what the bottom line is going to be for the entire project. I do think it's important, as the Councilmember Vela mentioned, about delays.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But, you know, every developer has delays. So, I mean, maybe I mean, I don't want to prejudice what anyone's thinking or prejudge, but, you know, maybe people are thinking in their heads. Well, we've had delays with the two developers we know.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So let's try somebody we don't know because we never had delays with them. Well, I'm sure they have delays in their projects as well. So it would be interesting to know that I understand the desire for diversity out there, but I don't think we should exclude or punish someone and not give them an opportunity to provide more'",
        "'speaker_8': 'information just because they have done something out there. And, you know, I will say for a catalyst Bay Port, very successful like Melia said, you know, they get things done site A and a we may complain or have some feelings about how long it took, but, you know, that was a 25 year, you know, project.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I mean, this was not something that this would have been done. This was easy, would have been done already. So I think we have to recognize the complexity of city and appreciate the work that the developer has done to get it to this point because no one else was able to do that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So it may have taken longer than we wanted. It may have cost more than we wanted. We may have had done more DDA amendments than we wanted. But, you know, we have shovels in the ground and we have infrastructure getting put in the ground.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I would like to see, you know, some more if there if there's some ways that these developers think they can mitigate the issue of not having diverse developers and putting all our eggs in one basket, I'd like to see that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But, you know, on the flip side, those that haven't been out there and done anything, I'd like to see, you know, what they think it's going to take to get them up to speed. On what it takes to develop at Alameda Point.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Because from the two people that I've heard from that have done it, it's not an easy thing. And we do have some idiosyncrasies that I think need to be paid attention to. And that my last thing was should that I lost my train of thought on the last thing.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well, give me a minute to come back to me. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Speaking of speaking of minutes council, we have this rule that the previous council imposed where we all have 9 minutes of speaking time. Some of us are getting kind of close to that limit. But with a vote of four council members, we could vote to suspend that rule.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But bearing in mind we do have a cast of thousands, I think, waiting in the wings. But just so we for housekeeping reasons, shall we suspend that rule? Anybody want to make a move? So. Mr.. DE So just so you know, you have a minute and 50 seconds left.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I actually remember what I was going to say. So I'll.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Say that if you want to use up some, you do.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Then. I mean, I think we also have to look at the cohesiveness. I mean, one of the downside risks of being the master developer ourselves is that we risk, you know, having patchwork and it doesn't look like the entire base is one community and one Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And, you know, I'd like to I'd like to see how we make sure that happens.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Um, yeah. Uh, Vice Mayor Knox White. Do you have any opinion you want to share?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I mean.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It all is. It sounds like people want to come back. I guess. I guess the question is, do we want four to. I've heard right in terms of a process.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I would urge counsel, maybe we can discuss it, maybe even developer by developer. It is not easy discussing you all in front of you because we don't play favorites. We love all of our children equally, but not to your children.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But you know the concept. So I but I also think we owe it to these folks who have spent so much time and effort and the people out at the reshape neighborhood to not kick this can down the road.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But Mr.. Are, you know best thinking to at least narrow it down to two. I do not think we need to come back with all four again. But I'm that's my humble opinion.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Yeah, I concur.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So if may I stay with you for a moment then, since you made eye contact, Councilmember Vela, if you were to, are you thinking narrowing it down to two or you've got one or what do you think?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I think two is fine, but I would like to articulate specific questions that we're looking at.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We hold that thought. Do you want to start with the two you have in mind?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Well, I said this earlier. I'd be happy to move forward with Catullus and one of the other new applicants. It's worth exploring what their proposals are and what they're looking to do. I do think that this isn't the last piece of Alameda point or anything else that's going to be developed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Good point.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I do want to make sure I do want to make sure that none of our applicants are discouraged from this process and thinking that they won't come back. Because I do want to make sure that they all understand that they are important partners.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I think there's going to be other opportunities.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Okay. And we'll come back to the questions part. So anybody else want to throw out their if? Okay. First of all, you're holding up two fingers. No, no.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm trying to make I kind of did. Did staff want to make their comment that they suspended when the mayor needed to speak or not?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Certainly.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I'll just preface it. I mean, if I was to have to narrow, I would probably want to pick one from the existing and one from the new. But that's just.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So from my from staff's perspective, it's really at the council's pleasure. You have a process that you're setting in motion and or at least is under discussion right now. You have a series of follow up questions that you want to to have us work on.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so, I mean, we're happy to, but I also don't want us staff to interfere with the process that counsel is currently discussing. So I would really defer to the counsel on that. But since I'm up here, I have one suggestion that you might want to consider if there are going to be a if it's going to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'be narrowed or not. And there are a series of follow up questions that you, the council, may want to develop. The council may want to think about a committee of the council that would work with staff and work with us to develop and refine those questions and then come back with a recommendation that may help on balancing'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the timeliness with the desire for additional information. So that's I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Like that suggestion. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Miss Potter. Okay. Are you up next? Do you want to do you want to wait? Because I can call in someone else.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yeah, I think I'm here. I'm there. But I'll listen to what someone else wants to say.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I really said mine.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So. So remind me, Councilmember.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You said I'd like to move forward with Catalyst and Alameda point on partners and the specific areas like to flesh out or kind of honing the kind of what I call the socioeconomic development.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We'll get into the further questions. And I like Miss Potter's idea of the subcommittee. Yeah. The vice mayor knocks. Right.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Assuming they were going to move forward with two. I mean, just because I can be open, I probably can be open to changing at least one of these I want to call it, you know. From the cartels presentation.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'They know the dirt that really grabbed me. And if anything, from from from that team, I think they have shown that they know how to get things done and and and have once, once, once, once they got the, the an alignment between their product mix and and their project that things move forward very quickly.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'You know, on the Army to point partners, I really, I, I just you know, they have team members who have who have shown over and over and over again that they are able to move projects forward and places.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We're very successful. People in town have not. I think if we were going to choose, if we needed to choose to, I think I would probably lean towards engaging our partners due to that. Let's see, Jamestown. I, you know, I, I they're probably the ones I feel the least familiar with.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But I do appreciate what they have done, what they've done at South Shore. And, you know, I appreciate that Remy, who sits on our economic development, strategic. Commission Counsel. I can't remember what it's called right now, but yeah.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yeah. And, and, and, and when she does the, the point of view in terms of how to develop jobs, I think is really important. And while I guess for me between Jamestown and Brookfield, if I if I was going to choose tonight, I would probably choose Jamestown because of their jobs focus.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I feel that I like what Brookfield is bringing in terms of I feel like we would get a slightly smaller project. But I think being led by a residential builder, their presentation was much more focused kind of on that residential side.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And while they talked a little bit about jobs and whatever else, I think that that kind of that commercial development is good. So if we were going to only move forward with to allow me to point partners in Jamestown would be the two that I would choose.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I'm just not still sure what questions I would ask to. Help narrow that down that we don't already have information.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Village, did you want to add something?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Yeah. I mean, I'm not going to. I'll be direct. I think my what gives me the most heartburn with two point partners is the affordable housing aspect of it and the issues that have come up relative to, say, with a couple of the projects that have come through.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I know that that's not necessarily through any fault of their own, but we are going through another round of the cap and trade on the Eden housing portion and with the funding for the Reshape project being a key issue, I do worry about that and where we're going to be spending resources in terms of cobbling those'",
        "'speaker_10': 'funds together. So I do that. That's my concern and what I'm taking into account when I'm looking at those decisions. I think AP has done a great job of finding finding a pathway forward on on a number of different things, and I applaud them for that.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But I am still worried about how we're going to make sure all of the affordable housing gets built that we've we've got planned.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And and I will say that I very much concur with the vice mayor. I'm the former vice mayor. Councilman Rivera on that. On the other hand, I've been around long enough to remember a project that we all hoped would come to fruition called Clif Bar, and it didn't.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that was when Catullus was at the helm. And they found that the the condition of the underlying wharfs was just such that they didn't feel it was economically feasible. But you I mean, if you know anything about the history of development here in other places, you have to be flexible.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You have to be able to adapt to changing circumstances. And I think the best thing to do is to put a good team in place. I could go with Catullus in Jamestown if I think it's kind of intriguing to go with a known quantity, if you will, in a not so known.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Although I would encourage people to read up on Jamestown in the materials in our staff report.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Councilmember Ody Okay. I guess it's time to make a decision. I thought I would throw a monkey wrench in until I heard the vice mayor. I still think there's some value in the experience that Alameda Point Partners brings for the work they've done on.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And you know, that missed application and cap and trade, that was not them. I mean, that was one of the affordable housing providers. So, you know, they would be they would probably make my short list from the the two groups that have been working out there.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And, you know, Jamestown has worked in Alameda. I mean, that people that would tip the scale for me that, you know, we partner with them. They are in our community already. And, you know, Cyprus is actually developing, which is block nine in block 11.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I mean, they do have some experience out there. Their partners have experience actually in this land, in this soil. So, I mean, those are the two I would go to if I had to narrow it down, you know, one on one that I'd like to hear more on the risk mitigation and then one that's on the'",
        "'speaker_8': 'new side.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The two were.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Jamestown and AP.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Jamestown people.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'When I used eight and a half minutes to get there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that's okay. Okay. I'm doing a little tally here. I think I see James Tan on. When? Everyone but councilmember councilmember decide. Okay, so could we agree that on our short list will be Jamestown? Speak out loud, people.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's so hard to picture. Okay. Okay. So okay, then let's figure out. Okay. Do we? Someone do the math, dude? We were three and two.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I read us AP two. Good. Tell us. Well, three could.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Tell us.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Because you put both on there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Okay. So, Councilmember Vela, are you at it for the second one or you could tell us. Yes. Could tell us. Vice mayor.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Partner.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'How many partners are correct? Um, one. Okay. Councilmember Councilmember.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I was EVP and could.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You get one vote, my dear? Oh, we've already. We've filled the one slots. Okay. Yeah. Council member, Odie.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'AP.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'AP.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah, I'm ready. I'll go with AP.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. I will say we have three for AP and I could go with either. So we I think that we have reached the decision that we will have two development teams to answer for the questions that we will ask staff to pose to them who would like to be on the subcommittee to to formulate questions.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Me and.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You. How about. Well, how about I'm hearing Councilmember de SAC. You said a number of times you'd like to have some more information. Would you work with Councilmember O'Day? Sure. To work with the subcommittee. Okay. Miss Potter, there's your son.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is that okay? I agree with that. We don't need a motion. Okay, so have we. Have we fulfilled our obligation to give and receive the presentations? Give direction? Is this good? Okay. And again, a heartfelt thank you to everybody who participated.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You are all winners. No, we're we're so happy to have your interest in our community. And as Councilmember Vela said, don't go far because we've got more work to do out at that former naval air station. So I am going to conclude this special meeting, but I'm also going to give our council I hate to start a'",
        "'speaker_0': 'meeting late. I apologize to everyone in the next item. We'll talk twice as fast. But we we've been up here sort of since five. We need a little break. So the meeting is adjourned. Thank you. Everyone will be back in 10 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_0': '740. I'm starting. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If everybody could find us. See, we've kind of changed the cast. And a first, I want to just start and say my apologies for everyone who here for the regular meeting that was supposed to start at seven. We had a meeting that started at five, but we are picking a development team for the next phase added Alameda'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Point and it just went a little later. So my apologies. But with that it is now. Well, it's even 739. I said we'd start at 740, but we're starting because we've kept you here this long. So I would like to call the special joint meeting of the City Council and the successor agency to the Community Improvement Commission'",

        "'speaker_5': 'It's mainly a concern because what I recall when I was on my last go around on city council and I believe we dealt with this in the year 2014 and at that time it was mainly funded fully by the county and.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'While I wasn't completely convinced that this was at the core of what the fire service does, largely because the nature of the program and I understand, you know, staff has might have will have some differences from this characterization.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But to me, the nature of the program seemed almost research in nature and that the point was to gather information in an effort to improve health systems delivery. And I'm just not sure that that's a core mission of of of this part of the fire fire department.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So so that's why I was willing to go with it in 2014, because it was funded by the county. But now we're at a point where the council will have, as be requested, to provide some stopgap general fund dollars to the tune of roughly $280,000 or so.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'evening. The additional third would have came from the Alameda Hospital system. Unfortunately, during all this time, the leadership of the Alameda Hospital locally has changed dramatically, where almost every key person there is brand new. So we're back into an educational mode with that new staff.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I'm confident we'll be coming back to you shortly with an agreement from the hospital system, because ultimately the county, as you know, has one large fund just divvied up among many departments. So it's just getting that education piece done.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Secondly, this is really a core mission of what the fire department does. When you call 911, the term paramedic means hands of a physician. And it was really when the pandemic program started here in the 1970s, early seventies.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And our interim city manager is one of the first paramedics in Orange County can attest to this, that it was really bringing physician care to someone's home, whether it was a cardiac defibrillator or bringing medications. And we do that every day for our community.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This is taking a highly trained paramedic and putting him and going out to prevent people with chronic health problems from accessing the number one system and causing multiple animals, transports, etc., etc.. We're also focusing on our homeless population because they have no care system.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But we're going to go out and start providing direct care to the homeless and make sure that we can get them to the services that they need. So those are directly at the core mission of what the fire department does.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You are correct on the funding. When you were initially on council, it was 100% funded at the state. We're kind of special in Alameda because this is one of only 11 programs that have existed that were authorized statewide.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we're confident that we're going to come back to you in probably October with not a request for funding, but a request for us to contract with our hospitals such as Kaiser Alameda, because there's going to be health care funding available for community paramedics.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And by having this pilot program in place, we're able to provide that level of service to our community that a whole host of communities would love to do, but weren't chosen to be part of the initial pilot program.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I wish it was funded already. Unfortunately, last year Governor Brown did not sign that legislation, but the same legislation is moving forward and we have all the confidence in the world and the assurance from newly elected Governor Newsom that he will sign such a bill as it moves forward.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But again, that such time, you know, this is we'll be back to you with a lot of things on this. We'll be back to you with another contract. We'll be back with you with some permanent funding sources outside the general fund.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But we're just asking for that continuance until next February, which we've been doing for the last three years.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And as long as Chief Rodriguez is up here, I will disclose that we actually talked on the phone a couple of times today because I had some questions about the reimbursement, not the nature of this problem project program.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I was on the council when it first came into being, and I'm also a former member of the alma mater, hospital board of directors. And so I understand that this is a great savings for the hospital because there are individuals who, for lack of other medical providers, use the E.R. as their primary care facility and and'",
        "'speaker_0': 'also lack the kind of follow up for chronic conditions that can get worse by being neglected. But for that reason, I feel strongly that the hospital we're saving, helping save them money and and physician in nursing time they should be contributing to this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But Chief Rodriguez is quite confident that there will be reimbursement from the hospital, as they've done in the past, and that money would go to backfill our general fund. Because my other concern. Heroin is is more of a process when we're going into our budget, into our two year budget process soon in the spring.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I really like departments to bring all their asks to us at one time because we're just better able to to look and decide, you know, where what we can find and how much. But on the other hand, this is one that actually expired in November of 2018.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And this program has been kept active just by the fire department finding some additional funds. I did ask that sometime in the not too distant future, we receive a summary, not just, you know, this is the sort of thing they do, but actual some stats.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I mean, this is this program is collecting data for the county and for the state to see if these programs make sense statewide. So I would like to see and be able to share with the public what kinds of calls have you going on, how many and what period of time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then the chief assured me that he's able to do to provide that his department. So any other questions or comments or do we have a motion? Just a.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Quick comment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Odie.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I want to thank the chief for this, bringing this forward in this program. You know, I remember when it was like two chiefs ago. I think we decided to be part of this. And I think we were the only ones doing one of the things, the things we're doing with this.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I think it's really benefited our community, especially our unsheltered residents, that this is their first point of contact. And I'm sad to see that, you know, we're cutting it from 3 to 2. But as you said, you know, the system as a whole benefits not just the hospital.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I mean, the hospital benefits. And it was an ACA type of savings. And that was kind of the impetus around it. And I think we were all disappointed that the governor vetoed the bill last year because, you know, everyone in Sacramento worked really hard to get it through and get it passed.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I was up there that day and it was like the highlight of my day. That day was when that bill passed. So I appreciate everything you're doing. And, you know, this is just a temporary stopgap until we have, you know, what I hope will be a statewide permanent program, because you guys are really doing a great job'",
        "'speaker_8': 'with everything you're doing. And I know that you update the liaison committee for the hospital every almost every meeting on the stats and the calls and the successes of this program. So kudos to you and your team that are working on this.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think it's an amazing service and I'm going to move approval of the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Item on a motion to have a second.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Second.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So all in favor. This is an authorization to the interim city manager to negotiate and execute a Third Amendment to the agreement with the county of Alameda, extending the term of the community medicine premise and pilot program with the additional funding, as noted.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All in favor.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I opposed of the one opposed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So the motion passes four in favor and one opposed.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mayor. Legal Counsel.'"

(Community Development 209)": [
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Rodriguez. All right. And now we're moving on to our regular agenda, and we have only one item, but it's a big one. So this is the the review of the 172 room hotel development located at 2900 Harbor Bay Parkway within the Harbor Bay Business Park.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'STAFF Is Mr. Thomas, are you are you going to address this first? All right.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You are.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Your act. Yes. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Oh.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'My God.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Actually, we've got to fix think.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Are we having a moment? Okay.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We're having a moment. There we go.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Click it.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Thank you. The panic was just starting to set.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'The evening, Mayor. Marilyn as he Ashcraft and vice mayor knox white and members of the council. Good evening. My name's Sandra Thomas. I'm your planning director. I will be presenting the staff recommendation tonight. And what I recommend that we do, since you have a lot of speakers, is I recommend that I move through my nine slides relatively'",
        "'speaker_12': 'quickly. I'm just going to give a sort of a quick overview of the situation and the staff recommendation. I myself, the city attorney's office, a number of other staff people are here to help me answer questions if and when the Council has any.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'The project applicant would like a couple of minutes to speak on behalf of his project, and then you have to appellants tonight. So I recommend that you give the applicant, I think three or 4 minutes is going to be more than enough for him and then 5 minutes for each of the appellants.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'But obviously, it's your meeting that's just a staff sort of suggestion on how to proceed. Once the then let everyone else speak who's come here to speak tonight, then you can close the public hearing. I know you know, this is for the benefit of everyone here who this is tonight, then that's your time to has a council'",
        "'speaker_12': 'to deliberate on your decision tonight. And your decision tonight is a decision as to is to answer a question. And the question is, did your planning board make a mistake when they unanimously approved this project two months ago?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And I will describe the the process under which they underwent to make their decision. But that is the question that you will need to deliberate at the end of the hearing tonight after you've heard from everyone else. The appellants, there's two of them essentially are making two basic arguments.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'They are saying that your planning board and the city made a mistake on the environmental review of this project, that the environmental review was inadequate under the California Environmental Quality Act. So that's sort of concern, number one, from the appellants.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And the second concern that is essentially, and I'm summarizing is that the project is just too big and doesn't meet our development standards for this site. It's probably no surprise, as the staff are recommending, that you uphold the planning board because we believe they actually did their job correctly and followed all the state and local rules and'",
        "'speaker_12': 'regulations. Just a little history on this. And I won't go through all this these words, but. The Planning Board in the city. We we do need to follow rules when we review development applications. We cannot and your planning board cannot make up those rules as they go along.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So what your planning board did is they followed the existing rules that were in place for the review of these types of projects. And there's two big sort of agreements that really everybody should understand. And that is, first of all, there is an agreement between the city and the property owners of Harbor Bay.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Harbor Bay, as probably everybody knows, was designed as one large master plan community. The business park shown on the lower right of the slide here is was, as you can see in the top. Slide it. This is manmade land.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'This is land that was made. For the purpose of developing it. And this was a approach. The development agreements were many originally approved in 1974. There were all sorts of disputes that were playing out. And eventually the city and that developed meant that the property owners entered into what's called the development agreement.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'This is a basically a contract, and it lays out the rules, the rules and obligations for both the developer and for the city, for this master plan community. And in this 100 page document, I'm going to summarize it in two bullet points.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'It basically says, look, the city is going to get a 22 acre shoreline park that surrounds the entire project. We're going to get a firehouse. We're going to get a school site. We're going to get a ferry terminal.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We're going to get all the roads necessary to support this place. And the developer is going to build all of them and they are going to build it right on day one, just at the beginning of the project.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And in return, the city is going to allow the land owners to develop 3000 housing units, which they did, and up to 5.2 million square feet of commercial development in the business park. And that's the basic deal, and that's the basic deal that has been followed for the last 30 years.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And in the review, the developer agreement talks about in the review of this of new development will be done in consistent with the existing zoning and development standards, which are all documented in the development agreement. So we can't vary from those standards when we review these developments as they come forward.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'There was also a second agreement that really governs how this how Harbor Bay has developed over the years. Late seventies, the city of Alameda is proposing to fill the bay for Harbor Bay development as we know it today.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'A new agency is created in the state of California called the Bay Conservation Development Commission. It's almost happening simultaneously. Of course, this new agency gets created for the San Francisco Bay and says, Well, you're filling the bay, so we're going to have a permitting authority over every single building you built.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Of course, that immediately sets up another lawsuit, and what is called legal settlement agreement is enacted between Bccdc and the property owners. And it basically says, well, since the purpose of Bccdc is to. Ensure maximum feasible public access to the shoreline.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'That agreement says while you build a 22 acre shoreline park all the way around the perimeter of this development, and we will call that maximum feasible public access for the entire development. That's essentially what the settlement agreement says.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And therefore, every project that you can build doesn't need to come for a separate permit to determine whether maximum feasible public access is being provided with that individual project. Because we've agreed that it is the 22 acre Shoreline Park, which the developer will build on day one, which they did.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And that agreement has has governed how the city and bccdc process all development at harbor Bay residential and commercial. Of course, those agreements are designed to keep us all out of trouble and avoid further lawsuits. And they've worked pretty well.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'But there has been some problem sites this I would call this one of them not maybe not a problem separate difficult site. It's it's zoned for commercial manufacturing and it's part of the business park, but it's immediately adjacent to the park.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'It's immediately adjacent to some to the neighborhood and it's immediately adjacent to the ferry terminal. So it's been a little difficult over the years, a little controversial. We originally approved an office development with ten two storey office buildings and 26 on this site.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'That project was approved by the planning board and then appealed. The Council upheld the Planning Board's decision to develop the site, but it was just before the recession and as a result, only two of the ten buildings were built.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Stacy went back and Maguire and Hester, the two office buildings you see out there today, 2014, there was a proposal to do assisted living on this site. It was also approved. It was then appealed by the neighborhood. That appeal was not upheld at the time, but the project applicants were proposing to come back with a revised application'",
        "'speaker_12': '. And then for reasons that had nothing to do with the city, they dropped that application. We now have a hotel proposal that has been approved by the planning board and is being appealed by the neighborhood and the other appellant the labor union, three or four.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I think once again there's this issue of sort of following the rules. I'm sure there's many people tonight who will argue that this should be a park. It can't. It's never been planned for a park. If we want to take private land for a public purpose like a park, we do have to buy it.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'The planning board and the city cannot use your regulatory process, your planning and zoning process to essentially create open space by denying projects. So let's just get to the major issues before you did your planning board make a mistake when they reviewed the adequacy of the environmental analysis?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I think the appellant and staff and everybody playing board all agree, yes, this project requires an air. That's not the question before us. We all know we did in the air. The question is, and what the applicant is saying is that the Planning Board should have required us know an additional EMR for the development of this site'",
        "'speaker_12': '. A little background on this. The city did in the air in 1974 for the original development plan. Then in 1989, when they did the draft, when we did the development agreement, there was a major overhaul of that air to address the development agreement and the plan development of the business park, which was then documented one year later'",
        "'speaker_12': 'in the general plan as well. So two year, 1989, 1990, all supporting and evaluating the environmental impacts of 5.2 million square feet of commercial development in the business park, 17,300 employees in the business park and ten excuse me, 100 foot buildings in the business park.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Just for reference, and this is important today, we have about 2.75 million square feet built in the business park, and we have a somewhere between five and 6000 employees in the business park. So we haven't come close to hitting what we had projected in the prior year.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'The California Environmental Quality Act says you will not require property owners to do a second air. Unless there's evidence that there is the potential for new environmental impacts that were not covered in those original areas. And that's the process the city went through to look at.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Well, are there any new impacts that might be result from this project that we didn't anticipate that when we did the prior year and those prior year in 1989 and 1990, assumed the 5.2 million square feet and the 17,000 employees.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So we do look at those issues and we look at with every single project the council knows the planning board is very familiar with this. What people may not understand is every single staff report we do an environmental analysis and we look at this.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So these issues were talked about. And so really the question and we do this with every witness is now the third project on this site in the last ten years that we've evaluated. And so obviously the first question that always comes up, you know, what about traffic?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'There must be traffic impacts from developing this vacant land. And every traffic study we've done in the three in the last ten years for this site specifically. Looks at this. And remember, the question is not, oh, are there going to be impacts from developing a vacant site?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Of course there's going to be more cars. It's a vacant site. So yes, there will be more cars, but that's not the question under the California Environmental Quality Act. The question is, were those cars not anticipated when you did your air before?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And would this generate additional cars or more cars or more traffic than you originally anticipated in your prior air? If it does, then you need to do an update or a new air. But if you're already analyzed it, then you don't and you shall not require a new way.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'As I said, you know, the traffic analysis and that's been the same for all three of them for the last three years, first for the office project and for the assisted living project, and now for the hotel project.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'The conclusion is from our traffic consultants who reanalyzed this in 2018. No, there is no evidence that there is going to be additional traffic generated by this project that is up and beyond what the prior air projected. Because remember the prior year a projected of traffic from 5.2 million square feet and 17,000 employees.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'You only have about 6000 employees out there today, so we're not even close. Of course, hotels generate less daily trips than office and R&D development, which is what was projected in those prior year. So if you just compare, well, the prior year assumed a certain amount of deployment on that site and it was at that type of'",
        "'speaker_12': 'development. The hotel does even less than that. It generates less peak hour trips even in the 2006 office project and is providing shuttle services. So when you look at all the record that the planning board looked at, they were absolutely right.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'There is no evidence that a new EMR is needed for traffic. Next question that we look at all the time, because this could change over 20 years between the last year and this year is the biological impacts. You know, maybe there were no endangered species on the site in 1989, but there are today that could happen that'",
        "'speaker_12': 'could generate new impacts we don't know about. So every project we send out, biologists, trained biologists, not only by the city, independent biologists. And they walk this site. They did it in 2006. They did it again in 2014, not 2016.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And then they did it again in 2018 to look for endangered species or any kinds of. Potential biological impacts and every single time they come back with the same conclusion. No, you do not have any endangered species. And once again, people it's this issue of are there any impacts that you didn't forecast?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I've I've been told. But the rabbits have moved out there. That's true. And the rabbits are super cute. We do love the rabbits, but they are not an endangered species. And that is not a new environmental impact under the California Environmental Quality Act.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We also I think the appellants weren't fully aware of the fact that we have a bird safe window ordinance and there are conditions of approval on the project. So they the bird strike concern is is not evidence for the need for an air obviously construction materials.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We put a lot about that in our staff report. This is all governed by state and federal regulations EPA, OSHA, CARB and a number of facilities so that the use of certain types of construction materials is not a new environmental impact requiring any air.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And of course, as you know from the packet, we have review and sign off from the Airport Land Use Commission, the Oakland Airport. These are not new impacts. There is no new impact. And of course, noise is also not a new environmental impact from the cause of building this hotel.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So on this CEQA findings, we are recommending that you uphold your planning board. They they interpreted and implemented sequel correctly, and there is no evidence of any new impacts or more severe impacts that would cause them what you already projected.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Next issue that's been raised in the appeals is it's just too big. The project is too big. What they approved is too massive for the site. Well, we have zoning regulations which establish what you can do on the site.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So that's how we measure whether it's too massive or not. If it complies with the regulations and it's not too massive, if it exceeds the regulations and it is too massive. The main restriction on this site is what's called the floor area ratio.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'It's 0.5, which is relatively low for an urban area, but not uncommon in a business park. When you translate, it's a relationship of how much floor area you can have in relation to the amount of land you have.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'In this case, when you do the maps, the project's about 119,900 square feet in floor area. That's the maximum amount of floor area you can build on this site. The Westmont Project a few years ago, same basic size floor area.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And this project meets that floor area. The other issue that has come up a lot is, oh, it's the buildings too high. Well, the building is 63 feet to the top of the parapet. The height limit is 100 feet.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'That is documented very clearly in the development agreement that I talked about in the CMS zoning, which is what this site is zoned, as well as our 1990 general plan, which made it very clear that high rise is a, quote, high rise buildings, 100 feet as of right.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'That means by right and up to 156 feet, subject to discretionary review, can be built at the business park. So the planning board was absolutely correct when they determined that the that the projects not too massive for the site.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'It complies with those regulations. Setbacks, same situation. There's a setback requirement all included in the development agreement and in the zoning for this site. It's for this type of restaurant retail, commercial, recreational use, which is what a hotel falls into.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'It's 25 feet from the edge of the park. This building a setback, 35 feet from the edge of the park. If you want to if you if you measure all the way to the water's edge, it's 75 feet.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So it meets the setbacks. It also meets the parking requirements, the parking requirement for this project with the restaurant and cafe that's also being added next to the ferry terminal, which is we think is going to be a great asset for the business park.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'It's something that the business park has been looking for for a very long time, which is another restaurant, waterfront restaurant. This they are providing two hour and 75 vehicle parking spaces to meet the zoning requirement. The parking demand study basically said that's way too many.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'You will never need 275 parking spaces for this hotel. So what the planning board did is put a condition of approval on the project, that they have to provide the vacant spaces to ferry parkers or ferry riders who can then park there during the day.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'They're required to advertise it with signs and provide a mobile app so that people can check their phones and see if there's parking available at the hotel when they're heading down to the ferry. There's accusations the city and the planning board didn't do the public noticing, right?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We did. We worked consistent with all state and city requirements for public notification for all the hearings we had. That's includes newspaper ads, postings and letters to all property owners within 300 feet. And that's all been documented for the record.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Finally, the planning board did approve it with some conditions. I think we all agree that if we're going to do a hotel here next to our ferry terminal as sort of a gateway into Harbor Bay, it's got to be awfully nice looking.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'The planning board said this is.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Not and.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm going to just interrupt Mr. Thomas for a minute and ask that the audience be respectful to all of our speakers. And the reason for that is Mr. Thomas is a veteran. He's used to this. We will we may have some people here today who are speaking in public for the first time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It is very intimidating for them to have people laugh or cheer or jeer. So I'm just asking what I like to say is make the podium a safe place where anyone feels welcome to get up because I want all of your input and you will have a chance.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But please do your best to be respectful to the speakers. Thank you. Go ahead, Mr. Thomas.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And the person who was laughing at that last statement, I think we all agree with her. We didn't think that this was a good enough architectural design. The planning board said this is not good enough. We you meet our height limits, you meet our size limitations.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'But from an architectural standpoint, we're not happy. So they did not approve this architectural design. And they said, before you pull building permits, you need to come back to us with the final elevations, because these aren't good enough for this pride, for this site, which is such a visible site.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'They also want to see that public art plan. They suggest using public art to really make this a signature building. And then, of course, the other thing that they said was we want to see revisions to the landscaping lighting plan and we want you to do that with the surrounding neighborhood, because we think a lot of the'",
        "'speaker_12': 'issues in terms of creating a good neighbor, particularly with the residential on the back side, can be addressed through smart landscaping and lighting design. So with that, I'll wrap up. Staff is recommending that you uphold your planning board's unanimous decision on this project.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'The environmental analysis is adequate. The project is consistent with standards and agreements that have been put in place to avoid problems and misinterpretations. And there is no evidence that the planning board erred in its unanimous decision to conditionally approve this project.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So that I'll wrap up my comments. I'm available to answer any questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Thomas. Does anyone have any clarifying questions they want to ask Mr. Thomas? If not, not from the audience. This is a lively group. Okay. What we are going to do now is I believe the sequence is we will hear from the applicant and then we will hear from our two appellants, and then we will'",
        "'speaker_0': 'take public comment. And we have speakers subsidiary. I'm just guessing a.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Very large stack.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Information.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. So. Oh, I'm sorry. One minute, Councilmember.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Point of information. Do we have, like, a time limit on either the or any of these?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, I so I heard and and Mr. Leach, this is the applicant. Mr. Leach, Mr. Thomas kind of spoke on your behalf and said, you want 3 minutes to speak. Do you feel that's adequate due to it? Well, you can have three.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then he indicated that the appellants could each have 5 minutes. I will check with the appellants and I will just say whatever one gets, the other gets. I'm a mother of twins. That's the way we do it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So anyway, so with that, any further clarifying questions? Okay. Thank you, Mr. Leach. Come on up and be sure to speak into the microphone.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'My name's Robert Leach. I'm the lead developer for the project. I wanted to basically, I think I'm sure most of you probably know by now that I grew up in town. I was born and raised here. I grew up in town, went to high school, elementary school here.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The only reason that that's important is because it gives me a historical perspective about what's been in the city for the last 50 years in terms of commercial development and hotels. And, you know, we set out a year ago really looking at this project and saying, hey, how could we build the nicest hotel in Alameda?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that really has been our goal. And we basically, you know, looked at the site and felt that it had so many great potential to it because of the the location, the waterfront, the ferry terminal next door. It makes it really an excellent hotel site.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's 5 minutes from the terminals at the airport. We noticed that I've always known, even when I was a policeman out here, that we didn't have really many good restaurants out of Harbor Bay. And so we wanted to make sure that we added a nice restaurant and.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And it's funny that we have a pizza transportation center, a nearby, but no coffee stores nearby. So we wanted to add coffee station as well. And pizza is one of the groups that we're talking to. Great restaurant, great hotel.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I can tell you that what we've designed and and I would agree with Mr. Thomas that there's things we can do to try to enhance the exterior. But the shape and size was built deliberately on the idea that we wanted to maintain an open view for the residents.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And if you look at the site plan in the photographs, you see half of the site is open. And that open creates a great corridor for for everyone to look out towards the water. If we lower the building down, all it would have done is made the building wider and block more of the view.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'As we started this journey, we met with staff. We've had three community meetings. A lot of folks are here today, and I think that we listened as much as we could. In fact, we made 37 changes to the project based on input from the community and from the staff trying to address everybody's concerns.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'One of the things I wanted to do after, you know, I read Miami to newspapers quite often and saw some of the controversy on on another hotel site out there. And so our goal was not to come in and ask for variances or can we have a favor or do this or that?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We basically said, let's take a look at what the rules are. Let's make sure the reapply to it. We do everything for the rules 100%. Don't ask for variances. It's I know it's controversial. I know that there's a lot of people that would prefer it's open space and not to have any commercial development at that part of'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the business park. So we did everything we could to comply. We think that we have a really nice project, far and away, and I've been building hotels for 30 years. I can tell you this would be the nicest hotel ever built in Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And and it's a top of the line product. You know, it's a marriott hotel, the largest hotel company in the world. But the owners of the hotel or a family owned business, they're not a big, giant corporation. They're a small family.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And they've done everything they can to comply with the regulations that are in. Appreciate your review tonight and hope that we can have your support. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Leach. Okay. I know we have to appellant's staff. Can you help me out with who's going to go first?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Either one.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, listen. Come on up and introduce yourself. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'All right. Okay. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Speaker three Go.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening, Mayor. Members of the council. My name is Mike lOSO. I'm here for the appellant Laborers International Union of North America Local 304. Our concern is about the seeker compliance with this particular project. And I'm going to break it down into three general categories.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The first is we don't think. I don't think anyone who reads the 1974 EIA can think that that air addresses this hotel project. There's nothing in there that talks about a hotel project. There's nothing remotely related to a hotel project.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It hardly even resembles it doesn't resemble the current business park. It was just a conceptual notion. It was a zoning decision to make it commercial, a concept floated about a business park much smaller than what exists today. And there's nothing in there to help you with any informational value about whether this proposed hotel is going to have'",
        "'speaker_4': 'any significant impacts or indeed relevant to whether this hotel has any significant impacts. The city prepared a report from Environmental Science Associates attempting to rebut the points that we made. First, there's a I think Mr. Thomas did this as well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And they try to add on all of these addendum addenda that have come since the 1974. Yeah, those don't count in terms of looking at whether this project requires in the air. You can only look to the 74.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah. You don't get to look at addenda that weren't subject to any kind of hearing or comment process under seek what they might have come up before the board, the design board or to develop the planning board. I mean, but they weren't subject to under a sequel to any kind of hearings.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Second, if you look through that 74, yeah, again, there's just nothing in there about a hotel project and there's really nothing in there even about the office park. So it's only the conceptual idea. It was limited in size and and certainly nothing about a proposed hotel.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So the first problem with it was going back that far, 44 years is that simply doesn't help you with any relevant information to evaluate this project. I suspect no one's looked at that 74 year to evaluate whether this hotel is going to have impacts on bird strikes or GHG emissions, certainly which weren't addressed that back then, of'",
        "'speaker_4': 'course, or for that matter, the issues that we've raised about indoor air pollution, formaldehyde emissions. So the second category, and this is the the Environmental Science Report notes that this was a programmatic air and therefore we agree it was a programmatic PR, it was a step back, didn't even have any details about a business park.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that leads to a tearing analysis under Sequoia. And in terms of tearing, it's a fair argument standard. We've shown that there are issues with bird strikes, as the city acknowledges with its most recent. Was that as a concern?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We had an expert and I think Mr. Thomas makes light of the fact of the quality of the experts that we had. Look at this. Dr. Smallwood looked at the city's ordinance. He's still concerned. He doesn't think there's enough there's any evidence, really, of whether the glazing that's required is going to actually work?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'He hopes it does. But still, there's still a possibility that birds are going to keep running into that building for the formaldehyde issues. We had one of the preeminent experts on that issue look at the project and he calculates a cancer risk of 18 and a million for the workers in the building from formaldehyde emissions into the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'air. And the fact that there's some requirements from the Air Resources Board, he assumed compliance with those when he did his analysis and just looking to other agency regs, that's not a sufficient analysis. We can't just simply point to some requirements and say it's done in terms of GHG emissions.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The report, prepared in response to our appeal actually acknowledges this GHG emissions and comes up with a number that's above the air quality management district's thresholds of significance and then tries to put that back in the bottle by claiming taking credit for emissions from a project that wasn't built and that's just not allowed.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And to see if we have to look at reality, which is 1500 metric tons of GHG from this project. The third category is that even assuming this was covered in the 1974 air, there's no substantial information or significant information that requires major revisions that because it doesn't cover any of the things we're talking about.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The same with those three issues GHG birds and GHG and formaldehyde emissions. None of that, of course, was covered or even known about back then. You have to look at those afresh in order to make that EIA work.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And there have been major revisions out there, obviously, for the overall. We have an office park that's much larger than anything that was even conceptually noticed in 1974. And also, in addition, the circumstances have changed quite a bit.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we go through this in detail in our letters. I don't think the planning board got into the details like this. They thought they were barred from doing anything or square by the development agreement, which says that nothing's going to happen under Sequoia again.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I don't think they actually consider this the evidence that they were present.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Raza. And our next appellant is. If you can introduce yourself, please.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I was just wondering if my PowerPoint presentation could be put up before my time starts.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Oh, sure.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And if you tell us your name, I won't count it against your time.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'What's your name?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'My name is Brian, shrimper with. And I'm the president of the Freeport Homeowners Association. Um. It's the one that looks like this. It looks like. Yeah, the colors are different. Sorry. Yes, that's it. Exactly. Just do I have.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm sorry. Also need a little help on the technology. Just the arrow. Just perfect if your head is there. Okay, so as an appellant, we're asking for several things. One, to rescind the decision of the planning board and if not, place the project on hold until a decision from the BCD on the full permit process is taken'",
        "'speaker_4': '. We think we have a good chance there. We're getting good reports back and that you should return it to the planning board to address critical project deficiencies and conduct an authentic community based design process. I'm just going to leave that up.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'These are the points that I'm going through. It's in your pamphlet. Does this blend into the shoreline? We believe it does not went into the shoreline. It's a massive right next to the commercial development. As you'll see, the original project is on the top.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The project now is on the bottom. And what a big difference that it has. You know, your setback is a minimum setback. Doesn't mean you can't put it further back. So why are we going with minimums? I don't understand that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Nothing in there says a hotel. It has a restaurant. I've never seen a five story restaurant. As we can see in this, it says restaurants, retail, commercial entertainment. Sorry about this. We don't think it's compatible with your zoning organ.'",
        "'speaker_4': '30 Dash 37.5 which says that it must be compatible with adjacent or neighborhood buildings and surroundings. It's not even compatible with the commercial, so it's much less the homes that are right there that you're supposed to promote harmony, harmonious transition in scale and character between different designated land uses.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We believe it doesn't do it and visually compatible with the surrounding development. And it's not it's not even visually compatible with the commercial area. Your other zoning 30 Dash 5.2 talking about minimum looks at public safety, health and general welfare haven't been done.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Your project design the resolution 1203 dated in December of 1981, where prominent buildings should be placed on the Harbor Bay Parkway spine and not on this little outlet that's there. Protection of hills to bay, continuity. When we're walking on our wonderful park, we're going to have a massive over pressing wall of a building between us and the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'hills. And it's going to stop. The enjoyment of our park designed should be minimize or mitigate architectural bulk. It does not do that. It's entirely out of scale with everything else. I think we've already talked about the environmental concerns, but it's in your packet.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I don't think climate change was even envisioned when that E.R. was done. We've just spent a lot of money on that. And yet we're going to say, oh, does it matter in this area? Inadequate traffic study. They keep talking about traffic study.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, a traffic study is all done in the commercial area. None is done in the community. How do they know that it's not going to impact the community? They haven't studied it. They haven't looked at it. And I think that that's a very important part.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They need to look at that very critically and very in-depth. There's other landscape issues that somebody else will be planned. Pay various creating hit. We're creating free parking when city policy is to encourage transportation by bicycle and ride share.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'What's going to happen is you're going to have people who used to ride there say, man, I could take 15, 20 more minutes in the morning and snooze that alarm one more time and park there instead of taking my bike or rideshare or something of that nature.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's what's going to happen. There was strong opposition from residents in the public in planning board meetings, Harbor Bay Isle Association Resolution, which represents over 20 homeowners association and 3500 homes, came out against it. We don't believe that most of our concerns are are done.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They haven't talked about design mitigation, how we can, you know, redesign that building to make it look, softening the project BCD commercial only applies to the original developer and not to accessories. And we believe that we have a point there and that we will make that at bccdc.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You should wait until that decision has been made there. Is it really for everybody in perpetuity? Whoever buys that project, 20 people down the line. So again, we're asking you to rescind or place it on hold until the bccdc process can be determined and whether it's going to go home.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I want to thank you for your time and attention.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr.. I know that. Remember how we went over this? No applause, no cheers. New Jersey. And we'll get out of here sooner. So thank you to our two appellants and our applicant. And we now come to our public speaker's slips, which are 33 and I think growing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So when we have normally a speaker, we get 3 minutes over a certain number of speakers, you get 2 minutes, we're over that. So what's council's pleasure on on this Vice Mayor do you have any thoughts Socratic to me?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I decided to take Councilmember Ody off the hook for a moment. Any suggestions on how to proceed? You know, I hear from all of you.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'No, I don't have any. No.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. A council member decides.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I have a question. Desert hall. Maybe this is a legal question. Does it hold water to have speakers speak at 2 minutes? But then if we feel like it's going long, we change it and then and then make it one minute.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Or if we set a time, it doesn't have to be.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I could even answer that. No, no. I remember what I said about mothers of twins. Everyone gets. You know, that wouldn't be fair if the first few speakers got 2 minutes and others got one, so.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'My suggestion would be unless somebody wants to make it, make a suggestion. Is it we give all speakers one minute and one minute, if you're cogent and prepared, is really quite a bit of time. And that's more you know, I'm sure it'll be more than 33 minutes just because it takes time for people to come and go'",
        "'speaker_0': '. But we can we can do something different. We can do 2 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Maybe.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Four, but let's not spend all our time deciding how many minutes and give the time to the speakers instead.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'How where do.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I hear two?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I mean, we can vote on that. And if it doesn't pass, I can propose 90 seconds, but.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh, that's Councilmember Vela.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I was going to say 90 seconds.'",
        "'speaker_0': '90 seconds councilmember or vice mayor, 90 seconds. So we take a vote of 90 seconds all in favor of 90 seconds, say I, I. How many was that for? And Councilmember Desai is No.'",
        "'speaker_7': '3 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, so that's. I'm sorry. Democracy still prevails. So we have a minute and a half. So here we go. Let me call the first three speakers and try to remember to keep doing that. I have first Patricia Gannon, followed by George Humphreys, followed by Chan.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Just one name, Chan. Okay, Miss Gannon.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I believe they were scrapped in city council council members. I'm Patricia again on Bay Farm Island, and I am here to strongly urge the council to either rescind the Planning Board's decision or make them or make it very or to send it back for serious revision.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I do commend the developer for having community meetings. And I was at these two of those, and 90% of the people there were totally opposed to the project. They raised their hands and very few people were in favor of it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I just would like to point point that out that this massive and I'm not opposed to the hotel on Bay Form Island, not on the excuse me, the business park. Surely they can find another location which would not totally destroy that beautiful, pristine piece of piece of land that it so enjoy, but not only to the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'citizens of Alameda, but also all of the animals. As a member, active member of Golden Gate Audubon, former board member, I am concerned about the impact. It's not only the hotels itself, but it's all of those. The traffic, the garbage trucks, the people and all of that is going to have a very negative effect on the peace'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and serenity of the entire neighborhood. And also that agreement that was signed was with HIPAA and not their successor and the Oak. And I thank you. I totally agree with the two. Appellants.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Okay. And Mr. Humphries. And as Mr. Humphries is approaching and after Chen speaks, we will have Ed sing.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Thank you, Mayor Ashcraft.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And the members of the Council. I agree with the the appellant's points that they raised because of the brevity of time here. I won't say why. I am.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Urging that you rescind.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The action of the of the Planning Board. However, I would like to say this if you feel compelled to approve the project that you might consider a what I would call a mitigated project. For example, you could downsize it to 4 to 3 stories from five stories.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You could reduce it from 172 rooms to 100 and use a.'",
        "'speaker_12': '100 foot.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Setback.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Which I think is really.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Required by the table 44 in resolution 1203, the park and parking would also be reduced if you have a 100 room hotel and then you'd have room for a 1 to 2 acre open space, which would allow for a wildlife area or wetland.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And Singh? I'm sorry, Chen.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening, Mayor, and the city council member or everybody who is sitting here actually can listen to the public. So I'm here representing my family. I'm a homeowner in Highbury Island and I'm also architectural designer. So I opposed to this my our residents in proposed 2902 Hopper Bay Parkway.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'First of all, for my understanding, the 2900 Harper Bay Parkway is a commercial manufacture song. So per the Code of Ordinances, 34 point what? 34.10. See, the uses permitted for this parcel doesn't even.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Include a hotel.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Neither the restaurant or the ballroom. So per the zoning ordinance, the Mario residents in is not even allowed for this parcel. That's my first question. And the second of all, there was another hotel proposed actually just one mile away from this site.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And the CDC didn't even permitted scale wise or height or functions very similar. If we compare apples to apples. And what is said is quite simple, that project is too large for the parcel, significantly obstructed views of the bay and a radius access to the shoreline.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's how they didn't get a permit for that hotel. And I run out of time. But I just want to finish because I want to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you so much. Our next speaker is Ed Singh. And after Mr. Singh, we have Emma Khan, followed by Charles Hodgkins. Good evening.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Much. City Council Gong, Haifaa Choi.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Happy New Year to you as well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I want to talk a little bit about the zoning for this particular piece of land at Sea Dash MWP, which the developer and the city staff have repeatedly told us are permits any developer to develop up to 100 feet high and including hotel and you know doesn't matter whose next door to them you know they can build'",
        "'speaker_4': '. Well, what about the rights of the residents behind this hotel? And I just want to re-emphasize something that Brian Trimper said a few minutes ago, that this project does violate the planning board resolution number 1203, which says you must pay design attention to minimize or mitigate architectural balk.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I've been in four meetings on this project and each time I see the architectural rendering, nothing has changed. It's a big rectangular 73 foot high box. So where is our input into this? Regarding the setback, I just want to re-emphasize that under Planning Board Resolution 1203, Table 45, there is no classification for hotels.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If you look at the offices up to 50 feet and 100 feet, the setback from the Bay Edge Park, not the shoreline is 50 to 100 feet.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you so much. Ms.. Ms.. Can. McCann, followed by Charles Hodgkins, followed by Pat Lamborn.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hello. I'm a homeowner. I've lived in Harbor Bay for 15 years. I originally wanted to come and let the city council know how much the small, narrow strip of Bay Trail has meant to my family, my children, and how the project is going to really affect our access to the bay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I still plan to do that at the Bccdc meeting. I think that is more their concern and I just ask that you please can we delay the decision until we have a chance to hear their decision once we present our our position as homeowners and users of the park, how this is going to be a different feel'",
        "'speaker_3': 'than offices with our access, it's going to change the public access and implied private property of a hotel that we don't see with the office buildings. So I just ask that we wait, take it slow, make the right decision.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Of Harbor Bay Owners Association. And we did.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Pass on the exact date we passed at our last board meeting. We passed a resolution opposing this project. We actually sent you a copy of it, so I'm not gonna read the whole thing, but it lists out more or less all that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The reasons have been passed by to you, by the appellants as to why we feel this is a project that is incompatible with our community.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we we do strongly.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Oppose that and stand in.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening. Mayor Ashcroft and council members. I'm Pat Lamborn. I'm a fish with feathers. I'm a unionist and an environmentalist. I'm a 40 year union organizer. I retired. Now I'm in. And I've always been an environmentalist. But yeah, now I count the endangered list.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Turns out at the point and, you know, my husband and I pick up trash, including syringes, and there are still plastic straws. So I'm speaking to you as environmentalist. I would be more polite, but I only have a minute.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Three of you were endorsed by the Sierra Club. Councilmember Vela, Councilmember Knox. Right. And Councilmember Odie, if you approve this project tonight, based on the Environmental Science Associates 31 page memoranda, you are repeating that nothing has changed since 1974.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You have asked our entire community. I've gone to them. I've seen Council member John Knox and Councilmember Tony de Suck at our climate action workshops. Okay. What did they say? We've paid for a whole nother consultant by 2063, 36 inches of sea level rise.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That will wipe out Crown Beach. It will flood shoreline drive and it potentially will wipe out the LC Romer Bird Sanctuary setback. You're talking about setting this building back 35 feet from the only natural shoreline path. There is just no way you can defend that, folks.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Please set it back. He's check the box as a unionist. We've got some union deals here. Let's check the environmental box. Send it back to the planning board. Push the building back further. Look at the design. Do an environmental impact report.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Donna Fletcher. And Dan Reed's after Ms.. Fletcher.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening. Mayor Ashcraft. Members of the council and staff.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The cities. Can you hear me? Okay?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm okay. Stay. Stay about there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The city's right. The rules have been followed. The problem is, we still have a mediocre project. And we want to know what can you do to help us change that? We think that if we saw that the the project is going back to the planning board for some design changes, we would like to be involved meaningfully and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'significantly to make a significant difference in this project. So far, everything that's been done has been done for the city excuse me, for the developer. And I'm not sure that the city has involved the community in a good faith, meaningful way.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And you hear tonight that that's what they're asking for. The result is that we have a project which. Really fits more on a freeway than it does on one of the last beautiful, primo, buildable lots on the bay in the Bay Area.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Can we not do better? Can Alameda not do better than this? I believe we can with community input. So we're asking you to please do what other communities do, recognize what our amenities are, value our amenities, take steps to protect and preserve them.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This is a neighborhood, a community.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mrs. Fletcher.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Dan Reidy. And after Mr. Reidy, we have Blaire Skelly, followed by Cathy Liang.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. I do have a letter in to you, but I just wanted to comment on a little bit about the environmental important events that happened in the environment. And some of the comments that came here triggered a few thoughts.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'One is that when the 1989 addendum was done, which is three inches thick, it was very seriously reviewed at the planning board level and by the city council. And then they the they looked at it's filled with a number of explanations of how the project from 74 had been revised, many times ways downsized, and therefore different mitigations'",
        "'speaker_4': 'were improved. What's interesting is that after that was done, we went forward like the extended stay hotel is built, the Hampton Inn is built, Hampton Inn building another building next to it right now today. And other buildings were built in the business park.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We didn't have to do all of those new revisions of environmental thinking. The build out of the business park there was already 1.1 million built at that time. The rest of it was built out without discovering a lot of new environmental problems.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'These are brought out sometime to stop a project and not in our static sequel analysis. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Blair Skelly. Followed by Kathy Liang. Followed by someone. Gilmore. Debbie. Deborah. Okay. Thank you. Hello.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Oh, good.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Evening. I live have lived in the.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Bay Farm Island for 25 years, and I do not support the proposed Marriott Hotel. You know, I clearly understand why the city needs more tax revenues and that a hotel can generate significant revenues. But I really the question, the need for another hotel in the area, if there really is a demand for that, the hotel belongs at'",
        "'speaker_7': 'the other end of the parkway where the businesses are. I really don't believe I've ever seen a big hotel like this, right. Bumping up right next to residential properties. This very large, standard looking hotel will definitely impact the residential area near it, as well as all the people who enjoy the use of the trail.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Um, you know, the five stories. There isn't even a five story hotel at the other end of the parkway. The hotel also impact our property values and will affect our wonderful quality of life because of the increase in crime, traffic and noise.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'As has been mentioned, the traffic study that's been done is inadequate as it doesn't address traffic is going to run through the residential areas. I I'm not a NIMBY and I was fine with the nursing home going in on that property, but I just can't support the hotel going in.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I would ask that you please rescind the planning board approval of the project.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Kathie Lee on.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Honorable mayor and council members. Thanks for this evening. It's my understanding I agree with all the appellant comments. You sent my voice, my letter. You can read that. I'm just going to cut to the chase. And it's my understanding that there's a BCD meeting this Thursday in two days to review the existing permitting for this land.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's also my understanding that there's a current permit with the BCCDC that expires in April. That leads me to the concern of why is this being rushed through? Or that certainly the feeling that is created. It seems the right thing to do would be to respect the process by allowing the BCCDC to perform their review first, then'",
        "'speaker_3': 'bring this project back to the Council and subsequently the Planning Board to work with the community. It's as simple as that. Thanks for your time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Deborah Gilmer. And Miss Gilmore is followed by Helen Simpson.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Hi. Hi. Thank you for giving me this opportunity. Excuse me. That's the first time I spoke this large of a group.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'See, this is why we don't share. Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I appreciate everyone that's brought really good information, and I'm really happy that my board voted against.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And, um, just please think about this. You know, I love Alameda. I've been here since 99.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I would really be sad if you don't fall in the right way. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Our next speaker is Helen Simpson, followed by Gary Thompson, followed by not Charles Hodgkins. Unless there's a different Charles Hodgkins, then followed by Carrie Thompson. Hi, Miss. Sorry, Miss Simpson. Yes, yes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good morning. Good afternoon.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's not really.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Going.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To work as.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It was. I lived in Alameda for 25 years.'",
        "'speaker_10': '24 of those years have been out on Harbor Bay or Bay Farm. And when we decided to buy a house and raise our family, we never envisioned a five storey 172 room hotel being built in our backyard in a residential area.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I ride the ferry every day. I ride my bike to the ferry.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The parking issue.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Is another can of worms for the ferry, and having shared parking with the.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hotel is not the answer. It's not a guarantee of spots. It's first come.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'First serve at the cost of 7 to $10 a day for ferry riders to park their.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I also understand there's two other hotels going up in Harbor Bay Parkway. So that makes it four plus the addition to the Hampton Inn. I also understand that the developer is developing something on Ballina Bay, the Westin. As for his website and also the hotel being built on Park Street, why all of a sudden we need all'",
        "'speaker_3': 'these hotels in Alameda? I hope you rescind this and not go forward with the hotel and protect our neighborhood in Alameda. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Gary Thompson.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Greetings City Council and thank you for Dark Sky. I would like to. I would like to see this sent back to planning. And I'm not here to impugn the planning commission, but I believe a 1990 study did not take into account today's environment and the use of these pieces.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Now, I was I have a shop that since be home in Harbor Bay. Every down and every day I take Runcorn Parkway 98th and down and get off one day, not a year or two ago, I started coming home and I turned on my GPS to see what it would do and it put me off on Fruitvale'",
        "'speaker_8': '. Then it dumped me off into Fern's side, and I was shocked at the traffic that was lined up on Fern's side all the way the bridge all the way down Island Drive. This was during when everyone was going to work, and I couldn't believe it.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The traffic studies come back saying there will be no impact. It's made a huge impact. I've lived there 20 years now. And and the difference of traffic moving through the neighborhoods has changed dramatically. And a huge part of it is coming right down.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'MCCARTNEY And coming right down. Davey Drive, where the schools are. And because people who live out of the area taking the ferry and working at the park now out where we are, Google is dumping them off before sending them the fast way.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The cinema short way.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But not the fast way.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Thompson. Our next speaker is Carey Thompson. Ms.. Thompson is followed by Robert Doud, followed by Tai Hudson. Good evening.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening, everyone. My name is Carey Thompson. I'm the chairperson for the Government Relations and Economic Development Committee for the Alameda Chamber of Commerce. And we support this project. We think that it is a good project and that it will bring local jobs, it will bring much more revenue to the city, and it does add parking to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the ferry. Yes, there are people that will drive to the ferry, but that doesn't deter those that are not willing to drive. There are people that are willing to get out of their cars and take their bike every day that they do that or take the bus.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I don't think that that is necessarily a true statement. It people are people and those that are really environmentally conscious will do the right thing. And I think that that's a good thing. So anyways, we do support this project and thank you for your consideration and listening to everyone's opinion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Robert Dow. Tie Hudson and Bassett about after that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mayor. City Council. I've been a resident for.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Over 25 years and now a business owner in Alameda. I think everyone voicing concern tonight is correct in their feeling that this location is very special and it should and I believe has been vetted thoughtfully. I'm in favor of this hotel.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think it's I think it's a great location for private and public to use. You get it, you get to be able to use the restaurant, the hotel, the coffee shop. There's more places to sit. As far as the view that was brought up as a concern, I don't think people look east to the mountains.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think they look west to the bay and the mountains across the other side of the bay. I think this this hotel suits the needs of the Harbor Bay businesses and the Alameda residents. I don't understand the traffic and the traffic concern, which I believe is would be minor, especially when many of the patrons of the hotel'",
        "'speaker_4': 'would use a ferry when they're visiting San Francisco. In addition, the hotel has given up 100 spaces for the ferry. This, on day one, may not guarantee the hotel one room, but it will guarantee traffic and parking reductions in the local.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Resident residential streets.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Earlier I said this. This should be and has been vetted thoughtfully. I think this developer has done a great a great job in taking in design concerns and bringing them up. I but I wish the city would move forward and maintain a critical eye on the design and ensure the quality.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, the next speaker is in. Good evening. Hello, Mr. Hudson. Come on up.'",

And as the hospitality industry grows in in the city of Alameda and in the East Bay as a whole, this is exactly what we need developers and hotel employers to do to ensure'",
        "'speaker_5': 'that a growing hospitality industry and a growing economy spread prosperity throughout our community. So again.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Please uphold the Planning.'",

I've been Alameda resident for 18 years and have lived on Bay Farm since my wife and I moved there in 2001. I currently work in San Francisco as a police officer and have done so for more than 23 years.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm here tonight to urge the Council to affirm the Planning Board's approval of this project and deny the appeal. I ride the Harbor Bay Ferry on weekdays going to work, and while I walk to the ferry, I've noticed many ferry riders have an extremely difficult, difficult time finding parking.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I believe the additional parking that this project will provide is sorely needed. My family and I look forward to having a restaurant and coffee shop within walking distance and meeting conference space that can be used by schools on Harbor Bay.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We frequently exercise along the Bay Trail and would welcome the upgrade to the path along the water. This developer has agreed to make these upgrades and I think it's worthwhile. Many of my neighbors support fully the project and it's my understanding that the hotel will have security on site, adding to the safety already adding another layer of'",
        "'speaker_4': 'safety to the safety already provided by harbor security and our own Alameda Police Department. I've heard people voiced concern about increase in crime, but in my opinion, the hotel would make their neighborhood in the area safer, not less so.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I hope you will allow this project to move forward tonight.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Teacher, I know that's important. And doing their homework, they did. And listen, if you had a chance to listen to their comments, you would know the positive aspects of this. I hope that you will continue to vote and vote for this project.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Not only does it give better access to the shore for the public, but the comments about the restaurant are very needed over there. There's there's hardly a place to eat when you're living in Harbor Bay and the coffee shop and the extra parking.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'All this is has been said. But from the council standpoint, we hear all the time that we need more hotels, especially in Harbor Bay. And I know that I get that feedback. A lot of the residents here don't get that feedback, but we have a lot of businesses there that they have to send their visiting staff, salespeople'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and customers to San Francisco or Oakland for hotel needs. And that means we are losing revenue.

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. McDonough. David Ross.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening, Mayor. Council staff. Thank everybody here for participating in this reasonably checkered process called democracy. The question for the people behind me, how many of you showed up at the planning board meetings? Who followed this process? I represent labor.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'I'm in favor of this project. It represents jobs. It represents a unique opportunity in terms of apprenticeships. At any given time, there will be between seven and ten crafts. Everybody's looking for workers. Opportunities consist of apprenticeships. It's not a toehold.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's the full body through the door. Not everybody in this room is foolish enough to think that everybody that graduates from high school in Alameda is college bound. This project affords the opportunity for people to make a good living, provide for their families insurance, maybe even be able to live in Alameda.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. My concern is specifically with the increase in traffic on McCartney Boulevard. I believe when the Business Parkway was developed in 74, there was an assumption that traffic for the business park would flow from the airport down the Harbor Bay Parkway to the business park.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Today, with our enhanced technologies, with Google Maps, etc., instead of using the safest route, traffic goes through the quickest route, which is through through my residential area, right down McCartney. So even if the traffic was anticipated, the traffic patterns that exist today likely were not anticipated in 1974.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Many of us have children that attend Bay Farm Elementary or Bay Farm Middle School. There are many, many children who Cross McCartney Boulevard twice daily to get to school and back. It's becoming a busier and busier streets, and I'm concerned about their safety.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So as you discuss this development, my request is that we also consider these traffic concerns and find ways such as a traffic stoplight or a lighted crosswalk that will increase the safety of the pedestrians crossing.

As you know, she's been a huge donor and contributor to your community for many years, both generous with her, with her generosity and with her activism in protecting your city. You know, the the Lehman Brothers hijacking at the point the attempt to take over part of the golf course for'",
        "'speaker_4': 'housing. And she can't be here. You suggested I contact the developer. I can't contact the developer because I'm the lawyer who sued Mr. Leach for his failed project in Sacramento. We sued him for fraud. He never did pay off on the entire judgment.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It was one of several lawsuits that led to his bankruptcy. When we discovered it was the same Robert Leach here, we discovered his his last project in Palm Desert has left $3 million in unpaid bills, which are subject to a current arbitration in this project.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'As you heard at the beginning, Mr. Thomas is not representing the interests of the city and the community. He's representing the interests of the developer. You're plant you did not get input from your planning board and it needs to be sent back to them because he told them that they had no choice.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You all know that setbacks and height limits and failures aren't something you have is right. That's the maximum. And projects are always smaller than those maximum setbacks of maximum heights of maximum failures.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'One of the things that we, my wife and I and our daughter who went to school here, really appreciate the fact that that this is a community that is very charming and very characteristic. That is one of the reasons why I simply feel that the building in and of itself, with its setback so close to the path'",
        "'speaker_8': 'and the shore and its height of of 72 feet is just inappropriate and out of scale for the environment. I think a picture is worth a thousand words. It really does stand out as being a an overly scaled building.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think that despite the fact that it has checked off all the boxes, as the gentleman before me just said, I think you can tailor the project to be set back a little bit further, have less parking, and be able to create a building that is either terraced back or otherwise addressed.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And it's nice to hear.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That there is encouragement here that that prevented revisions are pending and there will be a more neighborhood participation, which I will be involved.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In. So thank you very much. And we look forward to.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Both perspectives give me a lot of history and understanding of the various controls and requirements there. I'm here to request that you deny the appeal. I do think this is a good project, one that is highly sought after by the businesses in the business park.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'From the many years I've worked there, I know the hotel, the setbacks, the heights are all within their requirements. We've had a number of attorneys over the years financial institutions, both for Australians. Our buyers review these documents. The EIA has standing from previous projects we've approved.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I know the traffic for this project will be less than the one we approved back in 2007. The BCD there, there's an extensive track record there, Documented, which led the BCCDC attorneys recently to recommend to the commission no permit be required.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So if Bccdc Commission changes course on that, that will be strictly political. It won't be based on the legal merits, I believe. But that aside, you know, we want more good businesses. We want more jobs in Alameda. We can't keep asking good companies to come to the business park without amenities, without hotels.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They want this hotel and the business park approves.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Mr.. Mr.. Daniel Gregg. Father Sommerville. Hi.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'A I just stop for a minute. I would ask. Well, we have.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The speaker should have disclosed that he owns the property.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Isn't there an issue with someone coming this close?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. And also, we don't normally have people up on the dais. Thank you. So we reset the timer for Mr. Greg, please.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Uh, again, I'm a lead field representative of Carpenters Local.'",
        "'speaker_4': '713 covering Alameda County. I represent approximately 38,000 carpenters in Northern California. Many of them live and work here in Alameda. As many of you know, the construction industry when it comes to hotels is a is pretty tough for union workers to get into.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We think this is a unique opportunity here, both having union carpenters build the project on site and.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Have staff also.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Represented once the hotel is finished.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It might be the first of its kind in Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'As far as I can tell. A commitment by the developer to his union. Carpenters on this project is an opportunity for local residents to get training.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Apprenticeship and the payment of area standard wages and benefits. The staff report suggests and I know this was.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Said earlier, but I want to mention a real quick.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The appellants failed to demonstrate that the planning board's actions, findings and conclusions.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Including but not limited to actions.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Findings and conclusions suing to secure were not supported by.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Substantial evidence.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I've been hearing this a lot lately, lately in cities all over Alameda County, Northern California and.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Beyond. It's a tactic by many organizations to challenge Square to get what they want out of a developer or out of a project. We don't think it's ethical, and it's probably not legal. And I just wanted to make that known.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'In conclusion, the Carpenters Union fully supports staff's recommendation to affirm the Planning Board's decision to approve the project. And we ask that the Council.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Support the recommendation as well.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Sean Lavelle is followed by Jay Harris and then Karen Bey.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening. My name's Sean Lavelle. I'm a union carpenter and Alameda resident. US carpenters have to be up early in the morning, so I'm gonna make.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This short and sweet.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'As Mr. Greg said before, this can be built with union labor. And considering the costs of living in the Bay Area, I think it's going to be a huge boon to working people in Alameda. So I suggest that you deny the appeal and go forward with the project.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Then Jay Harris, followed by Karen Bass.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hi. Good evening, Mayor Ashcraft and city council members.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'My name is Jay Harris. I'm an environmental attorney on behalf of the applicant.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I reserve this time.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In case I heard any.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'New CEQA issues come up. That wasn't a part of the DB documentation.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's been going back and forth. And I didn't hear any and name of the gaming environmental laws thoroughness and I want to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank the city staff are being thorough in this.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Project and thank the.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Developer.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The applicant for being thorough in their work. I also would point out that the Planning Board.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Was.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Very thorough and reviewing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Consistency on this project and seeing that it was.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Within the scope of the earlier.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Development agreement in the city zoning and general plan, and it was very thorough in their review of the design elements.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And in fact part of the conditions was that they would return with some of the further.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Design elements of this project.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Before final approval.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Just thank you. And I just see my time on.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Recognition that it is late.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. We don't see time, but thank you for your comments. Karen Bey and Ms.. Bears, followed by Doug Dargan, followed by Amelia Foose.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Good evening. Good. So I just want to remind everybody that this is a business park. It's anchored by Penumbra, which has over 1700 jobs, Abbott Labs, who is expanding, and many other biotech companies that are expanding. So and it's part of our economic development strategy.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The business park and the goals of the economic development strategies are to increase jobs, to increase our tax base, and to add value to our parks by adding amenities such as restaurants and parks. This project checks all the boxes.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so in closing, this project will add tremendous value to our business. The Harbor Bay Business Park, a waterfront hotel with restaurants and cafes right close very near to the ferry terminal. This is just the kind of project that we want to see in Harbor Bay.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. David Hunt, former councilmember, former vice mayor, even Lou.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'All right.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you for the introduction. When we were about seven years ago, this came before us a different council altogether. And we were going to. We were asked to subdivided into five parcels. It was originally one parcel. In doing so, George came forward and representative his company and what during that presentation was presented as a two story opportunity'",
        "'speaker_4': '. It was strictly a lot.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Of discussions of.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'What took place on that. I'm not too sure if you guys read those things, but that your council made a decision at that point in time. Furthermore, I know that you've been struggling with parking and the ferry and talking about transportation in general.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If you want the ferry to be a viable situation, you need to really do address it. What is happening out there is that it was short on parking then and these little tokens of 100 more spaces is not going to solve your problem.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Your residents have not grown and Harbor Bay and Alameda in general, but your parking demand has spilled over throughout Harbor Bay residents.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And I think that's a.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Concerning issue with you guys and doing so. I would say that the vast, vast majority of the additional people that are using the ferry are off island, off Alameda coming in. That's a a something is a total different generation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The other thing. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I'm sorry. We've got speakers to go. I am, too. Our next speaker is Amelia Firth, and Ms.. Foose is followed by Zack Boling, followed by Steven Gertler and Brian McGuire. Good evening.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening, Mayor and members of the council. My name is Amelia Foose. I'm a homeowner in Harbor Bay, adjacent to Freeport Development, adjacent to this lot. I'm here representing dozens of my fellow neighbors who are not able to be here due to Chinese New Year, as well as many a lot of young families, families with young children'",
        "'speaker_3': 'who they were not able to be here this late tonight. Our community is strongly opposed to this business, and this proposal in its current form is simply too tall. We chose Alameda because of its small town feel. I've lived in Manhattan, in New York and San Francisco, and I chose Alameda because I don't want to raise my'",
        "'speaker_3': 'family in the shadow of a high rise. It's not about losing bay views. I don't really have a baby to lose, but I will lose view of the sky because of the height of the structure. I can appreciate the desire for more jobs and supporting our unions and to obtain more tax revenue for the city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But we do not need a 72 foot, 40 foot tall building to achieve this dream. Secondly, I am very concerned about the issue of traffic, as numerous people have said before me. Mr. Thomas from the Planning Board asserts that no evidence, there is no evidence of new impacts.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'However, I want to point out this is not a sufficient analysis to my knowledge. What I found there was one study that was provided by the developer that was part of this public hearing with the planning board, and that was an insufficient study that really just looked at the Harbor Bay Parkway.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And of four out of seven of those data points received a score of an F, and that's hardly reassuring. This. Thank you for your time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Zack Bowling is our next speaker, followed by Steven Gertler and Brian McGuire. And I think you've all got that down now. Good evening.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. Thank you, counsel. Yeah, I will. I'll keep this brief. I don't want to parrot things have already been said over and over. I fully support this project as both a very writer, as somebody that works in the business park, occasionally working with clients as someone that state and all the hotels that we currently have and'",
        "'speaker_5': 'that space, it's something that is desperately needed is more hotels and it's great tax revenue for the city. I, I absolutely think it's the easiest way to fill our coffers and help our underfunded projects in this city. So I fully support any hotel efforts in the city generally to supplements.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But in this case, I think this project is really good for Alameda and that's all I really have.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening. My name is Steven Cortland. I'm a resident of Alameda. I sat here and listened as your planning director advocated for this project with more zeal than the developer did. He loves this project, and he wants you to love this project.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But your job is to make an informed decision.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And I don't see how that's possible when your own staff.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Is feeding you a bill of goods and giving no credence to any arguments. To the other side of the question.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'They want you to approve this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Project and they don't want to give you any information that might cause you to doubt that conclusion. They are doing you a grave disservice.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Brian Maguire. I've said that more than once.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening again, everyone. Brian Maguire, just want to provide a little perspective here. A planning board that was 100% made up of Mayor Spencer appointees unanimously approved. This project found that it met our objective standards and rightfully honored a decades long commitment made by your predecessors.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Predecessors, probably. There's lots of good reasons articulated for it to support the project, and I won't go into all those again. But just a couple other comments. The project will be built, able to withstand a lot more sea level rise than most of the homes of the people that are asking you to deny this project.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This isn't like, yeah, you know, it's it's just a little confusing for me. Also, a two storey building blocks the views of the bay just as much as a five storey building does. And going a little bit higher allows us to get things like the parking for the ferry and more view corridors, etc. So it's time for'",
        "'speaker_4': 'us to start setting the right example. Things like the square and Bccdc process should not be abused by homeowners who want to freeze the city and amber or even even our union allies who want to get labor concessions.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Sometimes it's time to let those processes work the way they're supposed to for genuine environmental concerns. But in the middle of a urbanized, dense environment, the best thing we can do is dense urban infill, so should not uphold an appeal.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. All right. We've come to the end of our public speakers. And by the way. Well, well, then everybody speakers you held to your 92nd level time limit and I think you helped inform the council. So again, nothing is easy that comes before this board rarely anyway.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So who wants to who wants to lead the discussion?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We have to do this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember They said, Oh.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Wait, hold on.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm sorry you.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Needed a bathroom break.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh, okay. Yes. Wicked. Sorry. Yes, 5 minutes. Seriously, 5 minutes, people. Okay. We could take a look back at 940. It's it's 932. We'll be back for you.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thanks. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Too much laughter for.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Advice of concern.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. So, everyone, if you if you would like to continue your conversation, feel free to move out into the hallway. If you would like to stay for the meeting, please sit down and come to order for you are really okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You staff you. We just want. We want to start the meeting again.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'He has a gavel.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. All right. So the first thing we're going to do is we are going to close the public hearing because we just heard from, I want to say 34, 35 speakers. So the public hearing is closed. Excuse me.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we are now going to do council deliberation. So do we have any clarifying questions of Mr. Thomas before we get into our deliberations? I know I do. You do, too. Do you want to go first? A can take it away.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I call. I call on you when you try to avoid me. So you might as well go and you might have me.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Just a couple quick questions, Mr. Thomas. And first of all, thank you to everyone who came out and spoke. I just want to get that out on the record. So just some clarifying questions on some things. I heard there was an allegation made that the business part of the ER was approved for a much smaller business park'",
        "'speaker_8': 'and I thought the slide maybe had a different take on that. Can you kind of describe and tell me who's right?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'There is there was a 1974 EMR that er was comprehensively revised and updated in 1989 that it was done for the development agreement which specifies very specifically a 5.2 million square foot er the contention or the statement that was made earlier that oh you can't even consider that revision as legitimate is, is wrong.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We absolutely disagree with that. An addendum is a revision to an area and it was approved by planning board and City Council in 1989.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. And then I remember doing the bird strike ordinance because I think it was one of my referrals with then Vice Mayor Melissa Avella. I mean, if my memory is correct and you can tell me if I'm right or wrong, then the Audubon Society gave us a model ordinance for that and we adopt in their model ordinance'",
        "'speaker_12': '. That's absolutely correct. And they were here supporting our ordinance when you adopted it.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. So can you just kind of briefly tell us what the applicant is entitled to as far as my right and what our, you know, what we're allowed to do when there's a buy right project?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Yeah, the issue, the buy right terminology is in our general plan. It's also in the development agreements. It's the 100 foot height limit, it's 100 feet. And they are well within that height limit, the parapets, 62 feet. The project is also entitled Under our development agreements with the developer for a floor area ratio of up to 0.5'",
        "'speaker_12': ', that's 120,000 square feet. So the idea that we can as a city just sort of start arbitrarily hopping that down runs us afoul of those agreements.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And then I think there was an allegation that a hotel is not allowed and C MPD, can you trust that?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Construe the CMP.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And can you tell us what that stands for?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Thank you. Commercial manufacturing zone. That's the same zoning district for the entire business park. As we've heard several times, there's already two hotels in the CRM. So this issue has been debated and discussed several times before, and the council's approved hotels in the CRM, essentially, hotels are allowed in the CRM district, both at Harbor Bay as well'",
        "'speaker_12': 'as other CRM districts in Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'There are two last quick questions and it's been sent back to the planning board for some design considerations. You know, what opportunity at all will the public have to have input in those design modifications?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'What the planning board felt? They they they put a conditional approval that they wanted to see a final architectural design and a final landscaping lighting design before the project pulled building permits. And they were very clear that they wanted that to be a public process, a process with the community and neighbors, whoever interested I know the chair'",
        "'speaker_12': 'of the Planning Commissioner of the Planning Commission has reached out to me since that hearing, said, look, if that if this project moves forward, she wanted to personally be involved in making sure that that public process occurred and that she wanted to and that we invited the public to work on the design of the building and the'",
        "'speaker_12': 'landscaping lighting. I want to make it clear, though, you know, and I think the problem the council with the planning boards was struggling with here was we can't get to that level of detail if we as a community are still having an argument about whether the hotel should even exist.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So that's why the planning board took this two step process.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And then lastly and thank you for your answers. This is an appeal from planning board decision. So can you kind of describe what our role is as the council? And normally we're a policymaking body, but can you explain our role when there's an appeal.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Under under the zoning code? The planning board has the is the final decider on projects like this unless and they make the decision for the city. However, there is an appeal process and the point of the appeal. Is.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'It's an operating for you as the elected officials to determine whether your you believe your planning board made a mistake and what we essentially require a sort of substantial evidence standard for that. Like, is there any evidence have you heard anything tonight that makes you feel that they erred in the interpretation of the zoning code and the'",
        "'speaker_12': 'interpretation of any of the development agreements? Any of those things in the interpretation of the California Environmental Quality Act?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Mr. Thomas.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Any other Claire?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Just to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Claire. Okay, so we are. We are conducting a meeting at this time, so just to clarify. Excuse me. You could. You do need to wait to be called on. And I haven't called on you. So do any other council members have a question for Mr. Thomas?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mr. Desai.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Just to clarify, the the nature of this hearing is that it's a de novo hearing, meaning that we can evaluate anything under the sun with regard to this project. Not just we're not just limited to the.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'You have the ability to change the project.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah, exactly. It's a de novo hearing, so we're not limited to the planning board.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'You would change the project. We find.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Whatever, whatever it is.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Because you felt the planning board made a mistake and so you wanted to change what they did.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That would be an aspect of the de novo.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Exactly, yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Do you get your question answered? Okay.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I have I have follow up questions, too, but I can wait.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, you've got. Okay, go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Great. So the thing that really caught my attention when in listening to the planning board was when one of the planning board members said the following, and I believe this is a.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Word for Mr.. DE So just to clarify, you were going to ask a clarifying question of. Mr. THOMAS.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah, the clarifying question is about the nature of of combining parcels. Okay. Okay. Let me ask the question.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Preface questions a.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Little bit. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. Well, I could just get to the question then.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So, Cliff, did we correctly combine the three parcels that constitute the project? Because there is one parcel. About 30% of which is in the water and can never be built on. And then combining the three parcels that achieved a certain amount of square footage, building square footage, which is of the roughly 120,000 building square feet.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But that's a that's a function of combining the three parcels. The question I have is it's also a legal question. Did we follow California subdivision map or with regard to combining parcels? Did we follow state law with regard to combining parcels?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Because I saw one thing that said that anything less than five, four, 5000 square feet can up that parcel cannot be combined. So let me put it let me ask that.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Yeah, no, William.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I'll just say that I'm sure Mr. Thomas can ably answer that. And we have our assistant city attorney, Selena Chan of Land Use Matters. So feel free to.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Yes, please.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Let me just one quick answer.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'There are three contiguous parcels, all owned by the property owner. What the planning board said is because you are we are you have development potential on all three of them and you want to basically treat them as one parcel, one large parcel.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Then the condition is that the applicant merge the three parcels into one parcel prior to any issuance of any building permits. The reason the Planning Board made that specifically is because we want to make very, very clear. You're building this hotel at one end of the site.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'There's this other end of the site that's being used for a parking lot. They did not want a separate parcel there because they didn't want any miss understandings. You know, ten, 15, 20 years with somebody comes along, goes, oh, I've I've bought a parcel, I want to develop it at point zero.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'As far as I know, you're using the development potential for all three parcels with this one building and therefore we want this treated as one contiguous person.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I still want to ask it's still a legal question. Did we follow the California subdivision map if there was any provisions regarding combining parcels or did we follow existing state laws? What about that 5000 square feet or less?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This is Chen. Do you want to help with that answer?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening. Celina Chen from the city attorney's office. And to answer your question, we conditioned the planning board, conditioned its approval of the design review and development plan application on the subsequent merger of the three parcels. So that is something that will happen subsequently.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So you're basically saying it pass legal muster? Yes. Okay. Thank you. That follow up question, either staff or legal. Is that in the ordinance? It's written that all parking, whether required or in excess of all parking, shall be provided on the same parcel as the use which is generating the parking demand.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Is this. Now we've got two different parking places. We got one parcel, we got the primary parcel, which is roughly 4.6 acres. And the other parcel which is roughly, I don't know, point six acres. It doesn't seem to be.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I mean, you've got parking for this project on that 0.6 acre parcel. So that doesn't seem to satisfy this requirement that that park that all parking off street parking be provided on the parcels that is generating the demand.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Hence the need to merge the parcels into one parcel. And that's why that is. I mean, that is why that is a condition of approval. We wanted to make sure that we didn't have a misunderstanding in the future with somebody saying, Oh, I just bought a parcel with a parking lot on.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I want to build a building on it. No. If we approve this project at this size, you're using up the development potential for all three parcels. Therefore, we want them merged into a single parcel before we issue the first building permit.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And was that it just was that an.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'It also resolved that?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Was that a discussion that the planning board?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Yes, absolutely. We discussed that at the planning board. The need for the merger to occur prior to any building permits being issued.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Anything else, Mr. Dess?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you for now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Councilmember Vela and then Vice Mayor Knox White.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Mr. Thomas, there is a question or an issue raised earlier about the safety of schoolchildren crossing at McCartney and Audubon.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'My question is.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'You know, can we look at that separately or does that have to be part of a traffic study relative to this project?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We can totally look at it separately. I actually spoke to the woman briefly and unfortunately I don't have it, but I'm I told her to check in with us tomorrow. But I'm like 75% sure that the city has already budgeted and is planning to put in a signal at that intersection this next fiscal year.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I might have my intersections mixed up, but I'm pretty sure we've already got we've already programed and I funded a new signal.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That island.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I think it's I think it's one one spot over but.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'It.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It's island.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Right? Right.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But but again, the question is, could we look at it separately? Okay. And. What would we do in that in that respect if we were looking at it.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Would direct I mean to very simply direct staff to look at it tonight. It's a great time to look at it. We are working on our transportation projects for the next fiscal year. The budget will be coming to the Council for the next two fiscal years in the spring of the next couple of months.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Both. Both way.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you. I have a few questions and comments, but I wanted to start first just by saying that there was a comment by Mr. SAC about you and your coworkers and where your loyalties lie. And I thought it was completely out of bounds.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And, well, I will allow Mr. Leach to stand up and address the other part of your character assassination, which seemed to be the point. You were here. It was completely inappropriate. And I'm not going to sit here and let people stand up and impugn the integrity of the people who work for the city of Alameda, who are'",
        "'speaker_11': 'good people, who work really hard to just have people stand up and just claim that they don't care. I disagree with Andrew often. We have lots of passionate conversations. I never once think that he does not have the best interests of this city.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'You should be ashamed.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'All right? Not at all.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You can take this off line after the meeting. Let's get back to the.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Topic at hand.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We've addressed a lot of the issues that that have come up. I want to I wanted to ask about the traffic and then I have some kind of boundaries of what we can talk about the issue and you kind of said this in your presentation, but the issue is not that the city does not think that there'",
        "'speaker_11': 'will not be traffic impacts, but that for the balance of how we can make a determination, a significant impact is actually and this is in the essay report has to be a 3% increase in traffic at a specific intersection and that when staff looked at the traffic studies, that 3% threshold could not possibly be met by the'",
        "'speaker_11': 'amount of even the whole. If all the traffic went through one intersection, it still would not be and therefore it is not possible for the way in which we can make decisions tonight for there to be an impact.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But that's not to say that there isn't going to be more traffic from where it is today and staff wasn't making, is that.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'That's absolutely correct. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I just I think it's important tonight for, you know, this is a difficult issue. You know, I know I'll say that for someone just to go back again, it's not that we are discretionary to decide to do an environmental review or not because it has been approved in the past.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We are not allowed to write legally. We cannot just do more environmental analysis and hold the developer that.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'That's correct. Has specific language that says if you already have any air in this case, it's the 1989 amended air. You cannot require another one just because you feel like it. You need to have evidence that there's a significant impact that you that's not been.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Covered in a city of impact would be like the traffic that we.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Just like where the 3% threshold or we found endangered species on the site or one of those issues.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. And. And and just. Go with me for 2 seconds. But the reason for that is because, as you said in your presentation, they built the parks, the shoreline, the schools, all the public amenities that Harvard got built under the development agreement and the environmental clearance.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And it would be completely what would be illegal. But the reason is because it would not be fair to then go back and say, okay, now you gave us everything you promised. Now we're going to change the rules for you and make it harder for you to recoup those costs as you were.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'That's that's right. In terms of the development agreement, that was absolutely the intent. But, you know, totally separate from the development agreement is the California Environmental Quality Act, the law. And that's this issue of you can't be requiring another year just because you feel like it is.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'That's a standard set in that law.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But the development agreement is where some of these height limits and the U.S.. Exactly. Stuff is set. And that's why we can't make changes there. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And in a phrase that into a question, right.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yeah. So I just clarifying.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Clarifying.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And then for Sequoia, is it fair to say that it's not the sequel wasn't done. It's that when doing Sequoia, a new environmental report was not. But we did this analysis. It just didn't trigger the need for a new exactly.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Impact report, which legally we can't do. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Our obligation is to determine whether another air was required. Sequel lays out the threshold for acquiring a new E.R.. We had to do environmental studies to determine whether those thresholds were triggered and those studies were done and those thresholds were not triggered.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Therefore, we did not require a new E.R..'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And then something else that came up a number of times. Two part question, but the Bccdc permit, is that something that they are deciding whether to do or is there an agreement that says that they don't have to be done?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'The hearing in two days or three days at Bccdc, as I understand it, from reading the materials and talking to Bccdc staff, is that they're board wanted to have a discussion about whether a separate permit would be required or not.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Under the settlement agreement, it would not be required, but the board wanted to have a conversation about that because a lot of the residents had been going to the board, as you heard, to try to petition them to require a permit.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'It's important for everyone to understand, though. Even if the board says on Thursday, the BCCI board, oh, we want to require a permit for this project, meaning we won't have a separate hearing about it. They're not going to have that hearing until this board makes a decision on the project.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'They won't even be deemed the application complete until this board, the Salame, the city council makes a decision about this project.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you. That is my only question for now. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I don't know. I have a couple. Did you say a rumor? Okay. So thank you, Mr. Thomas, for all your time and information. So my question. A couple of them. One is there was reference more than once to the 1974 E.R. and perhaps subsequent documents never contemplated a hotel.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Can you talk about that?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Yeah, this is this. A number of the speakers were sort of saying you did it in 1974 and it's totally old. Didn't it doesn't reflect what you have now. And there was this passing, like complete sort of discounting of what the city did in 1989.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'What the city did in 1989 is incredibly important for this conversation. That was the update to the 1974 E.R. That's when the city said, you're right, this E.R. needs to be updated because our plans for the business park have changed.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And that 1989 revision to the 1974 E.R. was where the city very consciously and very specifically said our plans for the business park are the 5.2 million square feet, 100 foot buildings, the f they are. It's all documented in those agreements in 1989.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And that's why the city did, as Mr. Readdy describes, a three inch environmental document that was reviewed by the planning board and the council and the community to update that E.R.. So what we have is an IIR that is very specifically designed for this zoning and this this development as envisioned.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And it allows hotels and it talks about hotels in the business park.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. And then there was also some discussion in the conversation about the bccdc in going back before the board that there's a B CDC agreement that expires in April. What's that?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Well, I don't believe it. I don't know what they're referring to expiring in April. I think somebody was confused. And what they're talking about is that the city's development agreements expire in April. The settlement agreement with Harbor Bay does not expire, as far as I know, in April.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And that that runs.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The city's development agreement with the Harbor Bay Islands. Yes, that's come before this summer. Before. Okay. And then lastly, there was some assertion that the development agreement doesn't. Apply to subsequent owners that only the parties who negotiated or executed that agreement are or are bound by it.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'What that speaker was describing her, I guess it was the appellant was describing, was not our development agreement that what they were describing, I believe, was the Bccdc settlement agreement, which and that's what the debate is on Thursday.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And you know what? Essentially, you know, that's their basic argument for why Bccdc should have a separate hearing for the site.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think I might not be phrasing that clearly enough, but is there is an agreement with the city right now, notwithstanding that it expires this April? Does that agreement apply to subsequent owners, for instance, someone who buys a parcel at the at the business park, even though.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We have always as a city. Taken the attitude that the development agreement and this is true of all of our agreements apply to the land. These are entitlements for land, not to people to land. So when you apply a development agreement and give it certain entitlements through the land use process and then and then contractually establish those'",
        "'speaker_12': 'with a debarment agreement, you are basically first making those contractual agreements. It gives value to land. So if you're the owner of that property now, you have a more valuable asset. Of course, you can pass it on and sell it.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Those those entitlements don't just expire once you sell your property, if you like. And this is true of the homeowners. I mean, under that theory, they could sell their house and then we'd say, oh, I'm sorry, we don't want to let you have a house on that property anymore because we've decided to change our mind.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And you don't get the rights to have a house on this property anymore. I mean, that's essentially what we would be saying to the commercial developer now. Oh, we've changed our mind. We don't actually want you to build anything on this because you're not the original owner.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I got that. Thank you. And then I do have one last minor question. So you've said that the planning board president made it clear that she wants the subsequent design review to be have community participation. So is there a way that some of our speakers I'm looking at, Mr. Gonzalez, Irving Gonzalez, sitting in the front row, is'",
        "'speaker_0': 'a former president of the San Francisco chapter of the AIAA. And and then my friend down the road, Donna Fletcher, didn't seem to be objecting to the project overall, but definitely wanted more community input. Maybe she is. I don't want to put words in her mouth, but is there a way that, for instance, those interested individuals can'",
        "'speaker_0': 'be tapped?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Absolutely. They can always. First of all, we have to find out.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you for volunteering, people.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'This is we're only going to do this if this project moves forward. That's why we haven't been sending out invitations yet. If the project does get approved, gets through the Bccdc discussion and is then moving forward, this will be the very first thing that we start to schedule.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'What we'll do is we'll send out notices through the homeowners associations. Anybody can always contact the planning department. Just ask for Andrew and I'll get you on the list.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, I know how.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Much I want to do this with the neighborhood in the community, because we do think with the architectural design, landscape design, we can make it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Work. Better.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Good. I. I don't anticipate anything, but I would suggest you get in touch with those individuals where you have them in the room. Okay. I think unless anybody else has clarifying questions, let's let's get into our discussion. So who wants to lead?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I could start.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Who is that? Councilmember Diaz.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think the biggest concern that I have about this project and looking over the record has to do with the combining of the parcels. I could understand why the now, just by way of background, there are three parcels and one parcel is 4.4 acres.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Another parcel is 0.5 acres and a third parcel is 8.6 acres. The point six acres parcel is the parcel that is between the Maguire Hester building and where this project is going to be. I could understand why those two parcels would be combined, because the municipal code at at the time, the municipal code back in 1988, which'",
        "'speaker_5': 'was adopted in March 1988, not only said that parking generated by a project has to be met on the parcel of that project. Not only did the municipal code at the time in March 1988 say that, but it also said that if you're going to have shared parking that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Any use is that the parking is trying to satisfy any the demand that it's trying to satisfy. It has to be within 400 feet. Now, the hotel project is certainly within 400 feet of of where the where the wheat I'm going to call it the wheat parking.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The hotel project is certainly within the 400 feet of the wheat, a project which is required by the 1980 1988 ordinance. But it's not within 400 feet of the ferry terminal. So I could see why there is a reason to combine the parcels between the main parcel of 4.6 acres and the smaller parcel of 0.6 acres.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But I'm not convinced that there is any argument that says that that by right, we have to satisfy the project proponents efforts to combine the point five acre parcels, because if you just go to the Alameda County assessor viewer and you'll see the parcel, the parcel is of 8.5 acres, but it's a thin strip.'",
        "'speaker_5': '30% of it is 30 to 40% of it is in the lagoon that you all know. That's right there. And the other balance is basically on the on the. It's on this off the street, but towards on the green area.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You couldn't build on it, in other words. So it is incorrect to combine that parcel with the larger four acre parcel, in my opinion. And in combining the parcels, the effort in combining the parcels, as indicated in the record, was to increase the air, the floor, the amount of building space.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Because when you combine more parcels, you can by by definition, you can then have more building space. Right. And and it was a matter of the record that the discussion was focused on combining the parcels for purposes of increasing the FA because this is a direct quote from the planning board meeting.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'One of the planning board members said, quote, The three parcels joining as one is absolutely required. Otherwise these do not meet the FAA are and we would have to deny it out. Right. I can see to summarize, I can see a case for combining the parcels.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The big parcel, 4.6 acres and the what I call the half wider parcel 5.5 acres. But I believe, though, that the wrong decision was made with regard to combining the third parcel, the point five acres. The implication of all this, though, is simply that the project would still continue.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But rather than being 120,000 square foot project, it would be roughly 108,000 square feet. But at least it would, in my opinion, give us wiggle room to negotiate something where we have a project that perhaps covers. This is a technical term, a project that covers a wider building coverage because income and having a wider building coverage, we'",
        "'speaker_5': 'would have we could potentially have a lower built in. I would flatten it. You'd still have 108,000, but it would be flattened, hopefully two, three floors on. So I believe that, you know, based upon the de novo abilities of council to make a decision, I believe a wrong decision was made by the planning board when it comes'",
        "'speaker_5': 'to the environmental analyzes with regard to the combining of the parcels.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Okay. Who's next? Sure. Okay. Mr. Brody. Councilmember.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Madam Mayor. And again, I do want to give another thanks to everyone who came out. This is probably the one thing we've gotten the most letters on in a long time. So I'm going to be brief.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think there was a point made early in the presentation by Andrew that this was land made for the purpose of developing. So when we take a look at that, I mean, and somebody wants to build something on it.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I mean, we're not asking somebody to build on Walden Pond or turn out a redwood grove or, you know, a virgin prairie or, you know, any of those type of things, you know, a battlefield from the Civil War or anything.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'This is land that was built to be developed. And I think the vice mayor said it earlier in another meeting, you know, and I'll kind of repeat it and paraphrase it. I mean, just because it's a vacant space doesn't turn it into an open space.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I think when you consider that in conjunction with the fact that this land was made for the purpose of developing developing it, I mean, that kind of informs my decision making. You know, the reason why I'm not going to say much is because I didn't really see any evidence of any new impacts or more severe impacts'",
        "'speaker_8': '. I mean, that wasn't presented to me. And that's what we're here to look at. And I do feel that the project complies with our standards. And, you know, Mr. McGuire made the comment about the composition of the planning board.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I mean, that was I was going to mention that. And it was critical to me because, you know, I sat through the last four years when all of the planning board members were appointed, and I remember the previous mayor had appointed every single one of those.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And, you know, I think a fair assessment of those appointees is that they were not ones that would rubber stamp development projects without, you know, doing their due diligence. I think that's a fair, fair assessment of them. And the fact that they agreed to this unanimously, I think says volumes to the project and and where we shouldn't'",
        "'speaker_8': 'fall as a council on it. So I plan on denying the appeal and supporting the Planning Board's decision.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember O.D. Councilmember Vela.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Um, I'm going to actually go ahead and I know that there's going to be more council deliberation and discussion, but I'm going to make a motion to, to actually two separate motions. So one to direct staff to look at the intersection, McCartney and Arden BLOCK in terms of safe routes to school and pedestrian safety at that intersection'",
        "'speaker_10': '. And I'm also going to make a motion to deny the appeals filed by Brian Trimper and Labor's International Union of North America. I'm putting that out there to, to narrow the discussion down and I'm going to comment on why I'm making both of those motions, if that's okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It is fine. I would. My preference would be to give staff direction on the traffic implications because I think it gives them a little more latitude if they.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Have happy to amend it. Okay. To give them direction.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. To. So it's just that it doesn't need to be a motion perhaps to just give it.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So the motion is withdrawn and I'm just. Thank you. Giving direction. I think that, you know, there was a comment made earlier about the the use or the misuse of secure. And I find it disingenuous when there's 17 or 18 school challenges throughout California made on the behalf.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Of of.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Of one group. And there was that was just in by one law firm that has filed the appeal here. And that's just in 2018. And, you know, one of them was withdrawn in Sacramento where an agreement was reached.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So I'm not really interested in negotiating through threats of lawsuits that are really not, I don't think, justly founded and the principles of secure and what it's meant to do in terms of the other challenge. You know, I think that a lot of the concerns that were raised are really not necessarily sequel concerns.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'In terms of what I heard from the community, I heard some concerns about pedestrian safety. I think that that's an absolute valid concern. I would like us to look at that through other means, because I think that there's it's not just related to this project.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And certainly the city is committed to Vision Zero and it's something that we need to be doing anyways. With regards to why do we need hotels? We're right next to the Oakland airport and there's a lot of people that come in and out of that airport and they come here to our business park to do business.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And we also have a need for space. We've got folks that have family visiting. I was talking with some Coast Guard families that were finding it very difficult to find places for their family members to stay when they were visiting.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So, you know, and and we're in the San Francisco Bay area and there's a lot of different conventions that occur. And our hotels throughout the Bay Area are booked and it's very difficult to find hotel space. So it's something that we're seeing a lot of and that's why there's a lot of hotels going up.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It's a it's a good time to do it. And it's something that we've looked into as a city in terms of, you know, is there a need and what can our city really, you know, make use of? And so it's something that from an economic development standpoint, we've looked at, you know, a lot of the design questions'",
        "'speaker_10': '. I think our planning board made it very clear that they're they're planning to look at those design concerns as they come forward, and they want it to be a community based process. So I'm I'm sufficiently satisfied that that will happen.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But again, those aren't secret concerns. I do want to thank Councilmember De Saag, who raised a question with staff earlier her articulately with regards to the 100 foot height limit. And it was disclosed that I think that the the contemplation of a building of of 100 feet, which was, I think, adopted prior to 1928.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So it was something that was, you know, contemplated for quite some time. And so I think that there's certain things that that we've certainly been contemplating for a number of years in terms of what we're looking for in our community.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And it was something that, you know, actually dates quite a far ways back. So I think this gives us latitude in making these design choices and these development choices as our community evolves and our need evolves.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thanks, Mary Knox.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'If I could just quickly ask, I think it's answer the question, the issue of where we can we can make a finding to uphold the appeal without making a finding that there was inadequate, secure. Right. In the combining of the issue of whether or not combining the lots.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That's not a square issue. That's just a. Procedural issue that one could one could run could raise up to.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You know, do that in a de novo approach.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I, I just want to clarify, because you said it was a violation of it. It made the second finding wrong. And I think they can do they can do both. So, again, I would like to I want to thank everybody who spoke as well as I started to say earlier.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'You know, I know that this is a very difficult issue for a lot of people, especially for some people that I know kind of well who are directly impacted and will have the the the the the view that they currently enjoy changed.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I can say that as somebody who grew up in a family home that was on a ravine that was developed while we lived there, where places where we looked out and saw trees became a very, very large three car household and did change the nature of where we lived and.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'As in as I would say in this case, we didn't have any say. I believe very strongly that we have a fantastic legal staff. Ms.. Chen is phenomenal. We have a fantastic planning staff. Andrew Thomas does does us right.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And it's one of the reasons why we have been as successful in moving forward without some of the legal challenges that our city with other cities around us have had in terms of approving things. They fight very hard for our community, but I also know that I can trust them when they say the school law is really'",
        "'speaker_11': 'rock solid on this and that in terms of discretion, we can't we cannot legally do it, do more environmental work. And we do not have discretion to talk about the height of the building, etc.. One place that in terms of the de novo as that question as well that I would like to look at, I have heard'",
        "'speaker_11': 'from a lot of people about concerns about the impact on the water and the 35 foot. The planning board talked a little bit about this and I would like us to consider including removing up to 25 parking spaces.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The parking study says that this place is over parked and pull the building back 15 more feet back from the water. That is something we could do that would address some of the concerns about that, creating a more human space along the water, as some people have indicated, without actually sending this back or upholding the appeal.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So as we move forward, I'd like to to look at that, but also as a part of our denial of the appeal, which I plan to deny, simply because, as Mr. already this Council member already mentioned, I have not heard any facts that were not mentioned in the planning board meeting that I listened to that were not'",
        "'speaker_11': 'addressed and have not been addressed by staff tonight as adequate.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So Councilmember Vella.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I have a question. So that's separate from the whether or not there's a motion to deny. Are you proposing that that's something that we have a planning board look at? Or is that something where you're asking to give direction?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Can you clarify a little bit?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I would be asking to make as a part of our motion, upholding or denying the appeal, upholding the planning board's decision with direction to remove that parking, as was discussed at the planning board and bringing back the kind of the siting of the building.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So back after that. Sit down as a part of the as a part of the design review.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'd ask Mr. Thomas to come to the podium if you would. So, I mean, I I'm not in disagreement with that proposal. However, I am not sure I want the City Council to redesign this project, but rather to give direction for what it is we're trying to achieve.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But Mr. Thomas, can you help us with when this goes back and we already know that we're going to that we're going to request a more refined, improved design? I'm in complete agreement with that. What about this concept or question of removing some parking spots?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'How many where?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I think the planning board is already if if the council uphold upholds their decision, then the next step is talking.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To the Mike.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And Mary on.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'The landscape, landscape plan and architectural design. The council tonight could certainly amend that and say, hey, when you're doing the architectural design and the landscape design with the community. Please do have this conversation as well. The conversation of pushing the building back an additional ten or 15 feet, it eliminates a row of parking.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'But as Councilmember Knox White said, it's we already have a parking space saying it's over park. Now, obviously, the tradeoff here and this came up a little bit of playing board as well, the way we really wanted the extra parking for the ferry issue.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So that's going to be the trade off in the conversation, which you could ask the planning board to revisit.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So a question for you, Mr. Thomas. I did see that the statement that the hotel was over parked is currently configured, but by how many spaces was it over parked was given. So, so starting with the number of spaces required for those rooms and then the 100 spots that have been offered up for the ferry were there'",
        "'speaker_0': 'more.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So let me clarify here. So our code required a lot of parking for every hotel room, 1.25 for hotel room. So that's a lot of cars for one room like that assumes that a lot of people come to one hotel room with two cars in.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Does that assume 100% occupancy?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'No, no, that's that's just what you when you build the hotel. Well, so.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, no, but it's so 11.25 for every room.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Room. Right. Okay. So you to fill that parking lot, a lot of people would have to come with two cars for four. So they met the parking requirement per the code. So that's how many parking spaces they have.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Our parking study says, well, that's a lot of parking, probably way more than you need, but you met the code, so the planning board then put this condition on or since we think you're going to have all this extra asphalt lying around that you're striping for parking, we want you to make it available to the ferry.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Folks. What I think I'm hearing is suggestion that the council might amend the approval slightly to say, hey, planning board, when you go back and look at the landscaping plan on the architectural design, please look at with the community.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'The idea of moving the parking the building back 15 feet, if you do. I you know, we I don't remember the exact number, but just looking at the site plan, essentially, you you lose a row of parking. I think it's about 15 to 20 parking spaces.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We already know we've got over 100 more than we probably need. So all it really does, it's a trade off between moving the building back a little further. Well, it just means fewer spaces on a daily basis available for ferry parkers.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So I think at the end of the day, that's the trade off.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'QUESTION Okay. QUESTION So. Question. Do you have a question?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I mean, just on this issue, since it was brought up, I mean, so how many spaces do we think the ferry parking is going to use, utilize?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Well, here's the way that's set up. They're building a parking lot with a whole bunch of extra parking. We don't know how many extra the parking space said. We think you've got about 100 more than you need. The way we've set it up with the mobile app and the conditions approval is we we understand there'll be some'",
        "'speaker_12': 'days where there's the hotels got a lot of people. Other days will be less. So we don't know what it will be every day. It's not we're not proposing to fence off a parking lot for the ferry. What we're proposing is a mobile app signage to so that there's a way for people to go, oh, hey, there's'",
        "'speaker_12': 'extra spaces at the hotel. I can park there today.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So how are we going to regulate that? I mean.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'It's going to be it's a private parking lot. So they will regulate it. They will. Our conditions say you must have signage saying parking available. You must have the mobile app so that if you're in Harbor Bay at 9:00 in the morning and you're thinking about driving down, that you'll be able to check your phone and go'",
        "'speaker_12': ', Oh yeah, there's three spaces at the hotel available right now. I'm heading down. If it says No, we're full. We've already sold off the spaces. They're booked for the whole day, then you don't drive down. So that's the way it was conceptually structured in the conditions of approval.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And then if you do drive down and park where you're not supposed to, you'll get ticketed and towed.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Well, that's that's true. Today, if you park in the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well, I remember I have the scars from that.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So. Yeah, no, I mean, that's why we don't want people driving down in the hopes of getting a parking space in the hotel if there's none available or if other people have gotten there before them.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. Thanks for.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Those questions. I would just comment that being a bit familiar with that free parking. First of all, we want to start charging in the in the weed a lot itself because that's that's just a way that we bring in some revenue that helps with shuttles or whatever we do.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And also it might encourage folks who say drive from and circle and park there to not do that. But I would say that you could be assured that whatever available parking spaces are, whatever number of parking spaces are made available, they will they will be filled up.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Desai I.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Just want to close by saying this. So our planning director just said that the parking met the code, but bear in mind we also just had a conversation that the parking did not meet the code of March 1988.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And that's why, as they say, they're going about me trying to combine the parcels. Right. So that's that's a contradiction. And the reason why this is important for me is because this discussion and analysis was not part of the planning board.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Discussion is not part of the record. To be sure, this is not a school issue. This is a municipal code issue. But by the same token, it is also an issue that I am attempting to leverage in an effort to somehow wiggle away to make the project a little smaller.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so I think that's what council should be doing, is doing everything that it can to still have a hotel and still have hotel taxes, but also attempt to meet the needs of the residents concerned about a five storey monstrosity.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mr. Thomas, you want to come up and provide some clarification?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I just want to I just want to address this. This issue of shared parking, sharing parking between two separate parcels is a provision in the code. It's intended for two different property owners, two different uses. We do allow for shared parking.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'That's where that 400 foot thing comes from. If you intend to meet your parking requirement on somebody else's property, our parking code allows that under certain conditions. One of the conditions is if you're going to share the park, you we tell you you need two spaces and you're like, Well, I've only got the space for six on'",
        "'speaker_12': 'my parcel, but I can lease some from my friend who's down the street and our code says it should be within 400 feet if you're gonna do that. This is a different situation. This is one property owner owns three parcels.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Got it. Thank you. And I also saw in that I think shared parking is something to be encouraged because otherwise you have just empty asphalt.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'During.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Parts of the day and night. I'm going to jump in with my comments. And then we I know we have a motion that is pending. I'm not going to I don't have a lot because my colleagues all covered a lot of the points I would have.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And thank you to all for your thoughtful deliberation. It is always lovely when you can just make everyone happy. I'm not sure I've ever had that experience, but it would be lovely. But we don't. But then at the end of the day, where I sit as an elected official, I have to look out and see what all'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the different needs of the community are including. And I very much appreciate all the neighbors and the residents who emailed and who showed up to speak, most especially the ones who spoke respectfully, which was the vast majority of you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But then there are other people who weren't able to come out and speak. But I I've met with them. And I'll tell you about a couple of our businesses that are out there at the Harvard Business Park. We as Alameda INS should be very proud of some of the work that is being done it at Harvard Business'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Park and in fact, around our city. But I met last week with an executive vice president from Exelixis, which is a company that moved over from South San Francisco. They'd outgrown their space. They needed more space. They're expanding.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This is a company that is developing gene therapies, targeted gene therapies to treat a number of very serious cancers. And they have I mean, this company was started by a couple of Nobel Prize winners. They chose to be right here in our backyard.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In your backyard. And what the gentleman I met with told me is that and I heard this also from the president and CEO of Penumbra, which is also out there at the Harbor Bay Business Park, which does this nanotechnology noninvasive device, if you're having a stroke, that blood clot in your brain, they can go in quickly and'",
        "'speaker_0': 'minimally invasive way and push it out, save lives. And they are a worldwide company headquartered at our Business Park at Harbor Bay Business Park. But they've both told me in recent months that they run out of space when they have visitors and clients coming and the hotels that are out there fill up.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So they shuttle them over to San Francisco, sometimes are taking them to the Claremont, sometimes the Oakland Hilton. But apparently that's maybe getting a little run down. It's not as favorite as some of them are. What really bothers me about that is we're not being business friendly to our business park residents who are doing amazing things and'",
        "'speaker_0': 'bringing a lot of revenue into our city just from the sales of these devices and whatnot. And also that is transient occupancy tax TOTTY that is just flowing over our city limits into Oakland, San Francisco, Emeryville, Berkeley for the Claremont.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'One of the things I think Debbie Potter has left, but we had a discussion a week or two ago that we need to raise our transient occupancy tax. And don't worry, residents, you won't pay it. This is what people pay on their hotel rooms when they stay here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But right now it's 10% of your hotel room rate, whereas our neighbor San Leandro charges 14%. Really, are we not at least comparable to San Leandro? But that's money that is going straight into our general fund. So it's not that we do this just to have more money coming into our general fund, but the need is there'",
        "'speaker_0': '. We want to support our businesses. Exelixis made the conscious choice to move from San Francisco and they looked in a radius of different places and they just settled on Alameda and they're here. They love it. They're growing and thriving.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we need to we need to support them, too. I am mindful of the concerns of neighbors that they don't want to look at just any old monolithic building, nor do I. And I will say we could still work on this design.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I want so I want this to be a robust project process of getting input from neighborhood representatives, especially those with some professional expertize to bring to the table. And we I think with the proposal about reducing parking spaces, we can pull back from the shoreline a bit.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's what compromise is. Neither side got everything they wanted, but at the end of the day, this is a good project for so many reasons, not least of which the jobs that will create the space for hotel rooms, for restaurant and cafe visitors.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I've also talked to Mr. Leach about having come back from the Conference of Mayors. There are some great internship and work to learn programs that hotels are doing. I'd like to see that in Alameda with that. Councilmember Vella, do you want to restate your motion and then I'm not sure we've got a second.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So I moved to. Pull it up again to deny the appeals filed by Bryan Trumper and Labor's International Union of North America. Local Union 304 In approving a final development plan and design review to allow the construction of a 172 room, hotel and restaurant on the Harbor Bay Business Park shoreline at 2900 Harbor Bay Parkway.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'With the amendment to well while also directing staff to look at the intersection mentioned and then to. And I'm also amenable to taking the direction of the account of Vice Mayor Knox White that he proposed that we direct.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Do you want to restate it that we direct?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I would just say that the direct the planning board to identify how to pull the project back from the shore and remove.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That's an option.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Well, we can make it an option or we can actually say it's something we want. I would personally I would say I've heard a lot about the shoreline. I would I would make the motion to direct them to do that as opposed to make that discussion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I have and I want I'd like Mr. Thomas to help us word it in the way that's most effective.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'It's completely you can do it either way. I think the the if you if you just have them if you put it if you tell them just do it. Yeah. Then what I'm a little worried about is if they then get a whole bunch of ferry parkers coming down, then they're sort of saying, don't do it.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'There's that conversation that they might want to entertain. If you say, Hey, we want you to entertain it, we want you to seriously look at it, then at least they can kind of balance that out and maybe, maybe approve it with a setback.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Or maybe not. It's but it's completely if you say, hey, we want it pushed back. No ands, ifs or buts, then you can just do that tonight. And then I just lastly, it's just the issue of the traffic signal and the intersection.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I think that should just be.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Clear that it's.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Separate.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Yes, that'll be part of.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Direction to staff.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Process.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Comment. Okay. So we have I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Just one more clarification of the motion. You'll be adopting a resolution, so.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Uh. Yes. Okay. Councilmember Odie.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Madam Mayor. So. Are we doing a mandatory set back, moving the set back, or are we doing a consideration? Because I do have some concerns about free parking and there never seems to be enough. And I understand we don't want these big CS of asphalt and you know, we want to get people out of their'",
        "'speaker_8': 'cars and everything. But by bringing people to the ferry, we are getting them out of their cars and they're not crossing the bridges and they're reducing congestion on the bridges and the bridge approaches. So I like the idea of like moving the set back in, but I'm not sure I want to do that at the cost of'",
        "'speaker_8': 'ferry parking, given that I think we're going to see expansion of ferries like we haven't gone to the South Bay yet and there's just going to be a greater demand. And I think we're kind of choking that demand if we if we mandate that we reduce ferry parking.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I get the general ideas. And also I think Sharon Road also needs to be looked at. Sharon Road in McCartney, I think there's some complaints there. So not part of the motion, but.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The tourism.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Direction.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Councilmember Vela I'm fine with directing the planning board to look at alternatives on creating an additional setback through the elimination of parking spaces. And I think that that's the middle ground and it's it's not dictating the number of spaces.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It's letting them know that that's what we're looking for them to do. So that's the direction that I would like to include. And I think ultimately we are adding ferry parking through this project. So I don't want to have us use terms like we're reducing it.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We may end up reducing it by a handful of parking spaces in the end, depending on what the design looks like. So, um, is that, is that an acceptable direction? Okay.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I guess I'll second that motion then.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So and then just to satisfy the request of the city I clerical. So we want to approve the draft resolution denying the appeals and affirm the planning board's decision to approve construction of the 172 room, hotel and restaurant at the given address with the additional direction given to staff.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Correct. Okay. And we have a motion. Did I hear a second? Yeah. Yes. Okay. All in favor.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I, I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Opposed. Okay, so the motion passes 4 to 1. Thank you, everyone, and thank you for coming. Yes. Okay. Councilmember, no. So I am Vice Mayor. Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's okay.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I answered any. So I would like that. I would like the council to consider directing staff to send a letter to BCD about the about this issue. I think that there's a big planning for everybody.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We had one more discussion going. If you could just go quietly and.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We can wait if we want. But I think I think there's a significant issue related to the change in which they are the way they are considering changing, the way they deal with this permit, this specific issue whereby they are putting our entire planning process, basically saying that we've spent a year and a half planning or year'",
        "'speaker_11': 'planning. So I'd like to I'd like to consider directing staff to write a letter on behalf of of of the city to address that issue.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And did you see the the letter from Cox and Castle and.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yep, that's a private firm. I don't want to rely on a private, firm letter. I'd like the city to address the issues that we have, which is right now, the way in which Bccdc addresses planning is they will not take any action until they until a city has gone through all the way through.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We've worked with them to make sure that we are aligned, as we always have been, around this negotiated settlement. And now after we are approving the project, they are saying, oh, we may change the process. And I just think that that is a very problematic thing to do.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I hear from the city attorney in our city, Mr. Roush.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'While I don't disagree with Vice Mayor Knox White's comment, I'm a little concerned that that direction.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'May not be within the four corners of what we have on our agenda. And I'm trying to be very sensitive to. Council taking action with.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Respect to matters.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Are not are not defined fairly decently on the agenda title. So I would I would be a little reluctant.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'To suggest.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That you take that action tonight. Notwithstanding that, it makes good sense.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. All right. So.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I will perhaps withdraw my.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'My suggestion. Suggestion? Yeah. All right. Okay. So then this item is completed and we'll move on to the next. Thanks, everybody. Okay, now we have two more. And is that right? We have seven. We have City Manager Communications.'"
