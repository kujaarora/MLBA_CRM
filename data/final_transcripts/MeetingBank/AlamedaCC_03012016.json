    "Summary title:  Related to the Rent Review, Rent Stabilization and Limitations on Evictions Ordinance Consider: 1) A Resolution Adopting Policy Concerning Capital Improvement Plans (CIP), and 2) An Appropriation of Funds.  Adoption of Resolution Adopting Policy Concerning Capital Improvement Plans;  AND  Appropriation of $300,000 from the General Fund to Fund a Rent Program Fee Study and to Cover the Cost to Administer the Rent-Related Programs through June 30, 2016. (City Manager 2110)   [The Public Hearing was held on February 16, 2016 and the Council discussion was continued to March 1, 2016 at 5:30 p.m.  Therefore, there will be no additional public comment.]": [
        "'speaker_9': 'Good evening, Mayor, Mayor and members of the city council. I'm Debi Potter. I'm the community development director for the city of Alameda. And as has been noted, this item before you and this meeting this evening is a continuation from the February 16th meeting.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'At that meeting, the agenda recommendations called for an introduction on first reading of a rent stabilization rent review and limitations on eviction ordinance, adoption of a resolution governing the program and policies of the capital improvement plan and an appropriation of $300,000 from the General Fund to conduct a study and fund the rent program through June 30th of'",
        "'speaker_9': 'this year. And embedded in that last recommendation was a request for direction from the Council about how to pay for for the administration of the ordinance. On the 16th, the Council did introduce an ordinance on first reading. And second reading of that ordinance is scheduled for later this evening.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And for purposes of this meeting, I will be presenting on the Capital Improvement Plan Resolution and the program fee. As you know, one of the provisions in the ordinance for a no fault eviction is for substantial rehabilitation and staff.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And the ordinance does capture that concept of preparation of a capital improvement plan when a property owner is undertaking substantial rehabilitation. And the ordinance contemplates that the city will adopt an ordinance will adopt a resolution excuse me, a resolution that contains the requirements of the capital improvement plan.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And that the purpose of the capital improvement plan for substantial rehabilitation is to encourage housing providers to reinvest in their rental property. It ensures that providers get a fair return on investment, and it also provides tenants with relocation benefits if they are required to move as part of the substantial rehabilitation.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Hmm. Did it? The Capital improvement plan as contained in the resolution requires that before you increase rent or you terminate tenancies in connection with a substantial rehabilitation project, you must prepare a capital improvement plan and capital improvements as they are defined.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'For purposes of a capital improvement plan is that they must add material value or prolong the useful life of the property. They would not include routine repairs or maintenance. The cost of the proposed capital improvements must be more than eight times the amount of the monthly rent, times the number of rental units to be improved.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And as we've said, the plan must be approved by the city before undertaking any rent increases or terminations of tenancies. Under the proposed capital improvement plan. If a tenant decides to permanently relocate rather than pay the increased rent, they would be eligible for relocation benefits, relocation assistance.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And those benefits would be the ones that are outlined in the ordinance, which are tied to the length of tenancy and then and can be exchanged for time versus money. So it's the same provisions for relocation benefits that are contained in the ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And then if the tenant wants to stay and pay the increased rent but needs to be relocated during the construction, the improvement plan policy provides that the housing provider must relocate the tenant to a vacant unit on site while the work is being done, or if there is no onsite vacant unit, then the tenant would be permanently'",
        "'speaker_9': 'relocated with the payment of relocation assistance. So that is an overview of the proposed capital improvement plan. And before I move on to a presentation on the program fees, I do want to note that staff is recommending one slight revision to the proposed policy.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So it's on page one, the resolution. So Exhibit A of the resolution is the policy. So on page one, on number two, capital improvement.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Wait a minute. You're way ahead of me. Okay. Where is this?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes. So on the resolution and there is a page A-1, which is exhibit A to the resolution.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It comes up as page to honor the resolution. But.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But at the bottom of the page, it's printed A-1.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And then number two is called Capital Improvement. And so what staff is proposing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. Page one. That's the page numbering system they have.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So a capital improvement. And what we want to insert is a capital improvement comma. For purposes of the capital improvement plan policy, comma shall be any improvement to the rental unit. And then it goes on with the definition.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And the reason that we're asking for this additional phrase to be added is because we want to ensure that the policy is consistent with the definitions in the Ordinance of Capital Improvement and Capital Improvement Plan. So by making it clear that the capital improvement as defined in the capital improvement plan, then we are making sure that we'",
        "'speaker_9': 'are consistent with the definitions in the ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So you were planning to talk about capital improvement plan now and then continue to talk about all three the other issues. Now, without feedback from us.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I was going to present on the capital improvement plan, then the program fee. But if the Council would prefer to take questions on the capital improvement plan before we move on.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'd like to do that. I'd like to address this issue because the motion could pose to this issue by itself also that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That's correct. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So that's what I would suggest. All right. So then Amber Ashcroft.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'What I just want to say is, Porter, can we get this in print form? I mean, rather than you reading us some delineation because that's the language you just read to us is not here, is it?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'No, it's not.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And why is that? We don't have a hard copy in front of us is my question.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Because. Well, I apologize for that. The the the desire to make it to make sure that the language was consistent was with the ordinance definitions, was determined on Friday. So I apologize that that we didn't turn it around for the council in writing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But if I understood correctly, it's just a one, it's a capital improvement comma as defined by what was it's eight words. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So it's.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Just.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. And where in paragraph two. Capital improvement.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, a capital improvement comma.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. So it would be a capital improvement comma for purposes of the capital improvement plan policy comma.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Which is what this document is. So it's just pertaining to this then. That was the only change in.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Well, I, you know, not wanted to be too nit picky, but we get emails from the city clerk's office all the time and it's really easy and electronically document it just added and it gets downloaded next time we refresh.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I think I have that added text.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. All right. Member, only.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'A couple of questions, but just a point of information management. We. Viewing our comments on this at this point to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Clarifying questions, calm both her clarifying questions. Right. And then she could sit down and we can have our deliberation or we can just go ahead and have it with her standing there. I don't have a problem with it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I guess. Well, two quick questions. So under nine nine, be relocation assistance for the work associated with a capital. Improvements cannot be accomplished reasonably and safely with the rent a page.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Mr. Audi A4.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'A4.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It okay paragraph so.'",
        "'speaker_2': '99. So who determines if the work can or cannot be accomplished reasonably and safely? And the reason I ask that is, you know, roofing is one of the options where you can have a capital improvement and pass it on.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I can't imagine that, you know, majority of the times that a tenant would have to vacate in order to have a roof done. But if the landlord, you know, says you have to, I mean, who gets to make that call?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Is that the city? Is that some hearing officer? Is that the landlord? I mean, there's because there's a lot of wiggle room there.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So the it would be the program administrator.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And are we providing guidance?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So the administrator with factors and then a housing provider must relocate the tenant to a vacant unit. If there's no vacant unit, then they get permanently relocated. But presumably the existing unit, when repaired, will be vacant. So is there any provision where a tenant that wants to stay and pay the rent increase can move back when the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'repairs are done?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So the provision is that they if they would be temporary, they would be able to be temporarily relocated. If there was a vacant unit on site, if there was no vacant unit on site, they would be permanently relocated with relocation benefits.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And if there was a desire to come back to that unit, they could certainly do that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But that's not spelled out in the plan now. I mean, that's a big concern of mine that, you know. We're going to have tenants being mass evicted for these capital improvements and then maybe they're perfectly willing and happy to pay the additional rent of the improved unit and happy to be in an improved unit with, you know'",
        "'speaker_2': ', better heating, better kitchens, you know, not a leaky roof, no pests, whatever, whatever, whatever. But they're not going to have an opportunity to do that. So I think that's a big chunk that's missing from this plan. And then the other question I had is that I didn't see and maybe I didn't, you know, read it close enough'",
        "'speaker_2': ', but I didn't see that there was any time limit on these improvements. I mean, because they're there two months. Are there six months?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'In terms of the amount of time it takes to undertake the repairs.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean, what's how are we going to judge what's reasonable?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So once again, the program administrator would take in the capital improvement plan. They would render the judgments or the decisions about how much, you know, what's the appropriate rent increase based on the cost and the amortization, the interest rate, that kind of thing, whether or not permanent or temporary relocation was required based on the proposed improvements and'",
        "'speaker_9': 'the length of time that would be reasonable for undertaking the improvements. Those are all the kinds of factors that the program administrator would look at when determining what an approved capital improvement plan would look like.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Because I guess what I'd like to see in that is some provision where a tenant whose unit is being substantially rehabbed can have an opportunity to move back in. When those rehab and those rehab work is done, that rehab work is done, and it's not an excessive amount of time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean, we may have to quibble with, you know, how the relocation is handled, you know, because, you know, they're not they're technically relocating temporarily, but they're not relocating permanently. And I think that's kind of a big chunk that's missing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think it's a huge loophole that could be used to, you know, produce mass evictions. And that's, you know, that's kind of counterproductive to what we're trying to do here today. And I hope that I'm going quickly into my comments.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They're going to be really brief, and I'll listen to the rest of my colleagues. You know, I've heard from landlords that they want to make sure that this is an easy to understand process. I'm sure tenants would prefer that as well, although I haven't heard that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I'm really concerned that, you know, there's no standards in working. You're kind of asking us to take a leap of faith on how these things are going to be approved and the time length and how long people are going to be out of their houses.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's kind of where, you know, I stand on that one.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And the other member. Ashcroft.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So for clarification, we're still at Ms.. Potter's presentation asking clarifying questions, and then we'll come back to council deliberation. And I would prefer that just because I think we get the continuity of the of the report and some of the questions might be answered.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I've heard from members of the public that they would they would like us to let staff while we.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Were finished with these things and we were into questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes. I feel we're doing okay. Yes. On the capital. On the capital improvement plan portion of the presentation. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We were going to bifurcate the two issues so that we could finish one before we start the next.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, there are two separate votes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right? Right. So that was what we had agreed upon. Vice Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'My comment and I think Mr. already raises some good points and that's one of my reasons for of. Standing that this the termination of tenancy and relocation should be a mediated process because every case is different and you could have a large flat top 1960s building that when the roof is opened up, there's substantially more work that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'is needed than was anticipated. And to have all that sit in a hearing officer or program administrator at the city level, I think is a is a daunting task. And and if a tenant really does want to come back in, I think working out that temporary lodging for the tenant while the work is being done, I think'",
        "'speaker_4': 'depends on the case and depends on the relationship between the landlord and tenant. That's why I strongly believe in a mediated rather than a mandated approach. Or for this, I do think it's necessary to have a capital improvement plan if you're going to give no cause termination of tenancy so that it's real.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Because the problem was that people were being turned out and there were no permits taken. It was like, Well, yeah, I'll do it. But the eviction notices went up and I think there is some sort of protection in, in our limiting.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Limiting people to this particular activity by presenting a real plan that says that, yes, we are going to do this. We have our permits in place, we have tentative contracts, whatever, whatever those might be. But as far as the movements of the tenants, I think that's best mediated.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So staff the recommendation from staff to have the approval of the capital improvement plan be done by the program administrator was because there are technical aspects to the review and approval of the plan so that the expertize to to understand that the the reasonable cost of the proposed improvements to imputing the interest rate to the amortization over'",
        "'speaker_9': 'the 15 years to understanding whether or not it makes sense that tenants be relocated. Those are kind of more technical questions. So staff felt it was probably more appropriate to have the CIP process be handled by staff versus the rack who might not have that technical expertize.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But there is definitely a process where it will be done case by case each. Property owner who wants to come in and propose a capital improvement plan, that that owners plan will be evaluated on its merits and on its merits alone, so that decisions would be made on a case by case basis.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'A lunch spot you want to finish, right? Are you finished?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I said my piece.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. All right. I remember. Did you?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's my right hand. Thank you. Um. So, um. To Ms.. Potter. And I understand what the vice mayor is proposing. I would also be reluctant to have these items decided by the rack. I know we're starting a training program and that sort of thing, but I still I think we need to just see how well that body'",
        "'speaker_1': 'functions going forward. But what about, um, a mediator is we're going to use a mediator for some aspects of this. What about having these items go to a mediator instead who presumably would be informed of the technical aspects that need to be applied?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I you know, it could be a mediator. I think that we've been just proposing that it go to a staff person who would have the technical expertize. But if the council felt like there was something else that a mediator brought to the table in addition to the analysis of the technical documents, then we would you know, we'",
        "'speaker_9': 'could we could contract for that for that service. I don't think that that's I mean, that's certainly a possibility.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So remember day soccer. Remember Africa for you?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Finished for the moment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Because then I'm going to rotate.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah. We may go back over to thug.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Quick question on page a-1 item number for you reference, prime rate plus, I imagine you mean plus one percentage point. So. I think the issue there is if the interest rate that someone. It's for a project. Is above the prime rate.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'What you're saying is that. Only that portion that's mathematically within the prime rate. Is subject to being recovered by rent, is that what you're saying?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, we're proposing that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The prime rate plus one, and we essentially contacted a couple of commercial banks to understand what the interest rate was for, you know, loan renovation loans. And that's that's how we arrived at this formula.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Why a? Why don't you just say the interest rate that the person has.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Done so well for for 70 central? For example, if you ask the owner of that building, he'll tell you that he his interest rates on his balloon loan is like 10%. And I don't know that we really want to reward, you know, business decisions that might not necessarily make sense for the tenants and that kind of thing'",
        "'speaker_9': '. I think we felt like we should go and see if you go to a a standard commercial bank who does construction loans on multifamily property as a routine part of doing business, that that might be a good interest rate to use and that we might not want to encourage really high interest rates that are going to drive'",
        "'speaker_9': 'up the rents that you're going to have to charge to recover your cost. And then people aren't going to be able to continue to live there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So you think? That a landlord. Seeking renovations. That are perhaps in the million dollars is purposely going to go after higher interest rates?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'No, I'm just saying that it could happen. And that is the case that happened with 470 Central, which there was a proposal to evict all of the tenants to do substantial rehab. And he was proposing a doubling of rent because of the the financing that he had arranged for himself.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And. You know, maybe maybe that's not an appropriate financing structure and to undertake your substantial rehabilitation. So I think we were just looking for, well, kind of standard business.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Maybe number four should be rewritten to capture various possibilities as opposed to having this one. It just seems a little too. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Mayor Brody?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No, I mean.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, if you wanted to. Go ahead, I'll go after.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You. Okay. Thank you, Madam Mayor. So I'm kind of intrigued by the comments and that the vice mayor added, because I think he's right. These are probably all going to be unique, almost one off circumstances. And if we did, at least for the relocation and maybe just for the relocation at the tenant wants to come back and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'we can have some type of of mediation, you know, after a staff report or even semi-private mediation, because I'm not sure these are issues that should be now resolved out in like a public hearing, like the rec. I'm not sure if the rec can handle something like this, but, you know, some type of mediation on these particular'",
        "'speaker_2': 'this is kind of a small, smaller subset of all of the tenant protections we're trying to enact. So, you know, I'm kind of intrigued by that idea. And then if it you know, if it works and if our ordinance if we pass it, you know, has some struggles around the eviction area, you know, we at least have'",
        "'speaker_2': 'a model to look at and say whether or not that might work or not, because I was a little bit intrigued by it at the last meeting, not quite ready to vote for it. But, you know, I think this might be a good, good opportunity to I don't want to say experiment, but at least have kind of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'a trial or a pilot of that. And, you know, especially if somebody wants to come back, you know, if they want to come back, then there's a lot of issues like, you know, if you go off for six weeks and maybe your rent is the same, you know, maybe all you need is moving and maybe you don't'",
        "'speaker_2': 'need relocation and moving back. You know, if your rent is higher, you know, maybe there's some negotiation or some mediation. I mean, if you're in is lower or if you find a hotel and that's lower. I mean, there's a lot of, you know, combinations you can have to deal with that interim period.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So, I mean, I think that's kind of an intriguing idea.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So your what your if I can just rephrase back, what you're proposing is potentially a mediator who would handle the capital improvement plan for any particular project. And one of the things that they would be able to mediate would be the temporary relocation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Right. I mean, if a tenant wanted to leave. Okay, fine, cut the check it out. Go forward. But if they wanted to come back, you know, have, you know, whatever type and maybe not have a mandated relocation because the reality, you know what, if, you know, they just hypothetically they find a place that's cheaper, you know, and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the total cost of that place to live temporarily plus the cost of moving is actually less than they would have paid. I mean, granted, that's probably not likely, but it's possible, you know, then, you know, maybe they shouldn't have any relocation, but, you know, if they can if it's only two weeks and then they could put up'",
        "'speaker_2': 'in a hotel room and it could still come back, I mean, that might be something the landlords are willing to do. And plus, like I said, it gives us kind of an opportunity to try this out and pilot this idea of mediating evictions.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Can I go ahead? Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You want to jump in? I'll go ahead and let you jump in because. No, I have I have general comments. Where.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'General, go ahead. We'll come back. All right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I appreciate that, vice mayor. All right. Thank you. First of all, when I look at this, I see a housing provider being used instead of landlord, and I would prefer reuse in or to be consistent that everyone's okay with that in regards to staff versus semi-private mediator and actually some of these other things, can I ask'",
        "'speaker_0': 'staff, where did you find this? This is something that you were able to look at other other cities to see what they're doing or.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The basic outlines of the city. Yes, we did look at the city of Los Angeles, city of Berkeley, other jurisdictions that have capital improvement plans for substantial rehabilitation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And do they have a staff person?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes, they they typically have a hearing officer, which is a staff person. It's a little bit different than our model, which is where you have a contract hearing officer. Right. If you're not going to agree with with the decision.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Most cities with rent control have staff hiring officers.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So when I say so, I would think it would require some sort of expertize. Does this go through the planning department then?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Well, it would go it would go through the program administrator, whoever ultimately ends up administering the ordinance and the program, which I'm hoping would be the housing authority, and then they would hire staff with this expertize.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So the whomever is doing this would have to get permits through our planning department? That's correct. So why wouldn't this somehow connect to our planning department?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Well, it would that the permits would be the basis on which you would understand valuation and the length of time and that kind of thing. So there would be coordination.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The staff would already be getting the expertize from the staff, the current staff that issues the permits then. Is that is there more expertize than that needed in regards to the repairs or but sort of expertize is needed for a hearing officer versus a mediator.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Well, the here I believe that a mediator or a hearing officer could have the same skill sets. But essentially you want someone that is familiar with, you know, someone you know, familiar with construction and and the, you know, bidding process and what reasonable bids look like.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And when a property owner is telling you this is how long it takes to do the improvements, you want to know that they have a good sense of that idea, that they understand kind of imputing the interest rate to come up with the value to calculate the allowable rent increase.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. But that's to me a separate issue, the monetary part versus the part of how much time it takes to do the job. And I would actually think that that's going to be our planning department, that they're very familiar with what happens here in the city and how long it takes to do these different jobs.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That is true that the staff has familiarity. They don't typically weigh in or opine about the length of time if it takes one contract or six weeks to do something and another four weeks. You know, we don't really weigh in on on that, but they definitely have that knowledge.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So I don't I would think that there's some way to work with those people that already have that expertize, because I would not want to count on someone who's. Whomever a mediator is to just look at this like they look at all cities.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we have people here in our city, in our planning department, that are very familiar with the type of work, how much time it takes, that that sort of thing. So I'm not sure how how this really works.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Let me finish. Sorry. Okay. And then in regards to the interest rate and what you charge. I actually think it needs to be based on the real number of whatever the loan is that the average being financed from the.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Interest rate changes all the time. So the idea was to pick a formula so that if, you know, today this might be 3% in a year, it might be 6%. So the idea is to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But when they finance it, they're going to be getting, I think, a loan that has a set interest rate or or it would say that it's always going to be prime plus one or whatnot, whatever that is for.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Then I would think that that's the information that gets plugged into this formula because that's the real number. And I actually think that the landlord would be trying to get it financed at the best rate that they could.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And whatever that number is, is the number. And then in regards to nine A, if a tenant notifies the landlord, they want to pay a higher rent. Now that is language in here. So what a lot of staff thinks happens then.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Because it sounds so. So that is an option. The tenant can advise the housing provider, the landlord, within 30 days that they plan to remain in the unit and pay the increase.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So so in regards to what member already was saying, does the staff connect this? You have your tenant that does want to stay. They want to accept the higher rent.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Right. So as as this is drafted now, if they have notified the the landlord that they want to stay and pay the higher rent if they need to be relocated, that temporary relocation is available to them only in the event that there's a vacant unit on site that they can be temporarily relocated to.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And then they would move back into their renovated unit and they would pay the higher rent and they would go.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They would go forward.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'If there's no vacant unit as this is drafted, they would be permanently relocated.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So, so I would think that they should be there. So I don't know what the solution is, but I would think they should be able to come back. Just because a landlord doesn't does not have another unit available, right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Then they will eventually have that unit available. And if the tenant is agreeable to paying the increased rent, then I would think that that's reasonable that they should have. Right? So one should do the right of first.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So one criterion could be when evaluating the capital improvement plan is to hash out what that temporary relocation would look like, whether it was a vacant unit or being put up in a hotel, or if you can, you know, take a little bit of money and stay on your friend's house if it's, you know, a couple of'",
        "'speaker_9': 'weeks, that kind of thing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And probably right up to some Saturday, if it's going to take more than a certain number of days then.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And can I be clear that you're suggesting that that the landlord is responsible for relocating the tenant if there's no unit available? Are you just suggesting they have the right to come back if they're willing to pay the increased?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I was speaking about having them come back. However, I think this does include relocation assistance if they're not able to house them. Isn't that in here?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes. If they are, then here if there is not any any temporary relocation solution, then the proposal says that you would be permanently. The guidance says you would be permanently relocated and you would get relocation as.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To the same formula that reflected the oil. That's that's what's in here already.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean, in the real world, you know, for example, if you have mold remediation in the landlord responsible for putting up the tenant in some temporary lodging and, you know, the tenant does not have use of the premises which they have a valid lease for.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So they get compensated for loss of use. And then the landlord usually pays for some type of a temporary relocation. I mean, that's what happens in the real world when there's situations like this, like mold remediation, where it's just not the fault of the tenant at all.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then, I mean, there's is precedent for doing this, right.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And often often you're moved into a vacant unit that might not have the mold or you're put up in a hotel. That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I'm a swimmer.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Damn, that's what I wanted to circle back.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Well, I mean, you wouldn't. I'm. I'm thinking you're. You're suggesting that not only do they get relocation assistance that could be close to eight, $10,000, they get the relocation assistance and they have.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No one or they just want to.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Be closer to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'One or the other. Okay. Correct. You. So under this ordinance, they are they would receive the relocation assistance.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'If there's no unit available and they are permanently relocated.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Correct. However, as member already was speaking about what if you have this tenant that wants to pay the higher rent, they you know, they don't have there's not another unit available for them. What happens to that? And my preference would be that we do have an some sort of ability to have that same tenant return.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But but I would say the caveat would be that the repairs could be done in six months versus a year. I don't know. That doesn't make sense. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think this maybe ties back into what the vice mayor was raising, that this is this it's hard to speculate because every situation is going to be a little different. So maybe this really is I would favor this going in cases and I don't think every one will be like that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But in cases where people might want to come back and circumstances might be different, it might be even more of a negotiation, if you will, with a mediator or an arbitrator. But I would caution one thing about the length of repairs.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We happen to be homeowners of an old house, and it would be really difficult even going in signing a contract with a contractor. You always have to realize that there are things the suppliers you need might not come in on time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There's some delay for weather. And so I think we are we don't want to be tying our property owners hands inordinately. And that's why I agree with the mayor and Councilmember Desai on this interest rate. I mean, rather than some set formula and based on what the property owner at 470 Central did, and I know we all'",
        "'speaker_1': 'want to cast him as the boogie man, but we also have a policy that we want to see our old and decaying buildings improved. And if it takes a loan with the less than favorable interest rate to do that, why are we.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Why are we penalizing that that building owner for doing that? So as long as you could show the documentation, I don't see why we need to have a set formula in here that's a little too cookie cutter.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I should be vice mayor, and.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'll clarify my point. My point is that I wanted two things I wanted termination of tenancies and evictions is subject to mediation. And second, if you're going to do an eviction to do substantial renovation, you have to prove it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I think we can strip the rest away and still accomplish the protections that both sides need, though. And that's why I had that position of of and I strongly believe in in the mediation process. And I think at the point that I'm hearing, which I think is a good point, is a private mediation before it goes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'to the rack. I think is is time and money well spent. But the ordinance doesn't contemplate that. The ordinance looks at termination of tenancies and evictions as formulaic and mandated. So I think that's a problem. And that's why I voted no on the first time.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's why we're voting no on it again the second time. But I do I do think there's a place for mediation on the tenant landlord relationship there, and I'd strip this thing down the capital improvement land to subject to proof.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Do you have do you have permits? Do you have your financing? And the rest is as do it. And we're going to watch until you get it done. And no landlord is going to want to have their units empty while they're renovating the building.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They want to do it as fast as they can in the real world so that they can start getting the revenue back. So I'm thinking we're we're building this monster here. It's going to be impossible to administrate and it's going to hurt more people than it helps.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So member so I can.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Just weigh in on the rate. And one of the premises for me on this whole thing is to try to treat everyone equally, though, as much as possible. And, you know, I. You know, there's a comment about penalizing the landlord, but then you're also penalizing the tenant.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If the landlord has bad credit and or was only able to get financing, you know, at ten, 12, 15% or whatever it turns out to be. So I. Maybe there's some middle ground, but. And I just hate to hear the word penalize being thrown around like this is a penalty.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, then let's say let's not use the word penalty. Well, I guess it's just this is an interest rate that we're talking about imposing. I actually want to circle back to the vice mayor. So did you weigh in on this issue on the interest rate?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think it should be the real rate because whatever the bank will not lend at favorable rates on a building that's crappy.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that's correct. That that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Penalized the tenant for.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That. Well, no one tantalizes the tenant. It is. But nobody.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Is to bring the building up to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No more than the landlord's being penalized. It's the same when someone is, you know, the landlord will be paying it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The tenant will be going to use those words, throw those words around. We could throw them around on boats.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I don't think we are using the word penalty. Sorry, that's not use that word penalty. This is this is the interest rate that's being imposed.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'By the mayor. So were you sort of. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Member Did you want to any more.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean, nothing more than I already said.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So in regards to the interest rate, you know, what I'm hearing is that we would have to agree on principles and have this thing circle back again like we did before that. So should we look at that, for instance, the interest rate?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is there consensus that we would impose the actual interest rate?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'All I'm saying in terms of the interest rate is that I just felt that the way that number four is read, it's really hard and fast that it's going to be prime plus 1%. So if the interest rate is roughly 2 to 2 or 3% and well, and probably for a construction loan, that's not going to be'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that low. But let's just hypothetically say, if the interest rate if the prime rate was 7%, then. And the interest rate that would be subject to number four would be 8%. All I'm saying is that and that's the formula by which every you know, all the different possible reimbursements would be done.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But in the real world. Every property is different. And while there is the prime rate for purposes that people know, at least you know, what is the rate? The ultimate rate is subject to a variety of on the ground conditions and market factors.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's that. Instead of seven plus one, the real interest rate turns out to be maybe 8.5%. And then it's just that increment, which is a reasonable difference, is not captured in this. I think the reason why you created this is because of the situation where for 70 came in saying, you know, there they have a 10% rate'",
        "'speaker_3': '. I don't know if that if if that's true or not. I mean, I'm not sure what the what the going rates are for construction loans, for major rehabilitation loans. But, you know, I think I mean, if I had to look at 30 year mortgages, they must be going at around, what, 5% right now or so somewhere around'",
        "'speaker_3': 'there, or maybe even lower than that, -4.7. So. All I'm asking for is just a little bit more flexibility.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That's all I'm hearing that the council consensus is that when we come back with the policy, we would reflect the actual rate that's been approved as part of the submittal for the work.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's I think that's the consensus.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So we'll actually sell.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So here's my point, though. My point, though, is just in case someone does come up with this phony, which I don't I really don't practically see that happening.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I don't I don't see.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Someone actually these projects penciling out with, you know, a 15% interest rate.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And then without doubling the rent, I believe that project will be upside down. That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. I mean that everyone is acting in good faith.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. Landlords and tenants. That's really where we've been.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I mean, isn't this along the same lines as documenting the actual construction work? Rehabilitations just document. Just because someone comes in and tells you something, you don't have to do it. But but, you know, we require documentation. And I also agree with I think it was the vice mayor, but maybe it is.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilmember Brody said that these are the sorts of cases that are more appropriately handled in a semi-private setting of a mediation or an arbitration rather than in the rack. I think some sensitive situations like this and if, you know, if we were to consider when we talk about evictions, there might be some circumstances also, but we're not'",
        "'speaker_1': 'there right now.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And the proposal is to have this handled by staff, whether it's mediation or or a staff who's trained. And I think we're really looking to accomplish three things with the capital improvement plan, and that is to understand the cost of the capital improvement.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And then it rises to the level of eight times the rent, times the number of units, and that it is not repair and maintenance, but it's really to prolong the useful life, to set the proper rent increase that reflects the amortized cost of the investment and then to to determine the the relocation, whether it's permanent or temporary'",
        "'speaker_9': '. So those are really the three things that are intended to be achieved by the plan. And I don't know for us from staff, it feels like four pages is pretty, pretty succinct. But we can, you know, we that really is what we're trying to achieve with the policy.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Are those three key things, a mechanism for approving the work, for setting the the allowable rent increase and for resolving what the the relocation should look like.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So in regards to proceeding tonight. Am I hearing that this needs to come back with corrections and that it would be a semi-private mediator? Or is that something that staff would have as part of an administrative regulation? Does that need to be reflected here?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It's it's actually not reflect. I mean, it's the fact what's reflected here is that this would be handled by staff. But what? But who that staff is is not specified. And I think from our perspective, we would leave it to the program administrator to determine that the best qualified staff to handle this based on training and expertize'",
        "'speaker_9': '. But I'm hearing that the Council is very interested in somebody who is trained and versed in mediation, and that can be part of what is looked for in that skill set for the staff person. I think we're estimating when we looked at the program fees, perhaps 15 ships a year, maybe, you know, it's and we'll you know'",
        "'speaker_9': ', we'll see. But that gives us time to to really think about the kinds of skills and put something together where, you know, somebody somebody has the capacity to do this as well as other things.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Vice mayor.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think I understand that the and the way I break the two down is the CFP. The actual work that's being done, the valuation is, is a technical exercise. It's, it's, it's formulas. It's measuring against, against, against interest rates, against cost, etc..'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But the relocation side of it to me is, is a negotiation if we can separate those. To somehow in this and describe it better, at least it might be understandable.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And Brody.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. But just just a mediation on the relocation at the tenant wants to come back and how the temporary relocation would or would not be done. They want to leave. You know, we have a formula. Write the check.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Leave if they want to come back, willing to pay the rent, then that would be something to mediate. But not mediating the interest rate and.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'No, no, no.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'No, no, no.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's the formula.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I. And I. And I. I understand the distinction that's being requested. I'm not sure that it needs to be two separate people. There could be one person that could work with the tenant and the the owner to to get to the conclusion on everything.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But I understand and I'm hearing that the desire on the part of the council to have that mediated.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Any other comments on on the side on this part, the CFP.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we kind of have a recap on what we think.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I'm happy to do that if I'm that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So we will make that we will insert the eight words that I mentioned earlier as part of the definition of of a capital improvement. We are going to go back and have language on the interest rate being the actual rate of the loan that is secured.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Or the one on that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'For me.'",
        "'speaker_2': '4 to 1 on that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. And we are going to talk a little bit more on some guidance about whether or not the work that's being proposed actually triggers the need for relocation. So we will we can beef up that. We are going to talk about temporary relocation that we are going to have a process for discussing options for temporary relocation beyond'",
        "'speaker_9': 'just a vacant unit on site. And that that would be that would be negotiated or discussed. We are going to look at a cap on the temporary relocation so that, you know, six months, eight months, if the work takes longer, then it's going to be a permanent relocation with a payment of of the relocation fees.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So those were the items that that I had noted that the council would like to see when this comes back.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. You make comments member.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And is a question as far as timeline, when do you anticipate can move back?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I think that we would come back on April 5th and I would note that. Well, so the moratorium right now, I think the ordinance also says that you cannot evict, terminate for substantial rehabilitation until the CIP is adopted.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I believe that there won't be kind of any gap in coverage so that there wouldn't be evictions for a substantial rehabilitation without the CIP in place. So if we come back on the fifth, I think that would be timely and a resolution is effective immediately.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Because the ordinance would be it takes 30 days to become effective. Right. So this would become effective immediately. So then that that would work. And then the part about substituting the word landlord instead of housing provider.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I believe we actually did that on one of the versions. So we. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Any other comments from Council on this part?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Are we sure about the timing on that? Because that the moratorium is extended, we're extending it to.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But I believe the ordinance says that there aren't of.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Those things in the words.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yeah, it's in the or it's in the ordinance it's in the ordinance itself says that there there is you can't evict for substantial we have until the council has adopted the CIP.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That there. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Okay. So then we can move on to the second part of this agenda item appropriation of thank you.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And we appreciate the direction provided this evening program fee. So how to pay for the ordinance and the ordinance does need to be funded. I mean, this discussion we just had on the cap was a good example or an illustration of a component of the ordinance that will need to be enforced.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It needs to be funded and staffed to be successful. And staff's proposed funding mechanism is a program fee. We are proposing that a program be imposed on all housing providers, landlords on a per unit basis, and that one half of the fee can be passed on to the tenant and not calculated as part of the rent increase'",
        "'speaker_9': '. The 5% that would trigger the mandatory notification to the rack. We have been working closely, city staff has been working closely with housing authority staff to come up with with an estimated budget of what it would take to administer the ordinance as it stands at first reading.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The Housing Authority staff has been handling all of the public education and questions around the moratorium since November, so they have a good sense of the kinds of questions and what's involved they have put together. There were several flow charts that were in the staff report about how they think the process, the ordinance would be administered.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'They've come up with an estimated cost of 1.9 million annually, which is $129 a unit. However, by law, we are required to do a study to determine what the program fee would be. So we are not requesting that the council approve a program fee this evening, but that we get direction regarding the Council's willingness or desire to'",
        "'speaker_9': 'fund this program through a program fee. And then we'll come back at before July 1st with the actual results of the fee study. And we thought I showed this slide on the 16th. I'll just go quickly. But just if you assume a 50 unit property in Alameda with the average rent just over 2100 a month, and if'",
        "'speaker_9': 'we look at program fees for cities in the Bay Area, sampling of cities with rent control and add in the business license, you would see at 129 units a fee. Alameda is kind of in the bottom half of of the cities with business licenses as well as program fees.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So we feel like we would still be competitive as a place to to conduct, you know, business as a rental property owner. And then if the council is interested in where we sit just with our business license, you can also see once again, assuming a 50 unit property with an average rent of 20 $100, we are also'",
        "'speaker_9': 'in the bottom half just with our business license fee. So this these two slides are just kind of to show you that even if we were to adopt a program fee, we would still be kind of in the middle of the pack relative to the cost of conducting rental property and still residential rental property business in the'",
        "'speaker_9': 'city of Alameda. So what would the program fee be used for? It's you know, the biggest part of the fee is to administer the program. And that would range from scheduling and conducting rack hearings to coordinating all of the public education, to verifying that evictions are being done pursuant to the ordinance dealing with the CIP data collection'",
        "'speaker_9': 'for the binding hearing process. This fee. Presumes that we would contract out with hearing officers because that's not a full you know, there's not going to be hearings to justify a full time staff. The city attorney office would have a role to play because it would provide legal advice.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'When questions came up, if we were sued or we looked to enforce our ordinance, we would look to the city attorney's office to carry out those activities. And then staff's proposal is that the fee be part of the annual business license billing.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So the finance department would also have to bill for and collect the program fee, manage the database, you know, do collections, that kind of thing. So those are the components of the fee. And so as I mentioned tonight, we are we are tonight asking for an appropriation of funds in the amount of $300,000, $50,000 to conduct the'",
        "'speaker_9': 'fee study that would we would provide to the consultant all of the data that's been prepared to date. A consultant would work with us on the fee study. We would come back before July one because we're proposing that if the fee is adopted, it would be effective July one and run on the fiscal year and then an'",
        "'speaker_9': 'appropriation, the balance of the 300,000 that we're requesting to be appropriated. This is me this evening would be to fund the program through June 30th of this year. So that that is a request that we're looking for this evening.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'If later on tonight the council approves the ordinance on second reading, we are going to we will have an ordinance in 30 days and we're going to need a way to implement it. So we are going to need the appropriation for the general fund.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So. All right. Member Ashcroft.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm thank you, Madam Mayor. So, um, on the. The anticipated expenses, the one area where I would like to see some comparison done is on this. I think it was three full time equivalent equivalents in the legal staff.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I'm assuming you're meaning three full time equivalent attorneys as opposed to paralegals, or are.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'These two attorneys and one paralegal?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I would I would like to see a comparison of what it would cost us to outsource some of that work to a firm that does specialize in this area and also anticipated litigation. I mean, we probably may get some, but not every day, all day.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so do we really need an attorney sitting there waiting to defend, or is that something that we could outsource to a a specialist? Because bear in mind, we pay we pay benefits when we hire people full time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so we have to factor that into the costs. So I'd like to see a comparison of the two methods of staffing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Did you have any other comments? Remember Ashcroft vice mayor?'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Madame Mayor, may I respond to the council members Ashcroft's comments? Councilmember Ashcroft, We're thinking that this is a very conservative estimate of three full time FTE ees, and we're looking at that from a dollar perspective, not a body perspective.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think that your instincts are correct and that the city attorney, if she were here, would tell you that her intent would be to hire outside counsel as needed in the initial stages to see how this program works.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If we determine at a later time that there is a need for full time hired staff.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We would make that determination.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then there would be a job allocation, a job slot.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That would come to you, and we would do that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So hopefully those costs will be less. But as a conservative matter, we wanted to make sure that we had enough money to see the program through until the program fee was adopted.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. So if I understand correctly, you are contemplating outside counsel at the outset.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. And we and we get the three full time PhDs because we figure one would be an advice counsel to help educate landlords and tenants on the program supported by a paralegal and one litigator specializing in this area.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Vice Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think the reality is the $300,000 between now and June, we have to do the study and this has to be administered between now and then. So I think we should appropriate the money. We can always if it's not all spent or if something radical changes, we can always re re distribute them this appropriate.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'What's the right word.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'To put it back?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Unencumbered.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Unencumbered. So I have no problem with that. And I think this budget is is conservative as it should be. Although I can anticipate. Problems that would make this realistic. And I see that. Legal fees because this is a legal entanglement are 25% of the entire budget.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And to me that seems. Reasonable, given what we've constructed here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Brody So thank you for allowing me that clarifying question. This is just kind of my general comments, and I think it's fair that this is allocated equally between the landlord and the tenant. Hopefully when the fee study comes out, you know, we'll see that there may be some classes of tenancies that don't cost as much.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'For example, single family residents that are not subject to cost. The Hopkins are not going to ever go through the, you know, the hearing process or the finding the.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Binding hearing price.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's correct. So, I mean, I think there's some justification to say that the fee on those might be less. And if we ever adopt something like a model lease that may calm tensions, then, you know, in theory, that may be a situation where the fees might be less.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So hopefully when that study is completed, you know, we're given different options.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Remember Daisuke.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm of the opinion that the city of Alameda should. It, find the money with it within its own budget to run this program. So I don't support a study. I think we should make decisions that look into our own reserves or budgets and.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, I fundamentally I just think it's unfair that that that you're sticking this to especially the smaller mom and pop landlords. And I mean it's it's just seems unfair that and not only have this draconian project and then well here's the bill like I can't support the study on which is predicated any fees.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. So in regards to the B study, are they going to come back? They'll come back with what they estimate the cost will be. And then what will they look at? What is the proportion in it? I also have concerns about how much of this should.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Who should bear the costs of this. And I would like to see. I actually think the arbitration, if it goes beyond rack, should be somehow shared between the parties that require that next level. I think that we want to encourage settlement Iraq and that that would that would actually encourage meaningful participation at Iraq.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so so will they be looking at things, you know, things that may increase the cost? Because I think if the two parties don't have that, I'm going to call skin in the game and then everyone goes on to arbitration, then the costs will be extremely it could be extremely expensive.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I think at least I would like to see the parties pay at least 25% if they go on to that next level. I'm concerned about unlimited use of arbitration beyond Iraq because I really want the focus to be on meaningful participation in Iraq.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes. If I just can clarify the fees, not going to tell us who's going to pay fees. Going to the fee study is going to tell us how much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. But if they're assuming.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Our decision to decide so.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Then they must be making some assumptions of how many cases are going on to arbitration. And I see that as a what could be a very big cost.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So we assume 20 cases, which is $90,000, but we can certainly look at both. And that's why when we did the math, the fee was really the same for the the exempt and the nonexempt units because the 90,000 was a very small percentage.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But we can certainly when we get the fee study, if the counsel is asking us to look at pain, you know, a pain for a portion of the hearing officer process and or looking at a different fee, we can certainly do that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'When we come back with the analysis from the fee study, from the policy perspective.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And how many cases go to rack currently as you come up with the 20 cases that go to arbitration?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Well, that's the number. Just trying to make an educated guess.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Okay. So and it's 50,000 for that study. And then when it circles back, we would be able to see how to allocate the money. And I would agree that at least some of the money should come from the general fund, because I really think that this is not simply a landlord tenant issue.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think this is a community issue, and I think that is why we've gotten here at a council. And if it's a community issue, then at least some of it should come from the general fund, I would think.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we will have another opportunity to discuss who, if at all, should be paying for program fees or helping to underwrite this this the costs of these.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes, we it is useful for staff to get a sense at the council about whether it should be a fee that's required to be paid by the property owner with an opportunity to pass through a portion of the cost.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I hear some direction about it, potentially some of the general fund. We will look at all of that. It's helpful to have a sense not.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Knowing to interrupt you. I would say on this point, I think it's fair to say there is not consensus of the council. So you should look at the whole range.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So it will.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. And then I believe somewhere in these materials you look at what other jurisdictions charge for program fees, is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Right. We showed a slide on that. Yeah. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Member desk.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Of course, I have my qualms with the fees, but I'm just going to ask a question about the fees. The way that is structured is that it's it'll be potentially split $65 by the landowner landlord and $65 by the tenant.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And. Can the tenant write the check to City Hall instead of having once a year, instead of having the landlord have to pick it up so that it doesn't get included into the roll, into the rent. Because we want to keep the rent as low as possible and that the tenant understands that this is a program run'",

So to give you some background, we the city has an existing agreement with gyms on the course that's been in place since 2006.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So it's been operating. They're doing food and beverage at the Chuck Creek Golf Complex for the last ten years. That that agreement was a five year agreement. He extended his second his first option to renew for another five years.'",

And so therefore his current agreement expired just some of this December 2015 and he's now in a holding over clause month to month in his existing agreement.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The bit one of the biggest reasons that the city chose to start negotiating a new new terms was was the need for expanded food and beverage facility to accommodate golf tournament dinners. And we recognize the great work that Greenway Golf is doing in the expansion with the course and anticipated the increased need for food and beverage service'",
        "'speaker_9': 'out there. Specific agreement terms. This is a 15 year term with a ten year option to renew. All construction and renovation expenses are the responsibility of the concessionaire. Those I'll get into more detail in those in a minute.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But the basics it includes adding an enclosed patio for four golf tournament dinners and extend and expanded seating. It also includes exterior facade and a number of interior detailed interior renovations. Another big difference is that the concessionaire assumes utility costs.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Currently, the city pays all utility costs at for the food and beverage for the restaurant. And with the new terms, the concessionaire will assume responsibility for that. The concession fee payments to the city for years, one through six or 5% for years, seven through 25 through the remainder of the term is seven and a half percent.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'However, there's two years of concession fees that are waived once the enclosed patios, construction is constructed and occupancy permit is issued for the next two years. After that, the fees would be waived. The concessionaire must meet all standards of the agreement for the city to affirmatively renew the option, the tenure option.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Another thing is that the concessionaire in this agreement is required to hire a manager that is trained and solely focused on golf services, which is golf tournaments, the on course, food service and generally interaction with golf. And that person is to be trained by someone that on golf matters, by someone approved by the city.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I also want to point out that there's been discussion about lease agreement versus concession agreement. And one of the primary some of the primary things that make this concession agreement is that a lease agreement? Allows the operator to use property, the property as collateral for a loan to make improvements and use it as security.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And that's not the case here. It's a concession allowing for operations and. As we've just as I'll discuss in a minute Jim's in the course has shown sufficient financing capacity and doesn't need does not need the golf course restaurant as.'",

The concessionaire will pay 0.5 half percent of gross revenues into the golf course, into a golf course capital improvement fund, essentially a savings account to ensure that they're continuing to make improvements to the facility above and beyond what's required and stipulated by the agreement, those structural improvements.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So that money is put aside when in improvements, for example, replacing the roof needs to happen. Gyms in the course would come to the city to get authorization to use those funds to repair that roof. In addition, a big difference with this, with these agreement terms is that the concessionaire is responsible for all building and maintenance, including'",

What this is showing you is the past years, past three years of concession fee revenue to the city.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'So the city received a net revenue of 45,000. And with the anticipated revenue, because we are now transferring the utility cost over to gyms on the course, even with the five with a lower percent rate on the on gross revenues in year one and 2016 remaining at the same gross, assuming the same gross revenues as currently the'",
        "'speaker_9': 'annual net revenue to the city would be $61,750. What this is also showing you under anticipated revenue. So the years two and three, which I mentioned, there would be no concession fee for the first two years after the enclosed patio is built in years, 4 to 6.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We are anticipating after the enclosed patios built that we assumed an increase of 25% based on an expanded dinner menu. Expanded seating and golf tournaments. Now coming in means a higher gross revenue and thus net revenue coming to the city and that's 4 to 6 is still in the 5% gross revenue.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And then years seven through 25 moves to the seven and a half percent of gross revenue. So I also want to mention the total improvement value is anticipated to be $750,000. That's $500,000 for the enclosed patio construction and about actually 275.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So 250 to $275000 for the interior improvements. The city does retain this improved value on its property. And what we did is we used those numbers to do a financial review with Will Dan, which is a financial and economic consulting services group.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'They looked at the liquid assets, assets, as well as the line of credit available for gyms on the course and deemed it adequate for the scope of work for this agreement. And they based it on that $750,000 construction amount.'",

They also looked at the reported gross revenues and its within its within the standard expected range for full service restaurant and it's significantly higher than one attached to a golf course. It's common that restaurants attached to a golf course don't do as well as a standard restaurant because the attendants, the patrons come and go a'",

        "'speaker_9': 'They'll be adding new display cases a second register, more staff to increase as we expect the number of golf patrons to increase. That will increase the flow of folks through the snack bar. Also, significant improvements to the dining area windows, flooring tables, all of the treatments.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Other interior interior renovations required include the bar. The goal is to expand it and better define the bar area and include as shown new ceiling and modernize it. New lighting, new bar tables, new furniture. And then the intention is and what's in there is to do a bar patio as well, just outside the door that leads outside'",
        "'speaker_9': 'from the bar with pavers and umbrellas and outdoor patio heaters. And that's in addition to the enclosed patio. So moving on to the to the patio enclosure where you see before you, it doesn't show very well on the on the screen.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But the red L-shape is is the patio wrapping around the existing facility. This is a schematic showing that it would add banquet seating, style seating 180 folks for regular style seating 164 people. It could be. What's nice about this design is the enclosed patio could be utilized separately from the dining area, so it can essentially be closed'",
        "'speaker_9': 'off. So when there's a tournament dinner, it can be private in step. And in that enclosed patio area away from the regular dining patrons or the entire facility can be opened up to be used for for a larger event.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The city feels that it's a more functional use of the space than a separate banquet facility. Because it has that multi-use function, it can be separated and closed off for a private dinner, but it can also be opened up when it's really busy on Saturday and Sunday.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Brunches for additional seating for the restaurant as a whole. This patio enclosure concept was approved by the Golf Commission in July 2015, and Greenway Golf also approved it at that time. And that was the basis that we used to start moving forward with the negotiating of this agreement.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So the patio enclosure has full glass all the way around with accordion glass doors. It would keep the additional outdoor seating near the memorial and outside the bar door. So basically it adds capacity to the restaurant, but it keeps completely outdoor seating as well.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It wouldn't replace the outdoor seating with with the umbrellas that exists there now. The agreement requires the concessionaire to match the design style and color scheme that Greenway Golf plans for the facility as a whole for the clubhouse.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so we would expect Greenway Golf to work on those design styles and colors and then the city and then the city would work with as well with gyms in the course to make sure those are being matched.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And the agreement requires that the city approve all improvements. So we would be tracking that to make sure that we want it to look like one cohesive facility, not like two separate facilities. So for some renderings, these are renderings of the the planned enclosed patio.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It has a fully retractable roof, which would lead to more, you know, a nice days, which we have many of them here in Alameda would would be. You could have that open air feeling. The accordion glass doors could open and close.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The roof could open and close. And so they're fully weatherproof. So on a rainy day, you can completely enclose it. And it would have heating for the colder days, but it can also be opened up to to to allow the nice Alameda air and sun to to shine.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And as shown here, will still include what you see to the right. It will still have the outside. For those who just want to be completely outside with some with umbrellas, it will have that as well. This is another view showing that with the tempered glass doors there would be full views of the golf course.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And the goal and the vision of this improvement is to create a facility that's casually elegant and comfortable for golfers and non golfers alike. And one of the reasons. Well. And one thing, as I mentioned, what we're planning on what the plan is, is to some sample tournament dinners.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Gyms in the course already provides tournament dinners with a number of these type dinner packages. He will be expanding dinner for the community as a whole, as well as working with Greenway to to work out dinner sample dinner menus that they're interested in.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'He always works with individual tournament folks hosting tournaments on what types of menus they like to see. I've seen a range of food that he's provided out there. So with that, a couple other points I want to hit.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'One is the process. If this concession agreement is not approved, then what the next steps would be, because that's been a question that's been asked by the community. And so if this concession agreement's not approved, then the city has in our lease agreement with Greenway Golf.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Greenway Golf has first right of refusal. So the city would then enter into negotiations for food and beverage services with Greenway Golf and would bring that agreement then to council. Or they could choose to waive their first right of refusal if they waive their first right or refusal, or if for some reason council didn't agree and voted'",
        "'speaker_9': 'down the terms with the city, came to Greenway Golf then and opened, and only then would an open public RFP take place. So that's the process and steps that would occur. Gyms is a well-established Alameda restaurant. He was ten years at the golf course, 55 to 60 years on Lincoln Avenue, and they really give back to the'",
        "'speaker_9': 'community. I think you may hear from some folks the the youth and the women's club. In the men's club, he's he's often he does what he can to help support those organizations. And he's shown that over time. In addition, I met today with the Golf Commission.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'They and the Golf Commission recommended that the city extend Jim's on the course existing concession agreement for six months and bring back to the next Golf Commission meeting on April 12th, 2016. A revised, revised agreement terms with Jim's on the course that was discussed and agreed upon with Greenway Golf.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So essentially what their recommendation today was, they all expressed solid support for Jim's on the course as a concessionaire at the golf course, and they asked that Greenway Golf and Jim's in the course work on the terms to ensure that it incorporates Greenway Golf as golf's feedback.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I mentioned previously that since July in July 2015, the Golf Commission approved the enclosed patio concept. And what I told them at that time is with this approval, we were going to move forward. I would move forward in negotiations with gyms on the course.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so I have been in negotiations actively with the owner, Tom Jericho, since that time. I have been in discussions with Greenway Golf to the extent legally allowed to keep them as well apprized as I could on on how that was moving forward.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We try to include their needs and their requests as feasible things such as making sure that, you know, everything is is a comprehensive look and feel to the course. I do want to remind this is an agreement between the city and Gemma's on the course.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It's not a three way agreement, but it's between Jim's and the course. And city staff feels. I feel this agreement before you best represents the needs of the city, the revenue it will bring to the city, which goes into the golf fund, which then goes back into the golf course for improvements such as the front gateway that'",
        "'speaker_9': 'we've all been waiting to prove for a very long time. It would go back into resurfacing the parking lot, so any increase to revenue to the golf fund will be put back into the golf course. The city feels jammed on the course is a proven partner.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'He's had increasing revenues. Overall for the last ten years. A strong service to the community and proven reputation. Alameda. So with that, I. Conclude my presentation and I'm open to any questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Any clarifying questions from Council member Ashcraft?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Ms. Wooldridge. I have just a couple on the slide show. You just showed us the renderings. Who prepared this?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Gyms on the course. Architect. I'd have to bring him up to get the exact name of the architect.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we get an eight.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You want the name of the architect that you're asking?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I did. Who did the rendering?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You come up?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I know.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Happens. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Believing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You can introduce your guests. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The microphone may be just a bit taller.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Madam Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Members of the city council. My name is Tom Nicos. I'm the owner of Jim's coffee shop.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And Jim's on the course. I guess I'm here to answer questions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I just wanted to know the name of the entity that did the.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'MLB MLB design.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'M l de design.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'M l p d d.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'M l d.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'L the design. And so have this been submitted to the Planning Board for design review or what stage are we in?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I can. Right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Let's go back to staff, please. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yeah, thank you for the reminder. So any. No, it's still in concept. And the enclosed patio. The agreement requires that the enclosed patio be the detailed design be approved by the Golf Commission, as well as approved by the planning board.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's my only question on the renderings. And one other question has to do with the, um, I believe you said in your presentation that you wanted to, um, we wanted to expand the service at gyms to, um, also serve dinner.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I'm just looking at exhibit one, the concession agreement, and on page ten, paragraph 7.0, 2 hours. It says concessionaires business operations that the premises shall be open for breakfast and lunch each day of the year, that the golf complex is open.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I don't see a reference to dinner.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The breakfast and lunch is what's been done, and that's a minimum requirement.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So how do we require dinner if it's not in the concession agreement?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We could add it if we want to require. Um.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Did I not hear you mention that in the presentation?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes, you did. The intention is to add dinner were especially with tournament dinners and to serve tournaments, and the minimum is certainly breakfast and lunch. But he will be adding dinner. All right.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Just to add to what Amy just said. Ever since we've been there, winner, ten years at the golf course now and our hours of operation have always been 6 a.m. until roughly 8:30 p.m. in the kitchen and around ten or 11 p.m. at the bar.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's been consistent throughout the whole time we've been there for the last ten years. So even though it doesn't say in our agreement that we should serve dinner.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We always have.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But because due to the limitation of the of the kitchen facilities.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We're just limited as to what type of dinners.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We can serve. So now that we have a little more kitchen space, we're doing much more dinners. And. Oh.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you. All right. Questions of member out for you. Finished? All right, Vice Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'A couple of questions and I'd like to ask the city attorney again to repeat the difference between a lease and a concession agreement so that everybody is clear about this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hmm. Go ahead and take your seat at this point.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You think?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor. Matter. I see this concession agreement that's before you differs from a lease in several legally significant aspects of first a concession. I think first and foremost, a concession agreement does not grant any interest in the property.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'As you know, a lease granted leasehold interest in the property which can then be used to secure mortgages. And Ms. Woodridge spoke to the fact that this lease would not allow that. Also this concession agreement provides that it grants a concession in licensed gyms to the right to operate the facility for food and beverage operation.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That is all. The concession agreement does not also doesn't have those typical types of terms that you find in a lease agreement. There's no obligation to pay rent. There's no obligation for the concessionaire to be responsible for the interest tax, i.e., that leasehold interest that they would have if they had a true lease.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Similarly, as Mr. Aldridge alluded to before, there are limitations on being able.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'To use the property in any way.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To finance.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The improvements that have been discussed here earlier. Thank you. And my second question and this maybe Ms.. Roach can answer is, has there been a value assigned to the maintenance and repair costs based on what the city's maintenance and repair costs have been for the building?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Well, honestly, the city has not put any any repair into that building since the ten years that the gym's on the course has been in there. So I and I, I don't have a specific dollar amount for you.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Councilmember matter. I say my apologies, but it's really looking at a 4050 year old building and needing to coming down the pike will be relatively soon. The roof and the HVAC and it's easily 50, $60,000 with the repairs coming up in the next 3 to 5 years.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that liability has shifted completely from the city to the concessionaire by this agreement.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And Brody.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Just a couple quick questions firm as well. Rich, the the two party agreement, if I recall what you said, correct?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then under our charter, what body has the authorization to give you direction to negotiate price in terms. That. That's the counsel, I understand. Correct.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilmember Ody, who has the authority to give staff the ability to direct or to direct staff to negotiate pricing terms?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That would be you, the council.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. And if I'm correct, then we have given you that authority previously. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'In closed session. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. That's all. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Remember, these are.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Just a clarifying question. Earlier you mentioned a standard. I don't know if it's. Concession revenues per round. And you mentioned that it was $5 per round or something. A golf course that generates 500, 500,000 rounds a year. So.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So my math is that. The revenues per rounds for the entity we're dealing with is pretty, pretty much higher. And and that fact that standard.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That's correct. So the standard is $5 per round for for food and beverage services at a golf course. It's a good average for a golf course. Rounds is 100,000 rounds at that. That's assuming $500,000 per year is 100,000 rounds, $500.'",
        "'speaker_9': '$500,000 per year is a baseline for food and beverage concessions at a golf course.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. All right. Actually, what I was trying to finagle was. I'm trying to do the precisely get get what our rounds per round is at. But, but it's I have them estimates, but all my estimates are I don't know if that's confidential information by the way, but you did mention what the the revenue figures.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The revenues, public records in this last year. It was a 1.235 million. I don't have a top of my head the exact number of rounds for that same fiscal year.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Are any of the clarifying questions at this point council? We do have speakers. I'm going to go ahead and call the speakers at this point. You have ten. If you would like to speak on this item, please turn on your speaker slip.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And it'll be Peter Fletcher and then Ken Campbell. Beverley Blatt. And this will be 3 minutes each. And then Pam Curtis, then Jane Southwold.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Madam Mayor and members of the council. I'm Peter Fletcher, a lifelong resident of Alameda and a long time real estate broker. I'd like to speak in favor of the concession agreement that the city has drawn up with Tom G.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And she and Nikos, the owner of both Jim's Diner and the concessionaire of Jim's, on the course, which you'll be dealing with tonight and hopefully renewing this agreement at this meeting. Tom and Jim's Home Style Diner have been one of the longest continuing running, continuously running businesses in Alameda and has been the concessionaire at Jim's on the'",
        "'speaker_8': 'course for some ten years. I have known Tom for at least 12 years and have had many business dealings with him. Tom has been honest, trustworthy, fair and generous in every one of these dealings. I currently help run the monthly marketing meetings for the Alameda Association of Realtors and Gyms on the course has been our venue for'",
        "'speaker_8': 'nearly seven years. They have always delivered excellent service and provided delicious meals at very fair prices throughout the entire time. Longtime Alameda owned businesses need to be supported by our city. We are seeing lots of new growth in our little town and as we grow, we need to be careful not to lose those time tested businesses that'",
        "'speaker_8': 'have stayed the course and delivered good service and products to our community. Please vote yes to sign the new concessionaire agreement with DOMA Inc, better known as Jim's on the course and give them the opportunity to refurbish the building and to continue to serve us in the future.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Ken Campbell and then Beverly Black.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Mayor Council. My name is Ken Campbell and I'm a principal owner.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'In Greenway Golf.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The current golf tenant for the city of Alameda. And I first want to say that we're in support of the existing operator, Jim's and Tom. He's been excellent to work with. We do have some thoughts that we wanted to share and we've been sharing those with the Golf Commission earlier today.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Currently, we you know, when you look at the long term agreement that's being proposed, we're going to be married to the restaurant operator for a long time. Both parties are. So we feel it's important that there's as much clarity as possible within the existing proposed agreement.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We've been working to try to address these, but we feel that due to some of the privileged information, we weren't able to see a lot of the context of the agreement until it became public record. Our concern is not so much Tom and Jim's as the operators, much as that we feel that there's a lack of clarity'",
        "'speaker_5': 'in the current proposed agreement. We provided you some of the bullets, but we believe that on the context of the exterior patio, we did endorse the general concept of that. It was on the Golf.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Commission agenda in.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'July, but we did it under the context that we wanted to see more conceptual drawings and more detail, and we did not have that opportunity until the.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Agenda packet was released for this.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Meeting tonight. We feel that there's some ongoing concerns that still need to be addressed, being that it's a long term agreement. We want to get this right with you guys too. And with the partnership with what Jim's on the on the course, we believe that there needs to be better clarity with some of the common area maintenance'",
        "'speaker_5': '. There's no reference to on course convenience carts, which is an integral part of golf course services that we feel needs to be addressed, as well as what the defined services would be for food and beverage at the practice range in the par three.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'As you're probably aware, our company is making a sizable investment into the property over the long term, and we just want to work together with the partnership of the restaurant to make sure that we have the services that everyone wants within the community, and we feel like there's still more work that needs to be done on that'",
        "'speaker_5': '. As I said, we're supportive, but we feel that there's needs to be a little bit more addressing of the encore snack bars. There's one on the north course that's in disrepair, as everyone knows that the golf course, the clubhouse, the restaurants all have been neglected for many years.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we want to make sure that that's clarified in the agreement. Currently, there's nothing in there that requires anything to be done to the North Core Snack bar or what may be done in the future. And we feel like that needs to be addressed as well.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We're asking that you follow the recommendation of the Golf Commission and give us a little bit more time to have some real work sessions. We feel like we've had good dialog with Tom and the operations there and we feel that we can get these items addressed.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Now that we're privileged to all the information we feel that we can sit down and go through these concerns through a work session. We value the community input that we had and went through the process when we were doing the golf golf course proposal.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It helped provide the clarity because at the end of the day, it's not our vision. It's the community's vision that we want to see happen out there. So our position is, if you please look at what your golf commissions asked and give us just a little bit more time before you approve this tonight.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Beverly Black and then Pam Curtis. And then Jane sold.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, good evening. Good evening, council members. I'm Beverly Blood. I'm chair of the Golf Commission. And I just wanted to.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Give you a quick summary of of.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'What went on this afternoon. Mayor Spencer was there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But the others of you were not. I think that we had.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'On quite short notice.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Quite a few.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Members of the Gulf community.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Present all expressed complete enthusiasm for maintaining.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Chimps.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'On the course and also.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'How much they appreciate what Greenway.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Has.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Done so far.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And what we expect further from them. The as Ken just said.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The issues that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Came up were.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Because.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Of the process.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Amy Wooldridge was negotiating the lease and they.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In their conversations with with Tom, thought that certain things would be included and when the final product was out they didn't see them. So what we were asking for.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Is just the time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To work out all these details.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Everybody's in favor of.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Maintaining the relationship with the concessionaire. It's just that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We want to make sure that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Everybody's happy. Thank you. Yeah. I'm Curtis. And then Jane saw Walt. And then Joe Van Winkle. Winkle.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Mayor Spencer, members of the city council. I'm Pam Curtis.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I'm a resident of Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And a golfer. I am not here to speak in opposition, Jim, on the course.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I am here to get some facts.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I want the best restaurant banquet facility for the golf course and for the city. I don't want to say 15 years from now that I supported the wrong group.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I need some questions answered.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And people have been talking about them. How much money has Tom agreed to put into the new facility? Is he trying to get. Bye bye. Spending as little as possible? Or is he willing to support a first class banquet facility that will accommodate a couple of hundred people for tournaments, weddings, and other special events?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'These are questions that I need to know the answers to. I want the Check Creek, a golf complex, to have a first class banquet restaurant facility to go with its first class golf course. I want a restaurant that I'm proud to take my out of city guests to.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Please don't rush this action through. Make sure all the details are worked out before voting. A 25 year contract.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Can be a win.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Win, but it does not come with that guarantee. Please make sure all necessary t's are crossed and I's are dotted to avoid unnecessary surprises. We want a first class complex. That will meet the needs of our citizens. And that includes a first class restaurant banquet facility.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you, Jane. So, Sobel. Then Joe Van Winkle and then Kathleen Thoms. Then. Good evening. I'm Jane Saul Wald. I'm the former chair of the Gulf Commission, and I was actively involved with the process by which we selected Greenway.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Matches that outstanding.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Golf course.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That we anticipate seeing. Plus, Greenway is ready.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To jump in and work on the other golf.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Course as soon as the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'First one's done. It's going to be a fabulous facility. Let's make sure we have a restaurant to match. As was pointed out, unfortunately not.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'By.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Ms. Wooldridge, but by others.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There was a.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Very extensive and lengthy meeting.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This afternoon at which a lot of.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'These issues.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Were discussed.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And it's correct, no one was against gyms on the course having a lease. It's just let's.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Iron out the details and make sure the lease that they sign.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Covers all of the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Aspects of the agreement before you sign it.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So the solution that was.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Proposed by the Golf Commission that I very much urge you to take.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Is for.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sake of Tom's.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Peace of mind, extend his current.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Lease for six months, but make it mandatory that there be negotiations between Greenway and.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Jim's on the course to work.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Out all these details that are still unsettled and have that done by April 12th, which is what the Golf Commission asked you to do. I urge you to do that because the.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Last thing we want is to enter into.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'A 25 year lease and then find out that the agreement or the.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Facility.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Improvement that's being proposed by.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Jim's on the course is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Not really what we want and not really something that would.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Measure up to a world class golf facility that we're building.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That takes some time. There's no urgency for this.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'There's no reason.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That you have to give him a.'",
        "'speaker_0': '25 year lease tonight. You can do it a couple of months down the road once these details are ironed out. Now, the last point I want to just make is, although I'm a lawyer, I haven't done any.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Legal research on the difference between a lease.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And a concession agreement. But what our assistant city attorney pointed out, I think, is makes this that this is maybe not a concession agreement after all.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Remember, he pointed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Out that in a lease.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The lease holder.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Has to pay taxes.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Or a possessive rate.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'On possessor interest tax. Well, I urge you to look at Section.'",
        "'speaker_0': '4.05 of the proposed lease that has the concessionaire paying.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Exactly those taxes, which our assistant city attorney told us.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Earlier in.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The evening.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Makes this a lease.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And not a concession agreement. That's, again, one of the details that you need to look at, make sure it's ironed out before you go forward. So I urge you.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'To.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Accept the.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Golf Commission's recommendation, do a six year extension of the current contract.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'Go forward with the 25 year.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Agreement. Thank you, Joe Van Winkle. And then Kathleen.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Madam Mayor, council members and staff. The process broke down. But since today's word is praise, I'm going to praise the golf commission. The Golf Commission heard about this concept back in July, but then it was radio silence from then on.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And then they noticed that it came up on your city council agenda tonight. So they jumped in and they held an emergency meeting today. Now, it's pretty unprecedented, I think, to shove the golf commission meeting right before the council meeting so you can get some input.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But they got it. A lot of people showed up. There were more than 30 people there and they brought up lots of points of concern. 19 by my count, as I was trying to get them far too many to enumerate here in 3 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And some very serious points. So they were unwilling to support a 25 year commitment, yet they had a sense of urgency that something needed to be done. And they also recognized the lack of clarity that needed to be resolved.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The Golf Commission realized no amendments made by you tonight will fix that. So they did their job and they made a unanimous recommendation for the city to pause, allow gyms on the course in Greenway to work closely together, bring them back in early April, and most importantly, allow for the public to have their input, the public to'",
        "'speaker_8': 'see some drawings, the public to review the details. You should support the Golf Commission. They are a vital part of the city's management structure. They are the only group chartered and fully focused on the golf course. You've got rent control and bike paths and all sorts of other things to worry about.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You've got staff doing two jobs the last several months. I urge you to praise the Golf Commission to acknowledge their recommendation and to give them the time to clarify this. And that other point that Jane raised about the lease versus the agreement, because as I'm sure you'll know, the lease requirement in the city charter is for four'",
        "'speaker_8': 'votes. And I'd like you to be compliant. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Kathleen. So Sampson and then Peter. Yes, you may.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'All right. I'm the heart of the relationship high. And Peter's the lawyer.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You could use the mic, please.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'One of the first people we met in the city was Marilyn. We've lived in a lot of places. We've been to a lot of restaurants. And this was the first place that we went to. And I came home from the hospital for surgery recently.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It was the first place that we went to. I came home, that airplane in the city. We could have gone anywhere. This is the first place that we came to. I think of Cheers. My husband's lived in 26 places around the world, and this is like cheers.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I love the fact that it's not perfect. The imperfection of it is what I think is charming. I love tobacco, but there's something charming about this place. There's something about the fact that it doesn't open our drain our wallets.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We go there at least three times a week from six in the morning till ten at night. I don't care if it's not perfect. Imperfection to me is perfect. So I hope that I don't know the numbers or anything.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But we love this place. We love Tom. We love every Greek in the place and every Spanish person and everybody they hire. We love the place. Now, Peter will probably make it more business. I talk from the heart.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well we I think we are the.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Representatives of the non golfing customers of Jim's on the course and I'm sure there are quite a few. I think there's a great potential there.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'To increase the visibility of the facility to attract people who.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Are nearby and I think.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They just don't know about it. I'm amazed he doesn't know about it if they don't have to play golf.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I think they should promote that side of it. I have read the agreement. I have looked at the proposal. I think it's very exciting and I hope that one way or another you get to move ahead with it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I'm just going to give you my card if you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Just because I'm leaving early, because I do have a health issue.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you. Next, speakers, Norma Aunor. And then I'll be Little Arnold. And then Richard Waxman. Norma.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Honorable mayor and members of the city council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'For the mike down. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Stand back.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Pull it down there. Perfect.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I can hear you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm ale. I emailed some of this to the council so you're aware of it, but I'd like public to have a little input on it. And I want to give you a little history of golf course restaurants. I have been very active at the Chuck Greca Golf Complex.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's 1968, served as president of the Women's Club, appointed to the Golf Commission by Merrick Chuck Krieger as the first woman to ever serve. And I am presently president of the Alameda Junior Golf Club, and I spent countless hours at the golf complex.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'In a nationwide survey. The results showed that municipal golf course restaurants do not fare well and they do not make a profit. Over the years, our many restaurants at the golf complex have come and gone. None have ever had the great success that gyms has today.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This problem actually goes back to 1927 when the course opened. The minutes show that from the very beginning that the city had problems with the restaurant. And it has continued over the years. One of the main. One of the main.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Oh, oh, I'm sorry. Over the years are many restaurants at the golf complex have come and gone. None have ever had the great success that Jim's has today. This problem, actually. Well, I think I read all three. One of the main reasons for the failure of past restaurants is the owners spent more time playing golf on the'",
        "'speaker_6': 'course. Jim's restaurant on Lincoln Avenue has been a family owned business and tradition in Alameda since 1960, and now they are having the same success with Jim's on the course. They are not golfers, but our business people tending to their business and the people they serve.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Check the city records and you will find that when golf was down, gyms on the course feature, the city was going up each year and still is. The anarchist family has always worked well with met with all the many clubs at the course and are experienced in providing elegant banquet or casual affairs and are able to keep'",
        "'speaker_6': 'the prices reasonable with the present plans to expand the restaurant. It will be win win for the city and. We will get more tournaments to use our facilities as golfers would rather stay off the course they play to hold their awards.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'At the present, we lose many tournaments to other facilities that have come that have room for functions following golf. You know, my husband put that three minute rule in when he was on the city council. And I don't like it right now.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm trying to finish up as fast as I can.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Be sure to tell him that, Norman.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If you were to go out for bid, you would naturally have many bidders that would promise you the moon to take over a successful operation. I guarantee that you would never get anyone that has too many years of experience, success, and caring for Alameda and the customers they serve as the great Orcas family.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'When Greenway finishes the new Jack Clark course and the restaurant expands, Alameda will be a destination for golfers. Even without the remodel, golfers and families are now still enjoying the present restaurant. My intentions. Over the many years, I have always been for the good of the golf complex and for the city I love.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There is no reason not to renew the contract with gyms on the course. Their second. Their record speaks for itself. I strongly recommend that you unanimously approved the contract as presented. The city staff have done their homework and have put together a contract.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That will be a great it will be great for the golfers, the public and for the city of Alameda. And I have quite a few pages here of people that have signed in favor of the restaurant.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, little arch. Lil, your turn. And then Richard Waxman and then George something.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you very much. I. Didn't quite get what my wife said there, but it must have been funny about me. And we now will be married 66 years and 67 coming up in November. But I don't know that I don't know if we're going to make it after tonight.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I really don't. She put her foot in a hole. So with that much said. No wonder you're a mayor because you beat me to the punch line tonight. I don't think I'm being time for this. You did? Because on behalf of the mayor of Alameda and the council members up there, you did a wonderful thing for Liz'",
        "'speaker_5': '. Warmer damn here at this evening. And speaking for myself and friends who have been here in city government since 1952, I'm going to say this unequivocally. I have known many, many mayors. Citizen, city manager, city managers, council members, you name them.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I've known them all. There have been some wonderful ones. There have been some lousy ones. But I want to tell you this in all honesty, she stepped into some deep shoes when John Russo left, and she just did a marvelous job.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The city staff loves her. The people love her. It's been almost one year since you've taken over. We're sorry to see you go. But we will welcome the new city manager on board next week annually with a city in good hands.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Congratulations.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In regards to the reason I'm here. I have a book here, which is one of two books. The only ones in existence next to the Bible. Laura, your city clerk is dying to get into them. There are so many contradictions between the ordinances that she has on the golf commission and the concessionaires that are so different.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And if you will bear with me a few minutes, not even at I very seldom speak from prepared notes, but I have to to keep my facts in order. The very first. Commission meeting of the golf course was held on October 28, 1925, in the office of the City Manager.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In October six of 1926, construction of the clubhouse was given out with 11 bidders. That should be a four mile clubhouse or not event drive, which we all go to in order to price, came in at $10,870 to build the Grand Pavilion.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The dedication of the clubhouse took place on Friday, May 27, 1927. Now. The Golf Commission was integrated into the RPG with the Recreation Commission at that time in 1954 until 1985. Those are the era that I served from 53 to 86.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I worked with the pros out there are all Frye, Max, McMurry, you name them. I work with them. I also work with the concessionaires. We had five concessionaires during our brief arrangement with the Recreation and Parks Department after 1985, and I reverted back to the Golf Commission.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'To the best of our research, which have gone back almost 90 years, there have been a total of 14 to 16 concessionaires during 90 years of operation. Most of the contractors did not very well, and nine of them did not have their options removed.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It is a very difficult business also. To the best of our knowledge, Gemma's along the course has a general enviable distinction of being the longest concessionaire at ten years and three months. Gems has consistently increased city revenues each year.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There were record is impeccable, as is the restaurant on Lincoln Avenue, which is the second oldest in Alameda at over 60 years. Next to all these. But since his arrival here, George Kelly and Greenway Golf Operations have also performed brilliantly, redoing the classic Par three.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The renaming of the Jack Clark, the remake of the Jack Clark's Al Gore, and many of the other amenities he has brought to the complex. He does a remarkable job with the two courses par three and driving range.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'George is to be commended and I have great respect for George Kelly. However, Jim's under the leadership of the Iraqis family, has done equally as well and deserves the type of superlative that I give Greenway. They both perform excellently well at what they do.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Kelly In the golf business, Jim's on the course in a concession. Better. This issue has been on the back burner for three years and has taken immeasurable time off city staff and department heads. Staff reports cost time and money, as you can see tonight.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Quite frankly, I believe that the council has more serious issues to address. Like rent control, Alameda Point, Central Avenue, bike lanes, Marina Village, Del Monte Properties and others too numerous to mention. This should actually be at the bottom of the ladder.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'James is a fact. They have a minimum. What I like about Jim's is we go out to at least 2 to 4 times a week at breakfast. They have a minimum of 25 to 40 employees, nearly 90%, which are students, of which 80% are minorities that are in college working their way through.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They are local people getting local money, doing local things. And in closing, I have two final paragraphs. It is my hope and desire and those of many people I know that both gems on the court and Greenway Golf can each work within their God given talent to make the golf career of golf complex a jewel for the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'city of Alameda. And I am strongly recommending the staff report be accepted and a unanimous vote entailed that will continue the operation the way it is. I'm not going to use that trite phrase. If it's not broken, don't fix it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But I will give you one that I use a lot. 20 years ago. Last week. Last month. The most recognized brand in the world in China, Australia and Russia. The United States is Coca-Cola, number one. Without a doubt.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Nike, all of them second best. Hey, you know what a guy did that they brought in from South America 20 years ago? He says, I'm going to change the taste of coke. Well, bring in a new no new taste.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'He brought it in. All right. He cost Coca Cola $1.2 billion. So, ladies and gentlemen, you're the all good party up there tonight. I have sat where you have sat. You have difficult decisions. To me, this is a no brainer.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Let Jims do his work at the concessionaire and let George Kelly do his work there. And hopefully everything will fit like a glove. I want to thank you for giving me the time to express not all my views, but those of many other.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Which Richard Waxman.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hi, my name is Richard Waxman. And I'm Tom Jericho's attorney. And I've been working with Amy and several other people at the city of Alameda for a number of months and negotiating the terms of this new contract for the concession at the golf course.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I believe that the terms of that agreement are very detailed. It's not unusual for some lease type provisions to be in a concession agreement, such as property taxes, because the city of Alameda wanted Tom to take responsibility for those costs.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so that's why there's that provision is in there. It doesn't change the fact that that is a it is a concession agreement. It's not a leasehold interest in the premises. And it's very clear in that agreement on the terms and conditions.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Now, if there are some issues that need further clarification, I know that Tom would be more than willing to sit down with Amy and the other people at the city of Alameda to try to work those things out.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'He has cooperated in every respect to provide financial information, to get a line of credit with his bank, and to take all necessary steps to meet the requirements to make sure that the city of Alameda is comfortable with moving forward with a new contract with Tom.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I believe it is a very good contract and it is fair for both sides. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker Jorge s e f s t h h iou. And then Doug Duncan and then Tom and our last speaker. Speaker Cheryl Saxton. If you want to speak on this item, please turn on your slip.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. You spelled my name perfectly.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And you pronounce it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'My name is George to you. A little background on me. I have owned world class restaurants. I have owned a catering company. I've done banquets. I am also a food wholesaler. Tom G. Nikos has been a customer of mine since 1992.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Is my oldest. Not age wise. He is my longest customer that I have ever had. His longevity is due to his ability to run a restaurant. I have seen when I first started selling him food in 1992, he had a little hole in the wall little strait restaurant that, I don't know, seated maybe 25 people.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And through his determination and his knowledge and his commitment to quality and good service. He's built gyms to what it is today. Sorry. I'm not a great speaker in front of people, but I think that. There is no better operator in this city and even around in the area.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I think Jim's should get the the deal. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Doug. Don.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. Good evening. Council mayor and city manager. Oh, I'm. I'm here for another topic, but just being on the golf course, I have to speak. Okay. And pardon me because it's going to eat into my time at a later point.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Oh, I am. Feeling very comfortable that I here. Greenway wants to really delve into this and work with James. Let me give you a background. Everyone else has given their background. James is part of the family of Alameda, the fabric of Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'They sacrificed their own business out here to step out there. They were successful and they moved forward. The problem was a small businessman. He needs a commitment, a long term commitment so they can put invest the money and move forward.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I do not support that. You move it out another six years and extend it. We are on the verge. On the verge. Greenway has done a remarkable job in renovating the course. And the course is. And the of.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Driving range. But what has to happen today is the devil's in the details. We've been working on this for three years. I believe you have a very solid proposal. What is so unique? We do not want a country club atmosphere, particularly in the restaurant.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I do bring the family out to James. I know many, probably half their patrons are people that are not golf. So that gives you a feeling of what they have done and they have the longevity. So if there's details to be worked out, work about quickly, make it happen and let's move on for a year and a'",
        "'speaker_8': 'half or a year from now, we're going to have that. Premier facility out there and we'll have the adjacent concessionaires. So thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And I'll be Tom, Janet Goss and Cheryl Saxton. Those are our last speakers on this item. If you want to speak on this item, please turn in your slip.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening, Madam Chair. Members of the City Council. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to come before you tonight. First of all, I want to thank Amy. Most of all, she worked.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Tremendously hard on this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'On this whole project. She put a lot of work and I thought time, a lot of effort. And I want to commend her.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'She's a pleasure to work with throughout the whole time.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's been a long process. We've been at this well over a year and Amy hung in there all the way and all the hurdles and all the obstacles. And secondly, I want to thank everyone who spoke for and against me for all the nice words they said, you know.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So, Jim, just pretty much I mean, everybody knows germs have been around since 1960. We're going on to the third generation. You know, I'm not as young as I used to be. My son, you know, will probably be taking over the business.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And, you know, our goal. We are a family in the restaurant business. That's what we do. You know, we do restaurants and, you know.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We do them well. The only measure of success.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'At a restaurant is its longevity. Every restaurant the last five years, depending on who statistics you look at.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Russ was the last.'",
        "'speaker_4': '90% of restaurants go out of business in the first five years of operation. We've been around for a long time.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That alone is a testament to.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'To our business and what we do so. We currently have around 60 employees between both locations and we have 20 to 25 employees at the at the golf course.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And we hire local people. And we we are. Um. But can I say this?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We like being part of the community and we want to stay at the golf course location. And without saying a lot that I'm going to get myself in trouble with, I just want to say, you know, I wish you would approve my lease tonight so we can move forward with this project.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Cheryl Saxton.'",

And first, to just clarify, was not six years that we recommended was six months extension of the current lease with the ability to hammer that out much sooner as soon as 30'",
        "'speaker_9': ', 60 days. If they could get that information worked between Greenway and Jim's on the course and get it back to the Gulf Commission and subsequently to all of you. I worked at the.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Golf course when I was 16.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I worked at the Snack Shack. I was a breakfast cooked out there and I.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Know the.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Condition that it was in back then, and I don't think that it has changed much, much since then, until Jim's on the course took it over.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There's no question.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That anyone is.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Against.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Jim's on the course. Everyone is very much in favor, but with the amount of work that Greenway Golf is putting in and the caliber of golf course that we're going to have out there, just the little details.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That are not.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'In the agreement at the moment. We would request that some of those get added and amended before the agreement is signed. Um hmm. An example of that is for the caliber of golf course it's going to be. It'd be nice to have a cart that goes around providing beverages or whatnot and nothing like that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Was a provision in the lease currently or in the agreement excuse me, and the change to the snack bar on an on the north course. Some details like that need to be added or changed or.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It is our recommendation that the extension be six months, but certainly that the agreement could be signed much sooner as soon as the two could get together and hammer out a few more of the details. Um, thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. All right. She's our last speaker. Council members, member OTI.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Madam Chair. I want to thank all of the folks who came out tonight to speak and thank staff again for a tremendous effort in putting together this concession agreement. Now. As a new council member. You know, I try to look up to some folks in the community who I consider mentors whose opinions are very important'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to me. A Two of them are here in this room and they spoke on this issue. One of them in a little ironic. His wife, Norma. For full disclosure, they invited me over for coffee and one donut from the new shop on Park Street.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And Little pulled out the book, the Golf Commission book. And it was fascinating for me to sit there with Lil and Norma and actually relive the history of the golf commission. And, you know, he tried to do this in four or 5 minutes when I was at his dining room table.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It took a little bit longer. And I really appreciate that. But, you know, one of the points that stuck with me from that meeting with Lil and Norma was that this concessionaire actually has been the longest concessionaire of anyone we've had in the golf course throughout Alameda history.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And to me, that's important. We need to have some stability out there. I remember when there was a previous restaurant there and I'd never gone there, you know, even though living here 20 years yet, I've been to gyms many a times, both on the golf course and on the main island.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And sometimes, you know, when you live on Bay Farm, as as Peter Fletcher talked about and, you know, that's the place to go. I mean, that's the restaurant you want to take your family. And I agree with Doug.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know, believe it or not, I do listen to you and you do mentor me and provide comments. And, you know, I call you often and and get those the gyms is a fabric of our community, you know, not only for Bay Farm, but even those on the main island, you know, all is too busy.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Or gyms on Lincoln, which has been there 60 years. If they're too busy, then, you know, we hop in the car even though we shouldn't use greenhouse gases and we drive out to the golf course because we know the line is shorter.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I think that's important that, you know, we're putting our faith in an Alameda business and not an Alameda business that's just starting. We're not an Alameda business that doesn't have a track record, one that has 60 years, one that has skin in the game.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know, part of the concession, because this is a concession agreement, you know, he can't use the property to get a lean to finance. So he's they're going to use his personal funds or use a lean against his existing business.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean, to me, that skin in the game and that's the type of partner we want in our community. I think this is you know, it would be great if, you know, you know, we could have a Black Hawk or something like that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But, you know, this is not the character of our community. Our our character is is a family city, a place where you could take your kids or like I think it was Kathleen and Peter, you know, when they come home from a trip, you know, they can grab something, you know, casual I think casual elegance was that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'was the term that I heard, you know, or if you're all sweating and after your golfing, you know, that's the place you want to go. You know, we have tobaccos. You know, we have some nice places to eat.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But, you know, on the golf course, you know, for folks and families on Bay Farm Island, you know, I think this is the perfect match. No, I'm I respect the Golf Commission's suggestions, but from what I heard from both the attorney and from the owner, you know, there's nothing stopping the owner of Jim's and Greenway from engaging'",
        "'speaker_2': 'in negotiations. If we approve this this concession agreement and actually working on some of these points and I sensed willingness to do that and I will trust that there is a willingness to do that. But I do believe that we should give gyms the, you know, the certainty of having an agreement and maybe give them some equal'",
        "'speaker_2': 'bargaining power in those negotiations that they might not have if we place this agreement contingent on fulfilling those conditions. So nothing in my mind, you know, prevents you from doing that. I'm wholeheartedly in support of this. Please don't confuse my brevity with any lack of commitment.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm full fully in support of this and hope that urge my colleagues to support this and hope that we can begin a new chapter on golf on the golf course with gyms as a long term concessionaire.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And. Thank you, Mary Spencer. And thank you to everyone who came out and spoke in all the letters we've received up until now, I don't think we heard anybody say, don't give the concession to Jim's on the golf course.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But what I did hear and I put great weight into the work of the Golf Commission because they study these issues more in more detail than we do. And they're recommending a simple six month extension. They're saying we all like Jim's, but there are some details that need to be worked out.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think all of us who've had a chance to go out and tour the new about to be newly renovated south course, which is going to be lovely, are impressed. And we've seen what what Greenway has already done with the Smith Albright and the the driving range south course is coming along beautifully.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It is reasonable to want facilities and it's not country club but just nice, decent, good design standards to be consistent with what is is being done out there. Now I think people agree that the selection of Greenway Golf Golf was an inspired one.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They they've shown themselves to be very capable in what they're doing. So it would be very difficult for me to go against the unanimous recommendation of the golf commission. I think it's completely reasonable what they're doing. And as Mr. Saxton just reminded us, it doesn't have to take six more months to get this agreement inked because there'",
        "'speaker_1': 'is a motivation to move quickly. I know Greenway Golf would like to see that restaurant finished in time for the completion of the New South course. So I think that everyone is going to be motivated to do their best.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But it is important. This is a 25 year lease for all intents and purposes that we would be entering into. We don't take that lightly. I can't remember if we've done 25 year leases added. Allow me to point.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We don't do this every day. So let's let's take the six months or less and and move forward with deliberation. So that would be my recommendation that we followed the recommendation of the Golf Commission. Thank you, Madam Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Member de SAC.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Oh.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, thank you very much. I this was quite an interesting issue in the past several weeks. I had a great opportunity to listen to various sides of this issue from people who care about our community deeply, as well as people who care about the Gulf community as deep, if not more.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And people who really know what they're talking about. I met and listened to Jane SolarWorld and Joe Van Van Winkle, who offered some really good points that we need to consider when moving forward. I also had the great opportunity to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The former council member, former vice mayor Lauren Rich, along with Mrs. Arnold as well, and also understand from their viewpoint some of the issues that are both pros and cons. But also, you know, I heard from I met and listened and heard from Tom, the owner.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So it was very informative process. I felt like a judge, you know, being able to because everyone is raising good points. But as a judge, you ultimately have to say which issues and which questions trump this or that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I appreciate listening to what the Golf Commission members who took the time to come out this evening to go to our meeting. Now, just as an aside, I work during the daytime in Walnut Creek, so it's sometimes difficult for me to make daytime meetings.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So so that's an explanation to me. What it comes down to really is a staff recommendation. And I don't say that lightly because sometimes staff, in my opinion, on some issues perhaps will not make the right recommendations. Or sometimes I will think, well, did they really think think it through?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I know that the team of city manager in a Liz Warner dam and Amy Woolridge, I think they really looked out for all the all the issues that we need to be concerned about. And if there are some questions that we need to further analyze, particularly with regard to thinking up this project, this restaurant project, thinking'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that up with what Greenway ultimately wants to do out at the golf course, which I'm not, I'm not I don't really familiar with that. You know, I know that our staff will will help us think it through. And our staff will be there to to make sure that, however the restaurant is designed and laid out, that it's'",
        "'speaker_3': 'linked up with how the I think the golf course is going to get expanded. So that's the recommendation I take very seriously. And, you know, with the successes that especially APRA or APD director Ms. Woolridge has as a demonstrated, you know, these are not recommendations that we we ought to take lightly.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I'm comforted in moving forward with staff recommendations this evening. In the final note. You know, the thing that really strikes me about this. Proposal is that. I see in gyms a product that basically sells itself. You know, it's going back to the the revenues per round numbers that I mean, the revenues per round seem to be'",
        "'speaker_3': 'a lot higher than what the standard. In my estimate is if the standard is $5 per round, my estimate, based on whatever information I can glean, seems to be around 13 to $15 around. I mean, so that says something about this outfit that it's a product that it has sold.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, it's sold itself, basically. And you know, the few times that I've been to the golf course, not much. There seems to be a lot of people. I think I've only been on the golf course five times.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There seems to be a lot of people at this restaurant. So, you know, I'm I'm comfortable with moving forward with the staff's recommendation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Vice Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Madam Mayor. I would like to see if we can have the performance information that's provided in the slides and in correspondence of be attached as a file to this contract. Because I think it's important for us to monitor and a lot of questions have been answered from the TIME staff report has gone out and now'",
        "'speaker_4': 'particularly the benefits to the city shifting the liability of the maintenance of the building from the city to the concessionaire, the delivery of capital improvement to the city's own facility. The contribution, though it is different to common area maintenance, I think is is important.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Nonetheless, the concessionaire is responsible for or those that see IP allocation. I'd also like us to keep a timeframe and of all the lists that were on the paper that was just given to us from Greenway and whatever the Gulf Commission has concerns about.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think those can be dealt with in an additional contract, but I'd like to see this contract move forward. We have a concessionaire with it, with a track record that's worked in a very difficult environment because this contract started in 2006 in the heart of the recession.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we know that there is activity, and I think six months may not sound like a long time, but when you look at the time frames that are demanded by the contract to deliver the exterior patio, the interior improvements and the back kitchen improvements, these are tight.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If we want this to coincide reasonably with the opening of the improved golf course. So I think from a business standpoint, it makes sense to go forward with this contract. And. I don't know that the city has to have a negotiation between Greenway and and.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Jim's on the course, but I expect them to work together with the Golf Commission being the platform for that to monitor and to provide us with the recommendations where we might need another contract. Snacks. Snacks. And the addition of a, of a, um, a mobile cart.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think our features that may be become necessary and should be included in an concessionaires contract. But I don't want to hold up this concert contract while we're waiting for those peripherals. They're important. But again, the timing of this, I think, demands that we we move forward on it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Counsel, did you want to respond at all to his comments? I just want to give you the opportunity. If you felt like. I wasn't sure if there was any questions in there.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'An additional contract is beyond this to cover other things that come up. Is that possible?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Basically sort of a side letter or side agreement.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Or a separate contract. However, whatever tool there might be, yes, that's acceptable. And I think that would take six months or longer, depending on what the what the subject matter is.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If I understand the question correctly, you're talking about a side letter or side agreement that might be between Jim's on the course and Greenway.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'No, between us and. And Jim's on the course as our concessionaire. He's not Greenway's concessionaire. They should work together to make the golf operation work as a unit. But the contract as a concessionaires with us the city. That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So if if there is something that comes out of those discussions between Greenway and Jim's on some of these peripherals and the Golf Commission says, yes, we want this, that can go forward as a recommendation for an additional contract or addendum to this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I see what you're saying. Yes. If if through those negotiations, we feel that some of those areas should be further addressed in this concession agreement. It can either come back to you as an amendment to incorporate those items or.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Be the subject of a new agreement, if that's possible. I don't see those. I see that being a parallel path to getting this project started.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Kid and I would say on an as needed basis then. Right. I mean, that's the whole deterrence.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Was started today at the Gulf Commission. There was a discussion. We have no minutes yet from it. Well, it's hard to tell, but they're right. That's all. I didn't see any show stopper saying, we don't want this patio, okay?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Or the $750,000 is not worth the concession, the terms that we're giving in this contract.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Member Ashcroft I.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Have I have no idea what you're talking about as far as the subject matter of this contract amendment. You're using this list. That was the talking points. You'd like to see these as the subjects?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'No, I don't know. I haven't seen one.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There's an unknown. But at this point I'd like to.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's a theoretical.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. Yeah. So we'll see on that. And I appreciate your comments. I actually appreciate the comments of all the council members. And I want to start first with today at the commission. We really do value the work of the commissioners.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We value the actually everyone taking the time and going down there this afternoon and speaking and coming out here tonight. And we've received many emails on this issue. But I have heard. Unanimously from everyone is that we want gyms to stay on the course.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There has been no one that has said that they do not want gyms to stay on the course. I think that the concerns raised by the commission. Some of them are legal questions. At the end of the day.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I don't think that they outweigh the importance of the city supporting Jim's. So that they can be successful. We are talking about a small business, a very challenging business, a restaurant business. And as much as Greenway is stepping up right now, you have a course that is not at the start, at its optimum.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And yet Jim's has continued to serve our community very, very well. And I don't think that we I agree with the majority of this council. Let's move forward with Jim's. I am confident this will work out successfully for the city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And let's keep in mind, gyms does not serve only people that golf we act. We know that if honestly the numbers would not add up otherwise it has been successful because the community supports gyms. And given that I do support this, I'm confident gyms has actually been a really good part of our community for many, many years'",
        "'speaker_0': '. And I agree with the speakers that say they don't want a country club. I don't want a country club out there. I don't. I like alameda gyms is a big part of Alameda. It is important for our city, as we see here, to continue to support it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Why? Because we all like going to gyms. We actually like going to gyms, whether it's on the course. We like them. So I will be supporting this. Is there emotion?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Emotion.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Second.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I wanted to describe the emotion first. It's okay that we approve or adopt a resolution approving the 15 year concession agreement with a ten year renewal option that the performer information is summarized and put in a in a formal format and is attached to this agreement, and that we get periodic reports that coincide with the approvals that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'are listed are the milestones that are listed in the agreement. From Gyms and Greenway through the Golf Commission to us.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Still second thoughts.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. And any comments? All those in favor. I oppose no motion passes. 4 to 1. Thank you. And this.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Point. At this point. We're going to take a brief recess.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's good.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's a good motion.'",

They strongly suggested that we have kind of a more local angle in that letter than just the broad NextGen.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so to that end, Matt Farris, Lonnie here is going to be drafting us a paragraph to inserted into that letter tomorrow morning that addresses the request, the left turn request that we actually need to avoid noise within the city of Alameda.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'So just, you know, how did we get to this point?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'How we got to this point? We've had dealings with the airport off and on for a great many years. We were sued by the airport at one point and then we through the airport at one point. We currently are operating under the second settlement agreement with Oakland Airport, and that's actually operating very well.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The second settlement agreement, the airport's complying with that. During the four years when we were going back and forth with the airport, we formulated the airport operations committee. This was a number of people that sat on this committee.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'They advised staff and the council regarding air operations out of the Oakland airport and noise reduction. There is also class formed community. Yes. Right? Yes. And that was yeah, it was class that was form. There's a number of organizations.'",

And so that's really where we are today, is addressing this next gen. The South Bay and the West Bay have organized significantly over there and are strongly lobbying the FAA to look at this.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Again, we will be joining that effort with them to to lobby our federal representatives. That we're also adding to asking you to add this to our 2016 legislative program. That's why for you, we could not send this letter without getting that added to the legislative program that we're asking that we're asking to reactivate the Ad Hoc Airport'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Well, thank you very much, Mr. Horn. Great to see you back, by the way. Next gen basically is the FAA is transitioning the flight path to into a satellite based path. And as a result of doing that, communities across the United States, including in California, have been experiencing incredible amounts of noise.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'What that also means is that many communities in trying to deal with that with the FAA are beginning to organize. And so at the leadership of of the late Dave Needle and also at the leadership of Walt Jacobs and Mrs. Barbara Talia and also the late red was well rather Weatherill.'",

So I appreciate staff's recommendation and bringing us forward because we do, as Mr. Jacobs said.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'While Jacobs said, we do need to be a presence at the table in staff's recommendation, also working with our lobbyist in in Washington DC is also key too. So I really appreciate that. I think, you know that we've got a lot on our plate tonight, so I think we need to move forward.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. That being said, all those in favor, I am curious unanimously. Thank you very much. Oh, all right. Next item six. Be as in boy. And I do have a question. Does this item need to be heard tonight or what's your time estimate?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We would like to have this item heard tonight because there's a long lead time for some of the steps that we have in front of us.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Do we have any public speakers on this item? No.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We will. We can go through it fairly quickly.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. We could do that quickly because we have two other items that do have public speakers.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay.'",

    "Receive Report on Results from a City of Alameda Survey Conducted in December 2015 and Provide Direction on a November 2016 Ballot Measure. (City Manager 2110).": [
        "'speaker_9': 'So very quickly, as councilor will recall, last October, we came to you for authorization to proceed with a survey essentially to determine if our voters were interested in actually taxing themselves for city services and if they were, which of those services were important.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So we did actually go forward with your authorization to do that. We hired FM three to conduct that poll, and tonight we'd like to share those results with you and then the next steps. Very quickly, before we go into that, before you, you have Kurt Barlow from Form three, who will present the polling results.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We also have Tom Clifford, who's from Clifford Moss. He's our outreach consultant. And then we also have with us Don Maynor, who's our attorney, who's helping us on the utility users tax ordinance and language. So we have a bunch of folks here that we'd like to offer to you at the end of this presentation if we have'",
        "'speaker_9': 'any questions. So with that, I'll give turn it over to Curt.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you very much, Mayor, and members of the council. I will try to keep the mayor's advice here and go through as quickly as I can with all sorts of nice numbers in here. All this first time a few the specifics of the survey we conducted we conducted interviews the early first half of last December, telephone interviews'",
        "'speaker_5': 'with registered voters in the city who are likely to vote in this November's election. We conducted 600 interviews over the course of the survey, roughly for the margin of error for the first time in interviews. This is a 4% we split sample.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Some of the questions were half the respondents, 300 heard one set of questions, and that's roughly a 5.7 or 6% margin of error. And we do have we did connect the survey for the city back in 2008. So it's a pretty big time gap between there.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But we do have some comparison points for questions that we asked in both those surveys that were helpful to look at. So our basic approach to the survey is that half the respondents were asked about a general purpose sales tax measure and half respondents were asked about a U.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Modernization measure. And then the full samples asked about a Paques parcel tax. And for those first two measures, we did a little bit of testing of pro and con argumentation to see where people would land in the context of an exchange of information in an election context.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I hit on a few of these key findings and hit on them in a little more specific detail momentarily here. We asked a question about issues concerning residents and voters here in Alameda. Top issues were the drought and housing costs.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Now the drought the issue was before the rains hit, but we've had a nice, unfortunately dry February. So that would probably probably be top of list. Once again, things that have changed a little bit since 2009 was economy and crime have gone down as concerns, but housing costs and traffic both gone up.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We'll see those numbers momentarily. In terms of city services, we went through a series of questions that were corresponded largely to the performance metrics for the city. By and large, very large, very high levels of satisfaction with them, maybe the only kind of squishy area that were street maintenance.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And we'll see what that looks like momentarily. And then getting to the couple of measures we have considered here, a general purpose sales tax measure at half cent level had initial support at 63%, and that's a majority vote measure.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So it was above the vote threshold for passing one beauty modernization measure. And this is not an uncommon dynamic here. Start started off at 52% in the candidate vote yes with a pretty high level of people being undecided.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We spent some time explaining what to you is and how it would be updated and then support went up quite a bit to 68%. So again, both of those were some sort of explanation were above the majority vote threshold and stayed that way over the course of the survey.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'A paques parcel tax we asked about. We'll talk about that momentarily. It's a two thirds vote threshold and we only saw 49% in the candidate vote yes for that measure. So let's get into some perceptions and just the mood of the people and voters living here in Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Pretty happy people here. Back in 2008, we had three quarters of respondents who indicated they thought their neighborhoods were headed in the right direction. Almost identical now in 2015. Looking at the city more broadly, about three in five indicated they were happy with the direction of the city is and that was very similar to that in 2008'",
        "'speaker_5': '. No real big changes there. As promised, we went through a list of different items here. We presented as potential problems facing the community, and we asked respondents to indicate how serious of a problem they thought each of these may be is an extremely serious problem, very serious, somewhat serious or not too serious of a problem.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So you see the orange juice bars here are the extremely and very serious problems. Those are items, items that generate some little more intensity, those dark blue bars or the percentages of people who suggested that these are not too serious of a problem.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And you'll see the top two items here were drought and the cost of housing, where you have roughly a third who indicated those were extremely serious problems. And just about seven in ten say that they're extremely or very serious problems.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'A pretty clear top tier of issues and problems voters feel like are facing the community here. Obviously, the drought conditions are a bigger, bigger issue, but you clearly have some ability to address that locally in the cost of housing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Also, obviously, a local issue you'll discuss later on tonight. Looking a little bit down here through some other items here, sort of on the heels of those top ones are traffic congestion. Almost half thought that was an extremely, very serious problem, 46%.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then another little sort drop down to too much growth and development at 38%. Several of these other items here we're seeing, you have pretty strong majorities saying they're not too serious of a problem that includes a lack of parks and open space crime and the condition of the local economy.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Now. I picked out a few of these here that we actually had tracked some 28. We asked a slightly different list this time ago. This time around, somehow tracks for every item here, but you'll see items related to crime, whether we characterize them as gang violence or crime.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Broadly speaking, both of those were seen as less serious problems 2015 than they were in 2008. Also we asked about waste and inefficiency in local government that has gone down and concern has decreased significantly, as do the concerns about the amount people pay in city taxes and the condition of the local economy.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's the that's going down 8%. Feel like that's extremely, very serious problem when it was 44%. And obviously in very different economic times in 20. However, as promised, a few of these items have ticked up the other direction in terms of the concern levels here.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Cost of housing being one of them. It was not. It was still one of the top tier issues in 2008, a 55%, but now it's up to 69%. And now we've got just about that third. And a lot of that increases in the intensity there.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The extremely serious went from 22 to 32%. Traffic congestion also enough about 20 points in terms of extremely and very serious parking and commercial districts and open space are about where they were in 2000. This next question follows closely with some of the city's performance metrics here.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And we asked and random order and the language here pretty much echoes some of the things you've adopted as goals for the city here. We asked respondents indicate whether they felt like these city services were being provided at an excellent level, a good level, an only fair level or a poor level, and give that only to the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'fairly put me a little tiny tinge of negative. Just so we have two and two, but you'll see here that by and large you have really strong majorities in the care. They felt that the city is doing an excellent or good job providing these services public safety park facilities, recreation programs, library customer service, library programs in general'",
        "'speaker_5': 'here, really strong majorities indicate they feel like doing a really good job. You'll see that the orange bars, the fair and poor are all really small. For most these items, the people who didn't give excellent good marks tended to fall into the don't know category.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They may not be as familiar with the library services. For example, the only couple of items here at the bottom worth noting is just the quality of street maintenance was the only one where we had a pretty significant number in that fair poor category, or 56% excellent good and 43% fair or poor and pretty much only 1%'",
        "'speaker_5': 'didn't know. Everyone can judge the quality of the of their streets. So that was the one area that I think is I would I would suggest paying a little more attention to able to city's budget management and permitting services mixed results if you look at in absolute terms but pretty high numbers of individuals who didn't feel comfortable'",
        "'speaker_5': 'voicing their opinion one way or another. And in both the street maintenance and the city's finances, only 10% or 11% have poor responses to those. So most of those people were in the fair category. So I think the big picture takeaway really high levels of satisfaction on city services.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'A few items that people are less familiar with street mean it's been the one exception where there is a little more uncertainty where we have a substantial portion of the population falling in that category. Now we get into a couple of the finance matters we tested.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The first one has a general purpose half cent sales tax measure. Here's a hypothetical ballot language that could appear on someone's ballot. Roughly 75 words includes what the measure would spend money on. What the mechanism would be would last for 15 years as the best case scenario looked at here, and we included an estimate here as to'",
        "'speaker_5': 'how much money it would raise on an annual basis. We read this two individuals and by a 2 to 1 margin. Voters indicated vote yes on the measure. And a couple of key things we look at here for majority vote measure is obviously, first, you'd like to see support exceed the vote threshold, which it does.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And next is a sees it by more than the margin of error. So we're at 63%. We also look at the intensity of support and opposition. Maybe you have a lot of people indicating to vote yes, but the support is really pretty soft in this case.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Or definitely yeses are at 28% and outpacing or definitely no's by a ten point margin. And so a pretty decent support here. Those tax measures are also things that people kind of get. Only 6% are undecided. Very few people in that squishy middle category.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'People understand it. Not a lot of confusion. Your voters were able to pick a side on it pretty much right out of the gate. And by a truly margin, they indicated they voted yes as of last December. We also asked about a couple of different variants here, about some of the accountability provisions that could be included in'",
        "'speaker_5': 'the measure. And two of the key ones that popped up here, you'll see, is a public review of spending and independent audits where you have upwards of three quarters of voters said they'd be more likely to vote for a sales tax measure if it include a public review of spending and required independent audits.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Also, see general support for an oversight committee as well. And the base case that we asked for had a 15 year sunset. And we also asked about, well, what about a nine year sunset? And frankly, there really wasn't much distinction between those.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Both cases, you had 58% who said they'd be more likely to vote for a measure with one of those sunset levels. So in this case, the existence of a sunset probably seems to be more important than the duration of it at this rate.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Looking at a UTI measure. It's a slightly different set of circumstances here.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Can you tell us what you use to use?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That is a really good point. It is here a utility user tax UTI. Thank you very much. A clarification again, one of the things that people get choked up on and we talk about this in public. So here is a 75 word bal language hypothetical here.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Again, talks about a similar set of public services that the tax would fund. Again, this is a general purpose measure as well. So it has a majority vote threshold, but it talks about basically treating tax taxpayers equally regardless of communication technology used.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This is because we'll get into this momentarily. People are using VoIP and other types of communication technologies that that didn't exist or weren't contemplated when the annuity was first passed in the city here. Many, many cities up and down the state and vast majority of them have modernize them at this point in time to be more flexible'",
        "'speaker_5': 'definitions to capture these new types of technologies. This is what would be the intent of this measure. And out of the gate, we saw 52%, a very slim majority expressed support, 26%, no. And the two things that I pointed out in the sales tax, a highlight here, too, is the intensity of support and opposition and the number'",
        "'speaker_5': 'of undecideds. So here they definitely yes, is only at 17% and just about where the definitely no's are at 14%. I see pretty equal intensity on both sides, although frankly not a lot of strong opinions one way or another.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But yet that 52% is relying upon a lot of tentative supporters to get to that majority level. And that undecided level clearly stands out at 23%. About one in four of the people we asked on the phone, we read that 75 words, too, and they said, I don't know.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And in fact, we gave them two bites of that apple. If you said your first instinct was you don't know, we asked, are you leaning one way or another? And they couldn't even say that. So this was something that was throwing people off a little bit initially.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'However. Being clever pollsters that we are. We anticipated this having done a few of these surveys in the past, so we decided to read respondents a bit of an explanation about what's going on here. So here is the language.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's a little hard to read, I think, in the room, but talks about how the original tax was established back in 1995, what types of services it applies to, and what this measure would do. It would extend it to services like voice over IP, not changing tax rates at all, though.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I before you move on, because you actually explain what this is for. I don't think you should spend a little more time on that. What is this, u u t. What would that be?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The utility users.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, yes, yes. You're right. We can't read it. Tell us really what is.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Oh, it is a tax that you see on your on your various utility bills. And we have actually more well versed experts here. But essentially for I think your city has it for electricity, natural gas and cable. And the the rub here is that if you you're telling if you're telephone services now using VOIP voice over IP'",
        "'speaker_5': ', so you're using Skype or some technology like that instead of a traditional landline, then those are not covered by your your city's utility users tax. And so the city is now losing revenue over time as people transition to these different types of technologies and replacing them with other technologies.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But people with a landline pay a tax that if you don't have a landline, you're not paying. And that goes to the, quote unquote fairness argument. Thank you. Exactly.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So after we went through that explanation, opinions changed somewhat dramatically. We went from 52%. Yes. To 68%. Yes. And those undecideds went down from 23 to 10%. So a pretty marked change there. The intensity of the yes is still, you know, falls a little bit short of where the intensity of the rest of the yes vote comes'",
        "'speaker_5': 'from. So there's still some some softness there. This suggests, though. It's a concept. And the fairness thing, I think, is the mayor pointing out here, strutting, struck a chord course and respondents reacted to that. I get it now.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But they need to have it explained to them as I'm doing inarticulate job of doing here right now. I think it was probably an indication that this is a complex issue. But when voters have a, you know, someone to sit down and talk to them about it, they get it and they feel more and more responsive to'",
        "'speaker_5': 'a measure. Modernizing your your tax. Over the course of the survey. We have the side by side comparisons here where we went through some arguments in favor of the measures, arguments opposed to them. We wanted to see what would happen.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Where's the ceiling? Where is the floor? And at the end of the the surveys, both of them ended up in roughly the same places. 61% indicate they vote yes for a sales tax measure after an exchange of pros and cons, 64% for the US measure.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so they're both sort of in that low mid-sixties range for support after protocol argumentation. This is just a little bit of a summary of some of the concepts that we tested here in terms of the arguments in favor and with slide arguments opposed.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Some of the arguments were a little bit different for the routine, the sales tax. The U.S. obviously had a much more nuanced sort of argumentation for them because it talks about the fairness issue and the fact that the rate would not be increasing, but basically talked about some of the ways the money could be spent from these'",
        "'speaker_5': 'measures park maintenance, fixings, farm dreams, public safety, helping the city's general quality of life and fiscal preparedness for the next recession. And then we went through a series of arguments opposed to these measures here, and they're a little more visceral, right?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's the city is going to waste our money. We don't need this stuff. We can't afford our taxes. But also some things that are a little more specific to these measures, the fact that there was a sales tax measure that was rejected here in the city not too long ago, and the fact that maybe that the US'",
        "'speaker_5': 'is a little bit of a trick in terms of. Of achieving the tax rate the same, but broadening the base of services that are being applied to. So. The last measure we looked at here was a Parks personal tax and again went through the 75 words that would hypothetically appear on a ballot.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This was a we tested a $25 per person tax, but raised about a half million dollars annually. I'll pause here momentarily. But we talked about a lot of the maintenance that this type of measure would support, but also talked about opening and maintaining new parks.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So it was a it was a mixture, leaning heavily on the maintenance, but also did mention a little bit about opening new parks. And unfortunately, support at that level for that measure was was far lower than for the other measures.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And keep in mind that this is a special purpose measure. It has a two thirds vote threshold. So the 49% is a just little herrell lower than the majority vote threshold. But this will require a two thirds vote threshold.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Um, I think I just have one last set of data here to get through. And we did ask a series of, of ways that money from a potential general purpose measure could be spent. And we asked respondents indicate how important it was that was spent on this particular type of service scale.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Use was important, extremely important, which is dark blue bars. Very important, which is light blue bars. Somewhat important, which is the I guess it looks like here it's kind of looking a little light orange. And the dark orange is not too important.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'A couple of slides here to go through, not the entire list of them, but pretty much every voter thought all these things were at least somewhat important. None of these services were dismissed out of hand. So in cases like that, we tend to try to focus on the intensity of those reactions.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Those who said something was extremely or very important. I think, generally speaking, Alameda voters feel like all these things are vital services for the city. But there were some differences in intensity here. And on this first slide, things that generate much more strong intensity here.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'A lot of them were public safety oriented response times to a variety of different things violent crimes, property crimes, but also a couple more generic, bigger picture of things overall, maintaining the city's quality of life and the financial stability.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So you see a pretty big public safety and general infrastructure concerns there, as well as maintaining and repairing storm drains. And I think keeping pollution out of the bay where our our belief is were a pretty critical component of that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The next series, next slide here we have on it were items that were in the sort of sixties, low seventies range in terms of extremely, very important. Again, very few people, very few items in the have dark orange bars.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Everything here are seen as at least somewhat important looking at the extremely in various to try to sort them out here you start to see more infrastructural items come up where the storm drain might come on the prior slide.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But now we see street repairs, maintaining parks, things of that nature popping up here as well. The other item here that actually generated a fair amount of intensity was addressing the cost of rental housing in aggregate. It didn't have the same intensity as some of the items on the prior slide, but not a lot of people are'",
        "'speaker_5': 'dismissing that as an item, a spending priority. We have two more slides in this series, if my memory serves me. And so now we're getting to much smaller blue bars here, roughly in the 50 percentile range for all these items on the slide.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Again, the dark orange bars aren't particularly big, but we're getting into other types of services libraries, tree trimming, safe space for streets, for bicyclists. Pedestrians. Economic development. Most people feel like these would be nice things to spend money on.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They just aren't generating the same intensity as some of the other items. And the last slide is one of the few that we actually have any big orange bars on and particularly reopening city hall on Fridays. 53%, a majority said that they didn't think that would be a great way to spend tax dollars from new meaning new'",
        "'speaker_5': 'revenues. So in the final versions here, it looks like both a sales tax and a utility user's tax. Both are viable here in the city. Now, there's big caveats and distinctions between those two sales tax people kind of get, you know, a pretty strong majority and more than three and five indicate they'd vote yes for this.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Every time in the course of the survey until the users tax, though, it appears to have a slightly higher ceiling than a sales tax. A lot of confusion out of the gate. And if you were to pursue something like that down the road, it seems like this is something you need a longer runway.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Spend much more time educating the public about what's going on here and why this is needed. Generally speaking, it seems like the types of services that people want to see additional dollars spent on tend to be public safety oriented, focused on bigger picture infrastructure issues.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And finally, the last thing in terms of a Parks parcel tax here at this point in time, particularly to personnel, the two measures, it doesn't seem like it's viable, particularly with a two thirds vote threshold. At. Oh.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Oh, yeah. Well, go on. So that actually concludes the presentation on the polling. And then we're going to go into just kind of some discussion about moving forward. But if you'd like, it's at the council's pleasure whether or not you want to ask Kurt questions now or if you want to wait until the end.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Council. At my desk. It looks like you may continue. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay, so I will continue. Thank you. And if we have questions before we back up. Okay. So as Kurt said, the sales tax measure does seem to be viable and requires less voter education. But as we talked about, I think back in October, we've reached our statutory cap of 9.5%, which is a state cap.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Can you explain that a little bit more maybe?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yeah. So the state sets a threshold for nine and a half percent that cities can levy a sales tax. And we actually are at that nine and a half percent. Other cities have actually exceeded that cap. They're at 10%.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'There's four other cities in Alameda County, but they exceeded that cap because of a variety of reasons, but primarily because Measure B, which got special legislation, allowed them to go over their nine and a half cap and now are sitting at 10% in order.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So we because of the polling information, we did a little bit more research and we could, if we wanted to pursue the sales tax in November, pursue a special legislation at the state. But that would require a two thirds vote of the legislature.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And just talking to our lobbyists, they said that's very unlikely that that will actually happen. The other cities and measure b b that did get the special dispensation, I guess you could say, to go to 10%. They all pursued that with a simple majority, 50% plus one from the state.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We could do that, but we need more time to do that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We'll talk about that a little bit later. So we actually right now are we actually don't have the authority to go for a sales tax that has been confirmed in 2016. That could we could change that. It is sales tax.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'From from a financial perspective, from a fiscal stability perspective is very attractive because it generates three and a half million dollars a year to the city, which can go for a lot of things, not the least of which are those parks that we all love but nobody seems to want to pay for which we've noticed.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'On the lack of support on the parcel tax. So the utility users tax also appears to be viable. It lands at 64% after the education. And unfortunately, that doesn't raise as much money. It's 1.6 million to the city's general fund.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So it's not insignificant. But obviously, it's not as it's not as compelling as the sales tax argument. But unfortunately, that's off the table. So our recommendation actually to you is to pursue the utility users tax in November 2016.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But obviously that's going to take a fairly significant voter education component. We'd also like to suggest that you move forward with trying to secure that special legislation, because we're starting now, and it wouldn't take effect until 2017 or 18.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You'd only need that 50% plus one threshold at the state state legislature. And then that allows you that opportunity if you wanted to do it in 2018 or 2020 or 2022. It's not a huge work effort, but it allows you that ability sometime in the future.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So this is sort of two recommendations that we're saying go forward with the November 16, but also direct staff to to pursue the special legislation at the state level to exceed our cap to 10% on the sales tax.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So if you are amenable to that tonight, this is what we would be doing. Staff would begin the formal community engagement process with our consultants. That would include putting together 2 to 3 different mailers that would go out to the community.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And those mailers would be information mailers. As Curt said, this is this. The utility users tax obviously needs a lot of education. And so those mailers would be talking to the community about what exactly we're trying to do here.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We would do speaking engagements, online surveys, social media and website activities. And that cost would be primarily $65,000, mostly for education material, which we actually have already budgeted. Knowing that we were there, there was a likelihood that we might be doing this.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And then in May of this year, we would come back to you on the work that we've done to date, sort of what are the stakeholder educations that we've done? What were the information materials that we put out we would bring to you the draft resolution that the ballot measure and about ballot measure language.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And then we would discuss the next steps. And then on June in June, we would ask you to adopt the final ballot language. And. Okay. That actually concludes our presentation, so I'd be happy to take any questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And first, I want to confirm we don't have any speakers. Correct. All right. Councilmember Ashcroft.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Just a quick question on the staff report. Thank you, Ms.. For Madame on page four, talking about should the staff direct should the council direct staff to pursue the utility user tax, the modernization ballot measure, community engagement would begin quickly.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It will also include direct door to door resident contact. And my question is simply who would be doing that door to door residential contact?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'As.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Oh, right. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. What?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Remember his comment was us. That's what we're like. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That would probably become that would come later. Later. But most of the what the work that the staff would be doing are the is the educational material.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So the question was who.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Is to be.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Determined? Is that to be determined? Thank you for the here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Any other questions or comments from Council member Desai?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The comment that I have to share is I think, you know, I, I recognize the fact that the way in which our telecommunications activities are conducted now has effects on the amount of uut that we've been gathering, utility user tax that we've been gathering, meaning that as people shift away from landlines to cell phones, we've seen corresponding'",
        "'speaker_3': 'decline in UTC. So I get that. But I think, you know, the question that I would always have is as we're seeking to generate revenues via these changes or even down the road, additional sales tax revenues, I think the first thing I need to know is, you know, what is the underlying problem that we're seeking to solve'",
        "'speaker_3': '? I think in the big picture of things, we all know that at Alameda that we are in a structural deficit and we've always been that way, meaning that it's baked into the nature of our cake, that our expenses go beyond what our what revenues we collect through the the normal channels, i.e., property taxes, sales taxes, etc..'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But oftentimes the way that you deal with structural deficits is by changing your economy, encouraging the private sector jobs, business sales tax, etc.. So it's just I just need more information as to the nature of the problem that we're gathering.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I do suspect also that the nature of our labor relations are such that, you know, whatever whatever we gather, some amount is already. Some amount is already constrained. So I. Yeah. That's my comment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Any other comments by council vice mayor?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I agree with the. Assessment of sales taxes is out. Although I. Do think the direction to pursue the legislation that will allow us to go over so that we're at least where some of our peers are. I think it's a good a good direction to give.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think the use of utility taxes is antiquated and it does need to be brought up to to the current utility use. That's a question of fairness and it's a question of changing means of our utilities are are delivered.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we need to. To avail ourselves of that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Member Ashcraft.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm in support of staff's recommendations.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm ready.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm in support, too. Just to be clear, the the analysis of the likelihood of this getting through the assembly was obtained through our lobbyists, correct?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Just to kind of. I just want to make sure that was clear. But I do want to point out, you know, the the struggle that this might even have if we didn't need a two thirds vote to get it through the legislature when we did the Measure B B authorization in the assembly, it got 43 votes'",
        "'speaker_2': '. So 41 is the magic number, only got 43, even though there was a two thirds Democratic majority. No Republican Assembly member supported it and a number of moderate Dems stayed off. So. They want to make sure where we go in managing their expectations.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we make sure that our our lobbyist understands that this is our priority.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I do support staff's recommendation as part of the update. I'm going to want to know. So we're going. If we end up. Well, actually, I think there's a more basic question to begin with, what percentage of our meetings actually do not have a landline?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If you have any information on that, that's something we know. How many homes? Okay. So I am. I actually would like to know, you know, what this 1.5 million is based on where we're going to capture that money.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah. My name is Donald Maynor, and I work with the till to use your tax ordinances.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'About half the homes now.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Don't have landline there solely on.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Wireless or VoIP. And what the problem in your with your ordinance, you have no definitions and it invites.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Companies to interpret the ordinance different ways. So you're missing most of your money's missing because of wireless companies the way they interpret it. So by adopting about 90% of all the utility in California now is voter approved with modern audiences.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So you're just catching up to the rest of the communities by adopting the modern audiences.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And it'll take away any ambiguity as to how old you are and and supplies. But most of that money that you're missing is going to come on the wireless side, part of it's prepaid wireless, which comes about as a result of a new state law.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But there's one or two major companies that are interpreting your ordinance in a way that they're really under collecting.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sir. Did you. Are you with them or happened to be here in the audience?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'No, no.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I represent your city.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes. So we introduced I introduced him. This is Don Maner. He works. He's under contract with the city. He's an attorney that helps cities up and down the state on their utility users tax ordinances. It helps.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It was modernized for the plane the Warriors just won in overtime. So I was like.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, thank you very much. So and so that's good to know. And then in regards to the additional money, assuming this passes, how that could be spent by council, what that really looks like and this would be indefinitely, then this doesn't have a it's not like nine years or 16 years like the other.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This is a change in the definition. It just goes on and on and on. Is that correct? Right. And I see heads nodding yes.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I just want to put up the slide. This is our utility user stack. So it's not like we're going to it's not unlike it's not like the sales tax where our sales tax continues to go up. And then if we pass the sales tax tax measure, it would continue to go up even further.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'This is a revenue measure that a revenue that is just continuing to decline. So it's not even it's just trying to keep ourselves whole. It's not actually trying to buy us more. It's trying to keep us whole. And this falls into the category of fiscal sustainability.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. And then I also want to just share in regards to the the negative or not a strong positive comments on the parks connected to parcel tax. And I actually think that that is the issue, as opposed to the public not being willing to pay additional money to support our parks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think that there is a concern in regards to so many parcel taxes and who pays the parcel tax that that makes it so it's more complicated than not necessary supporting paying for our parks. And I actually think our community is very supportive of financially supporting our parks.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But it is is it is correct to say that. Well, let me ask is it correct to say that the uut is part of the re formula?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes. Well, you two is part of the brief, so you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Have some definitions.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Balanced revenue index, which is a formula that's used for the salary increases on some of our employees.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's well, can you name can you specify the sum?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It includes all of the public safety employees, and it does not include our employees at Alameda Municipal Power. So those are excluded. They are the employees at Elmira Municipal Power do not have their raises tied to the Balance Revenue Index.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Which is an interesting question and not to be answered tonight, but I mean, that doesn't trigger any legal issues in terms of the ballot balloting numbers.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'No. The use of that, the use of the your funds. This is a 50% plus one, which is a general tax. You can use that money however you choose.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So this would and I also want to just clarify this point. We're just asking staff to come back with these. But if we were actually going to put this on the measure, council would have a lot more input and we would vote whether or not it's at some point we would actually vote whether or not to put'",
        "'speaker_0': 'this on the.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Back so that you have to vote. So we're going to bring the actual language to you in May. And then we we expect that in June, late June, we'll ask you to formally vote to put it on the ballot in November.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Any other vice mayor?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If there are no questions, I would like to move the recommendations of the staff.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'll second all those in favor. Hi. Hi. Four in favor. One abstention. Motion carries. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you.'",

And we staff is recommending that we don't have any gaps in tenant protection measures while the 30 days elapses before the effective date of the permanent legislation.

        "'speaker_0': 'Three, so be six up to six. That was what we had done before. So that's Barbara Thomas, then John Sullivan and then Greg McConnell and many more. All right. Barbara and John would each get 6 minutes. Barbara, your first.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'I appreciate the early Ms.. Ryan and I said all those things earlier. I said all the good things earlier. Now I'm here to make a record as an attorney on behalf of a client. And that is, once again, I do not feel that this ordinance complies with secure.'",

In reading all the case law, I just said, you know, I've been looking at the tree and I missed the forest because this doesn't hasn't been addressed in your housing element.'",

And so along those two lines, I think that and I do think you guys do a lot of work, but I think you would have done a little bit less work and a better job could have been done if this had gone to the historic advisory commission, as well as the planning board on the housing element'",
        "'speaker_6': '. I think this ordinance is premature. It's not well thought out. And you can see no matter what you do, you're making people angry on both sides. I mean, that's a good, good sign that there's a compromise that's workable.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But everybody is angry. This isn't the right ordinance and it doesn't comply with the law, in my opinion, my humble opinion. The other thing I've addressed and I've read the city attorney and it's not this young man, but it's another person who responded that there are not conflicts of interest because more than 50% of the households or'",
        "'speaker_6': 'something in Alameda are renters. And that's that's apples and oranges. It's people. You guys are people. You're not households. So you have to get up the number of actual renters and compare it and see whether you. You are an exception.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I don't know if you're an exception under government code 1090, which is a felony. And I think very seriously about whether I voted on something which I hadn't been cleared by my attorney in my personal circumstances. She will be allowed to vote on this.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Everybody's not the same up on this council. Some of you are in different positions. Then you are vulnerable. Hmm. Violation of government code ten is a felony.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'Anyway, I.'",

Feel read that there's a you know, concerned on some of the items before us on this and this rack structure as proposed for instance, when tenants receive notice of a rent increase going'",
        "'speaker_5': 'forward. They will receive instructions on how to file for the you know, for a hearing. And then with the new ordinance stating that every. Every increase above 5%. The landlord has to notify the city and that triggers automatically Iraq hearing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think we are being naive, really, if we feel that the Iraq war can, you know, handle that kind of a lot going forward. So we really should look for some modifications to that. Our annual cost of operations tenants pay half.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Landlords pay behalf. Obviously the cost of operations will depend to a big degree on the number of cases filed. Since the tenants can file regardless of the rent increase amount. Why mandate the automatic filing when the landlord notifies the city later?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'About 5%. That's redundant. You know, it's duplication. It runs up the costs to tenants and to landlords. And obviously it justifies, you know, future. Raises to the budget. You know, the obvious way, of course, to avoid this would be to raise up the threshold from the 5% to 8% or 7%.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But I would be naive, I guess, if I expected that to happen tonight and then the second reading. But there are and maybe we should take a look at some alternatives, some really numbers to to if we could work through.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And there's an alternative number one. We all know, of course, that the tenants, regardless of the increase, they can file for a hearing. When a landlord issues a 5%, he must notify the RAC. And this now would be a suggestion, alternative suggestion.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The RAC would take no action unless the increase exceeded 7%, in which case the tenant would be notified. The indirect hearing would be would proceed. Alternative. Number two, if a landlord issues an increase exceeding 5%, he notifies the rec.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Here's a suggestion then alternative suggestion. Rat would take no action if the landlord provided the landlord demonstrating in his notification to the RAC. Two things a and B they. Since a tenant moved in to the property. The average annual rent increase, the average annual rent increase has not exceeded 5% and the increase being offered at that time'",
        "'speaker_5': 'does not exceed 7%. That's a responsible landlord. And that really represents about, I'd say 80, 85% of our good landlords in MM. Today. And we don't want to run, you know, run them out of town. If the goal is to collect information on the increases about 5%, then that's being accomplished.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But the other vital concerns are also being addressed. Number one, safeguarding our rack. This issue less cases protecting landlord tenant relations, no redundancy tenant can file if they wish, and keeping the operational costs to a minimum. No. I think adopting any either of those would be a win win situation really and would help our Iraq going forward'",
        "'speaker_5': '. A few other concerns on the next page and I'll just you can maybe read through them, have ability questions and and some suggestions attached to it. And also a concern concern number three landlord representative representative visited there new ordinance says that a landlord representative must have an ownership interest in the property and this could be problematic for'",
        "'speaker_5': 'the reasons stated here you might look through them and then concern for would be. Relocation fees and a sensible remedy. I think that I have put in there. You might just look through that. I've been, you know, obviously being involved.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We have here by voice here many times and. But because I'm really passionate and my desire to see this new look rack and board operate successfully and efficiently. None of my requests here tonight or suggestions are going to call them that involve any major change just by, you know, vital clarification.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And please do take the time to give them some air tonight. You know, we need a little bit of clarity, just avoiding conflict. Now, to finish up, I've been actively involved with the housing issue here for the last 18 months or so.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I appreciate your enormous efforts, really. I know you've put a ton of time and effort and worry and so forth into this. You're dealt a really a bum hand in not winning hand in court if you're talking about cards.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. All right. If you want to speak on the side and please turn on your step. Great. McConnell is our next speaker. And then Mimi more. And then Philip James. Greg McConnell. Mimi. Philip James. After Phillip, I'll be Rosa, Linda Fortuna and then Maglia Vella.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then that's. I don't have any other speaker steps on this item.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Mayor Spencer and esteemed council members. I was raised in Alameda and have the privilege of living here now. But I see friends of mine, other sons and daughters of Alameda unable to live in the city that raise them or getting priced out of homes that were once affordable to them.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The plan before you does have some technical concerns that do need to be addressed. But I worry myself about getting priced out of the city. That is my home. Something to keep in mind as we make these deliberations.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Alameda like the rest of the bay area, like the rest of california is facing a housing crisis. It's getting more expensive to live here every year and the housing supply is shrinking as more and more new residents move to the area.'",

I urge the Council to look at this measure as a first step towards helping alleviate housing stress for alameda families.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'So that's 20 May or.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Spencer said that she feels with the 5% annual rent increase, it will not trigger the RAC and the majority of the landlords will go along with.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The plan and that it should be no additional burden on on the RAC. With this in mind, why.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Are we projecting 1.1.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'And so it's it's just. Not something that we want to see to continue. So thank.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You. Thank you. And our last speaker on this item. Malaya. A chance to turn in your stats.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Good evening, Mayor Spencer and City Council. I think the.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Polling that we just looked.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'At shows the overwhelming concern of voters in Alameda regarding the rising costs of.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'That's what was discussed when people were actually.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Writing the Constitution.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And talking about what.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Type of government we wanted. They talked about the purpose of government being justice.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And housing costs have soared.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We need to take a first step. It's been a couple of years since.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'This issue was.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Raised again for a second time before the council. And this is really what we need to do. We need to make sure that the council is listening to voters and taking a step to make sure that everybody stays honest.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'If you're going to make improvements to the property, making sure that those improvements are done, making sure that we're collecting data, I think that this ordinance.'",

I think there needs to be a strong look at that to make sure that we aren't allowing for major loopholes that will undercut what this'",
        "'speaker_7': 'council is intending to do. So I hope that there is some sort of remedy for.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That that's looked at.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you so.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Much. Thank you. All right. She was our last speaker on this item. Council members once to go first.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Anybody I'll I'll I'll just off for day. Thank you very much. Thank you very much for everyone who's come out and. Showing their support on whatever side of the issue. I think it makes our civic life that much richer.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'When people are actively engaged, as is so many of you are offering your different perspectives and solutions. So believe you me. You know, we take notes and we try our best to incorporate the thoughts that are out there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I appreciated the yellow pamphlet that Mr. Sullivan put together is what it appears to me is some small steps, perhaps, that if we adopt some of these small steps in sending a message to the smaller mom and pop landlords here in town, that that we're doing our level best to try to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is what I consider to be the burdens of this ordinance, as is especially on the smaller mom and pop landlords. I think for the renters in town, it will work effectively in terms of stymieing the excessive rent increases.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I think if this is adopted that we have a system in place, but I think it's come at a great risk, at a great cost, especially to the smaller mom and pop landlords who are being asked to bear certain burdens similar to what the larger apartments are are bearing, even though it's the larger apartments who cause'",
        "'speaker_3': 'this problem. So in the yellow pamphlet that Mr. Sullivan put together, I do see some ideas that perhaps if we adopted, we could send a message that, you know, we're trying our best for the small or mom and pops.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'For example, like the idea that he has here about the having eco housing come in or or an entity like echo housing to come in to evaluate instances when a renter claims that the situation the habitat ability of the unit is in question so that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The Rent review advisory committee then doesn't just have a he said she said think of or do I believe the rent or do I believe the landlord they can turn to eco housing as as a source for to validate if the what the situation is.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I think that's I think that's a a great suggestion. And I also I like the idea of. Well, the concern number three here is kind of interesting. I mean, having making sure that whatever relocation payment is required.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'For actually Mr. Rudd, is it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Number four. We. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, whatever. I need my glasses, I guess. Whatever relocation assistance is provided that it's provided, it's placed with the the next landlord. So that's something that makes sense because we want relocation assistance while we have.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Concerns about the amount of relocation assistance. The relocation assistance ought to go to the home, because that's the whole point of it is for relocation. So. So I like that. I also like the idea that I what I saw on the.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'On the Internet today and which I do actually want to pursue. And again, it's along the lines of sending a message to the smaller mom and pop landlords. I mean, I would love to exempt owners of up to two residential units and only two residential units in Alameda from the requirement of relocation assistance in the specific instance'",
        "'speaker_3': 'of family move in. I think if we adopted that. A change in the relocation assistance formula. We would be sending, I think, a great message to the smaller mom and pops in town. I personally would have wanted to expand the definition of smaller mom and pops to those, you know, with less than five units.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But, you know, I recognize the direction of the council. But if we can do something like that, I think. We would be, you know, demonstrating that we're for a strong rent protection ordinance. But we're also trying our best to lessen whatever impacts there are on the smaller mom and pops as so defined here, in which cases those'",
        "'speaker_3': 'owning no more than two residential units. So. Those are ideas that I want to throw out.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'At member Ashcraft.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mayor Spencer. So and again, thank you to everybody who for months now has has talked to us. And former council member Barbara Thomas is right. We have talked to dozens and dozens of people for hours and hours.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But that is the way we get better informed about this very complicated subject. I, too, was intrigued by some of the suggestions that I read. However, I would like to see this ordinance move forward tonight in its second reading in the form in which we approved it at the first reading.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'However, we've said all along, not only do we have an annual review built into this process and a three year sunset, unless this subsequent council renews, we can, as a council, bring this back before the Council to see what I want to do is at least give these very, I think, well-thought out vetted proposals a chance to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'be be used. And we can see, let's see the kinds of cases that are coming before the rack. Let's see if I don't remember hearing previously that the RAC has been inordinately bogged down by claims of properties being uninhabitable.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I think that if I know some landlords have raised the question of, well, what do we do if we pay 50% of the relocation fees and then the tenant doesn't vacate or stays longer, and then you have to go to court and do it in lawful detainer and it costs money.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If we start hearing those those cases happening, if they're documented, this council can make a change before the year is up. And I think I mean, I think it's rather intriguing to to think of paying that 50% of the relocation directly to the new landlord.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But let's just see how this plays out. I think we're making some assumptions that just aren't there, aren't there? Based on any verifiable fact at this point. And also speaking of assumptions. I know there's a tendency to want to believe that it's the large landlords who are causing all the problems.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I've been on this council long enough to know that's just not true because they I mean, one of the most egregious cases that came before the council when I was first elected had to do with a four plex and senior citizens with disabled adult children getting 65% increase in their rent just because a landlord could.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So, I mean, it's we want to protect all of our tenants and I don't want to create different classes of tenants. We want to be fair to our landlords, too. But what I think we've done is we've we've struck that balance.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think we've spent a lot of time, put a lot of effort into this. I don't think it's time to start carving this ordinance up now before it's even had a chance to to take effect and be tested.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Amber. Amber.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I just if I. Thank you. Two quick points. The first quick point is that, see, dealing with the relocation benefits situation to me is an emergency issue, because once we adopt this ordinance and once it takes effect 30 days after we adopt it off the bat, someone who owns a granny flat behind them or and they want'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to move in there, they're their their grandmother or their or their or their adult senior adult parent into the backyard home that's being rented out. Off the bat, they're going to have to pay up to $10,000 right now.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I think that's why we can't wait to see, well, is it going to happen? And we know that that's going to happen. And that's just an amount that is. And I think the reasonable person would agree that for family move in situations, especially for someone who only owns one rental unit, that's not reasonable.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The second point is that the data is clear that it is the larger landlords. Of the 40 case cases that came before the rent review advisory board over the last two years. Of the 40 units that were subject to the Rent Review Advisory Board.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Of the 40, 33 were larger apartments. The case that councilmember, as he Ashcraft is referring to is in Benton Avenue, and that was in 2013, prior to the initiation of the housing crisis that really started in 2014 and caught flame in 2015.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So over the last two years, you know, it is clearly the larger land landlords, the larger apartments that have been driving this and caught between all that crossfire and fortunately has been the smaller guys.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And Brody.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So. Thank you, Madam Mayor. We've all talked a lot about this, so I'll try to keep my comments brief. You know, just to kind of address the point that my two colleagues were discussing, you know, I recall hearing a gentleman who lived I can't remember it was over near Blanding, but, you know, his rent.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think it was a veteran, a senior veteran back the first meeting we had over at Kaufman that his rent was raised like one or 200%. So that was a four unit building. And there was a couple senior couple that sent me an email saying that, you know, they were getting evicted for a move in when there'",
        "'speaker_2': 'was a vacancy and they weren't given an opportunity to stay in that one. So that was also for unit building. So I'm sure if I stretched my recollection, I would find other stories in my email and my talks with people on the street that, you know, there are smaller mom and pop landlords that are not behaving properly'",
        "'speaker_2': '. So it's not just limited to the large ones. And on the flip side, you know, there are probably larger landlords that are not behaving badly, that are doing reasonable rent increases, that aren't evicting, you know, willy nilly. So I just I'm going to support this ordinance as it's written.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean, there are things, I think that can be improved on it if we find that there's data showing, you know, there's hardship or if there's data showing that it needs to be tweaked, then, you know, we're all free to put in a council referral and have that discussion and kind of modify the ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know, we receive a lot of emails and a lot of communication and some of them get a little a little bit hostile in tone. And usually I try to just kind of brush them aside and say, I mean, these are our constituents.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They're allowed to vent, you know, and that's kind of the deal we sign up for. But one in particular I do want to talk about somebody said that if that if we pass, this is going to increase hostility and hatred between landlords and tenants.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And if that happens, that's our responsibility. And I don't I don't like to get up here and be preachy because that's not my way. But seriously, it's not. It's between. You all out there. It's between you, the landlords, and between you the tenants, too.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's up to you on how this works. If you maintain respectful relations, if you get along with your tenants, know if you do the right thing, there's not going to be hostility. All the small people, landlords that we heard said, I don't evict people.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I don't raise my rents, not I don't raise my rent 7% or 5%. Most of them said I don't raise my rents. You know what the reality is? I think John White mentioned this back at the last meeting.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And Kaufman. If that's how you're behaving, then. You're not going to be subject to any of the provisions of this ordinance because you're behaving right. So I didn't I was a little preachy back in the summertime, and I said, if, you know, if this keeps going, then the council's going to have to do more.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And it did keep going. We kept hearing stories of rent increases. We kept seeing we saw the for 70 central happen within days of us passing a moratorium. So I plead to everyone, you know, let's see. Let's do the best we can to get along.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Let's do the best to have positive human relations. You know, let's have peace in our city. Because if we don't. There was a measure ballot measure filed yesterday, I believe. And those are very strict rent control provisions. And without passing a comment on them, you know, one way or the other, I think if we continue on the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'path where we continue to have mass evictions, we continue to have people try to find loopholes. We continue to have massive rent increases at the tide in this community, and the public opinion is going to turn against landlords.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I plead with you, if you want to stop that ballot measure from passing, let's all just, you know, not to channel Rodney King or anything. Let's all try to get along. Let's all try to be reasonable. Again, I apologize for being preachy, but I think these are solid tenant protections.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think there are. With the CFP and some of the other exceptions that are in there that reasonable landlords can still earn a profit and still do reasonable things. But come on, folks, this is a long journey that we've had.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Let's try to treat each other nice and try to treat each other fairly, and we won't have to have any more additional regulations.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Vice Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Madam Mayor. I feel strongly about the mediation process and having observed it. It's success and. I think. Looking at this ordinance as its package, I do think it sends us a way on down the wrong path.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that path is a formulaic, one size fits all for probably the most important part of of the crisis that we've just seen. That being said, I think there are some good points. So another point is we can look at this and monitor it and change at any time we want.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And secondly, I think the point about protecting from mass evictions by a proportion of low cost evictions that's allowed limited is a good provision. But at the core and we spoke about it earlier in the session that preceded the regular meeting, that mediation has been successful.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I strongly believe in it and. Well, we'll see what happens.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mary Spencer, may I just interject in response to things that were said about my remarks? Very briefly.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Ah, yes. Member Ashcroft Nicely.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So with regard to the success of the RAC, and I've said this before. It's difficult to really place value on the statistics we've seen because we have also heard from many tenants who were too intimidated to even approach the rack.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The fact that they were tenants in larger associations. I'm aware of some of those. I mean, in larger buildings, groups of tenants went in together, so they had the power of numbers. But how do you measure the people who were too intimidated to use a process that was completely voluntary, that had no teeth?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The the landlord could be there and they could listen and they could say, oh, you know, you say it's a hardship. You can't afford this. Well, I can do what I want. There was nothing that could be done.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We've now put some teeth into the the mediation process, which I think has great value by adding the subsequent step of being able to take your dispute to a mediator. So I agree that I think mediation is very useful, and I do see some potential, even for some of the concerns that the small mom and pop landlords'",
        "'speaker_1': 'are bringing to me. I'm not unmindful of your concerns, but I agree with Councilmember Odie. I want to see this ordinance go forward as as constructed. If the if the rack was working so well, we wouldn't have have, you know, had to come to this point.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. All right. I wanted to ask, we had a public speaker speak to the E.R. for a housing element. Not being there doesn't. Protect us like it needs to. That somehow we're not complying with secure this. How to have a response to that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Madam Mayor, first I would point you to the sequel recommendation in the staff report, and you will see that the staff report makes a finding that this the passage of this ordinance is exempt from sequel as not a project.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We stand behind that determination and we have Mr. Brown.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'From the city attorney's office who might want to speak to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Would you like to speak to this as well? Actually, I was going to defer. I'm happy to speak on it. The attorney that prepared that particular staff report is also here, Mr. Roush.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So if.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If he's in.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There, I didn't see him back there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Mr. Roush. I misspoke. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Though. He's our city attorney. I didn't realize that. And way back there. Yeah. All right.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Madam Mayor, members of the council, Michael Roush in the city attorney's office, the. With respect to the housing element issue, in fact, very clearly, the housing element does address this particular kind of matter. Housing element indicates that the city has a responsibility to maintain its housing stock, to provide a wide range of of housing opportunities, to make'",
        "'speaker_5': 'sure that persons of all income levels have housing opportunities. And this is exactly what this ordinance at least attempts to do makes those opportunities available. And so, quite to the contrary, the housing element does address that issue very clearly.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And secondarily, with respect to the ordinance itself, as we indicated last time, if there are older homes, Victorians, etc., that need additional funding, that is a consideration that both the RAC and the hearing officer can consider when they look at rent increases that a landlord might bring forward.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'More fundamentally, this ordinance, though, does not change, does not have any impact, any direct impact on any physical environmental situations. This is really a a a, you know, it's so rent control. It's a it deals with rent. It doesn't going it's not going to cause any kind of environmental concern.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And that's why.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We concluded that it's not a.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Project. And even if it could be construed as a project, there's no physical direct impact and therefore it's exempt. That risk was well. Glad to answer any questions on those two issues if you have any further questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I have other questions, but I appreciate those answers. In regards to government code 1090, if I'm correct on that, that that was the code section that suggested that, yes, that I'm a renter. And there's, uh, I understand he's one of the runner up here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think the comment suggested that because we're renters, we would be possibly subject to some criminal violation by voting on this. Could you address that?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes, Madam Chair, I believe that the information that you heard was slightly misplaced. Government Code Section 1090 is about conflicts of interest by decision makers when they're entering into contracts. That's not what you're doing tonight. You're passing an ordinance, a law.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So the application of ten, 90 to 90 is not applicable to the action that you're about to take tonight.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. I appreciate that. It's actually quite a relief.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Oh.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Also there to me, there is a legitimate issue that so this is something that we can revise. And at some point I think council may want to look at in regards to if there's consecutive one year term basis, um, there could be small fixes like that that we may want to address at some point.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Circle back at this point, I do plan to support it as is. I think that it is very important. I actually think it's extremely important that we take action tonight. I want to thank all of the members who have come out and shared their concerns for and against.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This is really, really since November 4th, I think our council has stepped up. I want to thank council for all of their work on trying to I'm going to say, exercise your best judgment to meet the needs of our community.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I want to also thank staff. This really is a lot of work. And and I think it's just extremely important. We have an unstable housing situation for many of our community members. And to me, that is something that we are trying to address and a what I'm going to describe as a balanced, measured approach.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That we do have the ability to revise, which is to me one of the things that it is very important for 11:00 motion to continue.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To make a really quick. Yes. Okay I move that we continue this meeting past 11 p.m..'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All those in favor I was announcing so. So I do think it is the role of government and our council specifically. And I commend our council and our staff for moving this forward. I really think that we have tried our hardest to add that I want to say is teeth to Iraq and honor the work that Iraq'",
        "'speaker_0': 'has served our community well since 1979 and that we are adding a layer and that we can we can continually revise this measure. It is very different from a ballot measure that would be permanent, as my understanding, versus this this weekend, continually get feedback and we can modify it and make it better.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It also includes by definition, part of it is annual reviews. I think it really is a is a very good effort by our council. That being said, we have a motion.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It would be my pleasure to move that we we need to do this.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We don't mean.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Miss Potter so that we may have adoption.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Of.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'One. Sorry, this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Got it. That one. The first thing I get.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I move that we approve final passage of an ordinance amending the Alameda Municipal Code by adding Article 15 to Article six concerning review of rent increases applicable to all rental units and rent stabilization applicable to certain rental units, and concerning limitations on evictions and the payment of relocation assistance applicable to all rental units.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Amending Section 2-23.4 concerning the duties of the Rent Review Advisory Committee and suspending Article 14 of Chapter six in its entirety and determining that adoption of the ordinance is not a project. And is California Environmental Quality Act secure?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Or if it is a project, the ordinance is exempt under sequel. And do we do? There are.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Two separate.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Separate. Okay, that was a motion madumere.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'd like to make an offer, an amendment I would like to offer as an amendment that we move to exempt owners of up to two residential units and only two units in Alameda comma for from the requirement of paying relocation assistance in the specific instance of family moving.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's an amendment that I'm offering to this main motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I would I would not support that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And and I don't want it to be part of the motion I just made.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we could address that separately. At this point, we have a motion. Do we have a second?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, second.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, that was. I'm sorry. No, that's.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah. You have to address the amendment first. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'For you. So. Okay, so we vote on that separately, then.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'trailers. That's I see a picture in the Anthony Yacht Club of the old club back in 1900 as 1920, maybe it was. And you still see them hauling boats out. These are 22 foot style sailboats and dropping them.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You see in the pictures the old people looking like it's like the 19th century and they're dropping the boats onto trailers, which they probably ran off the pier to, to, to, to park them. Parked boats are not stored.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's just another way of having a boat. It's not. It's something. And it's I've had a pocket boat like this for years. I love it. It's nice. Small boats that were built to put on trailers at a rate in the Alameda in the estuary.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They they're the most fun to sail in the estuary. I mean, if you if we can't have them any more because there's no room on land, you're going to have to get a giant boat to a big boat.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'For me, a big boats, 35 foot or 30 foot, a bigger I have an 18 foot boat that's on the trailer. And you know, your tack, you're talking about destroying what is not a specific niche of sailing because they're going to leave the boats in the water.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's the plan. They're not getting rid of them. That's the niche. The group that's going to be meshed is us with the dry sailboats and we say dry sailing. We don't say dry storage. And when we said these drinks, the dry sailboats go, you're going to have much less sailing for a middle class, working class people I'",
        "'speaker_5': 'mean in sailing will be just looking at the American Cups from were from big yachts. That's nonsense. This is would be a terrible mistake to lose that sprawling mess of sailboats you're going to see when you take it to it they're making.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Andrew McKinley. Andy McKinley and then Dan Goldfield.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Not used to speaking in front of people. So just pretend I'm in my underwear. We're kind of getting off track here. The before the council tonight, you have a revision suggestion and we wanted to provide guidance for accommodating state tidelands and shorelines shorelines as a geological feature.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It's something that doesn't. You can't pick it up and move it somewhere else. You're not going to build an elementary school next to a. Active volcano. You're not going to build a marina next to. The pyramids in Egypt.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It just doesn't work that way. We have the very fortunate. Position of having this marina in our whole northern waterfront is on a channel that is maintained by the Army Corps of Engineers historically pleasure, craft, pleasure, marinas, where the areas were dredged out, especially the bay is particularly bad about infill or silting in.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The Corps of Engineers used to dredge places like St Landrum Marina, which I'm sure you're familiar with, is about to close down because boats can't get in and out of Marina, unfortunately. And Alameda has depths ranging from eight to.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Five feet to get out of the marina into the bay for hundreds of yards that will no longer be dredged by four of engineers. However, this estuary is a commercial channel used by the Coast Guard. In the foreseeable future, this is not going to change.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The Corps of Engineers will always maintain that channel as long as that commercial usability remains. And I don't see the Coast Guard base going away anytime soon. We're talking about ships out there and ships that draw, which means that they are underwater.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Submerge Think of an iceberg somewhere between 25 to 35 or 40 feet. I believe the dredged channel is maintained between 40 and 50 feet, 40 and 53 feet. That if you look at a chart, unfortunately, I don't have a picture for you that I can show you.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The dredge line. The channel. Goes right up to the end of the docks in Alameda Marina. They're right on that channel marker. So that is always the same with Grand Marina and to some degree, Fortman Arena. That channel comes right up.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It's actually closer to Grant to Alameda Marina than it is to the Coast Guard base. So that channel is going to stay open. We have this unique area that we can bring boats in as they get larger and larger and have greater drafts, which means that they're deeper in the water.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Mega-Yacht There's the opportunity for building a marina in a place by Wind River that could be used for those. But that deep water is important. It's something that is given to us that we just we can't let that go.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It needs to be. Kept for boating and waterfront use. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you. And Maggie's next.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Honorable Mayor Spencer and esteemed Council members. Thank you for.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'I come to you today against the development on the Command Street property that we're talking about. I come not only as a student of Aikido, but also as a parent of students of Aikido and as an Alameda math teacher.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I teach at Island High School. Among the many businesses nestled at this place, Alameda Ikigai has an established dojo. Aikido is a noncompetitive martial art and is the only such dojo on the island. For the last 15 years, Alameda Ikigai has trained hundreds of children and adults.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The training focuses on developing the mind, body and spirit. The emphasis on awareness and engagement helps students young and old, with becoming more grounded and responsible community members. In the years I've been involved with Alameda Psychic, I've seen many young children start and develop self-control and confidence.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Our students are not bullied, nor do they become bullies. There are kido mind and body helps them improve their schoolwork and athletics, as many of the parents have noted over the years. We have students from Anson, Ojai, Alameda High Schools, as well as nearly every junior high and elementary school on the island.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'As a student of Aikido, I feel empowered with the confidence to intervene in a nonviolent ways to resolve conflicts. As I know, I can both defend myself while keeping others safe. As a parent, I've seen dramatic improvements for both of my daughters in their behavior and in their schoolwork.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'As a math teacher, I use Aikido daily in inspiring my students to do their best by redirecting their negative energy into productive energy. This dojo is a locate. The Dojo location in space on comment is an important not just for Aikido practitioners but for Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In the rush to increase density and create locations to put people. I urge you to consider what will those people do? People need to do more than just eat, sleep and shop. Aikido is an essential service to Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Moreover, Alameda has been recognized as a northern elite school and as a premier dojo in North America. Sponsoring seminars periodically. These seminars brings people to Alameda from all parts of the United States and from abroad. These people stay and eat in Alameda, thereby helping Alameda economy.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Developed. Developing the location on Clment would force the dojo to close. Move out of Alameda. Downsize their space or raise dues. All of those options would be a loss for Alameda. Thank you for your time.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'As far as technology.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'It's clear there are many.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Boating enthusiasts here in Alameda. However, I am concerned that if this referral seeks to change the multi-family overlay zone that was so.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Crucial.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'To the state approval of the housing element, then I would oppose that change. And I think it's very important to recognize that Alameda does need housing and and you have recognized that as well. Hopefully some of the voting can be preserved, but there is clearly a need for housing.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So please keep the multifamily overlay soon as is. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Matt. And Liz Taylor.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Good. Late evening. I'm here to talk about as a father of the Aikido Dojo, Clement Street, I have two children, age nine, daughter and age five, who are both in Aikido. They attend three days a week. The acquittal since they have started have learned discipline in the space that is used.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There is perfect space for the amount of students, which is several students and adults who benefit from Aikido. I do not see the point of having more retail stores when there's already Park Street, Webster Street in very large development on Webster Street near the Tube and also South Shore.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So having retail place there and also a million and a half million dollar houses that a majority of the people cannot even afford. I do not find that beneficial. And it also, I think the uniqueness of Alameda since I've lived here, part of it will be lost if retail stores are put there and houses that most people'",
        "'speaker_5': 'cannot afford. So thank you for listening.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Liz Taylor. And someone is sitting there talking to you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Oh.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Ryan's. Go ahead. And then Amy Rose. After you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'All right. Thank you, Mayor and City Council. We've heard a lot of commentary already, and I think the value of the marina from its historic aspects have been covered as well as the the boating community. But I also like to talk about some of the synergy between the businesses that are there now and the other places on'",
        "'speaker_6': 'the island. There's a great deal of synergy that goes on between other maritime businesses, for instance, with bay ship and yacht, with West Marine, with ones that are on and off the island all around the Bay Area. Some of the sail makers are world renowned.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'People come from New Zealand and Australia to buy sails in Alameda. There are just a myriad of businesses there that are just critical worldwide. We're being in being pushed all the time to increase the blue economy, to increase exports with the new Pacific Trade Agreement coming online.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We need to have maker spaces, manufacturing, light industry that we can create exported products to send these things overseas and to bolster our own economy. There's so much more that we could do as a city to promote these kinds of light industries and things that are made here in the United States for export.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The Army and Marine is a great example of that. Many of the businesses there are actively exporting things all around the world and attracting new business relationships as a result. So I know time is tight, so I'll just stop there and hope that you will do what you can to preserve the marina and businesses that are there'",
        "'speaker_6': 'and look at all the relationships as a intermingle across the island. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Amy Rose. And then Peter Butler.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you for the chance to speak. I own a Victorian a half block from the marina and I'm speaking on behalf of some neighbors. I'm also co-owner of a sailboat, and we've heard today about how much Alameda is a sailing and boating town.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It's got six yacht clubs. I'm a member of.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'One of them.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We admire the pretty billowing sails and the colorful houseboats and the fun power boats. But do we support the Marine community or do we start driving them away? Do we bulldoze these historic.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Buildings and.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Marine services and all types of other businesses there and replace them with condos and coffee shops? Will the view from my house for my street change from the sailboat masts and the Oakland hills to a five story multi-unit building?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Well, they are parked in front of my house. I support jobs and not condos. I have friends who work at the Alameda Marina.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There's going to be housing built.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Down Clements on and on both sides of the Alameda Yacht Club, on the base and everywhere there's vacant land. I want to commend this letter to the editor from the Alameda Journal by Mark Greenside Reasons to Rezone the Marina and Arsenal and Ship Ways Properties.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It's got nine big reasons for why to take the residential out of the plan and build the residential elsewhere. Economic Diversity. It looks like we will already have planned the number.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Of market rate.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Housing that we want to have by 2023. We've already identified it. Most of almost all the housing in this development would be market and moderate priced. It's not needed to satisfy the housing element. Also, the skilled jobs we've heard about and the gridlock that this will contribute to the the possibility of an earthquake that would.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Really make that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'About seeing the rising sea level. Did we want to build this much right.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Next to the water?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hazardous waste on the side that needs to be cleaned up.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Drinking water, public land and smart growth. So as I talk to the sailors around Alameda, they all think that this is a done deal. They're all going, oh, too bad about Alameda Marina. We heard about it. Where are we going to take our sailboats to be worked on?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And it's not a done deal. And I hope that the Council will consider Mr. Matter Mallory's proposal.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Peter Butler. And then right around.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Mr. Spencer. Council members, thanks for the opportunity to talk about this. I think it's an important issue. My name is Peter Butler. I lived in Alameda since 1998 and I've had at least one boat in the Alameda Marina the entire time.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'When I first moved here, I kept my hobby cat on a trailer in the mail. Mary's dry storage. It was easy to trailer across town. Launched behind the high school. Or take it off the island and go anywhere.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Anywhere around the bay. My wife and I had our second date on that boat and we launched it at the Grand St Marine at the foot of the Grand Street for the Grand St there. Over the years, we've graduated to larger sailboats.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We now have a very nice 30 footer that we keep in the water at the Alameda Arena. Easy access to our boat is one of the reasons we've stayed in the Alameda Marina. When we take friends sailing, there's room for them to park.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's a short walk and with everyone's gear to the boat. And if I have something heavy to move, I can back my car up to the end of the dock. And because these things are possible, I'm able to keep my boat in great shape and ensure the safety of my family and friends.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There's no other marina on the island where I can do this. But just as important as the easy access is the fact that over the years I've had excellent service from the businesses in the Alameda Marina, particularly Fenton's boatyard.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's where I get my boat hauled and painted my engine and prop serviced, my rigging built and repaired. I buy parts and supplies at the chancery. And I use their metal workshop and things break from time to time.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They employ excellent craftsmen and I've come to rely on their skill and knowledge. Lastly, I do a lot of work myself because Fenton's will actually let me work on my own boat. This is what we talk about. Well, this is what we mean when we talk about a working waterfront.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And as a long time resident, I recognize the value of this unique asset. I'm opposed to any plan which risks this for the sake of a bunch of condominiums.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Dwight Grant and then Irma, Maureen Nolan and then Andy McKee.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Hello, council members. My name is Dwight Durant. I come representing Club Natick and Club Natick is a yacht charter business on the other side of the island over in Bowling Alley Marina. For the last 35 years, Club Natick has made its home in Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And prior to that, my father and his father also owned and ran businesses related to the maritime industry in Alameda or on the estuary. All of our businesses have relied on the services provided by Alameda Marina to be successful and provide jobs for Alameda NS and for people who serve the sailors and maritime enterprise people.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The other reason I go to too, Clement Street is because I'm also a member of the Naval Reserve. I came back to Alameda to participate in the maritime industry here after serving on active duty for many years. So it's very important to me that that waterfront continue its tradition of providing a reference point for the maritime industry'",
        "'speaker_8': ', both both militarily and as an industry. That's extremely important to me. My father also served and reported to the Reserve Center there. Club, now teak provides a number of avenues for people to access maritime the maritime industry. We have the largest school in the Bay Area and we have the largest pleasure fleet of charter craft available for'",
        "'speaker_8': 'we have over 1500 members, which means that members are coming from all over the Bay Area and in fact all over the country to come to Alameda to charter boats and start their vacations. That's tourism dollars that are coming here behind me.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'There are many craftsmen and craftspeople who perform work on the boats that that club not take has in has here in Alameda. And a lot of those industry, a lot of those craftspeople perform their work on our boats when we take them to Swenson's take to get work performed.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We bring our boats from our other base in Sausalito to Alameda to have work done here because we prefer suspensions and the and the other services that are available in Alameda Marina to the alternate boatyard. Of the hundreds of jobs that we have provided that my family has has consistently been able to find craftspeople, tradespeople, yachtsmen and'",
        "'speaker_8': 'yachts, women who are able to fill the tasks and jobs that we need in order to run successful business. Alameda has always been able to provide those because of its maritime industry, and to lose any part of the Alameda Marina complex would be a serious dent in our ability to be competitive in this in the Bay Area'",
        "'speaker_8': 'and would almost certainly mean that a ripple effect happens when you lose Alameda marina. The ripple goes outward across the island, across the trades, people who work in that industry. Thank you for your time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Irma. Irma? No. And Irma. And after Irma. Andy McKee.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Mayor Spencer. Council members. Good evening. My name is Irma, Maureen Nolan, and I'm a.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Replacing? We're putting in tons.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Of houses right now. I do want to mention traffic again because it's a serious problem when a vista we have two huge housing units going in, one almost complete one still in the planning stage. We just had the warehouses knocked down at the.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Ugly. They were blights.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'I have had extensive work done at at Swenson's and I also am familiar with almost all of the tenants in the marina are currently. In addition not just to the maritime tenants but also to some of the other light industrial tenants I've heard.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Hot Rod Shop referred to. That's actually a.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Moderately moderate competitor to my company, but we also cooperate across the island. We've collaborated on a number of projects. They build stuff for us. We build stuff for them. It's a it's a dynamic community.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I think that the.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Loss of the shoreline access and particularly the historic use of that, that is is a very, very great concern, particularly in regards to the state ordinance that that you refer to in your proposal. It is with the loss of this coupled with the loss of Nelson's a few years back.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There is no other out. There is no other resource in the East Bay. You have to go all the way to Richmond to haul your boat. And that's that's just the fact. The the the reality is.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'As as referred to in the ordinance, the jobs that would be lost are not low paying jobs.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And and replacing them with $15 an hour retail jobs generously.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Is no comparison to replacing machinists.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That makes upwards of three times that. And I think.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That if you lose the light industrial flavor of the waterfront, you lose quite not just the jobs, but quite a bit of the historical historical use of that. And the historical access of it is provided in the state charter.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I have a concern with the liability involved in that and subsequent legal action. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Leaving Mayor and council staff. Tom Charron. I've messed around in boats since I was 16 and I'm 72 now, so I've spent a lot of time on the water. I have had a boat or two in Alameda since 1993 and currently have one on the heart.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I got one on the water. Member of a couple of yacht clubs. I've talked to you before, and I don't think I need to go through all the things that have been said so eloquently by the members of the of your audience here this evening.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But I do want to just bring a couple historic things up since 1993. In 93, there used to be four boatyards in Alameda. Right now, there's only one and a half. Because Gran got cut in half, you know, when you allowed or the planning board allowed those houses to be built there.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So it's down to about half its fans is here. There used to be two Chandlers in our city. There's only one that spends, Charnley spends. It hasn't been said here tonight, but spend his warehouse. He sells and sends maritime equipment around the world and supplies all of the the other boatyards in Sausalito and Cama and Berkley with'",
        "'speaker_5': 'with parts and sends parts to boaters around the world. So we have a tremendous resource here. And I would certainly ask you to look hard at what Bill Poland really has up his sleeve. What this council did in 2012, without from what I can understand of the input that you have here tonight when this property was zoned'",
        "'speaker_5': 'AMC's. Mixed use and look and ask the staff to look closely at what does our city council want to preserve of the maritime community and its assets and support? Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So at this time we have two speakers left. If you want to speak on this, please turn in your slips. Gretchen Lipow and then Don Chesney. Good evening.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Council mayor and council members and staff. I'm going to just touch on what is what is the Tidelands Trust. So here's a map. And you may have all seen that. Maybe you haven't, but. Thank. Hmm. As you can see, the Tidelands Trust covers about half of the marina, and the line was fixed in the early 1900s.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And it can't be changed. Within that tidelands, the. The. There's to be no residential. It's just marine activities. It's been expanded to cover environmental, environmental and recreational. Activities. The land in California, the State Lands Commission has jurisdiction over the UN granted tidelands.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The word they used for the non tidelands is uplands. Tidelands in uplands. So and this commission has jurisdiction over the public trust. So basically listening to the speakers and looking at the information that I've had, the. The housing element had 240 housing units on the Alameda Marina.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I think that's a terrible idea. And I'll tell you why, because if you look at what's coming down on Clement, you've got almost over a thousand housing units all along. Clement with the boat, works with the Clement and Willow with the 2100, Clement with the internal terminals with the Del Monte.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You know, my son in law took his kids to off island for a field trip. He said it took the bus 40 minutes to get off this island and these thousand units haven't been built yet. So I think what we're talking about is a balance between jobs, which the marina has.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You've heard all the previous speakers, I don't have to tell you. And and so jobs and housing. And I think that's what we're talking about here. And that is preserving a very valuable piece of property here on the island.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And as you can see on that map, half of the buildings are in the tidelands and half are in the uplands. And that map I just gave you and also I found that in 1980, 2012, in August, there was a law passed that the the city has to account for all of the money that's raised on the'",
        "'speaker_6': 'tidelands area. So that's a new law. All right. So I think that's basically what I'm here to to say is to you get the picture. Preserve alameda marina for what it is. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And our last.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Speaker at this time, Don. Last chance. Turn in your slips.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Good morning.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Morning.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you for being so generous with your time.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Don Chesney. I am a sailor.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I was fortunate enough to happily fall into the sport in my mid-thirties.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Totally changed my life. I had women that were very generous and took me on and taught me.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'When I knew nothing.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And now I get back as I teach women.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I have an all female crew. I have a J 24. It's a stripped down sailboat that is on the heart.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Which with all that goes away, I will no longer have a boat.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I only take women well as I'm desperate. But it's just been such a life changing event for me, and I see it happening with my crew. And it would be terrible if that went away. The other thing we do, which George mentioned is Island Yacht Club, which is in the marina, we have the only West Coast'",
        "'speaker_6': 'International Line Sailors Regatta. The East Coast has several. We are the only one on the West Coast.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Last time we ran the regatta, we do.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It about every other year. We had what, George six countries represented.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'What? Boston. That's in the country. Ha ha.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Ha ha. The bay. Canada. So an. And these are like the.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Bravest people you have ever met in your life. These are mostly adults that have lost their sight as adults and then have their world has opened back up when they sailed.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Because sailing is very intuitive.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'My second mentor made me see my.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Eyes closed all the time because he's like, Stop thinking. Work with nature. So the other thing that we do at Island Yacht Club in Alameda is we have once a year women's sailing seminar. It's two days. It's all women teaching.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Only women. The guys are fabulous. They do all the hard work behind the scenes, making sandwiches, setting up tables. So what you guys do? We couldn't do it without the guys. So but again, it's that give back of women being the example for women.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And what I love about it, what saved the whole thing is.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Some of the women come Saturday morning and they are scared to death. They just don't even want to really get on a boat.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But maybe boyfriend made them go or something. By the end of the day, their partners show up and we have fabulous appetizers and the guys can hardly recognize their women because the women are like, Yeah. So it's just a wonderfully empowering thing that I think would be horribly, horribly sad to lose.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. All right, Steph.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. And thank you for everybody coming out. Um, this is something that. And staying. Yeah. This is something that we have all been thinking about for a long time. And I know the vice mayor has been thinking about this referral for a long time.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So a couple of things that, as you know, I don't know if the folks in the audience or at home actually understand sort of the referral process. This is not this is not our chance to do a staff report.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'This is really a time for council member to ask. And then the council has to direct staff to what they want us to do. But just as a sort of prequel to that, I just want to remind folks maybe in the room who don't know and of course, the council does know that we are taking a tour'",
        "'speaker_9': 'of Alameda Marina and all of the Northern Waterfront. And we I say the council and the staff concerned will be taking a tour of Aluminum Marina and all of the northern waterfront on March 11th. From 9 to 1, the we'll be leaving here from city hall, getting on a bus and we've already made arrangements to stop at'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Albion. A marina will be there for probably about a half an hour, then won't be moving on and single terminals moving on from there to ship ways and to north housing excuse me, an Alameda landing. So that's number one.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I think staff felt it was really important for the council to actually go out to the site and actually see the marina, see was what was across the estuary. So that was kind of the idea behind that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And then after that, what we are envisioning for the council and vice mayor is to probably come back to the council in April. Most like to be the second meeting in April, but if we can do it, the first meeting and I think kind of talk about what we saw, what we toured.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Understand the zoning behind that and listen I think to you all and ask for direction about the northern waterfront in particular the landing. We would like. I think that's.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In Alameda Marina, not Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Aluminum Marina. That's right. Thank you. I'm getting tired so that that would happen probably in mid-April. And at that point, I think we would expect the council to to give us direction or actually potentially even give the property owners sort of some insight about what you're thinking about for these particular properties as it relates to the zoning'",
        "'speaker_9': ', you have a lot of flexibility in the zoning and and we will talk about that at that council meeting. And so that would be the first time that this would formally come back, and that would be in April.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And then subsequent to that, if depending on how that meeting goes and we can talk about changing the zoning and putting some, what does that look like modifying the zoning? That's a longer process. And I'm not really actually prepared tonight to talk about what that looks like.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But we see that sort of as kind of an outline of how we would like to deal with with this issue, if that's a better able to the council and to the vice mayor. I mean.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes. So my intent in listening to considerations was just basically frame the discussion because I think the zoning details and the guidance, there's flexibility built in to zoning for practical reasons. But I'd like us to refine what the goals are of our zoning, particularly in the northern waterfront, particularly where there is existing commercial activity that can be'",
        "'speaker_4': 'grown as opposed to other. You mentioned Dennis now terminal where the commercial activity has gone. So what is it that we want to see there on a blank slate versus what is it that we want to keep and grow in other areas?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I also want to include for people's thoughts and considerations. If this goes forward, is other zoning that may happen that's not in place now. And I can think of Taylor Webster, where there's a mixed use project that is being reviewed in the planning board right now.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's the retail commercial on the ground floor and residence above on a lot that has been vacant or underutilized for for several years now, a blight, essentially. So I want to anticipate that in the discussion, not just the northern waterfront, we do have time if the timeline you suggest is amenable to the council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Member. Ashcroft.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mayor Spencer, and thank you. Thank you to all you stalwarts who stayed so long. And I appreciate hearing from all of you. I have been out to door. Very impressive. Liz Taylor is doesn't begin she's so humble but she is amazing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And just a year ago, her company was, I think, awarded the East Bay Innovator's Design Award or Innovation Award in their category from the East Bay Economic Development Alliance. We're very proud to have you in our community and and we want to keep you there.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I also want to just remind people. That. I think we should definitely ask the staff to come back and look at these things with us, everything this former dam says we should do. But I also want to remind folks that nothing is simple.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We always strive to achieve balance. And in this case, I think first and foremost, we need to preserve our maritime businesses. And then just a week ago, Debbie Potter, our economic development director, and the mayor and I were out at the East Bay Economic Development Alliance Innovators Awards for this year.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And another Alameda company went in in one of the categories that the nanotechnologies out in your Mariners Square loop. But anyway the I would actually like to and this goes back to something that is near and dear to the vice mayor when we had an economic development commission.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But these businesses who were there at the meeting, Marina, Liz Taylor, talked about the synergy that they create. They, they work with other maritime businesses, the the blue blue industry. They and and this is a declining industry in the Bay Area.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'As more and more of the coastline is is used up, I think they can help us reach out and maybe bring businesses here who they know, who I'm always willing to still businesses from other cities. Oh don't quote me but but you know we have this asset to to offer balanced with the jobs we need to create'",
        "'speaker_1': '. And my priority would be maritime based businesses, because, quite frankly, RV parking can be done anywhere. It doesn't need to be there on the waterfront and a few others might fall into that category. But then also bear in mind that there is a cost to renovating the infrastructure that is Old Wharf.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Some of it is started to be renovated. Not all of it has. Where does that money come from? Some of it comes from development. That doesn't mean we raise the buildings that are there, but it does mean the possibility of smart, mixed use.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Years ago, when I was on the planning board, a very smart woman or my colleague and cook, who's an attorney and a waterfront planner by profession, worked on the San Francisco ferry building, talked a lot about the eyes on the street and that you want activity in your developments all the time, not artificial, you know, barista creating'",
        "'speaker_1': 'jobs, that sort of thing. But, you know, condos, we you sat here tonight and you heard about the rents, the the the problem people are having finding affordable housing they can afford. Housing that we build, especially below market rate which some of this this will be helps take some pressure off the housing market.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I also want you to know, and I think some of you already do know, that those well-paying jobs that you talk about being out there at the marina, I heard from the employers, they have trouble finding workers even for those well-paid jobs because they have a hard time finding affordable places to rent.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we can't pretend that, you know, this is all one way and not the other. We've got to all work toward solutions. But I very much appreciate you all coming out and helping illustrate for us this very vibrant waterfront that's out there.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I'm just saying, let's let's make sure that we're preserving our maritime uses, maybe bringing some more there, but also looking at the need for the infrastructure improvements and the need for for more housing carefully planned. I look at this very much as a monopoly board was the way when when Liz Taylor took me up to the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'top level at that door and you look out this beautiful view and you could just reach out and touch the Coast Guard ship, you know, and there's a there's a great aerial photograph. Things can be can be moved around and situated.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we could have a very vibrant, functioning, well maintained space there. So let's keep an open mind. So anyway, I would I would just want the when it goes back to staff to incorporate all of those concerns.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Member Odie.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Madam Mayor. Thank you everyone for coming out and I appreciate the Vice Mayor bringing this item up for discussion. I'm perfectly fine with the recommendations that our interim city manager put forth a little bit concerned about, you know, having a formulaic approach to zoning.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But what might be another idea on this particular paper that Gretchen LeBeau handed us is that, you know, similar to what we did for packet landing, perhaps we do some sense of the council because I do agree that we need to preserve jobs.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I do agree that we need to preserve. I mean, these jobs, I mean, not just any job. I mean, these particular jobs. And that should be something that, you know, maybe that's something we can do as a sense of a council, sense of the council.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And, you know, has someone has plans to. Develop that that, you know, they keep that as a as a consideration and a priority. But, you know, reflecting what Councilmember Ashcroft said, you know, we we just went through a laborious issue of tenant protection.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And one of the things we do have that's causing that is an artificial constraint on supply. So we have to balance that. And I hope that people will be flexible as we prioritize. You know, saving these jobs, again, not any jobs, these particular jobs in these particular businesses that would be open to creative solutions to also, you'",
        "'speaker_2': 'know, fully utilizing the intent of zoning.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Everyday stock.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, thank you. Thank you, everyone, for coming out and being so engaged. It's very it's actually very informative and informative, particularly in the sense of when someone was explaining the depth of some of the water and how you can float your boat up and when how that's not readily available in other places.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And that that asset mixed with some of the business infrastructure on the land. How that then is intimately tied to the range of consumers of of maritime services, whether it's for recreational purposes or whether it's for business purposes, so that the industry cluster that's there is so intimately tied.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So it's it's not something that that. Well, I think it's also intimately tied to the area. So that leads me to one of the challenges that we need to think about is, you know, are we talking about mixed, you know, changing their mixed use designation or are we not to be talking about, you know, what must be'",
        "'speaker_3': 'done for this site to maintain its character and its history and its economic generating uses? That's the completely different set of discussion. That's more specific. It's more narrow to this area. So, you know, I, I look forward to this discussion.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And, you know, I've listened to and met with people who inform me about things like door and other businesses that are there. And these are the type of jobs that we want. These are the type of uses that we want.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This certainly reflects the character and the history of the city of Alameda, an island after all. Right. So I think this is something that we as a council need to be actively engaged in, looking to do what we must, not what we can, but looking to do what we must to preserve the maritime tradition, the maritime jobs'",
        "'speaker_3': ', the maritime connections that this place has with the residents as well as the businesses. No.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Did you want to make a comment?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I did. Thank you, Madam Mayor. Councilmember Odie just reminded me, I mean, appreciate that we are thinking about coming back to something similar to the meeting we had on Harbor Bay Club, the tennis club. And that was kind of what we were envisioning, at least as a preliminary step.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Um, and having the council kind of. Formerly. Discuss and maybe even Adobe something through maybe a resolution or something like that. Well, we're still kind of. Adding that around. But having the counsel kind of express your feelings about how you what you want to see, particularly on this site and some of the other sites.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But it would be similar to the process that we conducted on the Harbor Bay Club. Several months ago.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. So this referral, if I'm reading it correctly, it speaks to a consideration of mixed use throughout the entire city of Alameda as opposed to this site in particular that the speakers were speaking to and his staff's response then in regards to city wide.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Or are we? Is it twofold?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I think we. Well, we are going to do the. The tour of the entire Northern Waterfront. And I think we would like to spend a good amount of time on Aluminum Marina because there is some sense of urgency on this matter.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But I think it can also include and this is we're up for you know, this is up. However, council wants to handle it but it can also be a conversation about and so all terminals. Chip weighs on me.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Landing north, housing all the northern waterfront area. Now North housing is not so dmk's north housing has an R for zoning. But it is on the northern waterfront.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I want me to land in his Amex.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Almeida landing his Amex? That's correct. But north housing. Which is not. It does not. That's in hour for that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So there's not a project pending currently at the marina. But what is the status of that?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'No, we do not have a project. Not. No. No application.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Has even gone to the planning.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Board. Okay. So. I would be agreeable to looking at the mixed use zoning citywide. I think we can do that any time. I am concerned I would have concerns about during a preliminary whatever occurred on in regards to the club.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think that that's actually. Questionable if we should be expressing an opinion when there's not a project pending. And and I would agree and I would also like more information in regards to what are our current options. Just generally speaking of what happens with mixed use, can we can do we have to do we have to include'",
        "'speaker_0': 'housing in mixed use or a certain percentage? Or is it looked at on a project by project basis?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Right. I mean, I don't think we should be answering those questions right now, but I think those are the things that we can come back with you all and have that conversation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I would I would want to include that as to what is but is currently you, Kent, what it means currently.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. I think that's a fair topic to include you just saying you're saying you want that to be one of the things that stuff look.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right when this comes back and.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes, Madam Mayor, I think that's essential, because if we're looking at how we want the future to go, we have to understand what the rules are today. And we have to see if those rules are adequate for what's happening at this example that's been brought up tonight.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And look at the other examples of mixed use and what might be coming. Again, I mentioned the value of of the project at Webster and Taylor as a mixed use project. So do we is what we. The first question I want answered by this exercise is whether what we have is sufficient.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then I want to to calibrate that against what is the reality that we're seeing. And the testimony tonight gave us a picture of what's right in front of us. So that's my intention, is to get that get that exercise going.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I hope I can get support for that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. And then there was a comment that some of these buildings are maybe all are eligible for the national list of historic places. Is that something that the staff would be looking at?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We can take a look at that. I'm sure there's a fairly long lead time on that. But we can you know, we can do a little bit of research on that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I just want to ask.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Just just to follow up on the mayor's concern about what we did on the packet landing zone. I will always defer to the attorneys on the legality of anything we do. But I did think that it was useful for the developer to have a sense of where the council was, because there's no point going down a road'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that is then not going to get approval. So again, we'll stay within the the zone of whatever the attorneys tell us. They're very cautious. So I don't think the leaders astray. But I, I think I mean, when I was on the planning board, what applicants used to say is don't make us come back and back and then'",
        "'speaker_1': 'go, oh, yeah, no, we don't want to do that. You know, they'd rather a lot of money is invested in putting plans together. So I would defer to the attorneys on that one and decide.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah, I think the review of mixed use zoning in general, I think is an important discussion for the citizens of L.A. to have. So, so. So I do see incredible value in that. But having a. But having a particular discussion about this site, too, is something that seems to be really what's what's on people's minds as well'",
