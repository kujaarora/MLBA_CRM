        "'speaker_1': 'Project is not subject to the Surplus Land Act as amended and directs staff to include a $350,000 appropriation for the reshaped Project Backbone Infrastructure designed in the mid-year budget.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Good evening. Good to see you voted indeed.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Good meeting. Now good meeting, too, right?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But we hope so. Well, we'll see.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Council members, mayor, I am Debbie Potter, the city's development director. And I'm before you this evening seeking authorization to issue an RFQ for the West Midway Project. And just to kind of reintroduce everyone to the West Midway Project, it is an approximate 33 acre site located out at Alameda Point.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It is referred to or we look at it as two parcels. The first parcel, which is outlined in blue, we call the reshaped parcel. The second parcel outlined in red is the market rate parcel. Currently, that almost 33 acre property has the homeless, that Alameda point homeless accommodation, which is, among other things, 200 units of housing for'",
        "'speaker_6': 'formerly homeless people. And the proposal for the West Midway Development is to consolidate the Alameda Point homeless accommodation onto the 9.7 acre reshaped parcel and then free up the balance of the almost 23 acres for a market rate developer who would come in and develop up to 291 residential units, mixed use other commercial uses, and provide the'",
        "'speaker_6': 'backbone infrastructure that is required for the ultimate redevelopment of the reshaped parcel. So that is the West Midway Project. So quick little overview and then I'm going to go.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To the presentation. Okay. I just have to say.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I realize the map would be helpful after I put the PowerPoint together. So I'm.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Not about. Got it right. Now let's go to at.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This mask is tricky, okay, because you can't get the out.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But it's a nice photo.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Now they're going to see the second you got it. Sorry about that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So the city's the city council's vision. In the city's vision for the West Midway Project started when the City Council approved a disposition and development agreement with the collaborating partners and the collaborative, where the collaborating partners consist of Alameda Point, Collaborative Operation Dignity and Building Futures with Women and Children and the Collaborating Partners.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Nonprofit development partner Mid-Penn that DDA was approved in July of 2018. So shortly after the DDA was approved, the city issued an RFQ to identify and select a developer for the balance of the West Midway property. We received seven proposals in September of 2018.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'In February of last year, the Council selected two finalist developers. And then, unfortunately, through the balance of 2019, both finalists developers withdrew from consideration as the developer for the West Midway property at around the same time that the second developer withdrew from consideration.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The governor signed a 1486, which was an amendment to the State Surplus Lands Act, and that amendment that HB 1486 went into effect on January 1st of this year. And the new Surplus Lands Act, as amended, requires staff to analyze each of our property dispositions to make a determination about whether or not the proposed disposition is either'",
        "'speaker_6': '. The new law does not apply to it. The disposition is exempt from the law or the law applies to the proposed property disposition. Staff has determined that the Surplus Lands Act as amended, does not apply to this proposed disposition because the city had entered into a legally binding agreement prior to September 30th of 2019.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And we anticipate that the property disposition will be completed by December 31st of 2022. At the same time that the developer withdrew from consideration, the second finalist developer, the collaborating partners, started talking among themselves and looking at potential ways to develop the reshaped property essentially on their own without a market rate master developer to partner with them'",
        "'speaker_6': ', as was contemplated and is contemplated in the DDA and the collaborating partners, they looked at potential grants that were available and other strategies, and ultimately the collaborating partners concluded that the best option was to restart the developer's solicitation process that they really needed that that partner, as was envisioned in the development of the West Midway property.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And they communicated their their request to staff that we recommend a restart of the development solicitation, the developer solicitation process at the same time that the collaborating partners were looking at their ability to go it alone. Staff also began to look at ways we might recommend to the City Council that the City Council could play a role'",
        "'speaker_6': ', or the city could play a role in being a catalyst to the Reshape project, because staff recognizes that the ability to launch the Reshape project is of high importance to the city to be able to produce the 267 new housing units for formerly homeless people.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so staff looked at three different options that are discussed in more detail in the staff report. But we looked at the idea of demolishing the commissary, which is a big building out on the West Midway footprint. We looked at some secondary site preparation work that could be undertaken once that commissary was demolished.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then we looked at the possibility of funding the design. Phase one backbone infrastructure and staff has recommended and is recommending that the Council appropriate $350,000 to fund the design of the Phase one backbone infrastructure. And we're recommending that because that that activity has the longest lead time.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's it could be up to one and a half years to design that backbone infrastructure. And that is because of East Bay Mud's pace of work. And we are thinking if we could start on that Phase one backbone infrastructure and get that underway on a parallel track with the.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Solicitation for the market rate developer in the negotiations. Then we will be that much further along when we're ready to get going with the the master developer. So that that is our recommendation. And then just to reiterate, when the city clerk just read a few minutes ago, we do have four recommendations that we are seeking from the'",
        "'speaker_6': 'council this evening. The first is to direct staff to conduct a four week RFQ solicitation process to designate approved real estate negotiators for the project, to make a finding that the Surplus Lands Act does not apply to the the proposed disposition and as I said, direct staff to include a $350,000 appropriation for the backbone infrastructure design in'",
        "'speaker_6': 'the mid-year budget. And with that, I am concluding my presentation. I'm happy to answer any questions, certainly.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And Madame, quick to have any public speakers on the side.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have two.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So before we go to our public speakers, do we have any clarifying questions of Miss Potter? Let's start with Councilmember de SAC.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Several questions first. What thought has Steph given to having whatever developer is interested in the market rate portion funding the $350,000?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, if the city council does not appropriate the funds this evening as part of the midyear, then that would be an obligation of the market rate developer to undertake that design work. And that work then would not start until the developer is selected in the end and then a DDA are negotiated.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So the idea is to jump start or be the catalyst. There is also an opportunity to structure this as as a loan that would be repaid by the developer once the developer is selected. Um, that that that is an option.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Another question. Um, I can't quite recall, but what were the plans for the commissary building in the various documents that we've dealt with over the past years?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It needs to be demolished.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Mm hmm. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I have a the city manager would like to say a few words. Mr. Levitt.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'If I could just add to the first question to answer the first question. That was the concept is that we could put from the general fund as a loan. Then when you're doing the development agreement with whoever the developer is that's chosen that you could always choose at that time whether or not you would forgive the loan'",
        "'speaker_9': 'or whether you would apply that to the development agreement at that time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You answered one of my questions with that response. Thank you. Councilmember Desai Anything further from you? Councilor Brody.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. That was one of my questions, too. So can we just quickly go through the timeline? So just hypothetically, we passed this today, you know, in the RF, RF queue goes out tomorrow.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It will go out no later than Monday.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So Monday, that's the ninth. So then they have.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Four.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'More weeks on our first week in April. And then how long before we get some type of there's I assume there's gonna be a staff recommendation, right.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Right. What we anticipate is receiving proposals. Depending on the number of proposals that we receive, we will either short list or interview all of the, um, the developers who respond depending on the number. And then we would come back to council with a recommendation.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then do we have an estimate on when that would be?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think we are anticipating that we could be back to council with a recommendation at the first meeting in June.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'June. So. Okay. I'm not sure what day that is, but it's the first meeting just that's about 90 days, right? Yes. Okay. So and then hypothetically, just bear with me. If we did decide or decided not to declare the project exempt from the Surplus Lands Act, I mean, what is the timeline on that one?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh, it is.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I mean, so we would have to decide tomorrow.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So under the Surplus Lands Act, if you are if you are a property disposition that is required to meet the the notice requirements and then potentially the negotiating requirements, you have to publish a notice that is out for 60 days.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then if interest is expressed, you have a minimum 90 day negotiation period.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If someone expresses interest rate, that's correct. So if 60 days goes by and nobody expressed interest, then we've complied with the Surplus Lands Act. That's correct. Okay. So, I mean, it seems to me that, you know, whether we do one or the other, we're still going to get something in front of the council right about the same'",
        "'speaker_3': 'time. The only risk of.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Not I don't know that I would make the assumption that we wouldn't receive any interest. I believe OECD's list as it stands today is over 400 interested parties. And so I don't I don't know that we would assume that it would be 60 days and no expression of interest.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I mean, has anyone been knocking on our door to build 100% affordable at this point or so?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We're in clarifying questions of the staff report.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah, that's.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'As I would say that nonprofit housing organizations have not been afforded this automatic opportunity in the past. And so it's expanded a new opportunity forum for organizations.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then and Mr. said, you can stop the questioning when you feel appropriate. But so if, say, we did declare that it was exempt and then somebody disagreed with that, you know what? What happens then? I mean, who has standing to file some type of action?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This is our city attorney even, said Mr. Shen.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes. So if the a disagreement can come from a number of places. So for instance, if you proceed on this project that essentially any moment any party could come out and indicate to you that this property is subject to the Surplus Lands Act and ask that you comply.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That includes the Attorney General. It includes private interested parties like third party housing developers. It includes HPD. And so it's difficult to predict at what precise moment, because as soon as the city proceeds down to take the exemption, it is at least theoretically possible that someone would take that position, as Ms..'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Potter indicated, that given that we have an exemption that staff has felt pretty comfortable relying on and because that there is not a significant number of affordable actually is the other way around because this project is developing a significant number of affordable housing, it is relatively less likely, not impossible that affordable housing to offer would nonetheless come'",
        "'speaker_7': 'in challenge because we are already developing a ton of affordable housing on this project.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so the the universe of potential challengers is state agencies and then affordable housing developers.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And local agencies. So for example, the school district in theory, could or the parks district. All right. Local agencies having jurisdiction could. In theory, though, I believe we have heard no such challenge thus far.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then is there a deadline like at what point will that challenge be moot or a statute expire?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It will be for quite some time because your development process is long. You're not signing any deals for quite some time. You're currently just going out for RFP, which technically doesn't even trigger the Surplus Lands Act. So it will be quite some time before a statute is triggered.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I guess I was trying to understand at what point in this process will we know that if we did an exemption, that we're not at risk of having it challenged?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think it becomes less risky once we commence negotiations. And so and and and conclude the negotiations the council votes in 90 days passes, but a lot could happen. And this law is so new, it's difficult to determine exactly when no challenge could be filed.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But because this is so early and and again, to emphasize the RFP process is exempt from the Surplus Lands Act. So you're you're taking an action tonight that that doesn't necessarily implicate the Surplus Lands Act.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Anything further and further clarify questions, if I. We're not quite.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yeah. So if we move forward with an RFQ tonight and we're going to be back in June, can you talk to me about what is the process for staff selection? What is the criteria you're is being used? And will staff be coming back with a recommendation or just.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You know, a list of potential people for the council, too.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we staff anticipate that we would evaluate proposals, that we get back the, you know, consistent with the way we evaluate development proposals generally. We typically have a rubric that we use that looks at, you know, the experience of the team, what the very high level description of the projects that's being proposed, the ability for the team'",
        "'speaker_6': 'to finance the project, any experience on prior military basis, affordable housing development. So we have rubric and I imagine that we will probably hew pretty closely to the evaluation criteria we looked at the first time.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Around with that rubric be included in the RFQ so people know what, what is what, what they should be speaking to.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The RFQ typically talks about what your talks about, what you are required to submit by way of your experience, your financing, that kind of thing. And it's noted that that you will be evaluated, I believe, the points that are evaluated, but I don't think the rubric per se is include the.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Points for each thing is.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think. So we will double check.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think that would be good. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then it's our intention as staff to come back with a recommendation. Yes. Based on our evaluation process.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay, perfect. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Anything further, Councilmember de SAC.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Yes. On the RFQ criteria, does staff contemplate tonight or some other time getting input from the city council as to some of the qualifications different Council members might have want to see in prospective respondents stuff?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So if if the council recalls the first time we went through the RFQ process, we had a subcommittee that council members Odie and Datadog were part of, and that subcommittee developed some subsequent questions, and those are the responses to those questions.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Didn't see the light of day the first time around because the development teams withdrew, but we took some of those questions that had already been formulated and put them into this revised and updated RFQ. So some of the questions that the subcommittee had developed, we've added to the RFQ and are asking for those responses upfront to those'",
        "'speaker_6': 'questions.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Can you give us a flavor as to two or three of those questions for the public?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I believe.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That because you've forgotten.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So one of that one of the questions that the subcommittee was interested in learning more about was the sort of kind of the social justice and social enterprise aspects of the developers experience and what the developer was proposing that that it might want to do to better integrate or ensure proper and full integration of the reshaped parcel'",
        "'speaker_6': 'with the market rate parcel. So that's a concept that we captured in the RFQ this time around.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Anything further before we go to our public speakers? Okay. That's ever public speakers.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Miss Potter.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Abby, Pat Lurie and Doug Biggs. Good evening, Madam Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Council members Abby Lurie with.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Mid-Penn Housing Corporation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we're honored to be partnering with Alameda Point Collaborative Building Futures with women and Children in Operation Dignity to make reshape a reality. I think everybody knows that we're in a time of unprecedented housing crisis in the Bay Area, and there's an unprecedented amount of funding available at the state level right now to to for affordable housing'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and to address the homelessness crisis. And so we're really poised and ready to leverage these resources and bring them to Alameda so that we can realize the vision for high quality service, enriched, stable housing for the individuals and families who have experienced homelessness.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But to do this, we need the new infrastructure and we need the new community that will come along with that. And this, as Seth mentioned, we've explored a lot of different ways to try to make this work. And, you know, this is this seems like the way that will get us there the fastest.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I know there's been some setbacks, and we're we're hopeful that we can work together with staff to expedite the RFP process and are looking forward to their decision moving forward as quickly as possible. And, you know.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'll just have it again, the.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Importance of the infrastructure. We you know, we're thinking, I know a little bit short term of just we need the the backbone infrastructure to support the new housing and and hope that that's taken into account in terms of the financial capacity, the phasing, how a market rate developer is going to be able to do that because it's'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it's complicated. There's a lot to do out there, as you all know. So thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And our next speaker is Ted Biggs. Mr. Biggs.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening, Madam Mayor. Members of the City Council. My name's Doug Biggs. I'm the executive director of the Alameda Point Collaborative. We're here tonight to speak in support of the staff recommendations on moving forward. We've been at this since 2008, so another four weeks is okay with us.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Another year is not we. We do need to keep our foot on the gas pedal. As Abby pointed out, you know, we're at the highest crisis we've ever been, but there's also funding opportunities coming down the road that we don't want to miss.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We would look to see the RFP strengthened a little bit with both some of the scoring criteria clearly called out so that people know what they're they're being assessed on. And some additional questions on the capability to do the job.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, probing questions around how they propose to do phasing, maybe some additional financial. We're not, quite frankly, really interested in seeing a glossy, you know, vision of what they want to create out there. We want to see how they're going to get their shovels in the ground and make the infrastructure work.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we'd like to focus on that. We would ask that the collaborative partners be allowed to, once the applications in, to review them and provide opinions to staff on, you know, aspects of how we think they would work well with with our project and our design, we clearly.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Want to leave the final decision.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To the staff, as it should be for for making recommendations. We also strongly support the allocation of 350,000 to jumpstart the project. We believe it will provide reassurance to potential applicants that the city is serious about making this happen.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we think putting the money in now to do some of the infrastructure planning will benefit us and benefit us in the long term as far.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'As being able to move forward.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Regarding the Surplus Lands Act, I mean we have a lot of partners that are in other jurisdictions that are dealing with the same issue. This one clearly to us doesn't seem to apply with that. And the we believe the exemption is is totally appropriate.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We would be concerned if you did go forward.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Even though you don't need to, that at the end of the 60, 90 days, whatever, we still don't have a market rate developer that can build infrastructure, and that's what we need out there. So we would encourage you to adopt the staff recommendations and move forward.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Bass. And that's all our public speakers. Thank you. Okay. So now we go to council discussion. Who wants to start? I'm vice mayor.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That's why I met your council member. Avella didn't have any questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'll call the speaker. Thank you. Do you want to cede your time to. Are you even ready to speak yet? Maybe later. Catch your breath.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. So I did scroll through here. There doesn't seem to be any criteria in the RFQ, so I'm going to say I am supportive of moving forward with this RFQ. I will share that. I'm a little frustrated that we lost our last developer in September.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I feel like if the recommendation was to move forward with a revamped but very similar RFQ, that we probably could have done that in October of last year. And we are sitting here losing fact. We've lost five months, and I'd like to see movement on this as fast as possible.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think since last January, we've made very clear that this is a very important project and getting out there and supporting reshape is very important. That said, I know that we ask a lot of our staff and I want to acknowledge that as well.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But I really want to signal that I think housing has been for this council, if not the number one or one of the top two issues for the council. And and this is one of the opportunities where we have where the city has the opportunity to actually help move that forward.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I would like also to I support that I support all four of the staff recommendations, including the funding to move forward. But I'd like to see a phase two plan for how the city can help move this forward.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Outside of the funding, some of the planning around the backbone infrastructure, the $350,000, I think that's a good start, but I don't want to get caught flat footed if we go into negotiations with yet another developer and they drop out.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I want to I want to know what it would at least take. Give us the opportunity to know what it was going to take for the city to move forward and meet what I would say our 20 year promises on the Reshape project out there.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yeah. Beyond that, I'm ready to vote to move forward. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Who wants to go next? Okay. Okay. Councilmember de.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'SAC. Well, thank you. It would have been great if Alameda Point Partners was able to move forward with this project, but unfortunately, they dropped out as had another interested party. So here we are and I think we need to move forward.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And I the thing that I see in this project as a unique opportunity to not just build, uh, market rate housing, which is obviously going to be a critical part of that. This whole project is critical because that's what's going to help pay for the infrastructure, particularly for the, uh, the Alameda Point Community.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Alameda Point Collaborative part of the project. But, but I think when we go about trying to find the right developer to build the market rate portion, you know, I just don't want to have another developer whose vision is your typical, uh, kind of, you know, affluent type of housing that we've done that already with Bayport.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And quite frankly, we've done that already with other parts of Alameda landing when it comes to the residential. That's why when Councilmember Odie and I were sitting at us as a subcommittee on the previous go around, that's why one of the things that I was really interested in looking at for when developers came forward with developers who'",
        "'speaker_12': 'had some kind of open mindedness to working with looking at the project through a social justice lens. I myself am not an expert in social justice, so. So I won't pretend to know that. But I do believe that it is an important lens, not just because, you know, it's good in and of itself, but because it will'",
        "'speaker_12': 'make the market component, I believe, work with the Alameda Point Collaborative component because they're right next to each other. So as people build, you know, a new community, whether it's the residential part of the new community, or if there's going to be a jobs oriented component to the new community out there that we're bringing in developers who'",
        "'speaker_12': 'have kind of this open minded view of things, you know, who are willing to work with, you know, people who are who have proven themselves in social justice work, whether it's the Green Lighting Institute or whether it's Insite Community Center for Community Economic Development, or whether it's Angela Blackwell's Oregon Organization.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So so I appreciate staff, including that aspect in this upcoming RFQ, because hopefully that will make it richer in terms of who comes to us. And they will clearly understand what our expectations are. We we don't want to redo Bayport when it comes to the market rate site.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We want someone who has a more broader view of things.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Desai, Councilor Brody.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sure. Thank you. I don't really have too much more to add on the points that my colleagues had mentioned. It's already too late, so we don't need to beat that that horse anymore. I'm concerned about the Surplus Lands Act.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I mean, I. I see more of a downside to saying there's an exemption that may later get overruled than actually complying with the law. And, you know, following through the process that I don't think they can I think they can be done in parallel.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I would be in the minority there. I'd like to see us do the math on infrastructure design as structured in such some type of loan, whether it's a loan from the base reuse fund or whether it's something we expect the developer to repay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I'd even like us to go, you know, one step forward and demolish the commissary if if with the same type of financial arrangement. If that's something that council's interesting because I think I heard that the site prep actually is going to happen after the commissary.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Right. So I don't know if we have to make that decision today.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I would I would agree with that. Right.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So, I mean, that's kind of where I am. I just like to hopefully we'll we'll get a good staff recommendation because I think last time it was kind of left up to us. So we depend on on your expertize and analysis, and I look forward to that hearing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Councilmember Vela So apologies for having to step out of the meeting. I have wear a number of different hats and one of them is being a mom and my baby is not well tonight, so hopefully I won't have to step out again.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I was listening to the Q&A and the presentation. Um, and I, uh, a couple of things. One, I am concerned about the State's Surplus Lands Act and the just in general what this could potentially do if there's some sort of legal challenge which which I think could happen.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I it would have been nice had we known ahead of time that we could have gotten legislative clarity through like a legislative journal question, that sort of thing. But obviously, that time has passed. I still think this might be something where we should still attempt to get legislative clean up on this one item, even if we're'",
        "'speaker_4': 'moving forward as staff proposes with the exemption. I think getting some sort of legislative clarity, even if it's after the fact, would be helpful. So I hope that we're still pursuing that, even though we're moving forward on this, which I've been told we're looking at legislative clarity.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so I take staff at their word. The other, the other recommendations in terms of the, uh, the demo of the commissary, I'm fine moving forward with that. After the site preparation, I'd like to see the site preparation done.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I agree with Councilmember Ody that it should come out of, I would hope, base reuse. I would hope that it's a loan or something that we can negotiate. Those terms can be left up to staff. And I'm fine with the RFQ.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Vela. So I am also anxious to see this project move forward. We cannot overstate the need to address our housing crisis in our city and the Bay Area throughout our state. The reason I'm not as concerned about the Surplus Lands Act is that on page two of the staff report, report is the very impressive'",
        "'speaker_0': 'statistic that the Collective West Midway Project would include 558 units, of which 48% are affordable to very low and low income households. That's a huge percentage. I mean, certainly there are places in the state that are doing 100% affordable.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I just again, I still looking for that crystal ball, but I don't see the state stepping in to disrupt something like that. In fact, whenever I've talked about what we're doing at Alameda Point and usually the statistic is 25% affordable and that in itself is pretty impressive.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But the other things that do concern me is, as the vice mayor and others have mentioned, we've lost a lot of time. And I feel that time is of the essence and probably even more so going forward. I think it would be hard to escape the fact that we're in the middle of some very uncertain times with'",
        "'speaker_0': 'this corona virus pandemic, which has had a huge impact on the stock market. That impacts as a city. You know, our investments are held in securities. And and I think, you know, anyone in the construction industry is going to look at what that means to their portfolio, the cost of supplies wherever they get their supplies from.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I do think we need to move with all deliberate speed. And while I appreciate the proposals that the staff brought forward, I am wondering what council would think of being maybe even a little more aggressive. So we know that I'm just pulling up an email I sent to Ms..'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Potter earlier today that we know that we have had interest from two other developers who were not selected. That is right here. Okay. So my question to staff was, what about instead of going back for a full irf p that we actually asked the asked for updated r f Qs because this is our queue rather than our'",
        "'speaker_0': 'fee. But whichever it is from the folks who have expressed interest up till now that that we considered could tell us Brookfield and then CEI was a part of Jamestown, I believe, and came with an unsolicited offer. And I, I just wonder, I mean, we could certainly go back out to the market, do we?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think, Councilmember ODA, you actually were getting at this question. Have we seen a lot of interest expressed from others? I mean, I think someone who comes to the city just on their own volition without a solicitation is worth at least considering based on the criteria.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I would like to hear my colleagues thoughts about that and maybe just moving forward, assuming the parties are still interested. But I think it even says in the report that they are. And I also know that I heard Mr. Biggs from Alameda Point Collaborative mentioned that they would like to somehow be involved in the selection process'",
        "'speaker_0': '. I'm assuming, Miss Potter, that are two interviews take place and you have an interview panel. And will that include who would that include? Come on, back up. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we welcome the collaborating partners participation and when we on our first go around, they have an opportunity to meet with the four finalists and provide staff with their their feedback and their impressions, which went into kind of the calculus as we evaluated the proposals.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Vela.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Could could we here? I was just asking the city attorney for some clarity on whether or not the process that you've proposed, because I actually had asked previously the same question of staff and was it was told a different answer.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I just got an answer from the city attorney that it is possible.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I didn't get an answer at all. So let's compare notes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If we could hear from the city attorney, I think that that would.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Be helpful for Mr. Sharon.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I think the question that was asked is that does this exemption of the Surplus Lands Act that staff is proposing to take require that we run an RFP? The answer is no. The the Council may recall that there was a previously published staff report that indicated that an RFP is required, and at that time, that staff'",
        "'speaker_7': 'report was relying on a different exemption. Having considered further, we believe that this exemption is a more sound exemption to rely on and under this one, an RFP not explicitly required under the Surplus Lands Act.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Ms.. Potter And then Ms.. Vela.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I was just going to say that that however, the staff recommendation continues to be the same, which is to go out to an RFQ for the next four weeks and obviously encourage folks who have previously responded to update, refine, modify their submittal.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And it's just an opportunity to continue that and make sure that we've done a thorough outreach to developers who may be potentially.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I think we all understood the recommendations of the staff report. What and again, I just we might turn up that heretofore undiscovered developer or we might find ourselves marching for more weeks into an uncertain economic future and maybe even reducing our chances of putting together a viable package.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I don't and again, you know, this is just everybody's basing their thoughts on their best calculations. But I would like a discussion of the of this proposal. It sounds like Councilmember Fellow once again. And we if you couldn't tell we have not discussed this, but what you had your hand up, please.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So, Madam Chair, thank you for raising this suggestion. I think that it addresses the concern about another delay. I do know that I at least I don't have any reason to believe that the other two developers that had submitted proposals that don't have an interest, at least that that hasn't been conveyed to me.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think the opposite's been conveyed that that they did have an interest and I guess my concern is why are we redoing an RFP and wasting more time when we had four proposals? Could those proposals be more developed or nuanced?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think they I think that they they could. But I also think that some of them were open ended enough that it'd be interesting to see what they come up with. My other concern would be, you know, we've we did go out for proposals and nobody else submitted and so are we just going out and casting another'",
        "'speaker_4': 'net, which is going to take up more time? And that's my concern. So I'm I'm perfectly happy to move forward with your proposed suggestion, with the clarification from our city attorney, that that is, in fact possible, because I was under an understanding that we were legally required to put out a second RFP or RFQ.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Bell. Mr. Levitt, did you want to add anything.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I would recommend, even if you went to a, I guess, sort of a direct solicitation of the to development.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'See it, see CGI that came, as I said, came to the city unsolicited. I am.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yeah. So if you went to the three, I'd still give some time for them to respond, knowing what is occurred with the other two development, how they did not have the economics to be able to deal with this, that these could learn from that experience and build them over.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, what I what I was proposing, and I think, Ms.. Vela, I think was in sending, is that we would ask for updated essentially responses to exactly what staff has put together. Is that. Well, is that what you're thinking of?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think if there's an we're asking basically for amended responses, updated or updated based off of the new information. I'm fine with that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Okay. And otherwise, I would agree with all the staff recommendations. But the rest of the council. What do you think?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Councilman Brody, thank you. So let me understand the proposal. It's to just limit the universe to the three that submitted it before. And then what would our deadline for them to update be?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, I think if we were looking at it at four weeks, a four week window to respond, I would still do the four week window.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I mean, I guess if we're going to take four weeks, no matter what, there may be somebody out there that might respond. I don't know. But. I mean, if you could say we're going to just do that in one week, then.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, you know. Okay, that. Okay. Canterbury Council member I Vice Mayor Knox White Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I would be very uncomfortable adding in somebody who just voted in an unsolicited interest. I think it's one thing to say we had an RFP and we're not going to move forward with people who came through with that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But I think to add a third person, it's starting to get a little loose. And and to Councilmember Ortiz point, I think I don't see a scenario where we ask all of a sudden today, oh, now you've got a week to to submit information.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It seems like like like it's going to be that useful. I think if we can get this done in, if we can do it. RFQ In four weeks, I've heard that there have been some other people that have at least expressed interest.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'If we end up with the same three, we've lost a week or two at the most. But we know we know that we've actually done the broad thing. And then I would like if we were to move forward with an RFQ, I would like to have a date certain that this is coming back at the first meeting'",
        "'speaker_8': 'of June with a recommendation from staff and that, you know, that would be a part of the recommendation. But it seems like we're kind of trying to we're playing with only a couple of weeks. And with that being the math, I think it would be beneficial to just go with the RFQ and see if there are a'",
        "'speaker_8': 'couple of other people. It would also give the that whether it's Brookfield or Catullus or OCI, now that I see ICICI, the opportunity to spend a little time here from the, you know, get the, the scoring criteria, which is not currently in the RFQ, etc., and really respond knowing that they're responding to what the city's looking for'",
        "'speaker_0': '. So I will just note that I was also hearing several the council lament the fact that we've lost five months already. And I think, again, I do think time is of the essence. But to the point you raised about not wanting someone who came unsolicited to us who I think is actually doing some work elsewhere now, I'",
        "'speaker_0': 'made a point, but Mr. Chan, can you comment on that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'On whether or not.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We could also include CGI?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The council has wide ranging latitude here, so the council could direct staff to do any number of things, whether it's an update, including an unsolicited bidder, to go out to get a new bid. You have wide ranging latitude here.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'As long as that the process is fair and gives all parties an opportunity in a reasonable time to respond if you were to do it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And by the way, I notice that in the the staff report, sometimes the term RFQ is used and sometimes the term RFP is used and there is a difference. And it's the RFP that has this pretty pictures and I don't think most of us are.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But this is a request for qualifications, is it not correct? Yes. Ms.. Potter is nodding her head. Yes. Um, Councilmember Desai, Councilmember Odie, anything you want to add? Councilmember Desai One.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Point that I would add is I understand Alameda Point collaborative desire to be closely involved in this, but I think we need to be mindful that, you know, they are they are potentially material beneficiaries of this whole process.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So certainly we need to welcome their involvement, but we also need to, you know, make sure that everyone understands that, that this process is, you know, is transparent and fair in terms of the, uh, RFQ, whether it should be done on a select basis.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'The reality was that when I had voted for Alameda Point Partners, when we first did the go around actually was very close for me. It was very close between Alameda Point Partners and Catalist, and my working theory was basically that I believe in and continue to believe that entities who do good work for the city of Alameda'",
        "'speaker_12': 'are, you know, we should make no apologies in and acknowledging the good work that these entities had done. From my vantage point at the time, I thought, you know, so I had to wait very close to leave the good work that Alameda Point Partners had done with regard to site A and the different commitments that they had'",
        "'speaker_12': 'made contractually with those good works versus the good work that could tell us had done what they were putting together. Bay Port Along with Alameda Landing, I ultimately went with Alameda Point Partners because I certainly like their transit commitments, contractual commitments.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So, you know, if Catullus is still interested in this project, I have no qualms and moving forward with them. I mean, there are proven entity. People know what they. In the city of Alameda and four, the city of Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I'm not too sure about Brookfield, although I realize I think they're doing the project over there at, um, uh, Don Parker's old project.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And just for clarification, and don't stop his time while I'm talking, please. We are not here tonight just to let you know about your plan. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'You're saying go for it to have us of a select entities as opposed to a broadly open RFQ process. And all I'm saying is, I think we have before us, you know, some entities that seem to be no and I don't know cei that well but I certainly know.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Could tell us so. So if the argument is to have it to basically continue to the RFQ that we had started with several years ago by virtue of the fact that Al made a point, partners had dropped out and others had dropped out.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I'm fine with that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And just for clarification, I mean, Councilmember, somebody asked the question, I don't think we get an answer, but are there other developers showing interest because we like to make an informed and it could be yes. No, you don't need to name the names.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But Mr. Levitt, did you want to say something before him as far.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'As the three that expressly contact us, which are the three.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That are listed in the staff report?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Right. We as part of this process, we did reconfirm that the two other of the four finalists were still interested. That continues to be the case. Four finalists of the four finalists, Brookfield and Catullus, continue to be interested.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Um, C.I. has provided an unsolicited proposal, and I actually have received several inquiries from developers who are interested potentially. And we have let them know that we are recommending to staff the RFQ process and to put their name on an interest list.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Well, that's new information. So and these are developers who never have applied before this project.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'As far as I know, in I, you know, a broker says I represent someone who's interested. You know, someone else calls and says, I'm interested. I don't I can't sit here and say that they're for sure real. And once they look at the RFQ, they're still going to continue to be interested.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But we've had we've had expressions of interest.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Councilmember Vela I guess my concern with this is the fact that that's that's not as solid as an actual response to our request. And we had a previous request out there. My concern is, are they hoping that our new RFQ is going to be giving them more things that they wouldn't have gotten before?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And are we then kind of setting ourselves up for less? And that would be my concern with that. I also think that time is of the essence, and I'm wondering if we have that shortened process. You know, the vice mayor had asked could it come back by date certain in July.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I'm wondering, we already heard just sorry, June 1st week in June. I'm wondering if it couldn't come back even sooner than that, if we're talking about an update and just three, three, two or three groups. I you know, my concern with C.I. is that they didn't submit something early on if there was something that we liked'",
        "'speaker_4': 'about that package and therefore staff is trying to include them. I'd like to know, you know what? Let's put that on the record so that we can make sure that that's what we're going to get in the update.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I think it is I think the the updated RFQ that you've proposed already exemplifies some of the things that we're we're looking for. So I think that if, you know, if these other two are interested and want to be competitive, they're going to look at that and provide us with an update that answers it and either'",
        "'speaker_4': 'meets those meets those things or doesn't.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I would just add that I would be hard pressed to omit someone who specifically has come forward showing interest and I think has shared financial information, if I am correct.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And to clarify, C.I. was initially part of the James team, right? That's and then James.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's right.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Forward with AP. I think C.I. had a lesser role and then their proposal that they submitted was a reflection of some other thoughts and ideas they had separate from there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So they they were a part of the initial process, councilmember capacity.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sorry, did you have your hand up or you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'll just say.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Even if you did.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I agree with the vice mayor that I'd like a date certain. So I guess the option is open it up to others and then we kind of start over, right? Or we take the three people that already did the RFP and ask them to update it and then.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'With a date certain.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Also what the dates are. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And does that ultimately bias? A lot more time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I mean, I think I think it does. Councilor, finish what your thoughts are and then. Councilmember de. I see.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Because now I understand the question solved.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Yeah. You know now that you mentioned that C.I. has has was part of the original RFQ in some way, I'm satisfied that that, you know, they're not going to be this oddball, this outlier.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Whereas when I was.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Whereas Qatar and and the other entity had been intimately involved, um, just for history sake, this wouldn't be the first time that we had closed RFQ RFP process. When we did Bayport, it was started that in 1997, Bayport was actually not part of FISC.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So we did the RFP process for the FISC in 1997. And then in February of 1997, we decided that we were going to we were going to include what turned out to be Bayport as part of the FISC RFP process.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And but, but we had limited the, the respondents to the three entities who had responded to the FISC original FISC, which is our data landing, original FISC RFP and that was Catalist Lincoln Properties. And one name escapes me.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So this wouldn't be the first time. And I think the product speaks for itself.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Vela I just.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Like to make a motion. My motion would be that we direct staff to ask for an update from the three entities, the three developers that have previously submitted responses, and that we have this come back to us. I actually would like it to come back to us in May.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is that realistic? Ms.. Potter, where are you? Oh, there you are. And I will note that in the staff report, because it was one of the questions. And, Mr. Levitt, you have the floor in just a minute. But I had a question that it did say that the staff would be coming back with their recommendations by the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'end of the first quarter of 2020, maybe that month of fiscal year 2020.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That was that. I thought I had changed that. That was a holdover.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That was there.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'From the holdover from February. Okay. So it really is the second quarter. And I mean, we can absolutely strive for the second meeting in May. I'm just going to say that our internal with the package being published 12 days ahead in our internal process of being out with a staff report a month before internally is really what'",
        "'speaker_6': 'the constraint is for us. But we I understand the urgency with which the Council is approaching this and we will endeavor and do our darndest to be back at the second meeting of May. But that's our challenge, is really the lead times for this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I do understand the lead time. I just this these particular economic times were in make me really nervous, Mr. Leavitt.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I had actually been doing the math on here, and we hadn't had a chance to look at it or talk, obviously, because it's while you're talking.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This is real.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Time. So March 9th, if I was able get out March 9th based on the statement, which is a monday and you just did three weeks, you could get to March 30th, which then gives about a three week review to get it into the pack and process which gets you to the second meeting, a May.'",
        "'speaker_0': '2nd meeting in.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'May. But that would mean you have about a three week review process of the RFP, which means that Debbie is going to have to reorient some of her priorities, which definitely can happen. But I've heard you talk before at goal setting about we want to stick to deadlines.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And when you give us an expectation, we want you to be able to meet it. That's a tight expectations.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I appreciate that, too. I think we have a number of factors going on that there has been a bit of a delay getting to this point. But I feel like much of the heavy lifting has already been done because you've had this subcommittee you worked with to develop the RFQ.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so it's not as though you're starting from square one. And this council's priority, as I recall, is housing, housing and more housing. And so I you know, I give you credit for managing your staff, but I think this and it's just such an integral part of moving forward on our Alameda Point development.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I would like to see all deliberate speed put together toward this. So we and I'm looking the second May meeting is May 19th. Correct.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And that would be Tuesday. Yeah. That'd be the third Tuesday persons.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Which is it. Yeah. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I'll second if there's.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. We have a motions move by Councilmember Vela, seconded by Councilmember. So discussion. We're ready to vote and then the rest of the and everything else is just as proposed in the the the staff report, correct.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. All right. It's been moved and seconded. All in favor. I, I didn't. And Councilmember Vice mayor and that's why.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Can I ask a quick question? This is definitely coming back on the 19th of May.'",

During this process of evaluating the various possible firearm safety proposals, we've had discussions with many stakeholders, including various Alameda community groups as well as Big Five, and we appreciate their input and their efforts in promoting gun safety and helping Alameda become'",
        "'speaker_12': 'safer. The Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, one of the country's leading policy organizations dedicated to gun safety, has issued a letter supporting the two proposals before you today. And we appreciate that letter. I'd like to now discuss how these two draft ordinances are currently written.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'First is the safe storage ordinance, which aims to reduce wrongful, intentional and unintentional discharge of firearms, including suicides, and to help reduce stolen firearms. Specifically, it requires that firearms be stored in a locked container or disabled with a trigger lock unless lawfully carried on the body of a person.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We are mindful of the Supreme Court case of Heller v Chicago, which held that the Second Amendment protects the right to use the firearm within the home for self-defense. This ordinance allows for self-protection because its safe storage requirement does not apply when a firearm is lawfully carried on the person.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'One thing we'd like to note is that the ordinance applies to safe storage within the residence. If counsel would like to give direction regarding expansion or contraction of that. We are happy to take that direction. The ordinance does propose several possible penalties, including administrative citations, up to the maximum amount allowable under the code currently, as well as'",
        "'speaker_12': 'infractions or criminal prosecution. One item that I'd like to highlight is that the ordinance does have a safe harbor provision that protects gun owners from criminal prosecution under the section. If they do report lost or stolen guns within 24 hours from which they knew or should have known that the gun was missing.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'This safe harbor provision is intended to encourage prompt reporting of any lost or stolen guns. The second ordinance before you today is the firearm dealer video surveillance ordinance, which aims to deter and resolve any issues of straw purchases, which is where an individual purchases firearms on behalf of someone else who may be ineligible and which may lead'",
        "'speaker_12': 'to firearms being in the hands of unsafe individuals. This law may also help solve a deter other crimes such as theft or battery, which may occur on the premises of the firearm dealers. The ordinance specifically requires video surveillance of critical business areas such as where firearms and ammunitions are stored, sold or transferred or carried.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'It also requires that facial features of purchasers or transferees be recorded and stored. The ordinance does recommend that the does require that the video record at a rate of 15 frames per second and that images be stored for one year.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And the ordinance also would require a conspicuous warning that the premises are being recorded so that people who are coming into the premises have fair warning. I'd also like to note that these two audits are only the first round of staff recommendations.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We do have current efforts ongoing regarding organization of a community event, specifically a safety fair, which would be targeted towards not only gun safety but other general safety proposals. This feature is currently being discussed to be held some time in April, but it's very tentative and I think further discussions are ongoing between other staff departments and members'",
        "'speaker_12': 'of the community. So further updates may come and that day is obviously very flexible. We may move that. And I'd also like to to note that the council's high priority items, the other high priority items from the November 19th meeting, we are very much still considering them and evaluating them.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'That does include funding for gun violence, restraining order, education and outreach training initiatives regarding training, not only how to use firearms, but also how firearms and domestic violence and substance abuse and mental health issues are intertwined and requiring separate display and sales of firearms.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And so these items do require additional time for evaluation, given that they do require more operations, administrative and resource considerations. And so we will further collaborate with other city departments and come back with further proposals. With that said, if you have any other questions, I'm happy to answer them.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you and Mr. Hang any questions of the staff report for grew as speakers Council member DASA.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Thank you very much. You mentioned that you had obtained input from Big Five. Did Big Five give any comments with regard to the way in which weapons are store displayed? Particularly with regard to maybe having a designated area that's separate from.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Did they comment on that at all? No, I can't remember. We have still to figure out how we should approach that. Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I have a couple questions in the. The sales surveillance ordinance. It indicates that video surveillance would also be directed toward the parking lot of Big Five. So say I was pulling up to go out and buy a yoga mat, getting out of my car in the parking lot.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I would be video surveilled for that.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'It's possible that audience is not so specific as to what extent the parking lot would be surveilled. But the way is currently worded, you know, subject to input from the chief of police, which the ordinance does allow for.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'It's very possible that pastor buys around the parking lot area may also be captured. And, of course, counsel can give further direction on that provision of the ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And then how does the requirement of videotaping inside the store with facial features recorded? How does that work with, I think, another policy that this council has weighed in on about not wanting facial recognition technology used in our city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'How do how do we square those two?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Sure. I am not sure to what extent the previous decision was regarding general facial recognition. What I can say is that specifically this could be narrowly applied to only be at the premise of a firearms dealer and it would not apply elsewhere.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Certainly, if council feels uncomfortable with that, also, we can generally just allow for facial recognition. That's right. Just for videotaping of the general premises and not be focused on the facial features during a transaction. One thing to know is that because of the way that straw purchases are done in order to help resolve and deter those crimes'",
        "'speaker_12': ', it may be helpful to have the facial recognition. But of course, that's completely up to council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So it is big five and Alameda have some history of facilitating straw purchases.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Not that we're aware of that. Of course, it's it's really difficult for us to to track that without having additional data and also looking further into it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I see. Okay. Any other questions? Clarifying questions. Mayor? No. You just saying. Yeah. Yeah, that is the question.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. You mentioned I know we received a letter from I think it was safe, safe Alameda with some requests. Did staff have a chance to look at those proposed changes? And, yes, we have.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And so I believe safe Alameda did send several proposals. Um, so there are a few proposals to add a couple of additions to the preambles. But, um, perhaps it's best use of my time to, uh, and of course you can, we can discuss more that preamble if needed.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'But there are substantive changes include changing section four, dash 32.3 currently, which requires proposals to require safe storage of firearms in residents. Safe Element has proposed changing residents to premises such that this would also cover presumably commercial premises, and they have also proposed to require keeping firearms to also be unloaded when they're stored.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Staff's staff believes that premises is a broadening of the ordinance as currently constructed because it would apply not only to the residence but also to commercial premises. Um, this may open the ordinance to further challenge, um, with regards to keeping the firearm unloaded while it's stored.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We also believe that may significantly be open for challenge due to the Heller case that I previously mentioned, which does allow for firearms to be used for self-defense. And an argument I believe could be made that if the firearm was mandated to not only be locked and stored away or disabled with a trigger lock, but also unloaded'",
        "'speaker_12': ', it could significantly hinder what the court has found to be the Second Amendment right. There has also been proposals from State Alameda to, uh, remove criminal penalties and to only have civil penalties. As previously mentioned, as currently worded.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We are proposing the maximum civil penalties and the fines cannot be any higher than currently proposed. Of course, if council would not like to have criminal penalties, that's something that we can change. And as for the video surveillance, they also had a few other comments.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Um, I think most primarily that they would like the currently as worded the audience requires that the camera system be triggered by a motion detector while during off business hours. They would like that to be a minimum requirement such that video surveillance could, um, at the discretion of the firearms dealer be on for the entirety of the'",
        "'speaker_12': 'day. They would also like for the images to be stored on the premises for longer than one year and also require offsite backup of the images and how they're stored. Um, and a proposal that, um, during the sales strike, during any period of, in operability of the video surveillance system, that the licensee shall not conduct any sales'",
        "'speaker_12': 'or transfers. And so looking at these, these are a little bit stronger than some of the other video surveillances that are currently out there and have withstood previous challenge. Um, I think, you know, it's certainly doable. I think whether or not to, to expand on certain of these requirements, whether or not it's advisable or whether or not'",
        "'speaker_12': 'it's operational, operationally feasible for the firearms dealers. I don't have a comment on that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. I'm Mr. Shin.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Just to add to Mr. Hong's point, we on the issue of premises. We did look into it and we also had, even before receiving that, had a thought about what that means with respect to the regulation at issue.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The proposal in front of you essentially just precludes folks from having arms about within their residences that are not either worn or safely stored. And this is consistent with regulations elsewhere. We recognize that there may be places that the council may want to slightly further regulate.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'For example, the locations right outside of the residence, for example, a garage where you may choose to include in the regulation, and further, you may even decide that arms should just not be stored in places where when people don't live in, because that is more risk when it comes to theft, because you may not go into it'",
        "'speaker_7': 'depending upon where you use your garage for or your storage facilities on your residential premises. So we do have language available to you if you're interested in further exploring that point, and we're happy to display it for you now or any other time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mr. Shen how would you contemplate enforcing that sort of regulation?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so enforcement of this and this entire ordinance on safe storage is not going to be by police officers inspecting homes. It will be enforced by essentially self-reporting. And the enforcement mechanism will be one whereby there's not going to be a an overall regulatory scheme.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'm happy to defer to the police chief on any further comments on enforcement he likes to share. But I think the way we envision it is that it most likely would only occur when it's post hoc, where something has occurred and someone has reported it to the police and information is volunteered.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But as I raised in a communication with your office this morning, if tragically and we hope it doesn't happen, but a teenager got hold of a gun inside their home and committed suicide. We wouldn't criminally prosecute or we would have discretion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I would hope not to criminally prosecute.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Parents because I can't imagine you could punish them any more than had already occurred.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Prosecutors have the right to exercise their discretion, not to prosecute any case.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Did someone else Healesville or did you have your hand up or just. Okay, um, I'll just remind everyone that we're supposed to keep our hands away from our offenses for health reasons these days. Sorry, I was in a meeting yesterday where they told us we were all handling our faces and we were okay if we don't have'",
        "'speaker_0': 'any further clarifying questions from the Council. Thank you, Mr. Green. Let's go to our public speakers.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We now have four Dave Breslow, Krystal Lo, Pilotto, Jonas Stockland and Kelly Co.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Members of the council. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm Dave. You want to be sure to speak to that microphone? We've tried to, you know, hear you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. I'm Dave Frost. I'm retired technical executive, primarily focused on the storage industry. I now teach firearms. I'm a firearms instructor and safety instructor. There are a number of heartburn issues that present themselves on this. First of all, I like the intent.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All of us want a safer society. We just want things that work. And the issue that I have is that I don't believe this proposal has gotten the type of input and review that it really warrants. One is, I can't find anything in here that's really going to work.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I wish that weren't the case. Our suicide rate in the country has gone up by a third. We've spent millions and millions on prevention, and it's not working. Safe storage isn't going to reduce suicides. We've seen this. The data is clear on this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It will prevent or discourage, I should say not prevent, but discourage children from getting access to certain children. But I hope you know that it's on YouTube. If anybody wants to look a six year old entering, unlocking a cable lock or gun lock, you can shoot a firearm with a trigger lock.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Most cases, if there's a round in the chamber, the trigger lock has enough play in there. You can normally pop off one round. That's why I recommend cable locks. What I do recommend is that the council take a deep breath on this one.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Direct staff to conduct some information, gathering session sessions and furthermore move forward on proposals that do make a difference. I've made two efforts to contact the police department today. One voicemail box was full and I didn't get a receipt.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Answer from the chief. I don't believe that our police offer what many do, and that is provide free gun locks, free gun locks, safety training, all of these kinds of things. I'm aware of what the community service program offers, but I've looked at it and frankly, there are other programs that are free that are so much better'",
        "'speaker_2': '. So what I would recommend is that we do a number of things and avail ourselves in the community to free things, also establish criteria. What is it that we're trying to accomplish our murder rate here? Homicide rate is very low.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We had nothing. And the let's see, we had one of the most recent period, nothing before that one before that. Nothing to to zero. I mean, it's not going to get much better. I don't have data on gun thefts, but I don't see much in here that's going to make a difference, which is why I recommend that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'we move forward on those things that do. And I would love to work with staff on how to make this happen. And that includes grants most recently. The announcement I got was three weeks ago, over $400,000 was committed to various departments for this kind of thing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So the money is available.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chair. So I'm wondering with. Thank you. You may be seated, please, chief, for Larry, do you wish to comment at this time?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This is kind of although.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'He didn't put it in the speaker slip, but he was referenced.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I just briefly would like to respond to the speaker last speaker's assertion that he did not get a response from the police department. He emailed me this afternoon at 1214. I replied with an extensive reply. 3 hours later, he may not have checked his email, but he has it.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And in that email I informed him that the number he had called was not to the person that he was trying to reach. And I provided the correct number and answered all of his questions. So I'm sorry that he did not see that and misrepresented the fact that he did not receive a response today.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And while you're up here, do you have any other comments about anything in the audience or to one to.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Well, Mr. Sheen, I agree with him wholeheartedly that the enforcement piece is not going to be done by the police department. Uh, we we don't we're not going to be knocking on doors. And I mentioned this to the council when we talked about it a few months ago.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The Fourth Amendment would prohibit us from just going into someone's home unless they gave us permission to do so. And that in all likelihood, if a gun was not safely stored and an event occurred as a result of that, it would not be known to us until after the fact.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And then we would be pursuing whatever avenues, you know, whether criminal or administrative that would need to be taken. But we wouldn't know that until til after the event.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Anything? Council on South the chief. What? We have him up here. We can always come back. Thank you. And our next speaker is.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Crystal Lo Parlato. And then join us again.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening, council members. My name is Krystal Abelardo. I'm a member of Safe Alameda. A community group started right here in Alameda. And I also volunteer as the California state legislative lead for Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'First, I want to applaud the Council for being proactive about gun safety and gun violence prevention. And also thank the city staff for the hard work that they've done on this already. Ordinances like these save lives and getting them enacted here is a core priority of our safe Alameda Group.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We do want to raise, as noted, just a few potential provisions for your consideration, the first of which is really that we would like to see the criminal penalties eliminated from the safe storage ordinance. Criminal penalties and ordinances like this can have a disproportionately negative impact on people of color in terms of who is most likely to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'ultimately be charged and convicted within the criminal justice system. Disproportionate sentencing and the disproportionate impact that a criminal record can have on future opportunities for a person of color. We understand the desire to pass laws that have real teeth, but believe that desire can be balanced against the downstream consequences of a penalty provision like that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So it was excellent to be informed that the civil fines are already at the maximum allowable amount, so that that certainly can stay as as is from our perspective. We are aware that the Safe Harbor provision relies on criminal penalties as currently drafted as an alternative.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We would be open to reduction of the civil penalties as the tool that incentivizes reporting of theft or loss. Instead of relying on criminal penalties as the ordinance is currently drafted. Additionally, as mentioned, we would love to see the Council consider expanding the scope of the safe storage ordinance to all premises instead of just residences.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The basis for that is that when addressing the risks of a gun, getting into the wrong hands from theft or the risk of unintentional shootings, the same reasoning holds true for firearms that are not stored securely on a business premises.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'As for those in residential premises, and we'd like to see the ordinances scope expanded to reflect that to the extent legally possible. Of course, limited exceptions could be spelled out for premises controlled by law enforcement or other reasonable exceptions.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And just briefly, with respect to the firearms dealer surveillance regulations, as mentioned, we have given city staff some feedback on those. But also want to separately note that we find Councilmember de Suggs idea of regulating the placement of firearms within a store to be very compelling, and we'd like to see the Council explore such a regulation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you again for giving this issue the attention it deserves. And we do hope that, you know that members of the community strongly support these ordinances.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Stockton. Next.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It. AVM, Jonathan Coughlin, a.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Alameda resident, a parent, an.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Attorney and a concerned citizen. Thank you, mayor and council members, for opportunity to address you. This is a complex issue, obviously, and not something that can only be addressed at the local level level. We need our our state and federal partners to also make some movement on that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I would urge you, whatever you do, in addition to the local ordinances, we urge you to support, to urge our leaders in Sacramento and Washington to make some changes, we need big changes. One of which I would like to see is a change to the law that permits Californians to buy a new handgun every 30 days'",
        "'speaker_9': '. This has got to be increasing the flow of firearms and into the into the hands of the wrong people. As to the measures before you today, I would say I urge you to support them. I'm a member of Safe Alameda and would echo the points made by the previous speaker.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I would want to mention those a question about adding the unlocked provision. That is something that the Giffords folks support. And if you're concerned about litigation, they are you are spot on in terms of what is something that will survive a challenge.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Previous speakers suggested the first speaker suggested that these measures would not make a difference. That speaker also did not suggest that there was any downside to these measures and the point that there would be no way would make the difference.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'L mean, it does have a low homicide rate, but if one.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Locked firearm.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Prevents a depressed teenager from getting access to that firearm, this is all worth it. That's all it takes. So I would urge you to support these ordinances. And we're looking as if Ahmed is looking to work with you, the city, further on additional measures, two of which come to mind.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That might be up next. One would be liability insurance requirements for gun sellers, making sure there's sufficient liability insurance, and also an ordinance that would restrict the locations of for gun dealers to keep them in places that would be away from where our children congregate, away from parks, away from schools, some safe distance.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So with that, I would say please support these audiences with the changes recommended by the previous speakers. And I thank you for your time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Kelly Cope. And then we have Rodney Spooner.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I wanted to thank our city council members and our city staff for addressing this issue in our community. I do or do I? My name is Kelly Copeman and I'm a Alameda resident and a parent and part of safe Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I urge you to support this legislation with the recommendations that Krystal.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Pilotto had.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Recommended. We realize that gun violence is a complex issue and that along with suicide and unintentional injury, we hope that we can work with you on the underlying issues of gun violence and suicide and unintentional injury as well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There are there is supportive evidence that child access prevention laws do reduce all firearm safe self injuries, including suicide attempts among our youth. So there is evidence for that. And we do have a gun theft problem in the city of Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There has been more than 220 guns stolen in the last ten years from homes. These are guns that are coming from our homes into the hands of criminals. We need to do better than that. And we hope that we can continue to work with you on this issue and the underlying issues.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'And I don't want, you know, my comments to be misinterpreted because I don't intend any disrespect to anybody. The first duty of government should be to protect the citizen. Each of you swore a sacred oath of office to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States, which is the supreme law of the land.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'And I feel that this is an infringement. I feel, you know, the Second Amendment has been infringed quite a bit. And I got up off the couch to come to this meeting today. So in the ordinance, it does say that the gun, gun violence and gun injuries have a significant adverse effect on public health and safety.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I don't disagree with that necessarily, but I disagree with the significant, um, it does have an adverse effect, but you know, define significant compared to what? Unsecured firearms raise the risk of injuries from wrongful.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Firearm.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Discharges and suicides. Accidental discharge. That plus the last. Whereas trigger locks and lock boxes do not prevent firearms from being easily accessed. Did not prevent firearms from being easily accessed in case of emergency. What is an emergency? Emergency is time is of the essence.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And the fact is that I'm sure the officers here should be familiar with the Wheeler drill, which basically is a danger zone, 25, 21 feet. And to be able to cover that distance takes only like 1.5 seconds. So time is of the essence.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Um.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Looks like I'm I'm actually running out of time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The trigger locks on YouTube.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There's any number of YouTube videos that, you know, tell you how to disable a lock and in, you know.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'A short time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Speed.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And is that our last speaker? Okay. So we're going to close public comment and we will move back to council comment. Actually, I did have one clarifying question of from the staff report. There was this reference to and I think I actually mentioned it in my email, I asked you who is organizing the April 25th, 2020 Safety'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Fair? Because I believe two of us in the Council, I think Mr. Odie and I are both out of town that day, and I do think this is a topic that's of interest to the entire council.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So I know there the city attorney's office has not actually been involved in organizing that. If I could ask, I believe Chief Roll, I already may have more information.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh, okay. Welcome back.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Mm hmm. Mayor and Council Members. The April 25th date is not etched in stone at all. We by we, I mean the police department. Uh, Jennifer Williams from the school board, Kelly Cope, who just spoke to you a few moments ago from Safe Alameda, Sarah Henry, McKayla Parker at the police department.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We've had several meetings discussing the concept, the concept of having a community safety event and trying to have it far enough out that we can plan and have a have a decent event, but also work within various schedules in the school calendar and whatnot.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We were looking at late April, but it's completely flexible. Everything in that event is in the preliminary stages.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, that's great that we, the Council all shares the same fabulous staff person who, as I tell Michelle Kirkman, she knows my schedule better than I do. So she's a great place to start for getting the council on board.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I would think that this is I would hope that the organizers would like the council there, too. So thank you for that clarification, but I appreciate it. Um, three things. Yes. Yes. Okay. Well, I want to clear that up.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Councilman Brody, I'll start.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. First of all, I want to thank everyone for speaking on this and the work of our staff and just to kind of I know Debbie did a nice review slide of of West Midway, so we didn't do a review slide.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But to remind people when we talked about this idea, you know, last year there was a town hall that the mayor and then Vice Mayor Vella where we're attending on this issue. And then we brought it back to the council this year, I guess it was last year, but it was this term.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, we had just experienced another school shooting. You know, we still hear daily incidents of, you know, accidental children dying and, you know, guns used in suicides. So that was the background for when we first talked about this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And, you know, I think I said something and I think everyone agreed that, you know, if the new norm is now these these shooter drills and telling kids they need to get bulletproof backpacks, I mean, that's just to me, not acceptable.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So with that backdrop, we continued the work that was done with the first town hall, with the second town hall. And then we invited the district attorney to also come and share some of her information. And I don't know if you've had a chance to look at the report that her office put out.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But, you know, when we talked about areas that we could focus on, you know, safe storage was the number one area, one, because it was something we could actually have an impact on. And two, because of the issues Mr. Schenn talked about, you know, there's a lot of preemption in this area.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So, I mean, you look at the numbers in that DEA report and, you know, of the crime guns that are used in our county, 17% of them were legally purchased in our county. So to me, that's an astonishing number because people are always saying, well, you know, all these guns that people are using are not legal.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, they were legal at one time. They were stolen and then they were used in a crime. So if there's a way that we could cut off the supply for bad people to get guns that were purchased legally, then I'm all for it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So that's why I think first the straw purchasing thing is going to make sure that every sale that's done in Alameda is done legally. I appreciate the the the suggestions of my councilmember colleague, Mr. de SOG, to move that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I mean, there are a lot of different products that we don't want our youth exposed to, and we put them in separate spaces magazines, videos, cigarets. Things like that. So I don't know why if a ten year old goes into a big five to buy a baseball mitt, you know that they should be exposed to a row'",
        "'speaker_3': 'of what looks like semiautomatic weapons. So, I mean, I I'm sympathetic to the fact that, you know, a lot of this stuff, like the police chief said, is after the fact. But, you know, so is the discussion on license plate readers.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I mean, we wouldn't know if somebody should be tagged to have their car digging with a license plate reader until they've committed a crime. So I also appreciate the comments that were provided about criminalization, because we're not trying to criminalize the legal possession of firearms.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'What we are trying to do is to prevent those legal firearms from getting into the hands of people that shouldn't have them. So I think every responsible gun over a gun owner probably agrees with that statement, because the more that these guns get in the wrong hands, that the higher risk that someone else, not us, is going'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to do something about it. So I think we all should be in agreement on that. As far as the videotaping. You know, I think I remember if the police didn't come out with a thing wrong, but we did a ban on facial recognition software, which was automated facial recognition.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The police still have the opportunity to look at a surveillance video and maybe look at a driver's license and do a manual compare. And I think that's what this type of situation would lead to, that if there's an audit to make sure that these are not straw purchases and that the right person is buying the gun that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'says they're buying it, you can do a compare and then you pass the audit and then every then everyone moves about their day. So I think I said the criminal penalty. I like the idea of the premises. I don't know to what extent we can do that because we kind of I thought when the suggestion came that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it was about businesses, but then we talked about garages and curtilage and stuff like that. So I don't know if that's, you know, I don't know where that lies in the in the scheme of things. Maybe, maybe I'll just finish and then you can kind of of of talk about it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So and then, you know, Johnno in his comment, you know, if we could save an Alameda one kid from committing suicide by keeping a gun locked up for an extra 15 or 20 minutes or whatever. To me, that's worth it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And conversely, if we can save, you know, one kid from accidentally stumbling upon their mom or their dad's gun, that the mom or dad thought was hidden away. But kids find everything. They know where everything is. Trust me.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Then to me that's worth it to. And I again would think that anyone who says they're responsible, law abiding, that these are the type of, you know, commonsense rules that they would want because, you know, nobody has I think the mayor said nobody wants, you know, a tragedy in Alameda and that those are the type of things'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that we're going to try to work on to prevent. I wish we could do more. You know, I don't think we should have criminal penalties if you violate this. But, you know, I think we should consider something like strict liability because if you're negligent in leaving your gun and letting it get stolen or lost, then and you'",
        "'speaker_3': 'don't report it, that's a problem. That is a crime. And then lastly, on the DIA's report, I think Kelly may have mentioned this. You know, the stats are in that report. I think it's 88 that guns were stolen in Alameda from 2012 to 2018.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I don't I don't have the ten year number, but I added them up and it was 88. That's a lot that's a lot of guns that are in the stream that shouldn't be. And they were all presumably purchased legally and now they're, you know, not in the legal stream.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I'm happy to support these and I'm glad we were able to do something. I look forward to hearing my my colleagues comments and I hope we can incorporate some of those suggestions from safe Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm going to constitutionally, Mr. Shinn to comment on some of the items Councilmember Odie raised.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I believe Councilmember Ody had a specific question with respect to premises.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In our premises.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Or premises. So our recommendation is that not reach commercial at this time, but we do have language ready for you on all premises on residential. I'm going to ask Mr. Hong to at least load it so that if the Council's interested in looking at it and it's a fairly small change to the ordinance that we believe would'",
        "'speaker_7': 'satisfy some of your concerns and it might be a reasonable middle ground to take and I believe it's now on the screen. I'll just read it to the council. Essentially, we would change section four, dash three, 2.32 to indicate that no person shall keep a firearm within any residence or upon any residential premises unless the firearm is'",
        "'speaker_7': 'stored in a log container or disabled with a trigger lock within a residence. And. And the last part is important because. We're what we're regulating is that if you want to store a firearm on on a residential premises, whether it's a garage or a storage bin, you just can't do that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You have to leave it in the residence where people are living, where presumably there's more supervision.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then just for clarification, Mr. Chan. So the firearm under this section could be either stored in the locked container or disabled with a trigger lock?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That's correct. In either case, it has to be inside the residence.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And then to a point Councilmember Odie raised of, you know, 88 guns stolen and I think six years was the number. But if the owner of that firearm under this proposed ordinance were to report it as stolen to the police within 24 hours, then they don't have any liability.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The safe harbor provision, as proposed, would absolve that owner of liability.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So just trying to understand, how does that help us here, I guess, is the rationale that the quicker it's reported, the quicker it might be found. Because it's not it's still a stolen gun at the end of the day.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And presumably someone you know is stealing it for ulterior motives.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That's right. I think it really is to encourage reporting so that police officers can be made aware as quickly as possible, so that there is an opportunity it could be found. Or if there is a related crime that police is already investigating, then it would provide them with additional leads.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's a balance. It very much is like everything else about this legislation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And then another question about the ordinance. Who who reviews the surveillance video to make the chief of police.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And the chief of police was was consulted on this ordinance, I take it. And here is the chief of police.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Now he has something to say myself.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Back up.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh, come on, officer. We're having open mic night tonight.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It's not going to be the chief of police. It will be the chief of police. Designee.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Designee?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes. Yeah. If we if we were to have an occasion to review a video, it would be somebody in our investigations division. And and and on the issue of a straw purchase, I just want to clarify, the straw purchase might be legitimate at the time of sale.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It's it's that the person that legitimately buys the gun knowing that gives it to a person who's not eligible. So we wouldn't have we would have video of the person making the legal purchase. The straw purchase would be something that would be proven through an investigation away from that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Presumably didn't take place on camera, correct? Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So just wanted to clarify that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. Councilmember Vela.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I just have a question actually for our chief. One of the proposals that was put forward by one of the speakers was providing storage units in private in private vehicles for our police officers. Is that is that something that we do already.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'For in their private vehicles? No. But I have a very specific restrict restrictive policy about how they store their guns, whether they're on or off duty. Thank you. So they're responsible for that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That was my that was my only question for you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'At ease.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I did have a question for the city attorney about storage units and safe storage of weapons and storage units. The reason I bring this up is a very good friend of mine from high school went through a very difficult period in her life and a lot of it was related to drug use.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'She's since been sober for over a decade and completely turned her life around. But she was somebody that was arrested ultimately on a number of gun charges and she stored her firearms that she was holding for, not her firearms, but for somebody else.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And she was storing them in storage units. And it was very common for her to have storage units. And this was while she was committing a number of different crimes and kind of running with a not great group.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so I just was curious. Obviously, this language is written, wouldn't cover that. But is that something that we've looked at?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And the question was about requiring and stored in a storage rental storage facility.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I guess I have two questions. One is, could we prohibit guns being stored in a storage facility or is there a way to regulate that? Because oftentimes storage units are used to store these sorts of things and they're not locked up.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so if the question is, could we just preclude guns from being stored at all, or is it safely stored as in trigger locked or in a locked container? If the council's interested in regulating gun storage beyond residential premises, then I think our recommendation that you would continue to require safe storage instead of prohibiting storage altogether and'",
        "'speaker_7': 'prohibiting storage altogether is more legally challenging than you. Simply indicating that if you're going to be storing it in a commercial location, it still needs to be similarly safely stored, which is locked container or disabled with a trigger lock.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. And that's something we could pass the ordinance as written tonight and have staff look at the commercial storage aspect and come back to us at a later time.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Absolutely. We'd be happy to take your direction.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. That would be my preference would would be to look at that and look at what the options could be. I think as a as a new mom, I'm learning all sorts of things. One of the things that I'm learning is I used to think my parents were overbearing and not very nice when they wouldn't let me'",
        "'speaker_4': 'just spend the night at people's houses. But, you know, now I'm thinking about things like, does the other family keep weapons in their house? And if they do, do they store them safely? Because it's not just about the kids in the house.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's also about the kids that come over to visit and how they might play together. And some of the saddest cases that I've worked on in my legal career involved youth that were playing with a firearm that was not stored safely.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so I think that that's you know, if we if we can prevent that or make it more difficult, I'm all for it. And if there's, you know, if this will do that, then I think that we need to take that step.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It might not solve all of the cases, but I think it's a step forward in the right direction. I also think that, you know, in terms of preventing guns being stolen, you know, it's 88 reported stolen in that report.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Those are the 88 guns that we we know were reported. And I think, obviously, we've you know, one of the some of the cases that come up, I also in my day job represent law enforcement. And some of the things that come up with them are where there's stolen weapons being used to commit a crime or children'",
        "'speaker_4': 'who have teens who have stolen the weapons from their parents or from the parents of a friend. And those those things come up often. And I trust that our police are working with I know that they coordinate with other law enforcement agencies.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so I would assume going back to the straw purchase scenario and that sort of thing, just as much as a straw purchase is going to be at issue. A lot of times what we see is these sorts of things where potentially a youth has actually stolen a weapon from another household.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that's why I think that the the report requiring the safe storage means that people are aware of where their firearms are kept. And I think you. Can't have one without the other, because if you don't require the safe storage, then they're not keeping tabs on their weapon.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And if that happens, then they're not going to even know if the weapon is gone in order to report it being, you know, being not no longer in their possession. So I think we have to have both. We have had a number of forums on there, at least two forums on this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'From a city perspective, I think this is a evolving area of law. And so I would anticipate that there's more, you know, as things develop, if there's additional laws that we become aware of that that pass constitutional muster.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I look forward to hearing those, but I want to make sure that whatever we have is going to be enforceable and that we follow up on the enforcement, because otherwise it's just an empty promise to our community. And I don't want this to be one of those things that we don't follow up on.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Other council comments. But as mayor.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I want to thank the staff for bringing these two items forward. I will hope, hopefully at the end. I love to hear what's happening with the other 21 items that we asked and I would like to it sounds like, I guess another question, it sounds like staff is working with Big Five as our only gun seller right'",
        "'speaker_8': 'now on the concept that Councilmember de Sugg mentioned. So I was going to ask why that wasn't clear. If it sounds like those those issues are ongoing, but I think that that was something that we all unanimously supported when it was recommended.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I continue to to to support that. For me, I think almost everything has been said that that that I might say on the the proposed language, it's on the screen here. This would be my preference for moving forward.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think if the idea is that we want to, you know, hew very closely to our legal lines for making sure that people have access to legal firearms for personal safety reasons, keeping it to the residents makes sense.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And if our goal is also to make sure that that there are eyes on these and they're not just lying around then and not keeping them, you know, in a, you know, often a shed somewhere where people might not look at them for four months or even notice that they're gone, probably seems like a pretty common sense'",
        "'speaker_8': 'and not over burden overburdening requirements. So my preference would be to make this one change here. I can go both ways on the criminal. I think that personally, if we were going to go forward with criminal penalties, I'd like some sort of annual reporting so we know what is happening with these with these so that we're at'",
        "'speaker_8': 'least keeping an eye on it to make sure that there aren't disparate impacts that we can identify. But if it's the will, the council to start off with those administrative penalties, I would be supportive of that as well.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'On the commercial language, after conversations with our city attorney on the issue this afternoon, I think it's very I do think it's very complicated. I'm very supportive of trying to figure out what that means. And I think the storage one is probably a clear line forward on how we do that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But so I can't support the moving residences to premises today just because I think it will get us into a place where it's incredibly complicated and we need some more thought on that. So but I think it's a fabulous job.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I want to thank the city attorney's office for their work on this. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Design.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Great. I'll just keep this brief saying that, you know, we're entering into new, new areas because this is what mothers and fathers of Alameda, children especially want us to to do. You know, everyone feels empathetic or sympathizes with what's going on nationally.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And and I think what the staff has put together is some common sense first steps with regard to trying to do something a little little something here in Alameda with regard to stemming gun violence. So so thank you very much, staff.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And also thank you very much to the residents and to those who are especially committed to this issue. The folks in the back especially. We thank you for all your input. I think we're following best practices, walking closely with what the the former congressman's outfit is, is is encouraging with regard to stemming gun violence.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Of course, I would have loved to have seen language with regard to the way in which guns are displayed and sold within a retail establishment in Alameda, especially if there is a retail establishment that happens to sell soccer balls and tennis balls.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Oh, and also there's all these guns all at one place. I think there is ways in which perhaps the city of Alameda can create some new new ground in terms of of regulating sales and as a councilmember. He had said, you know, we regulate.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We certainly regulate the display of certain items like it's within our ordinance, I think is municipal code 30 dash dash nine, I think. So, you know, the as I call, you know, guns represent such a brute force that it's just not just, you know, there not any other athletic gear like like soccer balls or or soccer balls'",
        "'speaker_12': 'or tennis balls or tennis rackets. And so I think they really call out for for cities like Alameda to regulate the way in which they are displayed and sold. And so so I would love to see that. And hopefully maybe other cities will do that, you know, because like across the United States, you know, I think Wal-Mart'",
        "'speaker_12': 'sell guns elsewhere. So but I think, you know, we've got some great first steps. And I really thank the residents for coming out and being so passionate about this issue. I don't think we went overboard with regard to people's Second Amendment rights, but I think we did more than do nothing and sit on our hands.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So I appreciate everyone's assistance in moving us along into new territories that that Alameda City Council is venturing into with regard to the type of ordinances that we're crafting.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Odie.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Oh, I spoke already.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh, you already spoke. Okay. Okay. So mine is you did you started. I think he's don't.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Let me go get.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. Now okay. You've 2 minutes and 28 seconds so I'm in agreement generally speaking with my colleagues. And I do think everyone who's worked on this issue at the city attorney's office and in all who who brought forth this report, I my kids, my twins are now 28.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I do remember and I've spoken about this before, it's something our pediatrician talked about, you know, asking, do we have guns in the house? And and I'll share that. My husband is a former deputy sheriff when he was putting himself through law school.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I wasn't too aware of it. But he mentioned at one point when I was pregnant that, you know, I still got my service revolver. And I said, where it is, is in the dresser drawer. And I said, Oh, well, we're about to have two babies, so let's take care of that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we had a neighbor on the street who was actually a police officer and we talked to him about it and he took it off our hands and disposed of it. So, I mean, we do want to keep our kids safe and there's so much that goes into that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And in a lot of ways it gets more complicated as they get older. But we certainly don't want, as Councilmember Vela noted, children inadvertently coming upon and an unlocked weapon. I would feel better if in the sales surveillance ordinance the language about surveillance cameras directed at the parking lot was not there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm with Councilmember de Saag. I would like staff to bring to us what's possible about where the guns are sold. And it shouldn't be right behind the counter where I'm going to bring my that I bring all my purchases to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You don't get the big five a lot. But they do have they do have things that I buy, but it shouldn't be right there. But I think it's a bit of an overreach to videotape people in a parking lot who could be there for a lot of different reasons.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So that would be my ask. I don't know how the council feels about videotaping folks in the parking lot just because they're in the parking lot.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm in agreement.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You would agree with taking that language at parking lot language?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm seeing nods of the head. The well, Councilman Brody, thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'What was the what do we hope to benefit from from that type of surveillance? And that'll be the question I would have. Because I mean, I'll just elaborate. I mean, I would imagine that if we somehow had an ordinance that moved things to the back and then we could limit the surveillance to just that area.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sure. Cassandra, you know, you've been looking I the tennis racket.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think the parking lot would be outside. Right. And it's the parking lot that would be shared if I'm going to Bed, Bath and Beyond or Sushi House or.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Right. So. So leave that with additional surveillance at the parking lot. It would potentially provide additional footage of any transfers, subsequent transfers outside of the store or how the guns are transferred into or out of a potential vehicle or anyone who's outside.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Um, I think that's the general idea of just again, providing additional footage and making sure that people who are buying it are the ones who are actually making the purchase. And there's no one just simply waiting outside and, you know, taking a firearm right after.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Do we know how often that happens? I mean.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I don't have statistics. I can't remember. I think it's a current.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is that is that a solution in search of a problem?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Or is it something that happens? I mean, are people that dumb?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. We get that key for the.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Exterior surveillance or security cameras at the mall already at multiple locations. So filming people that are going to the grocery store. So.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I mean, what's one more?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I'm just saying I'm just saying that that that there are lots of retail establishments have exteriors, surveillance for security, not not specifically for guns.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But thank you. And I appreciate that this particular ordinance is gonna get to the front of it. It's the, the, it's the sales surveillance ordinance. So specifically sales of guns surveillance ordinance. And I, I, you know, I get that we to if you think you're going about your business and no one's watching you, you would be wrong'",
        "'speaker_0': '. But I just as an elected representative of the city of Alameda, I don't know that I want to suspect that everyone going into that parking lot, maybe conducting an illegal gun transaction. Councilmember Vella, did you want to add to that?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I do. You see where it is, by the way?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm looking at it on page four. Right. And I think my concern is we're also saying that they need to maintain that for a year.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And and I you know, I know that there's other surveillance out there, but we're not we the city are not mandating that it be maintained for a certain period of time and basically made available for inspection, I think because the languages that it's made available upon request.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So there's no subpoena needed. There's no, um, I'd be fine leaving it in if, if it was more than just law enforcement asking for it. Um. I just get out. I just get worried that we're we're now kind of requiring essentially.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Requiring surveillance in a in a really public area.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Very nice. Okay. So is a cause already?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, I think there were. There's three other cities that have this. What do they do as far as exterior? I mean, we had this discussion on license plate readers and there was a comment that there was no expectation of privacy.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'When you like get in your car, drive over the bridge, you know. I guess the same would apply to going to the sporting goods store. But on the flip side, I mean, is this an excess?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Sure. I just want to point out, um, so to your question, how many other cities require this? And this requirement does mirror others in several surrounding Bay Area cities, including San Francisco, Emeryville, Campbell and Pleasant Hill. So it's certainly not uncommon.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We could always add this to later, right? Yes. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So so are you agreeable with removing the parking lot designation at this time?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Oh, yeah. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'What I'd like to see is Councilmember de Sung's idea, and then we just limit the videotaping to just this small, contained area.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So are you doing. Are you making direction? Suggesting direction to staff? Yes, we both can, by the way.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, I think we all have to, but I would be in favor of that. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. You want to make an amended motion?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I didn't make any motion, but.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, I. Oh, no, that's true. There is no motion, I guess. But the staff report suggests that we we amend the municipal code and perhaps we want to do just a little further.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'With the vice mayor trying to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Talk about delegation. Would you like to try?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'd be happy.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To. We'd be happy to.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I would like to move the ordinance with the following amendments removal of the criminal penalties, which I believe I heard a majority of this council saying.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, with that worked on.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'With the revised resident's residential language, limiting it just to a to a residence and with the removal of the parking lot video, I believe those were the three that we talked about. And then with a direction that we would like to see something come back with with what we'll call the Councilmember de SAG plan.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And the commercial.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And also to have them look at it.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And the commercial district.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Mr. Shen Yes, I wanted to get some clarification from the Council on Criminal Penalties. And the reason is that in both ordinances that where the criminal penalties live cover entire chapters. So for example, in the safe storage part of the ordinance, the criminal penalties cover existing law such as unlawful discharge of a firearm or brandishing or using'",
        "'speaker_7': 'a firearms. I My guess is that the Vice Mayor's motion is not to eliminate criminal penalties, penalties for those, but just for safe storage. Yes. And is the right. And so in the other ordinance, it also similarly covers, for example, folks who refuse to get a permit that's otherwise required.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And the other ordinance is the stores.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Correct. The stores.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm only worried about. Oh, you.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Only worry about this.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Personally. I'm only home worried about the home safe storage.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Got it. And one more clarification or maybe it's a slight recommendation is that there's also the safe harbor provision. And so if the council's intent is to remove the criminal penalties and the safe harbor ordinance I'm sorry, in the residential storage ordinance, my recommendation is that you also give the safe harbor for administrative penalties.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Right now, the safe harbor is drafted so that you essentially don't get criminally prosecuted if you report within 24 hours. If you want to remove criminal penalties, we should replace criminal penalties with civil and administrative penalties and to continue to encourage reporting if that's the council's will.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, that sounds reasonable. I can see enough heads.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes, that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So we've had a motion. It's been clarified now. It's been set in motion by the vice mayor, seconded by Councilmember Desai. All in favor. I the motion passes unanimously. Thank you. Okay. Before we move on to item six, what are we on?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'See, we are going to take a quick ten minute break. Okay. Are we ready in the balcony yet? We're okay. We're going live. Okay, we're back. And we are on item six.'",

        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. We have several objectives. Today is one look at general fund financial projections. Take a look at pension and OPEB funding status. We'll discuss mid-year budget amendments requests provided by departments. And obviously at the end, we're going to ask you to take an action on the resolutions that the city clerk just read to us.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The workforce presentation will be done. The slides will be done by Nancy Bronstein, who is our city's human resources director. And just so you know, if you do have questions, the executive team is here to answer questions as well.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We will do a presentation, I would say, in three parts. We'll talk about general fund, the program programs outside of general fund and will, as I mentioned, a few slides on the workforce changes. We'll start with the General Fund highlights.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We're continuing to experience a strong revenue growth. One of the bigger items for us. Transaction of new stocks became effective as of April of 2019. And so we are looking at updated projections for these numbers because we now have a couple of quarters in and those projections are based on that now and they're actually growing.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Transfer tax again continues to grow. Last year used to be about 10% of the general fund budget. This year it's actually 13. And again, a caution just because we do get some one time money on large sales and those are the items we are kind of more so caution you about because it really depends on your real'",
        "'speaker_11': 'estate sales. We do have the baseline which we incorporate and those are going to be there and ongoing revenues. But there are a few that are not. Mid-Year operating expenditure requests focused a lot on operations. There are a few special programs, particularly outside of general fund programs, and we do have some funds that are set aside for'",
        "'speaker_11': 'capital expenditures, funding status on CalPERS and OPEB. It's one of the things that usually is being asked in terms of what the balances are. And so we'll talk about how it reduces our funded liabilities. General Fund Revenues. As you adopted the budget a year ago, we're bringing to you back again in with an update of $7 million'",
        "'speaker_11': 'increase. So the current revenues are estimated to be at about $107.8 million. And we'll go a little bit in the detail as to where the increases are. And a lot of them are within your property tax, which is your regular base property tax.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Based on our consultant deal, city wide growth in assessed values for property taxes went up 7.7%. This does include redevelopment of redevelopment areas. If you exclude those and just limited to general fund, it's about 6.65%. And so this also presents to you that about $1.9 million is attributable specifically to the property tax, which includes and VLF some'",
        "'speaker_11': 'waterfall funds and obviously regular property tax. We talked a little bit about transfer tax already. So real estate sales continue to generate our large revenues. I did want to mention to you as we published this report, our January a transfer tax came in in it was included one large transaction.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So to date, well, not really to date, technically. As of January, we had three significant transactions. And what I mean significant they were each over $1,000,000 that came in in all totaled $3.9 million. Those are the transactions that we'll look at as may not necessarily be ongoing, but more of a onetime in nature.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Program revenue adjustments will looked at several departments. The largest ones ends up being fire and police fire department, increasing their ambulance fees by $400,000. However, they are projecting that their mutual aid revenues are going to go down. We decreased the mutual aid revenue, but it's also offset with some of the expenditures the department would experience.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So there's an equal offset to overtime specifically. Additional items are firearm service fees, and vehicle accident fees are lower than the department expected, and police department and animal license fees are not necessarily being collected at the rate we would like because they had some issues with stopping the program overall.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Net difference for all, it's about 30,000 decrease of all of those items. But as a mid-year, we have said it was still about $7.6 million of individual programs bringing in within general fund. This has gives you a summary of overall general fund revenue changes.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We talked about property tax. We talked about transfer tax. I mentioned transaction and use tax. We are budgeting actually currently about $5.4 million, which is $900,000 increase. One thing that our consultants were a little cautious about is they believe that within a certain area, geographical area and specifically business to business transaction was much higher than originally expected'",
        "'speaker_11': '. And they kind of warned us that perhaps businesses collecting tax when they really shouldn't be. And so there's a potential for either them requesting a refund eventually or just realizing that they shouldn't be collecting it, and therefore that will go down.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So that's just something that we need to be on the lookout for, for the future. Utility users, taxes dropping. Specifically, what we are looking at, is it a little more difficult to collect mobile or prepaid wireless type of fees and at the same time, people continue to bundle their services and therefore, when Internet is included, it's bundled'",
        "'speaker_11': 'together and people use more of a Hulu, Netflix type of services and those are not subject to utility users tax. On the expenditure side for general fund, we're doing an increase of about $1.1 million on operating expenditures and a little under half a million dollars towards capital projects, money being set aside.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'What you do see in this particular presentation, we set money aside for OPEB and pension reserves. As you know, we do not appropriate the money right away. We always look at it one year behind once we have a results from our audit in year end.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So in this case, the dollar amount you will see is actually based on fiscal year 1819. Overall expenditures, excluding our set aside amount for pensions and OPEB is $103.5 million. With the dollar amount, it's 100 and almost $11 million.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We usually do present a CalPERS pension funding status. In this case, the most recent actuarial valuation available is as of June 2018. That provides you overall city wide safety and miscellaneous plans as well as breaks out the General Fund component.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And General Fund is, as you can see percentage wise, is about 77%. Third for Miscellaneous Group is about what's in the general fund and obviously 100% of safety. And as you can see, we tried to present three years in five year increments funding for CalPERS for both plans, just as a visual to see where we are currently'",
        "'speaker_11': 'referring back to our pension and OPEB funding policy. The policy that Council approved was half of the previous year's available fund balance, above 25% of operating expenditures and transfers out that are committed to be committed to pension and OPEB reserves.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'In addition, we have closed pension plans 1079 and 1082, which is safety. Those were frozen at 14 fiscal year, 14, $15 amount. And so as we have pensioners that pass away, those monies are being set aside towards pensions.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'As you will see when we presented the budget originally, we thought or how we're going to end the year as we will be able to contribute $1.4 million. What we actually doing is it's seven point almost $4 million goes to both pension and OPEB.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So 1920, again we're doing is we will see in the exhibits to the staff report the projection for 1920 is $5.3 million, but we will not include it until we actually complete fiscal year 1920 audit and then we'll be brought back to you for midyear or another standalone item at a later date.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'This is usually a requested slide just to see where we are. This information is actually as most current available, which is as of January. We've contributed today to CalPERS, $16.8 million. With that, there's also money set aside in our 115 trust.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And that has two components to it pension and OPEB in the pension side. This is amount that we originally contributed with the purpose of giving us some stability and pension stabilization sort of way. So if amounts going to go up so much that we have a little bit of a cushion to react to it.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And currently the balance is about $6.1 million. And then we have the OPEB contribution. This is a combination of what we have already included in our safety, and we'll use as well as additional funding that the city put in in our OPEB account.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'This is a complete summary of our general fund expenditures within the fire department. One of the things we do have is an increase in overtime costs, but at the same time that number is offset with the reduction in overtime because we're not planning on sending staff out for mutual aid, we don't expect it.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'In addition, one of the things just to remember, as we were looking through availability of various funding sources, the ambulance that council authorized for the purchase in this fiscal year was originally budgeted in the general fund, but we actually have available development impact fees, moneys that we're shifting that funding actually to the development impact fees instead.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And that provides a relief to the general fund of $400,000. There are other items that are included in the care for various departments. Again, this is for a lot of the operating expenses. There are a couple of capital project contributions and we'll have a slide that details that as well.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And seven point close to $4 million pension. OPEB reserve. This gives you a table format of where we project general fund to be. We start by giving you what you've adopted a year ago. You have made some adjustments to the general fund throughout the year since July to now.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And then of course, are current your midyear adjustments presented to you in a separate column and then we provide you with a projection through the end of the year on a baseline amount net activity for the year. We're actually ahead by $4.3 million.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'What that means in the baseline, we were excluded the large property transfer taxes and also did not count as pension on a pet reserve as ongoing expenditures since we set money aside from the prior year. If we do include both of those in the net difference in the activity is a deficit of $3 million.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'This gives you a graphic presentation of exactly what you saw in the previous slide and it gives you the solid line is your base operations with the dashed lines is including your one time revenues as well as the pension and OPEB reserve payments.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And again, shows you a positive number of $4.4 million. And then obviously a gap with those included US $3 million. There are a few programs, actually number of programs that ask for adjustments during the year. Some of them are grand funded and they include actually both the revenue and expenditure side to them as well as, let's say'",
        "'speaker_11': 'community development requested expenditures increase for monies that we already received for the cannabis program. Additional funding is requested for some other administrations, such as public art and sister city programs, a request for a position that's been already approved by council in year two of the budget.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'However, department is asking to bring it forward a little earlier and so for the remainder of the year and those budgets are included in here as well. As I mentioned, the ambulance purchase is now under development impact fee grant I'm sorry, fund and transportation services is measure B and be be funded.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And so we're utilizing notes. There were a few corrections we had to do on the sewer fund as well. We've included one sided transaction in the general fund and two of those are actually corrections, which includes also vehicle replacement that council already approved as part of the approval of the budget.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It's just that it was not included within the fund itself for appropriations, other items for various funds. And as you see, the biggest ones we project to have extra funding available again because some of our pensioners are passing away additional funding towards pension from closed pension plans.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We expect to do a contribution to CalPERS of about $5.1 million and then OPEB alone, half a million. A couple of capital project funds. So we have to set up right now Woodstock Park is you know that burned and so general fund is making a contribution for the rebuild of the playground, a reshape project that was talked'",
        "'speaker_11': 'about earlier. One thing I just wanted to mention is that right now this funding is not set up as a loan. Right now, it's actually set up as a general fund funding if we choose to actually pursue it as a loan rather than just a general fund funding right away.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Then one of the things that needs to happen is will bring back the promissory note that the Council will need to approve for the entire fund advance at that point in time. A couple of there's a few other capital project funds that are proposed for funding.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'They already have additional monies received and we're just appropriating both sides revenues and expenditures to mention about capital projects. There are nine completed capital projects that had some funds remaining because we did not spend all of it. So the funding so we do funding those projects.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It's about half a million dollars. And those funds will go back to the respective funds that actually originally contributed the money. A lot of them are restricted revenue sources such as Measure B, such as Measure B and some other ones like urban runoff funding sources.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'There are a couple of projects which have very small dollar amounts remaining that were general fund technical would go back to the general fund. There are also a few projects that had very similar purpose, meaning we've budgeted them in one budget year and then there was different project number in another budget year, but they're very similar such'",
        "'speaker_11': 'as pavement management. So we're just re appropriating those from one year to another. And there were two projects specifically in their listed here that had a little bit of a different purpose. So original money came from general fund to fund some of the city building facilities.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But even though these facilities are still a responsibility of the general fund, but they're not specifically, I would say, city facilities specifically. So a pathway lighting replacement project, 455,000 and then Alameda Point Gym module restrooms. Additional funding of 259.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'All right. We are on the new positions. And I'm going to invite Nancy Bronstein, our H.R. director, to go over those.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Dear. Hello, Mr. Bronstein.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Evening, Mayor. Council members, Nancy Bronstein, director of H.R..

        "'speaker_5': 'We're going to add.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'A.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We're requesting to add an accounting technician in order to allow the department to put all of those finance and budget responsibilities under one position. The Department is requesting an additional $27,000 in appropriations for the remainder of the fiscal year for that position.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I went all right in the police department, were requesting to add a lead parking technician and a parking technician position to support the expansion of the parking program, city's parking program. The lead parking technician will be a field position, but it will also provide some direction on scheduling and daily direction to the parking.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Today, technicians at Alameda Municipal Power Re requesting to add an electrical equipment superintendent position and delete two other superintendent positions. This will allow the department to fill the position appropriate for the duties in the City Attorney's Office for requesting to add three part time positions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This will give the department some flexibility on hiring part time staff, including fellows. And then we're requesting a 2.3% equity adjustment for the senior combination building inspector classification. This will provide a 5% differential between the combination building inspector and the senior building inspector.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then finally, the last item is we're recommending some minor changes, one to the education provision of the Alameda Police Officer Association's agreement, and then to the acting pay provision and the management incentive pay provision of the Alameda Fire Chiefs Association agreement.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And there's no fiscal impact of result of those changes. We're just doing it to ensure we continue to comply with CalPERS rules. And with that, that's all I have. And Alan and I are available for questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Quick question. Yes, Councilmember Dafoe, quick.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Question on the new positions. When I look at the like the Sustainability Resilience Manager annual cost of 164,000, or when I look at the accounting technician of 102,000, is that all wages or is that wages? And does that include the typical benefits that they'll pay for in the given year.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's fully loaded? So employees purchase health every every cost of the position.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Okay. Are there any. Let's go with the city attorney.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Madam Chair, I just want to clarify the request from the city attorney's office. We're not seeking to add any positions. We're seeking to add three classifications. Those classifications essentially will allow the part time schedule to include attorney positions if and when they're necessary.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And we have no current intent to seek additional part time attorneys. But we thought that because the part time schedule contained no classification for attorneys, this is the right time to to have that flexibility.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'So is that our continuing obligation or is that something we've done?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'This is additional discretionary payments we have made directly to CalPERS. So the way it's been presented before, when we presented the policy and if you remember, we had a consultant nature advisors coming out here and doing a presentation.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'One of the things that was discussed with council was how do we make this contributions? And once we determine the dollar amount, how much we have available and we figure it out, how much we want to pay towards pension specifically.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Then we split it up. 75, 25%. 75% went as a direct down payment to CalPERS for a down payment of our unfunded liabilities. And CalPERS calls them additional discretionary payments. 25% went to the 115 trust under the pension accounts specifically.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And that's the one we can continue to decide to use if we need to.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yes, that's more of our stabilization. Think of that cash flow kind of security.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. I thought I had another question, but I'll think of it after the speakers. Sure.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Any other counsel, clarification, city manager or anybody else wants anything? Okay. And we have public speakers.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have three Eric Christy Cannon, Ruth Abbe and Ingrid Bowman.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Good evening. I feel like I should do something really exciting to wake us all up. But I don't know what bag of tricks I am. Christie Cannon. I am a citizen here and I'm also on the Transportation Committee and CASA.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Um, so of course I just want to, um, emphasize how important I think the position is of a full time sustainability and resilience, um, person that will be working, I think under the assistant city manager. I wanted to talk a little bit about what I think that person needs to be able to do.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Um, Councilwoman Villa, when we were talking about either the emergency declaration or the passing of the Caap, I'm not sure which, but you said something that really has stuck with me and I won't be able to repeat it quite the way you said it, but it had to do with these climate issues are underpinning everything that the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'city does and everything that the city has done. You know, we're going to have to rewrite things and reconsider things that we've done in the past. And I've heard the assistant city manager speak quite eloquently. I think about the that same importance of climate issues underpinning everything and getting city departments to work together to make this happen'",
        "'speaker_5': '. And I spend a fair amount of time being on the Transportation Committee of CASA, going to Transportation Commission meetings, and I go to the Planning Commission meetings and I see this disconnect at that level, which isn't city staff, but still the policy level where, you know, planning thinks, well, that's transportation issue and transportation thinks, well, that's planning'",
        "'speaker_5': 'issues, but they're both climate issues that underpin the work of both commissions. So I think in looking for this person, it's really, really important to be looking for the kinds of skills that the assistant city manager has spoken about to really be able to manage and to work with all the different kinds of staff and priorities that'",
        "'speaker_5': 'we have, and to have good political skills in the sense of just being able to work with a lot of different people. So thanks so much.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'The new position for the Sustainability and Resilience Manager. We spoke about this issue during the budget hearing last year and with the foresight of the city manager and the conclusion of the City Council funding was set aside for implementation of the Climate Action and Resiliency Plan, which was not adopted until September.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so fortunately, with that foresight, you have the ability to have this already funded position. So we think it's very important in the implementation of the Climate Action and Resiliency Plan to have someone with the senior manager position reporting to the assistant city manager that can bridge those silos between the departments.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Your department heads already have full time jobs and.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Their project managers already have full.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Time jobs. And too. So to add in the interdisciplinary needs of the Climate Action and Resiliency Plan and all the other projects within those working to support the departments, when it's very clear that the subject matter falls within their department, it's one thing, but when things fall across several departments, it does require extra coordination and support.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we are very much in support of adding this position. We appreciate the foresight of the city manager and the City Council in the budget hearings last year, and we support the action of the city council. Thanks.'",

I want to acknowledge the commitment and the passion that the city council has shown toward taking climate action very seriously. And we're facing clearly an emergency that requires all means.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So I want to voice my support for this, a position that is funded. And I'm speaking also as a member of Community Action. Umm Qasr. I have taken several action, several projects on. As a member of CASA. And what I see actually is important in the way that this position can bridge the gaps in terms of where'",
        "'speaker_10': 'the projects are happening and how they can really be coordinated within the city staff is it would be wonderful to have somebody who really has a real fluency in working with the city and the various departments of the city, but also bridging the communication that is happening with the various groups.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'There are many people who are really bringing their passion, their commitment and their expertize toward climate action and who sometimes are a little bit not sure about how to approach this work. And it would be really wonderful to have someone who can actually act as a counselor almost to how to approach the city and who to approach'",
        "'speaker_10': 'and how to articulate these projects so they actually can really bridge among each other and gain momentum. And I think that this position is actually going to be really wonderful in tapping into all this task force that is waiting to take action.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I would love to. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And that's the extent of public figures. Okay. So we will close public comment. Council staff, your thoughts?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Can I ask my other question?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You can ask as many questions as you like within your eight minute time or nine whatever it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Somebody else go.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'For it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So again, back to 13 and 12. So what numbers, if any, on number 12 are in the numbers and 13? I remembered my question. So 13 is that the CalPERS OPEB trust? And then I think 12 is the 1920 numbers.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So the 1920 number that we're only asking you at this point in time to appropriate are not part of those numbers. The Slide 13 shows your actual cash that's been deposited with CalPERS as of January and with Pass.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So what we're asking you to do today is not part of it because we actually haven't sent any of the money over to either one of those agencies.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. So the 37 million that we've set aside over and since inception, that will be increased by 7.4. And then some other number which we think might be 5.3 but could change.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'No. Yes, that's correct. If after so with tonight's appropriation, it would be 7.3 and this would be under city manager's direction. That's one of the things that he included in the recommendation in the staff report is to allow him to bring back as part of the mid-cycle revisions potentially to the policy, as well as giving his authority'",
        "'speaker_11': 'to actually approve those payments. So it's likely we won't actually make a contribution until that happens. And then with that, after 1920, potentially, we will have an additional 5.3. That's what we estimate today. What the actual number will be is going to be after the audit.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Perfect. Thank you. I'll come in for someone else because my question.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I have a question. Speaking of CalPERS, so our payments are based on their projected return, on their investments. The stock market has had a pretty rough time in the last week or two with the stock markets just being jittery over the impacts of coronavirus.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so what what can you tell us about that impact on what Alameda? I mean, but we could expect our recalculated payments to be are you pointing to the city manager delegating that way city manager.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Level and are going to a little bit but we actually just met with a financial consultant who's actually reviewing our policy is going to be coming forward in May hopefully right before your study sessions. And he was talking about that a little bit, but I think we'll probably have more time in May to be able to answer'",
        "'speaker_9': 'that question specifically. In essence, their 30 year discount and actually is now 2020 year discount rate seven point. Yeah, it factors in the fact that you're going to have downturns that and you're going to have. Increases and downturns.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But you're right. The impact of a couple of last week definitely could hit this year's returns. Of course, it came back a little bit on early this week, but there's a lot of volatility right now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, I would say we will never know more by May, so.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Oh, shouldn't we? He should be able to answer the question pretty well in May for you. Okay. As far as what your he won't be, I'll answer what the total return will be, but be able to answer some questions that you have regarding how does this impact our future liabilities.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yeah. One of the things you have to remember, CalPERS was always behind. Not that it takes away any of the importance of it, but because they're evaluations is always two years behind by the time we get any of the data.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So if CalPERS happens to finish this fiscal year in a negative return or something lower than 7%, the city will not actually realize that as an addition to a liability until two years from now. So we won't see it.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yes, it's there. We know it. We can plan for it. Part of the reason why I think the city manager is going to look into a variety of ways to mitigate any future or existing unfunded liabilities. But just to answer your question, we will not see it actually added to our liability until two years from now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mr..'",
        "'speaker_9': 'LEVITT And not to over talk the issue at all, but some of the scenarios he'll bring are recession, as well as if it goes up up to 7%. So you can see what are the impacts going to happen in a recession, let's say 4% return or even less as well as a 7%.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That sounds very valuable. Thank you. Anyone else care to comment? Okay. Council member.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Soto. Thank you. And and I know I've said this before and I'll say it again, but I do appreciate that we will be looking at the the OPEB reserve policy because that the numbers that we're talking about in terms of the cumulative amount that's being set aside as a result of the policy is really astounding.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We're talking, you know, north of $20 million. And I get that we need to to pay down our our unfunded liabilities. So I get that we need to do that. But we also need to do it in the context of all these different other service needs that current residents are demanding.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So I do believe that we have to it's imperative that we revisit the the OPEB policy that we have in place. I appreciate the numbers that were presented here. And it's really I think we kind of, you know, we don't want to alarm people.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'But when you're looking at here and you're saying that that we have the possibilities of of going negative, when you take into account the actual, you know, the OPEB numbers that we're setting aside, you taking a look at those expenditures relative to the revenues that were coming in.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So Slide 15, when you take into account your actual cost, the mid-year projection has a -$3 million. If I'm looking at that correctly, going into it though, when you look at Slide 15, it was always tight because in the first column we had a positive $121,000, so a positive $121,000 for a budget on the revenue or on'",
        "'speaker_12': 'the expenditure side, that's $100 million plus going into it, you knew it was tight. So so when you look at column four, though, you could kind of see that, that, that, that we do need to revisit that open policy because I think that's what's driving it.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And I do want to kind of say, as I've said before, one of the things that I'm really concerned about stocking away, you know, OPEB, I mean, reserve money is that I still believe in until I'm proven incorrectly with a memo that says so flat out, I still believe that much of our our reserves are really phantom'",
        "'speaker_12': 'reserves, because part of it is driven, I believe, by not having a fully staffed departments in several places. And to the extent that the departments are not fully staffed, that means that expenditures is here, whereas revenues were here.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'But if they were really fully staffed, expenditures would be here. And the reserve is a function of, of, of that. So the honor reserve and the cumulative reserve. So I've always kind of believe that even though we've got these astounding reserve numbers from which we've, you know, created a reserve policy with regard to OPEB and pensions.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I've always believed that it's really a phantom reserve and so that we had to tread carefully. So I just ended it there. I look forward to going beyond the mid-year projections into the fall budget. Also, I do want to say, you know what, you know, Buddhism, edge, South Bend that they have a he has a 55% reserve'",
        "'speaker_12': '. I looked at his character and this and the city of South Bend has a reserve policy, general fund reserve policy of 35%. I was pretty impressed by that. Anyway, so.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'He might have some spare time to come talk to us about it. He's not the mayor anymore. Yeah. Thank you. Any other. Any other comments? So we have some recommendations to adopt a number of resolutions. Are we do we need more information or are we ready to move approval because we have another item to go.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Bella, please. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Um, I did have some questions about. Well, a couple of things I wanted to highlight is that we have baby changing stations coming in at our parks, and that's a big expenditure and something that we've worked on. And, um, but I did have a couple of questions.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'One was for the, um, for the building inspection inspector compaction. What unit is that position and is that management position?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'No, I believe that's ACA.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Is there a reason that we didn't address this or do we normally address compaction issues?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Really sort of. We had done a bunch of work previously on adding some classifications to that unit, and when we did it, we missed that. We had not done the true 5% that we try to do between classifications.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we recognized it as an internal compaction issue we wanted to fix so we could get people to promote.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. And is that a position that's vacant right now?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we actually have people in it. Okay, now, but it became an issue and it was really we saw it as sort of something we had created and wanted to fix.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. And are they how long have they been behind the.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We just did that adjustment in the last I can't say exactly when, but I think within the last year we added a classification.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Because remember that. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. That was that question. The other question that I had was on the finance department wear and tear. Did that the 175,000.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And Mr. Leavitt, did you address any you point to.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Those? Well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I guess my question is, what what work did that include? And because I know that there were other there was other work office space that was over there. So does that include the city attorney's office that's over in finance or.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So so the the presentation was about the finance pyramid. But what I what we've done and I think you hit on it in your presentation. Oh no you just changed the wording in the presentation is we changed it to look at city hall in general and there's a variety of areas that we need to look at.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so we wanted to have a space planner first and then look at what the key improvements are. So we're changing the use of that money, but it's still asking for that money for improvements within City Hall.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. So but it is it's not just for finance. It's going to be for other general, it.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Could be for other. And it may have to have some funding increased in the in the in the mid-cycle.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But. Okay, because I do know that we have I'm looking at the classifications for the city attorney's office. And I do know that they're they're fairly compacted within their office. And there was that other office that was down the hall.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I guess my concern is making sure that because we do have the city prosecutor now, making sure that there's a secure office for our city attorney's staff so that they can conduct necessary calls and have meetings. And is that going to be part of this?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Are we just doing wear and tear?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'No, we're looking at office space. And so.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So it's going to be everything.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That would be looked at as part of.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That whole thing. Okay. I know our city at this. This is just me asking questions. This isn't from our city attorney. And I haven't spoken with him about this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think Mrs. Darrow wanted to comment.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I just want to point out something. We do have a person starting on Monday, and to be perfectly honest, we're trying to figure out where to put that person. Mm hmm. Literally.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Understood. And then my other question is, on the on the the change. This is a question for nancy, our h.r. Director for the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'City.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'For the purse issue for the police. I know that we're we're taking out that longevity requirement. And you said that it's not going to have a fiscal impact. So we give a 5% differential for any police officer coming in that has a bachelor's degree for any bachelor's degree.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. But we we actually looked at it and we don't have a significant number. So we didn't see a huge impact. So you're right, they wouldn't have to wait as long, I think is.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Do we have officers that don't have a bachelor's degree? Yes. Is it a requirement, though? Is it part of the current job specs?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Not for the police officer.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So there's no requirement in the job specs to have a any sort of higher education for new hires?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'No. And I mean, I want to be careful and look, but no, we currently not at police officer at the higher levels, there are some.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Requirements and that's just for the upper management within the police department. Okay. And the masters, that's for any masters. Again, it's not like job relevant or specific.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The language does state that it needs to be that that both the bachelor's degree and the master's degree have to have some relationship to the work that they're doing. Um, we really honor the degree so we, we look at that and evaluate it, but the language does state that there has to be some relationship.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So it speaks to, I don't have it in front of me. It's the specific degrees we look at or something similar.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I did have one question when you were a mr. when you were going down some of our expenditures and there was the $111,500 to repair or rebuild Woodstock Park after an arson fire. So I believe the arsonist was identified.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So is it possible to go that was $111,500. Is it possible to go after per insurance or a subrogation action?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So I can certainly ask Mr. Sharon to respond to that. But part of the what city has is a deductible. And so because this didn't really reach our insurance level, the city actually has to pay the deductible portion of it or self-insured retention portion?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, I get the self-insured retention portion, but nonetheless, does that stop us from seeking reimbursement from the responsible party?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Um.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Restitution? Yeah. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So that's probably something I would ask Mr. Sheehan. It would have been done through risk management.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Um, I'm not aware that we. I understand that it was an arson that occurred there. I don't know if there was an arrest made, and I don't know where the prosecutorial status of that case would be. And so.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, well, I might just suggest that for $111,000 and we're going to look at, you know, our next item about park facilities, and there's never enough money to do everything we want.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Is that one of the things I would suggest we can certainly attempt? Depends on what the person has. It might be difficult to collect something like that. I mean, we certainly could try but.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Be a vice mayor.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It was a 13 year old child. So I just want to be careful that I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Wasn't ever going to say that there's such a thing as insurance policies that families have. And I, I was aware of that.'",

I thought it was very thorough and very excited to be supporting the sustainability and resiliency position. That's a position that this council asked staff to very specifically worked to bring back, and it was exciting to see that happen and'",

So what I'll be doing with you, I know it's late, but I'm going to be reviewing the project status, the staffing and timelines and funding for each of the projects that are currently happening, as well as potential future projects, as well as essentially a third category of projects that are'",
        "'speaker_6': 'being built by developers but in collaboration with my department and will be managed operated by maintained by LAPD. So could I actually not have this one up with the map? Exhibit two, please.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I thought this was exhibit two. I'm so sorry.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Unless I got it. But if I can get the map. Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The map is actually exhibit one, I think.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Oh, my apologies. So. Okay, it's great. Okay, we'll fix it. So just to give you a sense of the scope, I wanted to give a sense of what I call the life of a project. This was really helpful for the commissioners when I presented at the Recreation and Parks Commission, just to give a sense of how much'",
        "'speaker_6': 'work actually goes into building a park. It doesn't just appear and there's a lot of steps in between when it's thought about and when it actually opens to the public.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's not just the ribbon cutting.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's not just a ribbon cutting, a fabulous ribbon cutting party, which we hold great parties. There's essentially three phases of the thank you of the park development. There's a master plan, conceptual design for starters. The second is doing detailed design and construction documents, and the third is actual construction.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'A fourth essentially is ongoing long term maintenance. So I always like to not lose sight of that and the costs associated with that. So for the first half, what we do is we do conduct a request for proposals for a master plan and then manage all of the public input and outreach to the community and getting that'",
        "'speaker_6': 'information and compiling it into a master plan and work with architects to complete that and get it back to the Recreation and Parks Commission and City Council for approval. Once we have our master plan, then we do another request for proposals for an architect to do detailed design and construction documents and work closely.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's a pretty in-depth process. During that time, we're identifying funding sources for each of these three phases. That could be grant funds, that could be development impact funds, that could be general fund, could be a mixture, usually a mix of all of them, and managing those grants in the budgets for each of those steps, as well as'",
        "'speaker_6': 'identifying maintenance funding. There's also securing as an island. We have a lot of permits that can take six months to a year. And so that's regional state, federal, city permits. And then we get to go out to bid for construction and do all the problem solving throughout construction.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then we get to accept the project and have a grand opening and ongoing maintenance. So staffing for these projects of what I just outlined. So as the director, I'm responsible for the overall project maintenance, project management, as well as securing all funding, managing all of the budgets, doing the master, planning the request for proposal processes, the'",
        "'speaker_6': 'detailed design and high level construction oversight and decisions. And a lot and a lot and a lot of problem solving. I work with our parks manager who helps consult on designs leading up to detailed designs because he knows what it works for maintenance and operations.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'He also assist with daily field coordination during construction. And then we have a public works project manager who basically jumps into the process once we're doing going out to bid and then coordinates the many moving parts during construction.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'He also will get involved in larger projects like Estero Park or Sweeney Park during design development. So we make sure it's a it's a good biddable design. As I mentioned, most of our projects are funded by a wide range of funding sources.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The timing of when those sources become available is very unpredictable, will apply for grants. We may or may not get them. Development impact fees come only when housing developments are actually pulling building permits, and so that can be unpredictable.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So with that, I want to start with going through the current park, our park projects to give you a sense of what we're currently working on and what's coming down the pipeline. So you know what you have before you cruisy park for starters, I want to see this.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So Cruzi Park is right here on the east end of the island. We're right in the middle of construction right now as we speak. We've. Or the foundation. So it is finally actually happening. This has been a long time coming.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This project replacing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Started.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'A.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Few false starts since 2000. I think a lot about these. So we are replacing that recreation center with a new 2000 square foot recreation center. It will provide youth afterschool programs, rental facilities and much more. It will be fully built out, including furnished by June 2020.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We also have the City Aquatic Center that is in concept design. It's progressing to the Commission Recreation and Parks Commission this month and to City Council in either April or May. And we had and that was a big public input process.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We had three community meetings and so we're working through that. That's an interesting project because it's completely unfunded for detailed design and construction. And as you know, we're considering funding options such as a potential revenue measure. And so that's one of those projects where all these projects we can develop a park priority list, but we really need'",
        "'speaker_6': 'to consider it to be dynamic. And I'll talk about that a little bit later. And the City Aquatic Center is a great example of that, because if it does get funded, it would be a massive amount of staff, time and resources.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If it doesn't get funded, we can redirect those staff time and resources to other projects. Jackson Park Player is something that you funded. Thank you. In the this two year budget cycle, we're finalizing several concepts for that play area currently and be bring it out to to the commission for design for decisions and then construction.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And we've also been completing related pretty large maintenance projects on pathways and trees that have been taking a lot of interaction with with the local neighbors on those. We also have our annual playground replacement. We're replacing Bayport Park later this month on March 25th.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We have a neighborhood meeting with designs. We'll be making decisions and that's on that and that's moving forward with Cruisy. Park is our next playground for this in 2021. We also have creek, a park parking lot actually went out to bid today for the for the parking lot itself and working closely with Greenway Golf on utilities.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And that's had a lot of complications within that project. And they're also improving the sidewalks. We also have Northwest Territories regional shoreline up at Alameda Point. We recently had a thank you in memorandum of understanding, really kind of a historical moment with the Park District to to start to really move that park forward.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm excited to report that today. Actually, I had a meeting with the Park District and we're already coordinating on how to get tours out there for the public. So it's exciting. It's moving forward. The work behind it means we need to do the lease agreement over the next year and then subsequently start working on the conceptual plan'",
        "'speaker_6': 'and community input with public feedback. After that estuary park we've completed a couple of years ago, phase one of the athletic facilities is heavily used and appreciated by the community. Phase two is a really critical component because that's all of the park.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's your average park that you think of for the community. It's it's it's the playgrounds and the grass area and the picnic areas and basketball courts, dog park. And that will serve that little four acre park will serve all of Alameda Landing, which currently has no park other than just some grass.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It'll serve all of our Admirals Cove. So it's a bit of a a park poor area in terms of of that type of active park. It's there's no funding currently for it. It's estimated about $5 million. And so that for staff has been a top priority on figuring out how to get that funded because that's a need'",
        "'speaker_6': 'with residents now living in those new developments. Gene 20 Open Space Park. We've completed phase one, the most eastern portion, as well as across the Alameda Trail. Phases two and three are remaining and many people are asking when that that will be completed.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It includes community garden and includes a large open space that is on hold. No working can both no work. And I can't go after grant funding until we settle the eminent domain case. And so that is essentially on hold until we we we work through that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And interject a quick question here for the city attorney. Why is it that I think I read in the staff report we don't even have a court date until February of 2021.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I so in these these closed cases, unfortunately, suffer from everything else in the court system, which is that everything takes just okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is it just a lower priority or everything is.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'A lower priority to criminal cases, basically, and because criminal cases under state law has to be brought to trial within 30 days or 45 days without a time waiver. Everything is a lower priority to criminal cases.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is in eminent domain case is going to be heard before a criminal judge.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'No, but but in terms of how the court system distributes, judges have to staff criminal courts first before they staff civil courts.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Okay. Thank you for that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then we have the pathway is long for inside. And I'm sure I'm currently work with the city attorney's office. We've been meeting with every single neighbor, adjacent neighbor, because we have to do the legal work to get the new easements and do boundary work, survey work and get the new easements in place and get them done'",
        "'speaker_6': 'right so we can move past and not have the murkiness that we've had in the past. We also need to start short term improvements to make sure that the existing conditions are are appropriate and safe. And so subsequent to that, there will be design which will be quite complex.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's a four, four, five little pathways, it's a very complex design as well as a lot of regional permits. But we will start that design once we complete the legal easement work. So those, as indicated by the little blue shovel on the map in front of you are all of the existing current park projects.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. I'm going to jump to the projects that are being constructed, developed by developers and will be maintained by LAPD, because there's there's just there's less to say about those in some respects. But I don't want to undersell them because they are adding significant amount of new parkland to our community and will cost to maintain they'll be'",
        "'speaker_6': 'maintained by community facility districts so they won't be, in effect, impact to the general fund. But they also have been taking staff time on my part in terms of working with them to get the designs right for the community as well as something that we feel is appropriate to for us to maintain.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So that includes Alameda Point, Waterfront Park and along Seaplane Lagoon. Those are in the green shovels and the neighborhood park, which is a small linear park, but has a lot of components packed into a little park because it's serving 800 homes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so that has everything from fitness equipment to playgrounds to picnic areas and basketball court. So it has a lot packed into a little park. The last park being constructed by developers and maintained by LAPD is Alameda Landing Waterfront Park, which will be really unique for us.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we've been working out a lot of details on that because it's a we call it internally Pier Park because it's all a park on a concrete pier. And so that's very new for us and how to figure out how to do everything from like how do you install Drip when you're on top of a concrete pier'",
        "'speaker_6': ', drip, irrigation, things like that. And so that was just more complex on the on the design front. So jumping to new park projects, those are the ones with the little trees. One is to water park, kayak launch. It's a it's a non-motorized it's a proposed non-motorized watercraft launch.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So stand up paddleboards, kayaks, canoes, things like that. This was part of the Recreation and Park Commission's recommendation. They wanted to see us complete existing projects. They see the ferns on New Shore Pathways as an existing project, and they felt that this kayak launch as part of that project, simply because it was discussed, it wasn't part of'",
        "'speaker_6': 'the council final action, but it was discussed during that time, during that project as an alternative because that community, that neighborhood wanted a kayak launch. And and my recommendation was not to put one in in a neighborhood like that at Liberty and E Shore and instead to put it here at two Water Park.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If you'll excuse the interruption. It is 1055 and council. We need to consider a motion before we get to 11 p.m.. We have two remaining items there. Council referrals items nine, eight and nine B. We have no speakers on either.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Do we want to go past? Do we want to hear those after 11:00 and I need four votes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Vote some to do that I'll second.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, we have a motion. We have a second.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Can we put a tie? I'm hoping that we can get out of here by time by midnight, and if we not move them to the next. So I'm happy to support.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I wonder if we could say 1130 instead of midnight, try to get us out of here on the same day we can move discussion right here. Yeah. 11 Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': '1130 But that will reconsider then.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. Okay. All right. We're going to go until 1130 right now with the intent of hearing 99 be okay. All in favor of doing that. I can I get a verbal from you Mr.. Today so thank you. Just follow this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. We're going to move quickly. Thank you. And this.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Is great. So this kayak launch does have potential for funding, is completely unfunded, does have potential funding from the Division of Boating and Waterways. They have a fund specifically for public kayak launches that hardly anyone ever applies to and as a fund sitting there that they've asked me to apply for.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So that has a potential D paved park is another one that is a new park that doesn't currently have any funding and is on the most western side leg of Seaplane Lagoon. It's been described in the Alameda Point town of waterfront for a precise plan is to convert its about 22 acres of existing concrete surface to passive'",
        "'speaker_6': 'parkland and sustainable ecological area, including wetlands. This would be designed to date over time and adapt to sea level rise. It does have strong potential for carbon sequestration benefits, but it's not specifically listed in the Climate Action Resiliency Plan for that purpose.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This was recommended by the Commission to be the essentially the first new park on the list. So in terms of these four new parks that I'm discussing, they wanted to water park, kayak, launch to be first and then DEP have to be next after that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There is a strong potential funding source for this in Measure AA, which is the San Francisco Regional Bay Restoration Authority, and they have grant applications every December. So we could go to apply for a grant this December for a master plan process and then subsequently after that apply for construction.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It would be a strong candidate for that. And that measure is funding, I believe, for about the next 20 years. So we have a number of cycles that we can use to go after potential funding for that. For this project.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Enterprise Park is a triangular down by the internal boat launch. It's about 12 acre park between until sailboat launch and the USS Hornet, kind of includes the old Navy campground and recreation center. This has strong potential for public private partnerships.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We have had a couple different local Alameda businesses express interest in public private partnerships here. The commission has has discussed this project in the past and so this is another potential project. Lastly, the Alameda Point Regional Sports Complex, a large 57 acre area up by the Alameda Point Gym in the skate park and spanning west and would'",
        "'speaker_6': 'have a variety of athletic facilities there. Currently, site developer Alameda Point Partners has to put had to put one point per their developers agreement $1.8 million in. So we will have that available any time we want to start the master plan process for that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Other than that, there's no design or construction funding identified. So with that I conclude my report and open any questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Do we have any clarifying questions of the staff report before we go to public speakers? Okay. And we have public speakers, correct? We have four public speakers. Okay. And public speakers. You all have up to 3 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You don't have to feel. You have to use them all. But you've waited a long time to speak. So let's hear our public speakers Don Lemon.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Ruth, Abby, Richard Bangert and Marjorie Powell.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Good evening.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Good evening. I did vote, but, you know, I think there's a limit on the number of hours that the weekend holds.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Well, thank you. I think you're good word for that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'My name is Dawn Lemoine. I'm here to speak in favor of making D Paved Park the highest priority of the Alameda Recreation Park Department. The city's recent Climate Action and Resiliency Plan focuses on, quote, an integrated approach consisting of both adaptation and greenhouse gas reduction.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Development of Deep Park will further the goals of the Climate Action Plan. It will do so by number one, reducing the effects of sea level rise with the development of tidal marsh. And number two, reducing greenhouse gas as marshes act as carbon sinks through absorption of CO2 during photosynthesis.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Furthermore, as we develop Alameda Point, the deep park will ensure resources remain for our beloved species of birds that nest around the Deep Park area. And I'm talking about great blue herons are endangered, leased terns, Caspian Terns, Ospreys and others.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I urge the City Council to move expeditiously to hire an engineering consultant to develop the master plan for Deep Pave Park. I further urge you to grant the HPD request for funding for an additional staff person who can start writing grant requests for the development of the park.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Next to her. Ruth. Abby.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You mean Ruth? Abby with Community Action for.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Sustainable Alameda, I am also.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Writing to support the.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Implementation of D Pave Park. It's a unique opportunity for the city in that it is a passive park. So it's not, you know, technically about trails and and playgrounds. It's about an investment in our future. It is going to be a symbol for us, but it also is going to help us with our sea level rise, our'",
        "'speaker_4': 'adaptation. And I'm not and I think we feel some urgency because we may not always have the philosophy that that Parkland needs to be brought back to the wetlands and back to the sea. And so we would really like to bake this project.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In to the goal setting of this council and ask that you prioritize.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This project. We very much recognize the constraints that the Rec and Park Department is under in terms of their staffing, particularly for project management and support of the director. We have so many park projects and they're so important and there's so much funding out there that's available and it's the stuff capacity issue and you know that I'",
        "'speaker_4': 'feel like we're up against and I feel as though we would very much support the idea of additional staff support for that department. I also think this particular project of Deep Park might be something that could be supported by the new position and climate and resiliency manager to support looking for those regional grants and support the project'",
        "'speaker_4': 'management of a park like this.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Which is not a traditional recreation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Park, but is a different kind of.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Unique opportunity for us.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mr. Boehner.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mayor. Excuse me. Members of the council and staff, thank you for going through this process and putting together this priority list. And I would just echo what the previous two speakers stated very well about the importance of the park, and I would hope that you would incorporate those recommendations into any motions that you make tonight'",
        "'speaker_2': 'because the agenda item says approve a priority list. But of course, approving a list isn't an action item. I mean, it's a list. So I would I, I was hoping after we started this process, after the council referral back in October, that if the park came out on top, that we would then decide to move forward.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think I think based on what the previous two speakers said, I won't say everything again, but I think we can we can start moving forward with with the planning process. And I think that's. Urgent. And I think we should begin tonight by making a motion to do so.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Marjorie Powell. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hello, Mr..'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Powell. Hello, members of the council. I am Marjorie Powell. I want to echo earlier comments and just make a couple of additional points. As Alameda Point gets developed, we will see much increased human use over what's been happening out there for the last five or ten years.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's going to put additional pressures on the various resources that are available for the all of the wildlife out there. But I'm focusing particularly on the wildlife, the birds that use that area. There is both the concern for sea level rise, but also a concern for warming of the ocean and acidification of the ocean, both of which'",
        "'speaker_5': 'are caused by increased human use, both of which influence the things that grow in the ocean on which the birds and the other animals out there feed. Think both the insects and the small fish. The in particular the least terns need small fish because they're feeding tiny chicks who don't chew.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They simply swallow whole. So the the marshland development is going to be additionally important as that part of the island gets development. So I urge that you not only approve the list, but to the extent that staff has any resources, they start the process of looking for a consultant.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then I echo the point that when you come to talk about additional staffing, that the Recreation and Parks Department needs additional resources given all of the parks within the city. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Is that our last proposal? Okay. So, discussion council. I mean, I look to my left. Vice mayor.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm sure. Thank you for this. I really appreciated the staff report. I think it involved the written report provided a lot of important information. I guess I have a question. So so when I read the staff report, what I read is we have a lot of priorities.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We don't have the staffing tonight. We are not being asked to add staff in. And I would not support the idea of using the currently the recent just a point just created sustainable and resiliency position to all of a sudden become kind of an A in adjunct parks position.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I know that's something that might come forward in the mid-cycle, but I don't think that that's the type of working together and making sure that all of our departments are working on issues. A concept at least I approved that that piece for I.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So again, I said when this came back the first time I was on the planning board, when this was when this was developed and designed, I was a strong voice for Dave Park. I'm excited about Dave Park. I'm a little concerned that it's a park that is not in any plans right now.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We talk about resiliency and yet we have 11 resiliency projects that are unfunded in our recently adopted carp. This was not one of them. We have got sequestration projects in the carp that are identified and unfunded, and this is not one of them.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I'm just a little concerned that we are that that if we're not careful, I don't I'm not here to say let's not move forward with this at all. But I think if we're not careful, we're all of a sudden taking one park and jumping it to the head of a line of a lot of stuff after'",
        "'speaker_8': 'we've done a whole holistic planning around around parks and around and around climate. And so I think for me, if I was going to support something moving forward tonight, I think it basically I did ask staff and they have identified some funding that would be available to help plan this park that becomes available later this year, that'",
        "'speaker_8': 'would not be available to fund any of the other unfunded needs that we have for resiliency or parks or whatever else. And I think that if we were to give direction, I think tonight we need to make a a recommendation based on the the resources we have.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Because I sat in a meeting today with our traffic and traffic safety folks and talked about all the needs they have. And I and I've heard from other departments about the needs that are, you know, that are coming forward and mid-cycle.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I don't know where additional staffing is going to come, but I can't vote on something today. Assuming that in June I'm going to vote on it on a vote to approve another position for rec and park specifically because I haven't seen what all those with all the.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So far. So for me, I'd like to see something that maybe gives direction. I like the way that, that, that, that, that this was presented as a priority and it was a presented in the win there. You know, we have the part that sorry.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I didn't want to go too late losing my ability to to think I like the fact that the that the rec and park commission and the staff report really laid out like let's do the things we we are already doing, let's finish the things we have already started.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And then where it doesn't conflict and interfere and keep us from doing those things, we should also then start to work. And so I think whether it's the and I don't remember if it's probably a I think it was the the funding source funds that become available later this year.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'If we were able to write a grant that successfully got us a consultant who could actually do the planning so it could actually expand the resources we have in order to move forward on something like this. I think that would be a fantastic opportunity and so I'd be more than happy to support something like that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. As long as I'm on my left hand side. Councilmember Vella, do you want to go next?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I. I appreciate the work that's gone into this. I defer a little bit from my colleague in that when I look at the staff report in terms of the new park projects, it says Park No Direction received council referral from November 2019, but it was actually also talked about even prior to November of 2019.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We had, I think in the first my first year on council, we had extensive conversations about De Park. And I do know that we've discussed in terms of the two water park kayak launch, but we also have some other water based parks that are coming along that are through developer projects.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I. I would like to see us really start to focus on depth in terms of while we might not necessarily be funding things right away, we need to start seeing it show up in plans and then figuring out what the pathway forward is.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I understand that staff has limited amount of time to work on things, but I think we have a lot of nice parks throughout Alameda. It's one of the the things that makes Alameda. Alameda, but if we don't put d pave on the map and start carving out some time for it, I do have concerns that it's'",
        "'speaker_4': 'going to continue to be this item where we have not given clear direction to actually do that. So I want to do that tonight. I want to say, please move pave up on this list and and tell us what what are the next steps that where, you know, what do we need to do to to start making'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it a little more of a place? Because I remember Councilmember Marta Rossi brought this up when I was first here in the issues were signage and things like that. And we were told we can't do that because it would create liability issues.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But it's it's basically sitting out there with a ton of potential. And we're not we're not doing anything with it. And it is this concrete wasteland. And I don't want to see that happen to what could be a very nice space.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I understand that there's all of these other, you know, state pressures coming down for other things. But I want to make sure that West Alameda and I know we've got Jean Sweeney and we've got the Cross Alameda Trail opening up through our Pizarro Parkway and things like that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I want to make sure that De Pave doesn't get forgotten. And I think that it could play a key part in our climate action plan. So I'd like to see it prioritized higher.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember de SAG.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Well, thank you very much to Parks Director Woolridge and her presentation. And the map is very helpful in letting not just council members but the public see the breadth of new projects that were doing throughout Alameda not not just the east end of town but but but thankfully so much is happening on the west end of town'",
        "'speaker_12': '. So I am I am so happy to see this map that's presented here. And I love all those little.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Shovels, too.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'You know, I certainly welcome staff's recommendation, but I certainly also want to hear what my colleagues say in terms of, you know, how they would like to prioritize matters. You know, in terms of D Pave Park, I certainly join Councilmember Ody as well as all the other council members in in supporting De Pave Park largely because it's'",
        "'speaker_12': 'it's a different type of park, you know. I mean, we we in our minds, we have a certain thing about parks and how they function in our neighborhoods and how they look. But D pave in a way is is that not thinking out of the box for the sake of thinking out of the box, but thinking out'",
        "'speaker_12': 'of the box because there's a functional aspect to it with regard to climate change. And we can certainly be one city that that shows other cities how when it comes to planning parks, we can do it intentionally with regard to climate change.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So that's why I certainly support I supported Councilmember Odie when he brought forward the matter again several months ago. Thank you for her for for letting me join you on that. And and I'm glad to see that there's not only community support, but that that our Parks and Rec and I also vetted this as well.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So I look forward to what my colleagues have to say.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Alley, thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'll be quick. I also appreciate all the work that Amy and her staff has done. It was nice to walk home from the event on Saturday and basically almost walk entirely through parks between Jean Sweeney and Lydecker Park.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I was only a block away from home, so that was really great and it was a nice day too. So I think this council has a chance to go down, as you know, the most climate friendly council that we've ever had.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We did the climate emergency. We did the Climate Action Plan. We hired the sustainability person or we didn't hire them. We authorized the money today. And now, you know, we have an opportunity to prioritize a park. You know, that could be state of the art.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You look around the world, you know, Hong Kong has these wetlands park right on the edge of of of development, you know, huge, huge, huge populated cities. So the advocates of this park, you know, did what was asked of them.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We sent this to the Park and Rec Commission. They evaluate it and they put it at the top after the two parks that are already in process. So I think we need to respect that, that decision. So I'd like to move to accept the recommendation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Would you mind if I had a chance?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I want to make the motion because then we can have discussion. But I want to move to approve the priorities and then with direction to staff, to hire a consultant to develop this master plan and ballpark the cost and get this back to us by the end of July.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I'm going to speak next. That motion hasn't been seconded yet. I am I almost.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'A rule that you have to do a motion first before discussion. So.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, well then I will just comment that I was actually going to make my comments first, but I decided to respect your ability to go next. Okay. It's been moved. It's been seconded in my turn to discuss, I think, the hours getting late here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I also want to commend Ms. Wooldridge. That was an outstanding staff report you put together and the exhibits were great and I love the map. I have. I have much the same map on my wall, but it doesn't have all the new I might need to get a new map.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I also very much respect the Recreation Park Commission. I know that Ms.. Aldridge is extremely pleased with their composition. I think they're doing a good job for us. And so I, I think, you know, I think everything the council has said tonight is true and correct, including the points that the vice mayor made about we do'",
        "'speaker_0': 'have a climate action resiliency plan, and this wasn't a part of it. But I think we can in this particular matter, we can do it. Also, I would support the staff recommendation, which is to and it seems I can almost move forward on two tracks because the funding streams would be different because there are is this funding'",
        "'speaker_0': 'that is specific to the sort of park that. Park is. So I would support following the recommendation of the the Recreation Parks Commission to have the three priorities. But the two along the the waterfront on the East End followed by D paved park but they might even be moving forward kind of simultaneously insofar as going after funding'",
        "'speaker_0': 'that apparently you've been asked to to apply for. So if that is indeed the motion, I support it to. Okay. For the commission.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Of course.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yeah. I guess I felt my comments were very aligned with the staff report and the recommendation of the of the park. But the motion then got into directing staff to hire an engineer and be back in July, which I don't think is.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But also, I'm not clear where the funding is coming from that. And I'm wondering if we can talk about what what is what is not going to happen.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You know what? I will just ask for clarification from the speaker. I'm sorry. I was trying to get a word in edgewise and so I wasn't probably listening as closely to. Can you tell us what Motion Councilmember Odie made was?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It was to move from all of the except the staff recommendation about the priorities with direction is staff to hire a consultant that would be returned back by July.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Oh.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Before the budget process. They. Okay. So that. Well, say it again if you would like.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It was to move acceptance of the staff recommendation on the priorities with directions of staff to hire a consultant that would return back in July. The matter.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I guess my my question is to the maker of the motion, where what funding are we using for that? Because we haven't we haven't budgeted for that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think I'll leave that up to the the staff to figure that out. I mean, they were going to do these other projects also. So. Right. So what funding is there for those projects?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. So.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I mean, the idea was to send it back to the Park and rec to prioritize on the budget they have on which ones they would focus on. And we don't even know how much this one's going to cost.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's why we want this done. It could be so cost prohibitive that we decide we're never going to do this. I don't know.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, so as long as we're discussing, I think I another way to approach it might be to hold off on the direction to hire until we've had our mid-cycle budget discussions in that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, I don't know how much it cost to develop an RFP. I can't imagine it's like super expensive.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, it's a little different than a fully loaded salary. I think we could agree to that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I mean, I would envision staff drafting an RFP, which I think they probably have them on the shelf that would require minor modifications. And then whatever the consultant I mean, they're not that expensive. I'm sure they're under the amount that even the city manager can approve.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I don't even know if it has to come back to us.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'My concern is just taking things outside of the budget process when we're so close to contemplating that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But my concern is that this idea keeps getting kicked down the road and now we have an opportunity. We did what we were asked to do, which was take it to the Park Commission and get prioritized. So do we just leave it there or do we actually do something about it?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Because maybe the intention was we thought we could kill it there, but it didn't die. So we need to keep it keep it moving.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I I'm I'm sorry. I am troubled by that. The suggestion that we sent things to the, the Recreation and Parks Commission, a very hardworking commission to be killed, I think they took their mission very seriously, and I think they came back with a good recommendation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember De So you wanted to say something.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'In terms of the RFP for a consultant when when the July timeline was mentioned, that wasn't for the consultant to finish the work, is that correct? That was just the to the time by which we would select a consultant.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Really?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah. So that we would have peace and people would come back with their proposals and then we would select somebody and then, you know, that would pretty much align with this December date to.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I am the city manager. Do you want to add anything?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I was going to ask the rec and park director to come up.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Here and just the introduction that she was seeking. Do you want to consult with as.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Far as timing of how long it would take to do an RFP for this particular type of function? That would be one question, and I don't even know if you have a projection on what the budget for this type of console would be.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I haven't delved into it enough to know the budget for a consultant. If I can tell you that the consultant to do the master planning process for the pool was about $68,000, so it could be roughly on that order of magnitude.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Regarding time frame, I'm a little unclear. Normally for this type project, when we do a request for proposals, we don't bring choice for those consultants. Back to Council for decision. That's a different level of RFP on the development side, but not on this level.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So. So the way it normally works is I identify funding prior to doing an RFP because I can't necessarily choose somebody and then say I need you to hold for a couple of months until I can get it in front of council because it takes us.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It takes me at least if I have staff reports done and contracts done and everything I have, I need at least a month to get in front of the City Council because the Sunshine Ordinance, the RFP process itself, they're a little bit off the shelf is the term I heard.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'However, this is, as was mentioned, a very unique park. So you want to find the right kind of consultant. Someone who designs a baseball field is not necessarily somebody that you want designing this unique type of park, so you want someone that has the ecological.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so I would need to get more educated. I haven't built this type of park before. I need to reach out to my resources to get educated, to make sure we find the right consultant and don't waste our money on someone who wasn't correct.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I need at least a few weeks to do that. Generally, we have an RFP open for 30 days and it generally takes us about a month or so to pull together an interview, panel interview and some more time to get it under contract.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's usually anytime a type of RFP or bid process is about a three month process.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we would.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Council member Rudy.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Would the beginning of September be reasonable to come back with? Whatever bids you get and then a budget request on whether we if we choose to accept one of those bids or authorize you to accept one of those bids, I really don't need to pick myself.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You know, can you? I think I see Mr. Leavitt wanting to add something maybe he can.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Recommend is that she put that in as one of your budget requests and then you can consider that during the mid-cycle.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In May. Correct. Early May.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'In May. June. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And that I mean, that's fine to. It's just I still think we need to get the RFP issued. If you need more than two weeks or three weeks or four weeks to do that, then tell us how much you need.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But at least we can get that out there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Vela, did you want to say something?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think my concern and be this concern shared by my colleague is that if we don't at least start drafting the RFP and working on the RFP, we'll get proposals back. And we can we can put it in the in the budget cycle to actually say, okay, do we want to move forward?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But if we don't actually start working on figuring out what the RFP would look like, then we're really falling further behind.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I have a suggestion. What if as part of this motion we include direction to include in the budget, the mid-cycle budget, the position of a position for a consultant for this specific unique part, because I don't think it's just any park park consultant.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So with that and councilmember already to your concern that somehow and Councilmember Vela, I'm trying to be mindful of the concerns you're you're articulating. You don't want to see this pushed farther down the road. I'm here to tell you, it's the first meeting in March.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We're talking about the beginning of May when this would come back. And it's you know, I think I mean, I think everyone on this council is saying, yes, let's do this. But I just think that it's a little a little neater, a little more adhering to a good budget project, a process to include them, include this position'",
        "'speaker_0': 'with specific direction to staff to come back with working that into the budget.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, I agree with that idea, but I also think it should include some hard deadline on an RFP if that budget position is approved. I mean, whether that's whether May is too soon. I think I get that, whether June is too soon or July.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But, you know, some day because.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And and I understand that's your opinion. My feeling based on years of experience with Mr. Aldridge in the projects he's brought before us is that she gets the job done. And so I think that if we give direction that this is the will as a council and we're asking for that position in the budget, I don't feel'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the need to then, you know, double check her by telling her a date certain. And also we've heard her say that this isn't just any old park consultant and it might take just a little longer. But I don't.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I don't. Speaking for myself, I'm certainly not trying to delay what you're trying to accomplish.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I didn't I didn't say you did it, but I. I said I also know that our Amy does what we asked to do, but she's done a lot. I went to that meeting and heard all of that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So this is not on the agenda. I think you need more people, but that's not for today's discussion. So I trust that you'll do what what you need to do. But we've given you a lot, just like we given the traffic people and we've given everybody else a lot, but.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I mean, if maybe in the in the budget request, there is some some deadline put in that request, then, you know, that might work too.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Vela.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I would like it to come back before you know, before I've been on the council for four years because we have been talking about this specific space for literally the entire time I've been on council and it continues to come up is kind of here's the placeholder for it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I just want to make sure that whatever direction we're giving, it's clear enough that it doesn't come up again is on the list, but no council direction and no timeline. And I think that that's what we're trying to achieve.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm fine if you know, if if as part of the budget process, it has a date certain to come back in the fall, but I would like it to come back prior to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, I think in the budget it could come back sooner than the fall, the budget hearings early May.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's fine. I think the question is she saying we're hearing from the director that putting together the RFP is going to take time. So I think part of the direction should be to at least do some of the background work to identify what would need to even go in the RFP.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I might imagine that in order to put an item into the budget, there needs to be a little research about, you know, who that would be and how much it would cost. It is 1130, folks. So who wants to do.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Can I just I guess I'm just unclear on what what I get the prioritization and moving the park forward and everything else. I'm not clear on what the RFP and what we're the motion is to hire an engineer, which I don't think is the type of thing we need to hire for this project.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm sure that there will be engineers that are consulted at some point in time, but we don't even have a we have a minor concept, right? We have a high level.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What what may I actually ask a legal question really quickly when you just stuck something in my mind? So this recommendation in the staff report is to approve the Park and Recreation Facilities Project priorities. Are we getting beyond the scope of what we were asked to do in this staff report.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think is part of the prioritization. The council could certainly give direction about timing, right? It's I think the council probably wouldn't want to go into budgeting and deciding whether or not you want a budget for an engineer.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But I think if you were to just if the council direction was a particular deadline for a particular project, that's generally consistent with prioritization.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'A particular deadline for what?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'For a milestone. Right. Which is what I'm hearing from at least some of the council members. You want a milestone from a high priority for a high priority project to come back to the council that yeah, that's within the ambient prioritization.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But obviously the council shouldn't be, you know, establishing budgets making very.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm a little worried about date certain to come back with a date certain to come back with a RFP is that is that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think you're I mean that the staff may have concerns about operationally whether or not they could do it. But I think because you're prioritizing you're simply saying I think what I'm hearing is that I want the first step of this process to come back to the council in the next three months.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And that's the direction I think that's reasonable to give. As part of prioritization.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We did it on six B, so we've already done that once tonight.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I guess, Mayor Knox.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Could we could we just clarify the motion so that it right now, I think it's almost meaningless that the engineer part. So if the question is that we want some sort of a plan with funding, etc.. Because we can't do an RFP.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We don't know how we're funding this. I'd like to know if we're going if we're making a decision and it doesn't sound like we can actually say spend money on something specifically tonight, I'd like to know what we're not doing because we don't have a budget that's just the park slush fund.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So could we. Knowing that knowing following the mayor's recommendation, knowing the budget is coming in two months, could we ask that there be a proposal with funding and a timeline for moving this, for moving to the next phase of this park, which I would imagine is some sort of an RFP for a planning process for.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'What will be a large and interesting park.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mr. Levitt, what do you think?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yeah, I think you could do that. As far as timing, I would agree with that. If you said you wanted to have the console come back, we would put this as the number one priority. Priority, because it's the first time that you said you want this to be in the mid-cycle.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So if we don't have enough funding the mid-cycle, we'd cut something in there or we would put this before other other priorities if because it's the only one that you've prioritized at this point. I mean, why? Sorry. I mean, this is only if you said that, but is it consultants only?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It's not only, but it's 60000 to 80000 to what I'm guessing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, I think I'm hearing that we're prioritizing all three.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Well, what I heard was to have a consultant hired for this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'For this particular one. Madumere, please do things.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Maybe we should do the time. Yeah, I'd like to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, so we said that at 1130, we would decide if we were going to go beyond 1132 here items. 99 BE.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah. And I'm okay with that hearing them or not hearing them or hearing on the hearing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It takes four votes. And I don't think that we're going to be more productive as the hour goes on. So I won't be supporting that. And did I hear the vice mayor say he wouldn't either? Okay. Okay, I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So back to this.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Um, my comment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That was in your comment now.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Yes, yes, yes. My comment now.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Thank you. I think I will certainly join my colleagues in prioritizing Deep Park, largely because I do believe that there is community support for moving Dave Park forward, not just the support that I've seen recently, but it's the support that has been there for.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I mean, it was there when in my first go around 2012. 2016. Right. So. So, yeah. Who's counting? So, so I do think that there's community support behind it and the fact that it was prioritized high. So but I also respect the fact that Parks Director Woolridge, as well as our city executive staff are making are are'",
        "'speaker_12': 'causing us to make sure to put together an RFP that reflects our best judgment and research. And my hope is that all of that can be done within some time frame that's more immediate than not immediate. And at some point in time, if someone says September 2020, they'd like to see an RFP start moving forward.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I'm okay with that, that that falls within my timeframe. Do I have to prescribe it tonight? I don't know. But I do want to express my support and certainly moving forward, Dave Park because I do think that we're we're working on behalf of the people.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. Well said, Ms. Wooldridge.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If I could make a proposal so I'm more than happy to bring back a plan on D Pave Park, on what steps it'll take, what the funding is, what the timeline could be. If I could bring that later before our summer recess, somewhere around June, July.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'By that point, we may know more about potential funding sources for the Aquatics Center and what could or could not be happening with that. And so there's some other big projects that we'll know more at that point. And her and at that point, we may also have some decisions on whether there's additional staffing for the Recreation Department'",
        "'speaker_6': 'to help with this. Because then I can also do at that point is give you an update on okay, here's the D Pave Park plan. And if if staffing doesn't come during the mid cycle, here's what other projects will be delayed and by how long to refocus on this, because I guarantee other projects will get delayed.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It could be the aquatic center. It could be for inside. It could be a lot of other projects that will get significantly delayed. If I refocus on it was fine and that's your purview to determine, but I can give you that what that balance looks like when we have more information by June, July.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'During that time, I'm more than happy to start researching and figuring out what goes into an RFP of this type and start planning on an RFP. There's no funding attached to developing an RFP, and that's certainly fine.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'How does that sound?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It sounds good to me.'",
