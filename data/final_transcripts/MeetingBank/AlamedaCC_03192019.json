        "'speaker_0': 'And who pulled that? That was council member de sa, Mr. de sa.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Well, thank you, Madam Mayor. The reason why I pulled item five C is really just to make sure to clarify for purposes of the public that what's before us is not to hone in on any one particular option, but to have four options.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And the public will take a take a review of the different four options. And if we could have staff.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Good evening. Andrew Thomas Planning Director That's absolutely correct. Councilmember Desai We're talking about four different options for the segment of Central right around the Webster Street intersection.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And by the way, would you be Andrew Thomas, planning director?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I thank you. Have what I said.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Did you not did you. So my time is that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And we're going to be studying all four in equal levels of detail so detailed traffic analysis, parking analysis so that the public and the experts and everybody can see how they compare at that point. Once we have that information, it'll be time to start making decisions about the preferred.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Great. Thank you. And the second point that I just wanted to get across is I you know, I kind of feel that we're moving ahead with these projects along Central Avenue and potentially in Central Avenue. I kind of believe that we're moving ahead of these projects in a way that is not aligned with what's in our transportation'",
        "'speaker_7': 'or circulation element. And I feel that what we really need to do is, is modify, update different aspects of our general plan and do so in a comprehensive manner, and then see how particular projects like these bike projects, whether they're the issues crossing Webster Street or the bike project as a whole, how these fit in to the'",
        "'speaker_7': 'to the larger general plan as updated. And I would really encourage staff to think about that. I know that we're talking about updating our land use element, but but I do think we have to look at our transportation circulation aspects because of all these new projects and all these new plans that that we will talk about actually'",
        "'speaker_7': 'later. So I think this is an opportunity to begin to think about that comprehensively and also finally in a manner that really involves the public in a robust manner. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Vice Mayor. And that's why.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I just wanted to say that I appreciate staff bringing this forward. I think that the way in which the staff has brought has engaged the community and engaged our boards and commissions as well as the Council on moving this forward is really great.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's my hope that when we come back, when this comes back through the process, that staff will bring in it maybe a couple of options, but definitely one of the options that's going to come back is going to be the one that is determined to be the most safe and the one that identifies the best opportunity for'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Did you have a comment? Councilman Brody, just.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Quickly, I want to echo the vice mayor's comments, but Mr. Thomas, so what I didn't see in here is a timeframe on when we would get this back because this has kind of taken a while.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yeah. To be kind. It's a very kind of you to use those words. It is a.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'We're using state money to make the improvements. So we have to jump through a whole number of state hoops. We will be back shortly. It probably won't be the April 16th meeting. It'll be April 16th or the first meeting in May with a comprehensive report on this project, which will have much more detail about the steps and'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So five is adoption of thank you resolution amending the concession agreement with Deli Meat Inc known as Jim's on the course to provide an extension for completion of the event center at the Korea Park Golf Complex. Do we want to hear from staff?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Do we have whoever? Oh, it's pulled because we had speakers clips. Right. Okay. Do we want to brief staff overview of. Can you give us the 30,000 foot level as well? Then go ahead and introduce yourself. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Sure. Absolutely. So, Amy Wooldridge, Interim Assistant City Manager. So let's see, the brief overview is that the concessionaire Jim's on the course is is moving toward is in an agreement with the long term concession agreement with the city of Alameda to provide food and beverage at the golf course at Creek Park.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'He is building an event center as part of that agreement. That event center, he's expended about 8% of his budget toward completion of that event center. He's received his building permit and his his he has exceeded his original timelines and one as well as one administratively provided extension.'",

This amendment also adds the event, the enclosed patio and some version of that of design that would be determined later as a requirement as part of this amendment'",
        "'speaker_6': '. Those are the key components of this amendment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Are there any council questions or clarifications and separate work?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Councilmember Desai Thank you very much. Mr. Woolridge The question that I have is we received a letter via email from a stakeholder involved with Greenway. I believe the CEO name escapes me. Here was George Kelly, who was concerned about having perhaps a 30 day timeline within which certain plans could be.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Is that something that that, you know, is that something that you you were able to review and then come to some activations on that you can share?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Absolutely. Thank you, Councilmember De. So, yes, I'm happy to report that I've I've I had previously spoken to another principal with with Greenway Golf last week and also had already spoken with Tom Jacobs, the owner of gyms in the course and and what we can do and council that your purview can certainly add to this amendment is'",
        "'speaker_6': '. Well let me back up the goal really here is to ensure ensure a quality that the final product of the event center is a quality product and that really is in line with with the facility as a whole.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'What we can amend is a few things that I would recommend 45 days that the city has approval of all furniture, furnishings, fixtures and equipment for any. Some examples would be light fixtures, the restroom, counter flooring, walls, fixtures, chairs, tables, the patio furniture and pavers.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's an outdoor patio area adjacent to the event center. The carpeting, any interior exterior wall, finish paint window shades. So I have that detailed out. The other things I would recommend and has been agreed to is a landscape plan that again is approved by the city and that would be required to have approval by also 45 days'",
        "'speaker_6': 'within signing of the contract amendment. And then also there's been questions about the age vac and whether it is or isn't included. So I think we just put it in writing that there will be a fact included in this in this project.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Equipment approval at what level? By you by. Greenway by.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well contractually they're not gyms on the course is in a contractual agreement with the city, not with Greenway. So I would recommend approval by me as the representative of the city. The way I generally operate is, is the reality is I would be working with Greenway staff and I would talk to them and, and make sure that'",
        "'speaker_6': 'all parties are on the same page. But there's really not a contractual agreement between Greenway and Jim's on the course.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'It's not currently in there. This would mean in addition to what what is in the packet.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay, so my question is, are we allowed to, on the dias make an amendment?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, what I would mean.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'If that's what the desire of the council is.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'That up.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hold that hold that thought. Okay. Any other clarifying questions at this time? Okay. If not, I'm going to. I'm sorry. Councilmember Vella.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So, Amy, if Greenway doesn't like something that you know and they tell you that they don't like it, essentially, is that going to hold this up or what would happen? I know that you're you're kind of offering to mediate between the parties, but if there's some sort of issue or discrepancy or something like that, what happens?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Ultimately, it's still city discretion and city approval. So it would be in my discretion of whether I think that's valid or not. My goal with this approval would be that we have a good quality product at the end of the day that benefits the golf course as a whole and benefits the city because any revenue comes back'",
        "'speaker_6': 'to us. And also my goal would be to make sure it matches. You know, we don't want to have one type of paper over here and another type of paper over here so that it matches the look of the facility as a whole.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But ultimately, it's city discretion.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Any further clarifying questions? Okay. With that, thank you as well. With that, we will go to our speakers. We just have two speakers, 3 minutes each. Gentleman, it's George Kelly, followed by Ed Downing. Mr.. Mr.. Kelly.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Madam Mayor. And Council. My name is George Kelly. I'm the CEO of Greenway Golf. I'm the one that wrote that email yesterday. And basically, to express my concern over the, you know, the division and the quality of the improvement that is proposed to take place with the event center.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'One of the things that, you know, I'd like to point out, and I think it's very obvious to all of you, is that Greenway has made a tremendous investment in this golf course over the last six years. I got to say that we're one of the only companies in America investing as heavily as we are in golf'",
        "'speaker_4': 'at a municipal level. I'm proud of that. And I think at the end of the day, it's going to be a good investment for us, but that remains to be seen at this point in time. Everything that we've done to date is with the highest of quality in in our intent.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I just want to make sure that that the event center has this consistent level of quality. We don't want to have a situation where, on the one hand, you see the golf side and you go, wow, this is pretty cool.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then you go over to the event center and there's something missing. So with that being said, one of the things I wanted to point out is that currently most of the patrons at gyms are non golfers with the event center going in.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Most of the patrons are going to be golfers. So it's very this is a critical time for us. And but having said that, and in speaking with Amy and understanding the vision and and her commitment to seeing this through, I support the extension until the end of the year with the condition that within the next 45 days'",
        "'speaker_4': ', we have some level of specificity in terms of the quality of the improvements that are going into place. Obviously, we're not going to be the ones that can approve or disapprove of it. But I think working with Amy, we have a good relationship with her that will get the result that we want and need.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Kelly. Mr. Downing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Mayor Council City staff. My name is Ed Downing. I'm chairman of the Alameda Golf Commission. A week ago tonight, the Alameda Golf Commission met and took a unanimous vote in support of the city staff recommendation to modify gym's concession agreement.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I'm here tonight just to inform you that and express my strongest support for moving ahead with that. My belief is that Jim, as a longtime Alameda business, he deserves the opportunity to finish this project. And having talked at length to the folks at gyms, I believe that that will happen.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm also encouraged tonight to hear the discussion about Greenway and the folks at gyms getting together to resolve these issues. I think that would be very beneficial. So I'm just here to express my strongest support. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. That's my last speaker's. I'm going to close public comment and open council discussion. I'm going to just lead and say that I do have concerns and I've spoken with Ms. Wooldridge about this, that this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Contract was given to gyms on the course back in December of 2017 and there were a number of completion dates that have been missed. I think the first one was probably unrealistic because it was six months to complete an event center.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I am concerned that we are now, when we come to the end of this year, going to be two years from when this project was first supposed to have started. But I you know, I, too, am encouraged by the communication from Mr. Aldridge and from Mr. Kelly.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But colleagues, what do you think? Who wants to start? I'll go with Councilmember Vela.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And Madam Chair, I think you noted this. I think some of the there's a bit of idealism involved in the original plan in terms of seeing things through and getting things permitted. I don't you know, one question that I had asked Ms. Wooldridge, when when we met, was specifically what's the typical permitting time for some of these'",
        "'speaker_8': 'things and would it have even been possible for somebody else to have gotten it done? And I think, you know, when we look at it from that angle, I think that, you know, it would have been a lofty goal to get all of that done in the in the time specified.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But I also think that the the language proposed and some of the concepts discussed about trying to make sure, you know, first of all, the city still has the ability to make sure that everything's synthesized and works out there.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And and the extension, the extensions, not asking for an unreasonable amount of time. So I'm I'm inclined to support it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I saw Councilmember Desai stand up.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. I just want to make three points. First is I had the pleasure several weeks ago of of going through the golf course, the south. BARTLETT Yeah. And, you know, obviously everyone knows I'm not a golfer, but I got to say, that is an incredibly beautiful course.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I mean, the the semi athlete in me and the urban planner in me just has to just be amazed by that course. And I hope maybe if residents can, I don't know, walk through there, they will just be startled at how beautiful it is.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But in addition to it is functionality in terms of dealing with water and all that kind of stuff, it's just amazing. I mean, I went there after there are some rains and there are people still golfing out there.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The rain had occurred the day before, but the golf course was dry and so I was just amazed at the quality of work that's been done there. So I do. So I'm very glad to see that, you know.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'LAPD Director Woodridge and soon to be assistant. Soon to be interim city manager. Woodridge is, you know, taking will be incorporating, you know, ways in which we can make sure that the project that that's really at hand is aligned with is consistent with the the incredible beauty of the golf course that you have out there.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'If if residents have a chance, you should go tour it because it's so it's amazing. So I'm very happy that about the 45 day period over which, you know, hopefully landscaping plans will be submitted as well as, you know, city getting approvals with regard to Finney's.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I guess the third point I want to say is, you know, yes, for some it's been, you know, maybe two years. But, you know, I remember voting on this, I believe, in 2015. So for me, it's been four years.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So. So we do have to get moving in terms of having not only a beautiful golf course, but an event center that that that complements the beautiful golf course. Because, I mean, the extent to which how beautiful it is, as we were people even talking about it in terms of possibly having a PGA event there.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So so I'm just talking about, by the way, the South course. I expect that the north course, I think it's called, will be just as beautiful.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Anyone else. Okay. And I will just just segway on to that that yes, I believe that completed. Well, this course in the event center has the ability to attract pro golf tournaments and, you know, the banquets and all that follow.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's also been a great opportunity for young golfers, the youth golfers, to learn the sport. And it's a great form of recreation. And also the event center in the beautiful location should be a possible venue, say, for weddings and banquets and such.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I will and I very much would approve this adopting this resolution with the amendment that recreation parks director, interim assistant city manager Aldridge made about the 45 days to approve the Fannie's if come December of 2019, this project isn't completed, I will not be inclined to entertain another extension, but I hope it doesn't come to that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So with that, Councilmember Odie.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think the two of us didn't talk.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But okay.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I mean, I'm going to support this as well. I just want to point out, if you look at the staff report on page two, it wasn't until December 17th, just a mere three months ago that they actually received the building permit and that there's still mechanical electrical permits that that they're waiting for review.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I why some people may be concerned about the the time length and the delay. I mean, a lot of that is probably on the city for not issuing permits. So I don't feel necessary to hold that against the concessionaire.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I am concerned about this 45 day thing, which, you know, the public doesn't had notice about. I didn't have notice about. And I mean, I'm just curious whether that's something we're even allowed to do on the fly here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So with that, I'm going to turn to our inner city attorney, Michael Roush.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mayor. Thank you, mayor and council. I would agree that I would not recommend that we add that to the Second Amendment at this time. I think Council has given direction with respect to what it wants to see with respect to the 45 day review period.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Let that run its course. If there's an issue with that in some respect, we can bring back a Third Amendment. But I would be more comfortable with just dealing with the Second Amendment, with the provisions that are in the agenda report, rather than adding this on, because perhaps some member of the community might not have understood that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'this was going to be part of what the council was going to discuss.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So, Mr. Marsh, to your point, what if we were to come out with a language, Madam City Clerk, continue this item to the next meeting in order to get that 45 day period in? Because I do happen to think when we look at the delays and I am I am not aware of any evidence that it was'",
        "'speaker_0': 'our city's building department that has caused the delay. And so I certainly wouldn't want to rely on that. The fact that they just got the building permit in December, a year after their contract was granted. So is it possible to come back?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And before you answer that question, I think I've got comments from, like I said, the vice mayor and then Councilmember Vella.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, I do think we have the ability I would just say to to add this, I think it's actually adequately noticed. It doesn't specifically tie us into something, but I will not be supporting a Second Amendment without the this this language.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I wanted to thank. I'm going to go with Amy. I don't know what to call you anymore. So any.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Title must always.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Work.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'She spent a lot of time. We talked a lot about the need for these types of concerns. I know that there is a lot of just concern between the parties out there. And I think this gives us a little bit of control to make sure that we can help everybody reach the goals that we wanted to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I really appreciated Chair Downey coming in speaking. I too agree that this is an operator that's a local business that we should be supporting. We should be going out of our way to support our local businesses that every at every turn.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'On the other hand, like the mayor, I will not be entertaining future amendments. It's time. It's time to get this thing done. So I however, we decided to go forward related to the noticing. I am not inclined to sign a Second Amendment and then hope that we have a signed Third Amendment at some other future point.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Vela.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I had a couple more questions for this, Will Rich. So that with regarding the permit issues, can you kind of talk a little bit about that in terms of what the timing of the permits were and when or if there was a permit that was delayed longer than others?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I can't speak to other permits. Every permit is unique in terms of the level of complexity. It depends on what submitted it. And so there's that. But I will say I don't think this was held up by the permits.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think I worked very closely with staff and public works and in building. And actually I think they worked very hard on this. It took about it was submitted plans were submitted July, beginning in July, the first week of July.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So it did take a number of months. And that and I'll say also when you have a complex project, I've been through a number of complex permits myself with the park projects and oftentimes they we had two, three, four rounds of hold comments that you have to respond to and get back.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So he had either three or four rounds of hold comments and so it was also our city staff doing their due diligence.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You're saying hold the comments.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm sorry, hold comments. Is is when through in the review process, there's questions from the reviewer and they write down they hold the permit, the issuance of the permit until those questions are answered. You know, and we have an operator who that he then had to go and get the information because he's not an architect from his'",
        "'speaker_6': 'consultants. And so that takes time. So that permitting process did take however many months. That is off the top of my head to five months. But I think everybody did their best.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. And then with regards to some of the items that, you know, that that are of concern in terms of this 45 day period, you know, to what degree are you going to be reviewing them? I mean, to what degree are we going to are you proposing that we kind of get involved?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I would be reviewing to the degree, for example, that, you know, the paving matches, as I mentioned, the existing paving the landscape plan is certainly something I would work with on with Greenway because I also want them landscape to match the existing landscape out there.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You know, Mr. Daneyko and I have already talked about, for example, treatments in the restrooms and he's confirmed with me, he's already planning on concrete counters and tile. And so I'm looking for for quality and also just for the the overall look of it, I'm certainly not an architect or designer, so I'm really just looking to make'",
        "'speaker_6': 'sure we have a generally good product. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And my final question is, what happens if this isn't like if the extension isn't approved.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If the amendment is not approved, he is in breach of contract. And we have to look at terminate. We have to terminate that contract subsequently. Greenway Golf is it has in their contract that they have the first right of refusal for food and beverage service at the golf course.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So essentially Greenway would take it over.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If they if they chose to. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I have Councilmember Brody.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you so quickly as well, which it sounds like there was really nobody at fault. These things just take time. Yes. Okay. So I'm comfortable with that. But I think we should understand that as we're asked to do a Second Amendment, that these things take time.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So it's completely reasonable that the concessionaire would ask for an extension. So through the chair, I I'm curious to hear the vice mayor's logic, if he cares to share on why he thinks it's okay to do this. Because, you know, I'm fine with adding an amendment with this 45 day if if the council believes it's something that'",
        "'speaker_5': 'we're allowed to do.'",

I don't see has any material impact on the extension that we're being asked to grant, essentially a one year extension.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I just I don't see it. It's not I mean, I would imagine we didn't ask her, but that if that 45 days went by, she would probably come back to the council and. Ask for our direction, but I.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'No, I think based on the way that this is noticed, it's noticed that somebody knows that we're talking about amending the agreement. This is an amendment to the agreement. Anybody who wanted to come and speak to or had concerns about how we might amendment this agreement would be very clear that they knew that this I think this'",
        "'speaker_2': 'is a great example of how we should title an agenda is are our agendas.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'So hi there. I'm just going to let it be known that when we come to public speakers, we have a whole bunch. So you're probably getting 2 minutes or less, but just start consolidating your arguments and. Hello, are you presenting this item?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Madam Mayor, members of the City Council. My name is Patrick Pellegrino de. I'm the city's climate action coordinator, and I work in the Public Works Department.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'All right. Nice to see you. Also dressed up. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So the latest science and recent wildfires have shown us that climate change is real. It's happening now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Closer, friends, we can hear you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And its impacts are likely to be severe. And some commentators have called our current moment a climate crisis. So the resolution, before you responds to that crisis by declaring a climate emergency, this resolution shows Almeida's leadership in climate action and also demonstrates the community's resolve in addressing climate change head on.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And while our federal government has shied away from the bold action that is necessary to surmount this challenge, cities and local governments are stepping up to fill the gap. And Alameda is an example. We are stepping up and developing a ambitious climate action resiliency plan, which will put forth strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and building resiliency'",
        "'speaker_4': 'to climate change. And that plan should be concluded in the next several months. So with the declaration before you, alameda would join its peer cities, some of which have adopted a similar resolution in addressing climate change with the gravity and urgency that it merits.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah, we start our audience.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So this is clearly a worthy item and I'm all for it. I am going to ask you to hold your applause. Just virtually applaud. The reason is when we have so many speakers, it just takes more time. It's also a little bit intimidating to some people for whom public speaking is not their favorite thing to do.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We have four, five, six, seven, six. Could be your job after this.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Oh, yeah. And so it's 7000 square feet that can be used for the following purposes. It could be used as for retail products to cover costs. Could be used for education for children. Could be used for environmental groups.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And there are many environmental groups fighting for this cause. It could be used for environmental movies. Right around the corner from the Alameda Movie House. It could be used for new technology to sequester CO2, which is possible to pull down from the air and stop our planet from raising that two degrees that we've all heard about.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And it could be used for. Your city goals of the the essence of the seas rising and doing great disaster to our island. So I see this center as being something that could be critical for all of us to act within as a context for where action could take place of physical action across from the children store'",
        "'speaker_4': ', where the kids go in, they can point and say, Look, mommy, a climate action center like that. So I'm trying. What I'm trying to do is get people stoked up in the 30 seconds that I have left.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'So you're doing that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I didn't know what I was going to say. I still don't know what I'm going to say, but I said it anyway. This is something that's really required, I think.

        "'speaker_3': 'relative to sea level rise, which is our biggest concern. In addition, I encourage you in the future, as you're looking at the different versions of the Climate Adaptation and Action Plan, to really scrutinize that plan for its comprehensiveness, for its effectiveness, and for its ability to be implemented and funded.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Because the eye can see that your determination and your consideration is here. But words in a paper only mean so much unless they can actually be act upon with actions and policies and procedures and plans. So thank you very much for your support and your leadership.'",

So I'm a resident of Alameda and steering committee member with CASA, A Community Action for Sustainable Alameda. I speak on behalf of Costa's Climate Emergency Subcommittee, which worked with Councilmembers Knox White or Vice Mayor Knox White and Councilmember Brody to put this resolution before you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we're really excited to have this before the city of Alameda. As an island city, we applaud your leadership to put forth this resolution. Alameda is climate emergency declaration. It comes at a time when we most need to focus our positive energies and policies on local climate solutions.'",

Incidents of extreme heat damage, damaging storms, floods, smoke emergencies that we've all experienced.'",

So we ask your support on this resolution tonight and we're watching with enthusiasm and really encourage you to vote yes on the resolution.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Um, I'll make this quick. My name is Caroline Troy, and I'm a junior at Almeida High School, and I've been a part of Casa, and I run an environmental club. I was really distraught to hear that by the year 2050, before I or my peers even turned 50 years old, El Nino will experience so much sea level'",

The small window of time that we were given by climate scientists to reverse that sea level rise is closing on us very quickly. According to the IPCC, we are less than 12 years away from being unable to reverse our mistakes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But Almeida is proposing to do something the climate emergency resolution. And I believe that is really powerful. I believe that the climate emergency declaration is a perfect response to the climate crisis that threatens all of us because we should be panicking over the state of the earth right now.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so I want to inform City Council that I'm excited that we're looking at passing our city's climate emergency declaration. And I speak for the high schoolers of Alameda when I say that, I'm excited that our city council is making steps, however small they may be, towards protecting my and my generation's future.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So thank you on behalf of the students and the planet.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. I remember about applause. Just virtual. Don't Dems don't do it for real. Okay. Zoe Moore, are you here? There's Zoe and Jessica Robinson. I see you said be ready to come up and you will be followed by Isabella McCracken.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hello. Hi.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You can raise the mic, Kenny. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'My name is Zoe Moore and I'm also a junior at Alameda High. I'll also make this quick. I support the state of climate emergency declaration declaration. Climate change is very real and potentially more harmful in Alameda as we are an island.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Projections have shown parts of Alameda to be under water very soon, very sooner than I had expected. And this shocking information is frightening to many students at our school. Our community needs our city government to take action to deal with this scary reality.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And as an island city, rising sea levels are an issue very close to home. I'm excited to see policy implemented, to try to make Alameda as sustainable as possible, as a step in the right direction. And I hope that we will lead other cities to do the same.'",

        "'speaker_10': 'Support the needs of the.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Future generations and see climate change not as something that will one day affect us, but as something that is already impacting our everyday lives. This is an important investment for the future of Alameda because I am confident that it will be more cost effective for us to move towards a city with zero emissions now than to deal'",
        "'speaker_6': 'with the consequences of the entirety of Bay from Island being underwater within decades. The students here today and all over Alameda are the ones who will be reaping the consequences of your actions.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Actions we want to see done not only for our future, but the future of Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you. So don't be shy about moving up toward the front when you hear your name called. Just keep things moving along. Hello. By the way, high school students, I'm a little biased because they went down me too high.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I know a lot of HS students too. You're really good speakers, so. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hello.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Hi. So my name is Chi Hoang and I'm a student at Alameda High. It's okay. First of all, I want to thank you all for working to help Alameda move towards a sustainable and zero waste environment and in favor of the climate emergency resolution.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I thought I would suggest some solutions to help Alameda to become an environmentally friendly community. I am so encouraged to see Alameda starting to implement waste bins with all recycling landfill and compost bins. Although it might seem like a minor issue, it is crucial that we start to implement trash cans on the streets and in schools that'",
        "'speaker_6': 'have all the following recycling, landfill and compost bins. Sorting trash correctly is a first that we can take to help reduce landfill up, which can help slowly reduce greenhouse emissions. To get more specific, if the climate emergency declaration passes, a smart way we can utilize the federal funding is to subsidize businesses, more specifically restaurants with biodegradable to-go'",
        "'speaker_6': 'boxes, since most of this waste comes from restaurants uses of plastic. Hopefully these are some ways that we can help, you know, to become an environmentally active community. Thank you so much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Charles Addams, followed by well, Cathy, Dana is my last speaker, but I think she may not be here. So Charles Addams.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Students have filled this room before and alamy. The government has passed environmental resolutions before. The actions taken over the last decade have not been in line with any of the rhetoric. Alameda Municipal Power is known throughout California as a leader in fighting against rooftop solar.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Rooftop solar provides a consumer with the cheapest power per kilowatt hour available and provides the greatest environmental benefit because it doesn't destroy undeveloped land, doesn't require new transmission in an age of increased wildfire, threat like even wind farms do, and is the only clean technology that creates on island jobs.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Now, while carbon tax is needed, federally, net metering is a local method of counting for the environment and economics. PGE continues to credit rooftop solar at retail. The surrounding counties. Marin San Francisco Sonoma take bold steps to credit customers above retail and credit.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Tell Americans that just 27% of the top rate and is spreading misinformation. Campaign Against Solar Technology. Most homes in Alameda could produce 100% of their annual kilowatt hours through rooftop solar. A policy would be to reinstate aggressive net metering.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Additionally, formula change developments at Alameda Landing and the upcoming Alameda waterfront are antithetical to environmental protection. These formula developments notoriously contribute to a plastic throwaway culture destroy small businesses, destroy community self-reliance. But they provide business models designed to maximize traffic.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This there is no bike path or token small business that you're going to put next to these malls that are going to alleviate this business model. You have to know these guys. Their model is Emeryville.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The same people.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Passed anti-Chinese door legislation. San Francisco, Berkeley have done this. Tax single use plastics. These are real policies. And reversing the mistakes seems to require different policies than I've ever heard considered in in this council. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Last year. Last week, it wasn't at all high. You guys all continue to not only represent, but represent your generation exceedingly well. And I'm really impressed. And I just want to thank you for coming. It's very moving to have you here and very meaningful.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I want to thank Councilmember Odie, who joined me in helping to work with Costa to bring this resolution forward. I also want to thank very much our staff at the Public Works Department, Liam, Patrick and Aaron, who worked very closely with us to make sure that what we brought forward actually worked with within the 18 months of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'climate action planning that the city has already been undertaking and will be coming forward later this year. You know, I have mentioned this before. This is really the first time that the council is actually providing any input on that climate action plan and our goals.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think that in in the hopes that we do pass this tonight, I wanted to highlight that the most meaningful thing here for me is we need to move as quickly as possible to zero net emissions no later than 2030.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This is the council's declaration that this is an emergency and we are setting for the city our goal of net greenhouse gas emissions at 2030. Some of that might come from the state, from state changes, etc.. And we're going to, you know, as we go through this process, we're going to identify what we think that is so'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that we can identify at some point in time how we're going to get to that. But it's my hope that we will pass this with that language and that expectation. I also want to understand that the expectation, the Climate Action Plan, may come out with us with a different goal, but we that is not the beginning.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right. Sorry. It's not the end. It is the beginning. Once we once we pass that plan, which I have heard a little bit about and I'm very excited about, and I think our staff has really done, from what I've heard, a crack job getting to where they are.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We will then start the conversation about, okay, what next? Climate for Alameda is an existential crisis. We are the only island city in the bay. Sea level rise puts it puts all of our existence at risk. And, you know, we should be climate leaders.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It has taken a number of speakers and it's taken us a number of years to get to here. When I was campaigning last fall, I talked a lot about how 44 or so years ago when we got a new public works director, the city's official position was this is a regional issue.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sea level rise is a regional issue. The state will save us. We don't do anything. So through leadership. I wanted to recognize that as well. I really want to also just quickly recognize Damian, Herb, Ruth, Amos, Sylvia and David Teeters and many others who met with me and talked with Jim about it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'To really put this together, to really come together. I think our goal and it seems that we're reaching it tonight if we pass this is for the community, our staff and our elected officials ought to be on the same page in saying that, hey, Alameda is taking this seriously.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We're going to be on the same page. We're all here to to show up and work towards it. And my hope would be four years from now, Mr. Adams will show up and say, you know what, I've heard a lot of words in the past, but you guys really actually started putting the pedal to the metal and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'making some change. Lastly, I'm going to just wanted to reflect a quick comment. Ms.. Cannon, our first speaker, talked about words versus actions. And I think one of the places that this this resolution does something different than the other ones does is it starts to require that all staff reports that come forward from this day forth need'",

        "'speaker_5': 'You're really easy to work with. So thank you for that. I just think this is something we need to do. Some people might say, Well, why do you declare an emergency? Well, for exactly the same reasons why the vice mayor mentioned so.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Our staff, our city identifies that this is one of the overarching goals that we will consider every time something is brought to the to this body and that it's kept in the forefront of our community. Because I don't have to really go into the the why?'",

        "'speaker_7': 'You know, it's very difficult would be very difficult for Alameda. 2050 is 31 years from now. 31 years ago for me was all for everyone. It was 1988. And as I look back 31 years ago, I kind of feel like it happened at a snap of a finger.'",

At the January 2nd, 2019 City Council meeting, Council member Jim Odey provided a copy of the cost compact to the City Council and the community and requested that staff work with Bay Metro, the new Bag and MTC organization on a presentation of the cost of compact'",

The way it was set up, we had a leadership team, three co-chairs, a developer, a nonprofit housing advocate, and someone from philanthropy Michael Korver, Ruby DMG, Leslie Consiglio from Silicon Valley at Home, an advocacy group, and Fred Blackwell from the San Francisco Foundation.'",

They authorized the chairs to sign it with several caveats. First caveat was they didn't approve everything that was in the contract.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'The second caveat was they didn't approve any of the specific revenue ideas that are in there.

        "'speaker_12': '. Even before Costa started, the state was really going to work on housing. They did a lot of work on transportation in the last few sessions. They were going to focus on housing. So let me just go through the ten elements very quickly.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'The first one is just cause eviction policy. This would be to protect tenants from arbitrary evictions. It would set up a regional just cause eviction. It just says that landlords have to give an actual reason when they evict someone, both for cause, which is not paying your rent, destroying the unit or a fault, I mean, or no'",
        "'speaker_12': 'fault, which is that you had. The landlord wants to use the unit for a family member or for some other use. And I should say that if jurisdictions already have ordinances related to any of these elements in place, what's in the CASA Compact does not preempt what you do locally.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Number two is establish a Bay Area emergency rent cap. This would be for 15 years, and where the cost to group landed was CPI plus 5%, which is about 8% in today's numbers. This was to have increases be a reasonable amount.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Now what is reasonable people can disagree about that. And what they were striving for is a number that would protect tenants from what we're reading about where their rent goes up 30, 40% in a year, but also not make it so low that it made it impossible for developers to go out and build housing, get the financing'",
        "'speaker_12': 'they needed to do that. The state of Oregon just recently passed something like this rental assistance and access to legal counsel. This started off as a discussion about providing free legal assistance to low income tenants that were being given eviction notices.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'But the group came up with a better idea even, and that is that if there's some way for people that are facing an emergency, whether it's a loss of a job or a medical emergency, where they can't pay their rent for a couple of months rather than evict them and spend money on a lawyer to help them'",
        "'speaker_12': 'in that process, why not just give them emergency funding for a few months as well as other services they may need so they can stay where they are? So this is now about both remove regulatory barriers. Number four, to accessory dwelling units and number of cities in the Bay Area have done some excellent work around Adus and'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Junior Adus. The idea is to take the best practices from the region and have them apply to every community. One of the problems you probably heard about is cities may have fees, but some of the water districts were doing hookup fees that were the same as if you were building a new single family home.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And this is when you were doing an Adu within the footprint of your building. So part of this would deal with impact fees being charged on a per square foot basis. Number five, minimum zoning, near transit. This is one of the most controversial.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'It talks about setting minimum height and zoning and density standards around high quality bus service and major transit stops. Your staff report has pointed out that the high quality bus service does not apply. It has to be busses that run on a 15 minute head away during the week and a half an hour headway on weekends.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We did a map for this. It really only applies to San Francisco, Oakland, San Jose, parts of Berkeley and San Leandro for the rest of the region, including your city. It would not apply. And it has. Has to do with making housing an eligible use on a large, commercially zoned parcels.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'What does that mean? You're probably all familiar with the Hilltop Mall in Richmond. It's not doing well and hasn't been doing well for a while. A developer I ran into out there when I was at a car event with my son on a weekend, told me that the city had just approved Richmond just approved about 8000 units'",
        "'speaker_12': 'of housing over a period of time there. And they're going to repurpose the mall for a safe way or some sort of shopping or grocery store in there for residents. And those are the kinds of things that make sense because of the land that's there and the fact that they're not being used as much anymore for mall'",
        "'speaker_12': 'use, good government reforms to the housing approval process. This is actually done in many communities throughout the Bay Area now, but not all. And it just requires that local jurisdictions create a publicly accessible format online where people can read about the rules, codes and standards that apply to residential applications.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And when you decide now places deem complete, it also would strive to say that once you decide an application is complete, the rules, fees and historic designations are set in place. At that time, I'm sure all heard developers say that what they really don't like is when the rules change throughout the process.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'That's what the last thing is about for zoning compliant residential projects. No more than 310 oval public hearings. I didn't used to know what de novo meant, but I went to a lot of planning commission hearings and learned from the lawyers that it means how many you have before you start over again.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So if you have a project and it doesn't change at all, there would be three public hearings. But if you're planning commission, the developer and the community got together and said, You know what, we should make some changes.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'That starts the clock again. And there's three more hearings after that. Number seven, expedite approvals and financial incentives for missing middle housing. Missing middle is usually referred to as housing. And the 82 either 120, 150% of AMI. In this case, it would accelerate approval for zoning compliant projects that provide on site affordability for a missing middle, where'",

        "'speaker_12': 'The first one, which is very controversial, is a 15 year property tax increment abatement modeled after New York City program. We learned recently that this is unconstitutional in California, so it's off the list. Others would be lowering impact fees, creating extra density bonuses and reducing parking minimums.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Unlock public land for housing, promote increased utilization of both surplus and underutilized public land for affordable housing. Now, this is also a little bit controversial. I'm doing this now two, three or four times a week around the region doing presentations in order to get feedback.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And what people say is in the East Bay, what we'd like to see is more jobs. Right now, one of the big imbalances is you get lots of jobs and not a lot of housing built over the last ten years in the West Bay, in San Francisco, San Mateo and Santa Clara in the East Bay, you've done'",
        "'speaker_12': 'a much better job of building housing, but haven't gotten the jobs. And so what we could do is sit with the number of things we do. But one is to set aside some of your surplus land for creating new job centers and new places where jobs could move to.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'But where it's it makes sense. We like to figure out ways to help you use surplus and underutilized public land for housing. Number nine, and this is again, one of the more controversial ones. This is how do you finance it?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'This chart just shows you how they came up with a $1.5 billion goal for how much they'd like to try to raise. And what you see in the upper left is if you were to average 24,000 households a year, that you would help with rental assistance and legal assistance that would cost $50 Million.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Trying to fund 14,000 units of new housing a year affordable at 150,000 per unit would come to 2.1 billion and of subsidizing or preserving market rate and subsidize affordable housing at a little bit less, 100,000 a unit would cost 4750 units $376 million a year for a total of 2.5 billion.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'The cost groups came up with trying to figure out a way to raise 1.5. This is the chart that both MTC and the ABC board said they do not support. This is a menu of potential sources of funding.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'If every sector, property owners, housing developers, employers, etc. contributed something. There used to be twice as many on here. Then there were half as many. Now this is what is a menu of just potential ideas. A menu to to look at.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'To give you a couple of examples of what I hear when I go around is people hate on the left for property owners regional parcel tax. We just did this recently for the Bay Area and people say that parcel taxes are one of the only ways that local government has to raise more.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Money to pay for housing, infrastructure, schools, parks. So to the extent that you go and take something that is one of the few sources local government has, that's a problem for a lot of local governments. On the far right, where you see half cent regional sales tax.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Same response that I've gotten as we've gone along around here all but are worried about hitting up against the 10% sales tax. And so the closer we get to that, if we use it for this, it gives you less leeway going forward for schools, for open space, for all the things that you need to fund as a'",
        "'speaker_12': 'little community. Now, I will say there's a lot of support for the 1% vacant homes tax on the upper left, because we're seeing more and more homes in the Bay Area that are being kept vacant as investments not being used as housing.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And this is being done now in Vancouver and in in Paris. There's also a lot of sentiment that we should have the people who are causing the problem during the most jobs help pay for that. That's what the developers variable commercial linkage fee does.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And on the only employers side, the gross receipts tax, both of those are arranged again, if you do a range where you charge a higher amount in the West Bay, where there's lots of job development and charge a lower rent in the East Bay where you're trying to get the jobs to move to, it helps make that'",
        "'speaker_12': 'happen as a policy matter. Again, these are just rough numbers. But for whatever amount of money is raised, up to 10% would be for local jurisdiction incentives, up to 10% for 1010 and protection services for affordable housing preservation up to 20%.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And for affordable housing production a minimum of 60% of the money raised. But we've heard from people that we should probably combine the last two so that in different times in the building cycle, in the economy, you might want to switch to preserving existing affordable housing and other times switch more resources to building new affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_12': '75% of the money spent would be spent within the county of origin. Under what was proposed, 25% would go to a regional program for revenue sharing, and this would be subject to ongoing performance and policy outcomes. And again, number ten, regional housing enterprise is one of the more misunderstood ones.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'It would be to establish a regional leadership entity to fund affordable housing track and report progress in all of these and provide incentives, direct incentives and technical assistance to cities and counties. It would not have direct land use or zoning authority or play any regulatory or enforcement role.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'It would have an independent board made up of people from MTC and air bags, boards and some other key stakeholders and be staffed by the MTC, a big consolidated staff. There were several other calls to action in the report that they couldn't get to.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'One is redevelopment 2.0. Is there a way to bring back tax increment financing? Lower the voting threshold for housing fund measures to 55%. Address the fiscal ization of land use with which is what Prop 13 do with some Prop 13 reforms.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'If you preserve and build more affordable housing, it helps prevent homelessness. But you're all dealing with homelessness now. And so what can we do about that? And finally, grow and stabilize the construction of labor force on a on the schedule.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'The CASO was the document was signed by the participants, including a representative of AIRBAG and MTC in January. The legislative packets that are now being talked about in Sacramento have some or to do with parts of the cost ten elements.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Others are totally different. And so what we're going to be doing now when we get to the last slide. There are over 200 bills in Sacramento. As I said, the two boards that empty and bag authorize the chair to sign it, but did not support everything in it.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Didn't support those revenue numbers I should put up there. They are taking this action to stay at the table, engaging the legislature there. Each has a legislative committee and they will take every bill and every piece of this and debate it and decide whether they want to support it, oppose it, support it with amendments or oppose it'",
        "'speaker_12': 'until amended. They've instructed staff, myself and a number of the people to go out and talk to all of you, to city and county organizations, to tell you where things stand now and to get your input and a bag established.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'An ad hoc local government committee to directly advise both the air bag and MTC legislator legislative committees on these bills. And Madam Mayor, I understand you're a member of that committee, along with the mayor of Fremont for Alameda County.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I am.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And then finally, the cities and counties are already engaging with the California League of Cities, which is very involved in this. And the legislators are going to be making decisions about these bills as they come up. So that's the end of my presentation.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I'd be happy to answer any questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. And do we have any clarifying questions from the council? She'll get our public speakers come back to the council. Okay. So thank you and nice presentation. We have an increasing number of public speakers. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. All right. I have three have. Speakers in this order. Catherine Pauling. Brian Maguire. William Smith. Ms.. Pauling.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I gathered calling Dear Mayor, Vice Mayor and council members. Forgive me. I'm going to read this for my phone. On behalf of the Alameda Renters Coalition, I'm submitting this brief statement and response. Tonight's Agenda Item six B on the Classic Compact, our exposition on the classic compact alliance with the Regional Tenants Together position.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We send you a letter. There is going to be an attachment so you can read it yourself. While we appreciate the attention paid to tenant protections. Like just cause eviction and rent control. We deeply disagree with CASA on the following points.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'One Their last minute change on just cause to omit relocation assistance for owner move in evictions and to leave out tenants in their first year of tenancy. Second point the recommendation of regional and perhaps statewide rent cap that far exceeds the Regional Consumer Price Index.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We and Alameda know that 5% each and every year is unsustainable. This is even higher. Their lack of insistence on tenant protections and new revenues for affordable housing before applying zoning and streamlining changes and the relatively low amount of funding 30%.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And actually I think it's even lower now for tenant protections and affordable housing preservation, while very low income and low income price points remain the furthest behind and housing availability. For these reasons and others outlined in the Tenants Together article ARC urges the City Council to do better than the CASA compacts and adequate recommendations and move to'",
        "'speaker_6': 'implement the twin pillars of an essential local rent stabilization policy. Basically rent control, at least an annual cap of 4% or less, and a three year cumulative cap of no more than 10% and have true just cause evictions protections without any emissions.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Brian Maguire and Bill Smith. William Smith.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening. I think I generally agree with Catherine sentiments on the tenant protection side. I think Alameda can push for this compact to hopefully have the strongest, viable, you know, passable tenant protections in it for the region. I think Alameda hopefully soon will be enacting stronger protections than what this compact calls for.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And on the production side, I think this also is an opportunity for us to hold our neighbors accountable. I think Alameda is doing a comparatively decent job on the production side, at least aspirationally trying to get housing built and supplied at all levels for the community.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And this as the those numbers in the presentation show just how bad, you know, some of our peninsula neighbors and the incentives are all wrong, obviously, and they have been for a generations on how we fund cities and how we, you know, our tax structure and what we can do prefers job creation over housing production.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that's one reason is because one thing that's missing from this is so a lot of trying to capture fees from new things that happen. But the sort of the horse is already out of the barn, right? All the the land value the the value that this economy and this housing crisis has all are all that wealth'",
        "'speaker_4': 'has already been shifted to incumbent landowners. So this company should be looking as aggressively as possible at ways to capture some of that value back from from those who just happened to purchase property at the right time and then capitalize off the wealth that's been generated by the economy.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And most most of that wealth has gone to, you know, something like 80% goes to incumbent landowners and not to the actual people in the economy that are doing the work that's creating that value and whether it's Silicon Valley or any other part of part of the economy.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I think we should definitely push for those items to be as strong as possible and support it, because we're trying to do our part. And I'm I'm optimistic that this council is doing its part. And this is where we can convince our community and that we are also pushing our neighbors to to do their part.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, William Smith.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Thank you for this opportunity, Madam Chair and members of the Council. I'm William Smith, a resident of Alameda, and I've been working on housing in this city for a number of decades now. I'd like to say that the two semis that go right to the point that presented by the speaker, the housing plan is going'",
        "'speaker_4': 'to make the problems much worse. And it needs major reforms in these major changes. Urban habitat did not sign off on it because of many of the same reasons and more that were cited by my Catherine Pauling. So it's a problem.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The fundamental flaw in the whole problem is the and Brian McGuire hit on this, too, is the emphasis on jobs creation. Yes, the East Bay has done a better job than the peninsula in producing jobs, housing, but we're still producing more jobs on the East Bay than housing on our own.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So it's not going to help to minimize our housing and bring the jobs over here. So we just absolutely have to find more funding for housing. There is no question about it. And you'll hear more from me later if I mean, if it doesn't go to late tonight on a couple of the other later items on the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'agenda on that topic. But a lot of people are getting very concerned about this. And when you read the headlines, more jobs created in Santa Clara County last week and then in many, many years, I just cringed because that means more homelessness is coming, more people are going to be moving out and so on.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so that's definitely going to be a turn around in the next decade to job creation is going to be seem a pariah and not a not a good thing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Smith.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's my last speaker. So of closing public comment, do we have council comments before we entertain in motion? Vice Mayor Knox Quite right.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I guess a quick question. I don't know who whether it's for Andrew or somebody on staff, but I was a little caught by surprise and I missed it in our our staff report. But the presentation says that we have no high quality bus service and yet the 51 AA meets all the criteria.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Plus we have ferry terminals, both of which meet the criteria. Is there something that opts us out? Because the presentation said we don't actually meet that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Who's taking it, Ms.. Potter?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I will start and then maybe Mr. Paul will have more to add. But MTC produced a map based on the definition of a high quality bus transit route, and that's a separate category than the ferries. We recognize that we have the ferry service here and the high quality bus service was defined as 15 minute headways during'",
        "'speaker_6': 'the week and a 30 minute headways on the weekend. And MTC mapped it for the nine counties. And so I just relied on the map that and Tsay prepared.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay, said.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mr..'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Paul.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And that's the reason I'm here, is to see if we made any mistakes. We had the same comment in Contra Costa County the other night, but I found out from one of their planning directors that they have 15 minute during the week, 30 minute on Saturday, but on Sunday they have 45 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So that may be why or if there is a mistake, just let us know and we'll correct the maps.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The 51 A is I looked 50 minutes Saturday and Sunday in 10 minutes. All all peak period.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Then it should then that should count though.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Just want to make sure.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I say.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And did I see whose hands did I see? You can go talk to Councilmember Dave.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You know I a at some east bay league a city meetings I hear a lot of concern about the cost of capac being raised, particularly by officials representing cities from contra costa county cities. And I see some merit in a lot of the concerns about the cost of compact.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I would not want our city to make any decisions regarding the cost of compact tonight. For example, you know, the debate is still on about just cause eviction. You know, my my position on just cause eviction. I'm not supportive of just cause eviction.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And if that's one of the arrows in the council quiver, I have to be very concerned about that. Strangely enough, Alameda Rental Coalition appears to be concerned about how just cause eviction is framed as well. So that's a concern.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And this whole thing about what's a reasonable rent increase, you know, I like what we the city of Alameda had arrived at back in 2015, early 2016, as 5% as a trigger, a threshold trigger for dealing for implementing our local rent stabilization measures.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You know, I if you're talking about the Bay Area CPI on top of 5%, I mean, we could be talking about 9% as being a reasonable rent increase or even 10% rate increase. So we're going to have to be clear as to what we mean by CPI.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I mean Bay Area or Western regional CPI, very different from national CPI. So again, that's an area of concern. And frankly, you know, if 15 minute headways along Santa Clara Avenue as a result of the AC Transit 51, a bus line means that, you know, we would be subject to the cost of provision regarding minimum zoning, near'",
        "'speaker_7': 'transit line lines. I would be concerned about that. I would be concerned about that because of, you know, for a lot of the reasons stated by the Contra Costa County stakeholders, they're concerned about the loss of local prerogative.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So for me, I think there still a lot of questions that are outstanding regarding the CASA this afternoon, the second CASA matter. So I'm not ready to to give any recommendations about this. You know, I would say this much, though.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think if we're going to do any recommendations, I think, you know, we need to know, you know, in what specific ways are we vulnerable as a city, vulnerable to, um, to the CASA Compact if, if it passes as presented, if, if the just cause evictions are there or if the 5%, 8%, I think, I think he'",
        "'speaker_7': 'need to go through I don't line by line analysis of of of of the regulatory effects to Alameda. And also, you know, maybe this isn't related to the COSA compact, but I understand that assembly member from San Francisco, I think his name is David Chiu, wants to create a regional housing body that has a taxing authority.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I understand, you know, why we pay taxes. But for many of the things that we put our money towards, our tax money towards our property, tax money towards you know, there is there's a connection between the service that we as taxpayers receive.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We put our money and then, you know, we are potentially we can potentially take part. We pay we can pay taxes that goes to BART or we pay taxes that goes towards mosquito abatement. Well, you know, mosquito abatement people locally around town to help resolve I think if there's going to be a parcel tax on property, on'",
        "'speaker_7': 'homeowners for rental assistance, I think that has to be discussed a little bit more because I don't see the the the the nexus there. So I, I think I think there's a lot of people in positions of power who are running around like chickens with their head cut off, trying to come up with any solution and throwing'",
        "'speaker_7': 'it on the board and not really giving it the deliberation that it deserves. So at this point, I would suggest that we accept the presentation on CASA and do within our own City Hall, do our more of our own homework.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I'm actually going to take the next time to speak just because I want people to be clear on what we are being asked to do tonight and what we're not being asked to do. So this is simply we're being asked to direct the interim city manager to incorporate state legislation introduced to implement the CASA Compact into'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the city's legislative agenda. And I can tell you, incidentally, Councilmember Amelia Vella and I will sit on a statewide policy committee on Housing, Community and Economic Development for this League of California Cities. And next week, we're going to be in where are we going to be?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Southern California, somewhere called Costa mesa, maybe. Anyway, we're going to be at our statewide policy committee and I'm sure we're going to be looking over a lot of the proposed legislation. It is proposed legislation. I think there's something like 2700 bills have come to the legislature.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I was honored to be voted by the mayors of Alameda County to be one of two representatives on this legislative task force that will consider proposed legislation that would be needed to implement the CASA Compact, because right now it is just this collection of principles.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I mean, some of them are fleshed out more than others. And one of the things and Councilmember Desai is right, this is not without controversy. Can anyone name any issue today? That is not without controversy, but it is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Housing in our state is such an important issue. And one thing we've learned from our housing policy committee is every city in the state has to do its part. But that's not to say that every city in the state has to do the same thing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so one of the criticisms about the CASA Compact is it tended to be this collection of big city mayors who got together and they have big problems and they implemented solutions that address their big problems. But it is also true that we have cities that are housing rich.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have cities that are jobs rich, and yet we feel the impact. And I would call Alameda more housing rich than jobs rich. And yet every time you try to leave the island to get to work, unless you're on the ferry, you're going to run into traffic congestion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But the point is, we need to look at this. Ignoring a problem doesn't make it go away, doesn't make it go better. Has the final solution been reached? Is this going to be without controversy? No, but we're rolling up our sleeves.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think all.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Points that Councilmember de SAC raised are fair points that need to be in a discussion. But tonight, we are neither accepting or rejecting anything. We're just saying we want to have a say in the legislation. And I just saw our state senator, Nancy Skinner, on Sunday, and she just texted me this evening to say, I want to'",
        "'speaker_0': 'discuss my housing bill with you. I think it's more moderate. So I mean, there's lots of lots of work yet to do, but we got to get started. So with that, who's next? Councilmember Vella.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Madam Mayor, to your point, I think that of the thousands of bills that are being considered by the legislators in this session, a fair percentage of them actually touch on housing, housing in various capacity. It is. And I think it behooves us to to really consider the legislation that is being tied to this and to to play'",
        "'speaker_8': 'a part and to to really have a say in terms of what ends up happening. And so I think that that's really what we're trying to do tonight with what's before us. And I think that it's important that we do have our say in it and that we keep track of it, because when the state does decide'",
        "'speaker_8': 'to implement different things, we want to be able to know what's coming down the pipeline and we want to be able to advocate for Alameda and for all means when the time comes. And I also think that it's a regional issue and this is part of having a regional conversation and trying to work together on these issues'",
        "'speaker_8': '. We may not always agree, but I think part of what this is trying to do is to at least identify the issue areas in the concern areas, we may not agree on the solution or the pathway to get there, but it's part of having that important dialog that's going to get us where we need to go.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So thank you, Councilman Brody.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Madam Chair. I'll get to go next. I call.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'On you. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I appreciate the presentation and the work, Ms.. Potter, you've done to to synthesize this for the council. And I was at the League of Cities meeting to where concept presented to the folks from the East Bay region. And, you know, I got a different take from it than my colleague.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Respectfully, the controversy to me was a lot of the people that are not doing their share still are trying to fight this because this was a solution that would force them to do their share. So that to me tells me we're headed in the right direction.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I don't view this as the be all, end all. I don't view this as, you know, the ceiling on what we can do to help alleviate the housing crisis. I view it as a floor and then we can expand on it like and I think, for example, the fact that a regional body recognized that there is'",
        "'speaker_5': 'an issue with displacement and an issue with rents and an issue with evictions, enough to say that there needs to be a regional solution that includes just cause some type of rent cap for a temporary period, and this idea of rental assistance for tenants to help pay their rent so they're not displaced.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I mean, that's something that, you know, I think is something that's worthwhile, that we shouldn't just shut out. I think it's something we really need to think about. You know, we've talked about here in Alameda the missing middle and how workforce we call it workforce housing, middle middle income, housing, whatever you want to call it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You know, it's nice to see that, you know, policy decision makers at a regional level and now at the state level understand that this this is a problem. And we've known it's a problem for quite some time. And the whole idea and I think this is, I think, instructive for us as a body and for our staff'",
        "'speaker_5': 'is, you know, public land for housing. I mean, we've seen one proposal to sell public land come to us that didn't include additional housing. I mean, we kind of had some restrictions because of historical the historical significance of the building.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But we saw another one that was pulled off the agenda that didn't have any housing. So I think we need to think first. And I said this Saturday, you know, housing needs to be at the top of the list when when our staff evaluates potential projects, whether they're, you know, in Emacs or multifamily or in commercial zones'",
        "'speaker_5': '. And, you know, we had to be part of the solution and transient aurion development. If we're serious about our transportation goals, about getting cars off the road and reducing greenhouse emissions, it's going to be with dense housing on transit lines or near places like BART stations and ferry stations.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I mean, there's just no way around that. So I think to say that, you know, we shouldn't do that or we should like soft pedal, let her slow pedal it because that might be resistance. Well, I mean, the resistance to housing is why we're in this problem.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I'm really glad that somebody stepped up and kind of outlined the reasons. And I would be more than happy to make sure that we put this on our legislative agenda. We follow it and we make sure that we're part of the solution and that our neighbors are part of the solution.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Because, you know, I think we've done a pretty good job, but a lot of our neighbors haven't. And we're not going to solve this problem on our own. We're going to need tools. And I think we need hammers for some of these cities like Lafayette and Walnut Creek and places like that to actually, you know, do the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'things that need to be done in order to meet this crisis. So I appreciate all the work done by. Our staff and buy a bag, an empty seat to bring this forward.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. De Vice Mayor. Not quite.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, first, I'm going to say Jim took everything I was going to say.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I got you back for the last time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No, I for for me, I'll be really short because I agree with the majority of the comments from from my colleagues. You know, we are in this problem because we have not tried to address it. Everybody has pointed at somebody else.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And it's going to be uncomfortable when we get around to finally addressing this. And it's you know, it's a hard conversation and nobody wants there wants to see changes to their community. But at the same time, nobody wants to see their neighbors move out.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And they are displaced through rents, displaced because of their commutes, etc.. And so, you know, former Vice Mayor Avella, Councilmember Vela, you know, said, you know, we we need a seat at the table. We need to be pushing on this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I said when Councilmember Odie brought this the cost fact sheet forward, our first member meeting in January. It may not be perfect, but it aligns very much with the work that we have been doing here. I think to say that 18 months worth of work on behalf of the cast of compact folks is just people throwing ideas'",
        "'speaker_2': 'at the wall to see if it'll stick. I think that's that's kind of unfair, quite honestly. And while I can see that some people don't agree with it or necessarily want to want to look at this more, I think also it's really important that folks here who have had to listen to us all talk so much also'",
        "'speaker_2': 'leave that they are these are these are very intelligent people who have worked really hard with in large groups to try to identify good ways forward. And hopefully what we can leave with is the idea that doing the same thing that we've been doing for 40 years is not going to solve the problem.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So with that, I would like to make a motion that we direct our interim city manager to incorporate into the city's legislative legislation agenda, incorporate incorporate our incorporate the concept, compact into our legislative agenda.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I'll second that. Do you mind if I say a.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Couple things, Madam Chair?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, I don't know. Maybe I need to hear that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, was a brief.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It is brief. I would just point out figure three on on page seven of the of the costs a compact or I think it's page 13 out of 40 and which shows the map of rent increases from 2010 to 2016.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Or it kind of says two things 2010 to 2016 and 2011 to 2016. In either way, what's alarming is that increase greater than 30% is is a is a broad swath of Alameda. And I think that thematically that's what we've heard from our renters groups and things like that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I do want to I do want to point out that that, you know, this is, you know, to Councilmember Otis point, this is about getting people to focus on on kind of problem definition and figuring out general solutions.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It's not to say that we're planning to ignore that. And obviously different communities have been impacted differently by these issues. But I think some of these maps can be very visually helpful in terms of showing and reinforcing what we've heard from from some of our constituents here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And so we had a motion second and we want to have some discussion. Councilmember So.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Real quick.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Point. I think what would help the city of Alameda get its ducks in a row as it deals with either of the regional CASA? And I want to say regional CASA to distinguish that from the local CASA or housing legislations coming from Sacramento.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'What would help the residents get our ducks in a row is if we, in a comprehensive manner update our general plan, because then that will really begin to have neighbors giving input as to what they see, what they want to have in their neighborhoods with regard to things like accessory dwelling units, etc..'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I think that's important.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. All right. We have a motion. We have a second all in favor. I opposed one opposed to the motion passes with four eyes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And yes.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'If everyone could please take your seats. We are back in session staff. We are back in session here. My children always hang on my every word. This training, they didn't. Okay. I am going to propose a couple of agenda changes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we. Our next item is six C, the public hearing to consider endorsing the annual report on the status of the general plan and housing element and more. But we have an item item six E, which is this public hearing having to do with an appeal about this Park Street hotel, which I have close to 60 and'",
        "'speaker_0': 'growing speakers clips. So I'm going to propose that we move that item next, because I hate to keep you all out late. And then we also have a lot of city staff here because item six F is the adoption of the resolution amending the fiscal year 2018 19 budget workforce change and others.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So my proposal council is that we take items six E, items six F and then I just talk to Mr. Thomas about item six C. If we didn't get it to to it tonight, it wouldn't be the end of the world, as my colleagues would say.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The sun will still rise in tomorrow morning.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Right.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Councilmember Otis, I mean, I'm.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'We have we have 50 we have 60 speakers slips from the public. I really would favor taking that item next.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Can we just decide to bump six C? We said.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'So you might consider allowing the appellant to speak after the applicant before taking all the public speakers.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. We can do that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If you wish.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'This is as I said.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'I would like to move that. We allow speakers one minute to speak, which will still be an hour of public comment. And with the requests that if you just want to say, I agree with that guy, that's perfect and we will listen.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. You have second in that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Question the of inquiry for the appellant and the applicant that I think we have some rules that give them what is it, 10 minutes or 50.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Typically give them 10 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Somebody move that last second time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They hang on to every word. It's okay. It's been moved in, seconded that we give speakers one minute each because we have 60 or more speakers and the applicant and the appellant will each get up to 10 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Correct. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All in favor. I, i any opposed? Okay. That was unanimous. Right? Okay. Okay. Once again.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. I'll try to set the tone here and move along quickly so you can get to the speakers. This is a appeal of a planning board decision to approve a new hotel at 1825 Park Street. The hotel would be 96 rooms with 62 parking spaces.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It's four stories and meets the zoning and height requirements for the district. The Planning Board's decision was a decision to approve essentially two entitlements that were required for this project to move forward. They needed to be approved before it could get building permits.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Number one, design review. That's the architectural design. That's our process for the review of architectural design. The planning board approved that a design with a condition that the they still had some concerns about some of the detailing on the building and they required their resolution of approval required that the applicant and their architect come back for refinements'",
        "'speaker_9': 'on the final design before building permits are issued. They also approved a parking reduction which allowed for the 96 required parking spaces to be reduced to 62 parking spaces. But they conditioned it that in all cases, on all parking required for the hotel that they exceeded their six two space.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It had to be provided on site through a valet parking program. So essentially ensuring that all the cars generated by the full 96 rooms would be parked on site. If the spaces are not available, then it would be done through valet service on site.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'This, as I said, the project meets the North Park Gateway Zoning District Zoning designation. This is also this site does have a multi-family residential combining overlay on it. This is raised in the in the appeal. That is a permissive zoning overlay.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It allows for multifamily housing, but it does not require multifamily housing on the site. The hotels are permitted by right on the North Park Street zoning district. The general plan is can you commercial hotels are encouraged and allowed in community commercial in the general plan.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And of course, hotels are supported strongly by our economic development strategic plan that was approved by the council just last year. So as I said, this was approved by the planning board. That was on July 20 excuse me, January 28th.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'They had a study session a few months earlier at which time they looked at a prior design, which they weren't happy with, gave the architect instructions. He came back. They came back on June 28th, at which time the project was approved with those conditions that I mentioned earlier.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The Appellant has raised three issues in their appeal. They've focused really on the parking aspect of the Planning Board's decision. They questioned the adequacy of the parking analysis and the team measures which were imposed by the city and approved by the planning board on this project, and because of their dispute on the part where their questioning of'",
        "'speaker_9': 'the parking analysis. They then the appellant makes the case that the the project was not adequately reviewed under the California Environmental Quality Act. And they also raise the issue of the fact that this is a multifamily zoning district and there's no housing in this project.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Staff disagrees with the appellant's analysis on the parking and the California Environmental Quality Act. We believe that the planning board did follow the zoning code, which and the parking code which allows the planning board to evaluate parking on a case by case basis, imposed measures to reduce the demand and therefore allow for reduction in parking.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'In this case, the Planning Board didn't even actually allow a reduction in parking. It simply required a valet parking and required and imposed tedium, tedium measures to reduce demand on top of that. So we feel that the planning board did the right decision on the parking aspect of the project.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And the other issue that was raised in terms of California Environmental Quality Act. We respectfully disagree with the appellant. This project is consistent with the zoning because the zoning allows for these types of waivers and adjustments by the planning board.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Therefore, there is no problem with the analysis under the California Environmental Quality Act. And then of course, as I said earlier, the multifamily zoning district is a permissive zone. It permits multifamily housing on the site. It does not require it.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So for those reasons, we don't support these aspects of the or don't believe that the appellant has made a strong case on the parking issue or the multifamily overlay issue. Staff is recommending that the City Council uphold the Planning Board's decision.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We think the Planning Board made the right decision in moving this forward with their conditions of approval and which would allow the project to proceed under the conditions I described. However, the planning this is a de novo hearing, which means that you can consider any issues brought before you and or that are raised by this approval by'",
        "'speaker_9': 'the Planning Board board. Therefore, an alternative action by the Council could be to uphold the appeal and direct the planning board to reconsider their prior approval. When you send it back to the planning board, you can also specify what it is that you want them to reconsider.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'As I said earlier, there's two pieces to this to this approval that they made design review, the actual architecture of the building, the parking plan that they approved, or of course, you could send it back if you wanted to uphold the appeal, send it back to have them reconsider both of those issues.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So you can you can and should, if you decide to uphold the appeal, give the planning board clear direction as to what it is you think they did wrong and you'd like them to reconsider. That is the end of my presentation myself.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I also want to recognize staff member Linda PEREIRA and Alan Tigh from our staff here, who did really most of the work on this project and I think did a.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Nice thank you staff.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. All right. So who's up next? Appellant The applicant goes first or the appellant.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Before I start, I also wanted to say thank you very much for moving us up a little bit. And I wanted to say that we did lose like 15, 20 people already. They did fill out the slip, but they're gone.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But they did put up there that they are in favor of this project. So good evening, everyone. I want to thank honorable mayor, vice mayor and city council members. As many of you know. My name is Paul Patel and I wanted to thank all of you guys for being here tonight.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Your support, guidance and suggestions in helping me to bring this project to the city of Alameda has been incredible. No matter the outcome, you will always have my thanks and respect. I still remember so well the moment when 18 years ago, I fell in love with Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I had just moved from India. I was a housekeeper at Days Inn, which is now roadway in cleaning rooms and cleaning toilets. I had very little money. I remember looking out the ocean and how my heart skipped a beat when I realized something.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I was home. I have had some people ask me, why not invest elsewhere? And I'm speechless. I love this city. I still live just a few blocks from that ocean. I eat at Alameda Restaurants in Alameda, Texas, and dream not of building of faraway cities, but my own.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Everything I have learned and earned is from this city, this community, and these citizens. I'm a seasoned hotel owner. I'm getting my MBA from Harvard. I have the skills, the funds and the will. I want to give back to this city that has given me so much.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm not a foreigner. I'm son of Alameda. I had a moment of total desperation last week when I called my mother in India. She's a small town woman, doesn't understand the political world, but she's also one of the most moral people that I know.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'She was trying to make sense of all of these. So she asked me three questions. Is everything you're doing legal? Yes. Will your project help the community? Yes. And will you take care of the people that works with you?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes. She laughed and told me to have hope that all would be fine with the project. She said an argument where the answer to all three of those questions was yes would be unbeatable. Downtown Alameda has a problem.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There is no hotel within walking distance of our downtown restaurants and other businesses. There are too many empty storefronts because we don't have enough foot traffic. This new hotel will create jobs and revenue for all of our well-loved downtown establishments from tiny little House to Maggie's to Alameda Cineplex to Alameda Island Brewing Company to East End Pizza'",
        "'speaker_4': '. Our restaurants, coffee shops, our bars will benefit. We will provide meeting space for local at discounted rates. Contribute to the local transportation agency, open up our gym to Alameda residents, increase tourism, benefit local nonprofit organization and local artist and contribute to the beautification of Park Street.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The direct and indirect benefit are endless and enduring. It is a win win situation for everyone. I'm the only Alameda Hotel developer who's also a resident who cares about this community as much as you all. If we don't take this opportunity now and the owner of the land decides to do something else with it, there is no'",
        "'speaker_4': 'other appropriate lodge. So we may never have a hotel in downtown Alameda. The reason I'm here before you is to work with you, to partner with other businesses and support the people that live here. Because at the end of the day, who cares about this community as much as we do?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Before I go, I would also like to thank Alan, Linda and Mr. Andrew Thomas and the city staff. For all your help. You have made this process much better for me and it is appreciated whether you're here to support this project or not.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Each of you that took time out of your lives to be here, you truly cares about this community. And that's why I love this city. And I'm doing this project because I also care about this community and want to give back.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'My goal has always been to solve the problem that needs to be addressed. And with your help, we can work together to make this a reality. So please vote for this photo. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Battelle. And then we will also hear from the appellate tie, Hudson and Mr. Hudson. You will also have 10 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening, mayor. As you Ashcraft and members of the city council. My name is Ty Hudson. I'm with Unite Here Local 2850 and we are the appellant. And I want to speak to a couple of different issues here.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'First, I'm going to speak to really the letter of the law when it comes to how the city, how the Alameda Municipal Code talks about allows for parking reductions. And second, I'm going to speak to whether this is really the right project for the city and for that location from a bigger picture point of view.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I'll start with with the letter of the law on the parking. The municipal code allows for does allow for for parking reductions by the planning board. And that, as Mr. Thomas mentioned, that that is true. But it also spells out very specifically what the planning board has to find and what what the the project has to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'provide in order to qualify for those reductions. The two reductions that are sort of that this project claims to or the two criteria this project claims to to to meet are a a parking demand study that would show that the parking that the project wouldn't need as much parking as it is the code would ordinarily require.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that and a transportation demand management program which the the criteria which are very specifically defined in the code. So I'll start with that one. One of the. The program that the this project purports to provide is participation in the Transportation Management Association, which would give transit passes to employees of the hotel and subsidizing Uber or Lyft'",
        "'speaker_4': 'to various locations for the guests. And but that does not meet the criteria of the code. The code requires, among other things, specific performance targets for trip reductions and parking reductions that these measures would are supposed to try to meet and.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Secondary measures that they that the project would be committed to implementing if those targets were not met. There are no targets included in the proposal here for how many of the guests would take rideshare. There are no targets mentioned for how many of the employees would actually use public transportation to get to work.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And there are no secondary measures proposed for if those two measures weren't enough. And so it just simply doesn't meet the criteria. I'll say a little bit more about the Uber and the lift further, further along. Second is the parking study.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There have been other hotels that have come forward that that in some cases that I've been here to oppose or support. And but whether I suppose opposed them or supported them, some of them have done real parking demand studies.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There was a hotel out on Harbor Bay Parkway which which I was opposed to, which we were opposed to that did a parking study that observed a comparable hotels. For 77 days over the course of four months to determine how many parking spaces this new hotel would would likely require.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The purported parking study for this project observed two days, once on a weekend and once on a weekday. That is not a parking study, and any anyone who tries to pass that off as a parking study should be embarrassed.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There was no mention of how how what was the occupancy of the particular hotel on Webster Street that they observed? And it's just it's just not a it's not a credible study. For what it's worth, the study out on Harvard Bay Parkway came up with a much higher ratio of of parking spaces to rooms that would be'",
        "'speaker_4': 'required. After they actually did a robust, robust data collection. Then what this then what this purported study concludes. So that's the letter of the law and the parking. The project simply hasn't met the the criteria that required for the granting of a parking reduction.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I respectfully would submit to you that perhaps the parking that they want to provide would be enough, but they should go back to the planning board, do their homework and actually demonstrate that. Second, I want to talk about whether this project is really what the city of Alameda needs.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Our appeal mentioned and Mr. Thomas mentioned that this is one of very few sites that is designated as a multi-family overlay. I recognize that that doesn't mean hotels are not allowed and I don't make the argument that a hotel is not allowed to use here.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But we just had a long presentation about the housing crisis and all of the. Really extreme measures that that legislators and other policymakers are considering taking to address this serious crisis and to put a sort of mediocre hotel on a spot that has that that is an opportunity site for for multifamily housing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I would I would suggest that the council should think really hard before before approving that. Second of all, there is a lot of rhetoric about activating the street and improving the pedestrian activity on Park Street. But this hotel is inward faces, places in the parking lot in the back to be.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'To be perfectly honest, people are going to drive in, parked their car, or have a valet parked their car and drive from the back and the front door and the front windows are really just decoration. There was a lot of talk at the planning board about about the the appearance of the windows to create an appearance of'",
        "'speaker_4': 'pedestrian friendliness. But there's nothing that about this hotel that activates the street in any way. There's nothing that, you know, there's no retail or food on the ground floor that would actually bring people in and have and have people walking up and down that street.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that is a second that is a portion of Park Street that, you know, could really use that kind of pedestrian activity. So on the whole, is this a project that is good enough for the city to overlook that the that it doesn't need the the letter of the law and the parking reductions?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I believe it's not. And I, I hope you'll at the very least send it back to the Planning Board for it to really do its homework and to create a better project for the city. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Counsel, before we get to our stack of speaker slips, do we have any clarifying questions for staff? Councilmember Desai Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'One clarifying question is on the if we're going to basically remove this from the housing overlay, are we require then to make up the loss of this area? That would have been no.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We're already in surplus, so sites on it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mr. Thomas.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I don't. Don't go.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I had a question about the appellant's assertion that the parking study just observed two days at another hotel. Can you speak to that?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yeah. You know, I we looked at the the Webster the hotel on Webster Street. We did some independent analysis as well. You know, I think, you know, the issue for us as staff when we think about the appellants arguments is we keep coming back to the larger question.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That entire provision in the zoning code that Mr. Hudson referenced references is all about the planning board reducing the amount of parking on the site available under what the code requires. And what the planning board actually did is they said, look, you need we think you probably only need 62 spaces.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That's what your parking lot shows. But when you if in fact, we're wrong and you need more, you're going to park it all on site through a valet program. So they technically didn't actually reduce the amount of parking.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'They said you have to park. If if 96 people show up and rent 96 rooms and each one of them has a car that they need to park on the site, you're going to park all 96 of them.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So the whole argument about the parking analysis is for us at staff becomes we sort of find ourselves jumping ahead. If really the issue is you want 96 spaces that are independently accessible without any valet, then there there is really a simple solution.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The hotel has to get smaller because we just can't fit 96 rooms and 96 parking spaces on that site. So you could say, all right, 62, that's all you the parking you have. So let's reduce the hotel to 62 rooms if you really felt that you needed every room to have an independently accessible parking space.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So for us, the whole argument about the parking study is interesting, but just not particularly relevant because at the end of the day, the planning board said if the parking study is wrong. Then you'll be valet parking because we don't want you dumping any cars into the neighborhood or onto the street.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You're going to park at least 96 cars on this parking lot. And if that means you need to have your staff people come out in valet park and that's what you're going to do.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. Any other clarifying questions before we go to public speakers? Okay. So public speakers. It would help if you don't wait until I've called your name. The third time to walk up to the front. I'm going to call three or four in advance, cut out to the aisle so you can get up here easily.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We will get you home sooner if you do. So our first public speakers in this order are Carrie Thompson. Michelle Russo. Correct me if I mispronounce your name. Oh, wait. And Paul, Minnesota. Oh, I know who that is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'He's ten pizza and cut a long line and bah! Thank you for the phonetic pronunciation. Miss Thompson, you are for it. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. Good evening. I just wanted to say that I feel that the planning board did do a good job on their due diligence and that they are taking into account everything, including parking, including the design of the hotel.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Whether they enter from the front or the back makes no difference. And that we fully the the Government Relations and Economic Development Committee fully supports this project. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And you even gave me the phonetic spelling. Michelle Manila. Sorry, it's getting late.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hello. Hello.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'My name is Fisherman who says I am an Alameda resident and one of the owners of East End Restaurant down on a park. And what a vista. I want to also second, a lot of feeling here that I think the planning department did do due diligence on this project.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The many, many hoops they had them jump through on design review and still more to come. I feel that there's a viable project here, and especially to address the idea that there's not going to be pedestrian activity because the hotel has a parking lot.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I just want to say feet in that end of Park Street is going to benefit my business. A lot of the businesses around us and I look forward to meeting and greeting a lot of new visitors to Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you. And Paul, is this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You know and a man and council I am family says I am one also of the owners of East End restaurant here in Alameda and I say no to the appeal and yet to the hotel because I think it'll do wonders for businesses here in Alameda and I think it's a great idea.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. By the way, you're all rock stars. It's staying under one minute, so keep that up and you'll be home even sooner. Okay. And also continue these phonetic pronunciations. I love it. Kurt, Long and Bob. Then I have no excuse for mispronouncing your name.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right, he's left. All right, so then we have O Zens and Lee. And I bet I said that incorrectly.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'You don't want you know, they are doing their business with their clime and go to, you know, San Francisco or Oakland to live. So I think, you know, and to me, that is another, you know, tourist destination. But, you know, to help business and the companies to stay here.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'And a lot of it is the retail. And so I think that the Bay Area should know about Alameda. And I think that, you know, more traffic would really bode well for Park Street and the city of Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And San Patel here is.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'I'm Sam, but I was a resident of Alameda. Two years ago, I moved to Saint Louis, Missouri. But I still have business here. Uh, consulting, say business. I bring in a staff, people here, uh, for the interviews and all that, and we've been housing them at the airport.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'The biggest problem is they don't want to go to Oakland. Uh, they want to come to eliminate some beautiful island. They feel safe here. Very safe. And it's a beautiful. I lived here, so I know. And why I was sitting and hearing all the different cases before us, uh, the, the one at the golf course.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So they're building the event center and that is very exciting news for us as a business then. Now we can do a event there and have my staff living in, in downtown, and that will help us very big because the staff will be very happy.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'Case and understanding Park Street and Alameda, myself, being a community member and coming down here all my life, I think that downtown needs a.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Little bit of a revitalization.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And hearing both sides and facts the case, I don't see really a reason why this community wouldn't benefit.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'From.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'A hotel like this, being in the area and knowing the brand. Hearing the objections.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'On the park's parking side, it doesn't really seem like.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'We think it's hugely beneficial to the city with the all the taxes that this hotel will pay and provide and also not use very many city services. And we'll also greatly support all the businesses along Park Street, which could use a help, you know.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So this is a wonderful project. We're very excited. I take a little offense to the union representative calling it a mediocre hotel because it's a fantastic hotel brand. It's one of the top largest hotels in the country.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We do not do applies. We have got 60 plus speakers. We will be here all night. Please, no more applause. Thank you. And you get the speaker off. So don't do that again. Please keep the mayor more cheerful.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'I am. Hello, I am Benjamin Winter. I'm the owner of Phenix, the venue right here on the corner. I am speaking in favor of the hotel. I was on the fence until Mr. Pertell took the time three or four times to come by, to call me and to get to know me and to talk to me and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'be personal about this. And I just hope we take that very seriously. I opened my venue two years ago and it takes a fire and it takes local pride. And I saw that in him. And I didn't know him.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I didn't know about I didn't know about the project. And I had the same kind of shared the sentiment of a of a major hotel chain coming in. And but things need to be local and personal. Our growth needs to be local.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It needs to be personal. I think that's at the root of the concern. And I see local and personal in this project, and I think it will catalyze a lot of vitality downtown, which is a band game. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Which brings.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Madam Mayor. And Council members and staff, rich drinks, long time resident and commercial broker here in town. I want to bring to your mind 1989 1990 movie called Do the Right Thing by Spike Lee. This project has been going on for three years.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'About a half a million dollars spent by the applicant, two planning boards, two mayors and two councils. So it's time to move on. We have a50 vote by the planning board. They've done their homework. Staff has really done their homework.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We've gone over and over and over with the design. Three architects on the design hotels bring in a lot of businesses and that means more jobs. I know someone spoke earlier about not having jobs. I think we need jobs and this will bring in more jobs.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's also going to bring more money to the businesses in town where their their employees can maybe afford to live here and the rents will be better. So I implore you, as Spike Lee said, do the right thing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And now will you will you correct me on the awful pronunciation? I'll make.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, first off, thank you so much for letting me talk for a moment or for a minute. This is a fantastic opportunity to bring something to the city that I think it needs. But more importantly, I'm here to support the Planning Commission and what they've already approved and they've already talked about.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's interesting when I see the the unite here come and talk negatively about the location of what it is and what it could be and on set. But they've addressed all those things. Everything has been. The Planning Commission was very, very they did their homework.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They knew what was going on. One of the things that I do for a living as a filmmaker and when I do a film, I shot a short film here a few years back. And the first thing I do is I go to the local businesses, I go to the restaurants, I bring a crew to the you'",
        "'speaker_4': 'know, we shot inside the Starbucks, we shot inside the movie theater. We were at the marina. This is a beautiful and wonderful place to be, but without a hotel downtown makes it really inconvenient to do things like that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I just want to say that I support I support the hotel and I.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Hope you make the right decision.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'My name is Phoebe. I'm a local resident of Alameda for many, many years. I am in favor of full title. I believe that it will bring a lot of new business, will bring life to downtown. Growing up here, downtown has changed so much and I think that we need to provide stay for a lot of people.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There's not very many high end or very nice hotels in the area, and I think a brand new hotel will definitely change the flavor, especially towards the bridge where right now people say it's dead. I think it'll bring a lot more people to Alameda than want to stay because currently everybody is staying and either Jack London or'",
        "'speaker_6': 'downtown Oakland. And I think that Alameda has a lot to bring and I think I'll bring a lot more people. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'And that number of people will be visiting local businesses. Following that, he's also going to be helping revitalize some of the infrastructure in the local area with regard to undergrounding of the overhead lines, the ADA compliance of the sidewalks and some of the streets.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Now nearby the hotel, he will be taking on the cost and the effort of redoing all of those for the city of Alameda, as well as his own business. The burden of proof to prove that this is a viable and beneficial project has been met.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'And every time I try to stop by Alameda because it reminds me of home tonight, I have to drive 45 minutes back to Campbell. If there was a conveniently placed hotel, I would probably stay the night and wouldn't have to drive back.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I believe it would be great for the city both with tax revenue and jobs. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Mr. Gorman is followed by Sean Flynn. Followed by Vincent Moore, followed by. Lay Tai chi. Tai, you're going to help me. Okay. Mr. Flynn.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Villa Luna. Hello.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hi, I'm Mike. Villa Luna. And I'm in favor of the hotel. I think it will be good for the economy and creates jobs. The hotel visitors will help local businesses with. Visitors need to eat and shop.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'My kids have 30 year lease on that place and they plan to stay there for a long time. I heard that the proposed project is a mediocre project. By no means that project is going to enhance the gateway to the city.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We plan to hire between 5 to 10 more people to do because of the increased visitor to anticipate. So I hope you approve the project without any further delay, because it's going to create no more no more and more income for the city from the hotel, but also from the rest of the business around.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'But being new to the city of Alameda, I call it the destination. It's the hidden gem of the Bay Area. And I think we do need the hotels here because we need to increase tourism to the city very much.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I'm all for that. Plus, it's going to increase business, it's going to increase jobs and everything. So we're all for it. The chamber supports that. Thank you so much.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'I was really inspired by Mr. Patel story. I think it's a very Alameda story that most people could really feel really good about that someone who is really ingrained and enmeshed in the community and like Benjamin Winters from Phenix said.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Mr. Patel took the time to come out and meet with me and hear about my concerns and was really looking for ways to partner and to find ways that his guests could benefit from the kinds of entertainment that rhythmic provides to the community here.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'Their mission is close to his heart. He doesn't have to do this for the hotel. He's reaching out because he cares and he's offered to provide additional shelter for sexually trafficked youth when the shelter has no more beds.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Hi.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening. My name is Mark Skolnick. I'm here to support this hotel. It's going to bring a lot of revenue to the city. It's a well thought out program that's been thoroughly vetted by the planning department at very high expense to Mr. Patel.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And this is the right project at the right time in the right place. So I thoroughly approve. And I urge you to do the same.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'A project like what is in front of us tonight at the north end of Park Street has been a goal for the organization for many, many years that I welcome this project. The hotel will not only generate needed revenue to the city, but I also believe it will inspire other developments and improvement to the north end of'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the Park Street. And in that process, the gateway to Park Street and our city will improve and become more attractive. I believe that this project will do due to the north end of Park Street, but the theater project, Detroit, downtown, it will become a success.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'I think there's spillover benefits to many of the retailers and merchants along Park Street and other streets. Others like it in Alameda will be tremendous and a gentleman mentioned it earlier. Now, if I have friends and family visiting instead of packing them in my house, they have a place to stay.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'And he planted here 18 years ago and he wants to build his business here. I think it's going to be good for Alameda. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And LA my Damien do you recognize your name? Is it that person has left okay. Because they pronounce the name so badly. And then we have to picture Michoud. The last name is Michelle. Janet Maccabee. I saw her.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'great events that we have. And Mr. Pertell has been an absolute delight to work with his community minded. He's resilient, certainly, and he is somebody that we really want to support. And on behalf of our board of directors and our committee members, we ask you to approve this project.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Ms.. Maccabee is followed by Steven Zimmerman. Mr. Zimmerman followed by the champion Nam Cam. Followed by Steven. So, so sorry. So sorry. Mr. Zimmerman. Hi. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Mayor. And members of the council whose proposed project, hotel project, will revitalize the northern section, partially bring more visitors, obviously revenue to our town and support businesses like Tuckers, but also will support a lot of nonprofit groups. What a lot of people forget to realize as we put on a lot of great events in town as the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'incoming president of Rotary, we're going to be hosting a district call in the Hornet this May. We're going to bring some world class speakers like astronaut Scott Kelly. It's a three day event. We're expecting hundreds, if not over a thousand attendees for three days.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'During this time, we were trying to reserve room hotel rooms on the island. We could only get 46 rooms, not only to be an asset to the businesses, but also nonprofit groups in town like Darbar, Rotary Boys and Girls Club and their big event in October.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So there are many reasons to support this project. It makes sense for the community, it makes sense for businesses, it makes sense for visitors and their family members. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Okay. Do we have Ms. or Mr. Nam Cam? No. Okay. I'm Steven. So sorry. No. Nora Gordon. We could be out of here even sooner. Darren and. No.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We really scared them off. Ivan Gutierrez, Mr. Gobierno, Joe La Parra. I saw him. There he is.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Where you are.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, I get the other ten in.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Front of me, you know.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You do know we have rules in this body.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There's nothing more I can say other than I support this hotel and everybody else. Every single speaker in front of me supports the hotel, and they said everything beautifully. Better than I could. So thank.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You. Thank you. Okay. And then I have. See, look, look, look. No, Nora. A bill. No.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Oh.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Hello, everyone. I'm a local resident, small business owner in town and a commercial property owner on Park Street. I think the hotel is good for our downtown district. Hotel guests will come stay and spend money in our beautiful downtown.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think it will help our economy. I totally support the hotel project.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Ms.. NG is followed by Vida's Vida Circus. Here he is. Hi. And you can tell us the real pronunciation of your name.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Vida.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Not too bad.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Speaking of the hotel without the restaurant is the best news to all Park Street restaurants. No, that's confirmed. That was the first what I figured when people told me about the situation and I really feel the pain for years trying to present this project and start building.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I mean, that's wow. It took me half a year to build my little restaurant and I thought, it's a disaster. So for years, I really feel the pain. I really want to support him as much as they can.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And all this nearby out of mobile, out body shops, maybe they will convert for more parking lots, so who knows? Maybe they will see the opportunity once the hotel is going to be standing there. So it can really bring good news to everybody.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I shouldn't be really sad about locals comments.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you. What's your restaurant, by the way?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm more popular to my restaurant.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh, yeah? Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then Richard kind of Powell.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Kind of Powell.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Followed by Alex. Rachel, Rachel followed by Crash.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I hear.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So thank you for the opportunity to speak. As a long time East Bay resident and supporter of our major businesses. I heartily support the project and urge acceptance.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Alex Patel. Hi.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Good evening. I'll try to keep it brief. I grew up in Oakland for first 24 years of my life and every time I would get a straight AA, we would go to Tucker's. Every time we wanted to, as Burma came up, we would go to Burma.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'I mean, it's been a place that I've come my entire life and it's been really special. And then seeing it grow and expand over the years has been really tremendous. And just and this is a project that I think will drive a lot of business here.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'And hearing everybody talk about the business growth, it just seems like it makes sense. And then also, my brother had a very important event. We brought family in. We lived in Oakland for a while and we looked for places and we didn't find a place safe that we felt comfortable bringing our families here.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'But we would always come here to Alameda with all of the family when they would come into town. And so having a hotel like this, I could see family bringing in people to stay at the hotel. And it would be something that would be great for us to be able to come here and spend more time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And to have Koresh are here and and followed by Carlos Rosales, followed by Sunil Lama.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hi.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hi. Good evening. I'm in favor of the hotel project. I'm an L.A. based filmmaker who does business here in Alameda and, you know, have meetings over projects. And it's usually here in downtown. You know, all these is one of the examples that we usually meet.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So it would be great to walk down the hotel and just walk over to the restaurant versus driving. So I hope this happens.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you. And Carlos Rosales, there is.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So hello.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You just want to start by saying that a certain said from the local union that the gas will come in through the back, go inside the hotel and inside there they need to eat. Everybody here in Alameda has most of the restaurants are privately owned.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They're not a big chain. So I think the all the businesses will benefit, you know, by having 97 people come out in the city every day if it's sold out. So I am for the hotel. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And let's see, we've got Sunil Lama there. Sunil. Followed by William Smith, followed by Brian Maguire, followed by Carlos Serrano crying. Hello.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hello. Good evening. I'm here to support Paul's Hotel Project. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It took longer to walk to the microphone. Bill Smith.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That was short. Bill Smith, again, welcome to you. Back up here. I'm really impressed and delighted to see the business community get behind something, the business. And so that's very impressive. But not one of them has mentioned housing and where these employers are going to live and all these new jobs are.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I do have find a couple of suggestions for our planning director to work about in terms of approaching this. He said, we met arena numbers. That is absolutely not true. We are way behind on the affordable housing component, which is the housing group where they employ most, employ for the restaurants and the hotels will live.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so we're going to have a problem that we're going to add to it. They said, oh, it isn't high. Everybody locally, well, they're not going hiring away from someone else locally. So eventually people are going to move in.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So that doesn't work. Then the other thing I wanted to say is we really should do a social vulnerability analysis because you wrote me, the city wrote me that squat does not do consider social vulnerability in the fact of income for affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's outside of CEQA. We need to get that in.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Smith. Brian Maguire.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hello, Brian Maguire. You guys dealt with a couple of big issues today climate change item, big housing crisis item. And one thing that both of those colossal problems have in common is that they're one of the big contributors to those is bad local process that leads to bad faith appeals that delay in order to delay and deny'",
        "'speaker_4': 'projects for infill development. So hopefully we're not going to play that game here any longer, even if it's our friends who are asking for something. Putting on my bike walk hat. I'm hopeful that we can have a way to direct the right chair, sort of which to substituting for a shuttle to go to the back of the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'hotel. Better yet, offering to transit day passes to users as an alternative to Uber and Lyft. I think this is would be a decent project to have a few project based bike share options for guests. Three or four bikes, maybe.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Lastly, if you've ever scratch your head trying to park at the marketplace, you should grant staff flexibility to give one further reduction of parking so that the 17 compact spaces can be six inches wider.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Carlos Serrano, Keegan and Mr. Serrano. Quinn is my last speaker slip. If you want to speak, just don't feel compelled. But if you want to speak, get his speeches live. And right away.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That could be Ashcraft and the council member for this evening. Okay. Mr. Patel is a personal friend of mine, actually, and he's very passionate about this project. About a year ago, he actually toward me around Park Street. I used to live in Bay Port Alameda myself, and he's so passionate about this project that he explained to me'",
        "'speaker_4': 'about all the economic benefits that it would bring to the city that would bring the parks. As a matter of fact, he took it all the way down Park Street. How he would benefit all the companies and businesses down Park Street.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I used to have a friend that owns chicken wire. I don't know if you guys remember on Park Street. He didn't make it. He was right there really close to the hotel site. So in my 20 seconds, let me just tell you a little story about Mr. Patel and where he has come from and where he's'",
        "'speaker_4': 'going right now with this hotel. This is not his first. This was not at first. I'll tell he's experience hotel operator and he no, he's really knows what he's doing. And I highly urge you guys to support the denial of the people.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you so much. Okay. Our last speaker is Michael McKenna.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Is it morning yet? No, it's still afternoon. Still evening. Good evening, council mayor. I'm Michael McDonough, president of the Alameda Chamber of Commerce. I turned in my speaker slip, slip last because I wanted to speak last. And I don't know if any of you were taking roll or taking.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I was chicken scratching. Everybody that came up here, we had 46 for one that I'm not sure if he was for or against, but it sounded like you might have been against. But I have never seen that many speak.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We had 12 that left or 13 that left. That's on the back of my slip. Mayor, if you want to check that. I have never seen that many speakers come out and all be for something. And I think it's because there's no doubt that the businesses in Alameda, as we see today, need a hotel in Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There's no doubt that the residents need another hotel in Alameda. There's no doubt that the tote tax will benefit our budget. There's no doubt that it will stimulate the economy again. On Park Street, remember what the thinking is.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, guys.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'See you again. All right. With that, I'm closing public comment and I'm opening up council discussion. Who wants to go first? Councilmember Vela.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'A couple of questions for Mr. Thomas. So we heard about that story in question. And we also heard that there was a study done from a hotel on Webster. There's two hotels on Webster. How many rooms do they have?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So number. Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Approximately 50 rooms for both.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Both hotels.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You know.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That's the Hawthorne Suites we're talking about.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I mean, I guess part of my question is just we're hearing about all the business that is going to be generated. Do the and at the Hawthorne and the I think the date but I don't know the name of the other hotel.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Days in.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Days Inn or something like that. The roadway or.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Roadway in.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That that. How much business are they generating right now for Webster Street? They're both at the entrance of Webster. Do we do we have can we quantify that?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I can't standing here now.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But we're hearing that they're at capacity.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I have. I know. Yes. The I don't know about the roadway. And I do know about the Webster. The other Hawthorne Suites is often at capacity.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And that's that's about 50% of what this proposed hotel is.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yeah, it's about 50 rooms.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Regarding the the ride share proposals, you know, have we I mean, obviously that came up. That was one of the that's one of the proposals in terms of how to handle that. Do we have any sort of guidance or policies in place regarding.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You know, what the what the condition of approval requires is that to make that available to hotel patrons so that they can get a ride? What we're trying to do is we were trying to make it as easy as possible for people flying into the open airport to not have to rent a car.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So with with different hotels, we've taken different approaches. Sometimes we require that they run a free shuttle just back and forth. In this case, the operator and staff discussed using a ride share program so that make that available for.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You could feel free to come up if you want. Also, I know she's got a broken foot, but if you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Say yes to the idea.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The idea of the ride share was to essentially make it free for the for the patrons to be able to get back and forth from the airport to the hotel without having to rent a car.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So the operator would be paying for the ride share. Right. Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And, Councilor, we've got a little bit of housekeeping business we need to conduct first. We are approaching 11 p.m.. It's 1051. We need four yes votes to call new items after this one after 11 p.m.. We have six F is our budget.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have nine is a council referral on the transient occupancy tax, nine B is a breastfeeding etc. referral. 10 a.m. a head swim center update ten be sure a moved. So okay to hear the dates here all of them the balance.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Oh I'm happy to delay my till next time.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. By me.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. That one. That's the Toti and Mr. Adejumo.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The stop waste info thing is for info so we can just push that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay, so.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Amend my motion to move the balance except for those two.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is that that was the.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Ten C.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And what's the charter amendment.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's the subcommittee.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Back.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. Oh yeah. Right. That was the time frame. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. The motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So that's the motion to hear. Six, seven, 9a9b, ten a, ten B, okay. All in favor.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'By.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Anyone opposed. Abstained. Okay, we've got two five over on that one. Okay. Sorry to cut you off for you. Did you finish your what.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm done with my questions. Okay, I have. I don't know if anyone else has any questions. Otherwise, I'm happy to move in my comments.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'If I may just finish the answer to that one.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh, I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Linda was cluing me in there. She the the way the condition is written, it's hotel pays for ride, share services for the guests airport and any place within three miles. So once again the idea is try to reduce the need for for patrons of the hotel to have to rent cars, which would then have to be stored'",
        "'speaker_9': 'in the parking area.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Question.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So finish your.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Question. Go ahead and I spell. Okay, then I'm ready. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh, well, we'll see if anyone else. Councilman Brody.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'My quick question was like, practically, I'm like in use case mode. How's that going to work?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I mean, because usually.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Usually, like you pick it up on your phone, but then you pay for.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It. You call. Let's say you're flying in from Oklahoma. You've you've observed a room at the hotel. You ask if there's a shuttle from the airport. They say, well, yes, we'll pay for the ride share. And they contact the ride share for you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Oh, okay. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So they will dispatch or I mean, the.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Idea is you're you know, I mean, obviously, if you don't know that it's available, but if you call the hotel and say, hey, how do I get to your hotel? Do you have a free shuttle from the airport?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That's how you'd find out about it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I mean, do we consider any type of bike option like not necessarily like calling luggage from the.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Airport, but, you know.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Park Street or whatever.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Those sort of things. I mean, we didn't we didn't require that when the we need to get you up here. They do have they have onsite bike parking but not bike share. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Oh, do we.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Have a bike that we can give Linda.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Don't we live that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have the.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Holder. So I think.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We'll be.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'All right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, the budget hearing coming up.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Maybe.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It was not a conditional approval. This is a de novo hearing. You certainly can add conditions if if you'd like to.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mr. Thomas.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Any other clarifying questions? Okay. Who wants to start with discussion, Miss Vella?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So we just had our two items. One was on climate impact and the other was on the the CASA Compact. And I think, you know, the questions that I was really asking is it's not so much about parking to me.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It's about what are we doing to reduce single occupancy vehicles. And so, you know, we've also heard from the business community. I mean, Tony Kuttner has been up here multiple times talking about the need for an Alameda shuttle and a free Alameda shuttle.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And we are trying to promote that. And I've heard from a lot of you in support of that shuttle. And I think that, you know, to me, it's, you know, I think the number of parking spaces, yeah, I think I would do away with the compact spaces and just make them passable.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Actually, I got pinned in some some nice gentleman decided to park so close to me at the marketplace that with my seven months belly, I couldn't quite get into my car. And I ended up waiting for 45 minutes for him to come out of the restaurant he was in.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But but I, I do think also, you know, with with the rideshare agreement, I'm not in support of that, frankly. I think that we need to be supporting public transit. We do have we have busses that go to and from the airport.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I've taken them. I in fact, I've had friends that were visiting recently from another country who were able to manage it. And I think we need to we need to be looking in that direction. I don't want to be supporting any extra single, single occupancy vehicles coming in and out.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I certainly don't want our businesses supporting that. I also, you know, I, I like the idea that this is going to generate business. I'm not necessarily we have two hotels on Webster Street. I think, you know, they to a certain extent might improve business, but not to the level that I've kind of heard into in terms'",
        "'speaker_8': 'of the enthusiasm. But I do, I do think that we need to work on improving, uh, you know, doing what we can to improve our business districts. Again, I and I like the idea of of of you know again the offer to house traffic youth.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I used to be on Almeida Family Services Board and have done a lot with dream catchers. There's actually new laws you can't house traffic youth anywhere there's there it's very highly regulated. I hope that the support for dream catchers will continue and there's actually new training for hotel and motel workers that's just gone into place because of'",
        "'speaker_8': 'trafficking actually occurring in hotels, which is why you're not allowed to use temporary beds in in hotels and motels for traffic in particular. But I do think overall, there's there's a problem and a couple of speakers have raised it with the process involved for hotel approvals.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And we have these processes involved that are very strict for certain projects. And then for hotels, it kind of seems like, you know, each hotel project is very different and I get that we've done the work session before, the planning board.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But I also think that, you know, we should have a process that includes at least one public like community meeting. I'm not talking about a study session before planning board. I'm talking about just generally speaking, there should be a community meeting where we notify the neighbors and we let them know.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I think the city should be doing that, not to not to impede or bogged down the design review process or the approval process, but just so that we're we're we're just kind of creating a level playing field and saying this should happen.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And neighbors know and we don't hear from people, people that live nearby after the fact that they weren't noticed and why city require that. So that's just something that I've seen and there's been a lot of talk. Michael mentioned the number of people who've come out.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I've also heard from a number of people who had various complaints and different things and didn't know who to who to talk to. I directed them to rich cranks and and other folks, but I think just setting that process up would be helpful before it even goes to a study session or final, final planning, planning, board approval'",
        "'speaker_8': '. I you know. I do think that there you know, I do have concerns about the pedestrian just safety in general. We also have things like Vision Zero in place. And if we're again, if we're in encouraging rideshares and there isn't a designated drop off point or we're not investing in public transit right now, there's a big problem'",
        "'speaker_8': 'on Park Street with double parking. And it's become it's becoming increasingly bad and it's actually slowing down traffic. And so I do think that there needs to be some work done on that in terms of how are people going to get dropped off?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Where are they going to get dropped off? And why are we not supporting public transit or the Alameda shuttle or some of these other things? So I do want those things looked at.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Who wants to go next? Mr. Desai.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. I've read the staff report, reviewed the planning board documents, looked into the relevant ordinances and the the TDM analyzes. And I've concluded that the appeal does not rise to the level of significance. And so I will vote to deny the appeal and vote in favor of the hotel.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Who's next with the. Did you finish? I didn't mean to cut you off, Councilman Brody.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I just make up comments. I appreciate everyone coming out and waiting till after 11 to to hear us deliberate on this. I do share some of the concerns raised by my colleague, Ms.. Vella, especially related to the ride share, and that we we just went through an exercise declaring a climate emergency where we want to get more'",
        "'speaker_5': 'cars off the road. And yet, you know, we're asked to approve a project that basically puts more cars on the road. And I won't even get into the whole like independent contractor gig economy thing and income inequality that that I think is exasperated by by some of these rideshare companies.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I do think if we're going to want people to take bicycles and, you know, walk more, you know, we need to have projects that actually promote that. I mean, in an ideal world, I would have liked to seen a project that had ground floor retail, that generated foot traffic for retail, that had three stories of hotel'",
        "'speaker_5': 'and three stories of residents. I mean, the issue or housing, I mean, we had a long discussion earlier about the housing crisis, yet we're giving up one of our multifamily overlay sites for purely commercial. So I think there's a way that we could have worked in retail, commercial, hotel and residence at the same time and really taken'",
        "'speaker_5': 'advantage of the position of this property right in the gateway of Alameda to generate foot traffic from tourists and residents. And I think that's a missed opportunity. And I would have liked to have I would like to see in a project like that come forward.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'On the parking thing, I'm not really convinced that that that's an issue. I, I can't remember where I saw it, but I think it was one of our agenda items that, you know, these parking minimum parking requirements seem to be a tool that people use to oppose these development projects.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And, you know, I don't think that's a good idea. Again, if our goal is to reduce the amount of cars providing more parking, it's kind of disincentivizes that. So that that argument really didn't hold a lot of water with me.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'On the design review, I mean, this is a matter of taste. You know, I personally would have preferred something other than art deco there. But, you know, I'm not going to like again, it's a matter of taste and style, so I'm not going to tell anyone to come back and do anything differently, considering it's been like done'",
        "'speaker_5': 'redone three times. But I think, again, I'm disappointed that a project didn't come to us that included housing, because I think we could have we could have done we could have done more with this project and more with this property.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Then. Okay. Vice Mayor Knox White.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sure. So I'll pick up from there. I will. Jim's no councilmember.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm coming to you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Vision, I think, is a great one. And I hope one of the things that comes out of this is maybe as a part of maybe the general general plan and housing update. We can talk about how in the future, if we're going to go up five or six stories on Park Street, maybe we can actually require it'",
        "'speaker_2': '. Changes are needed to look at requiring some of that to be housing. You know, I was on the planning board when we wrote the North Park Street zoning rules. It was on the subcommittee that helped write those rules.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And one of the things we wanted to do with the north north of Lincoln, on Park Street District was was attract businesses that are not like businesses in other parts of Park Street so that there was no competition.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I do think that a hotel makes sense here. And, you know, I do want to thank Mr. Patel. I met with him over three years, so I did not get to vote for his project on the planning board.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So there's no inconsistency here. But he did come before us for at least one hearing, and I think I met with him about a year before he ever got to the planning board, as did most of the planning board members, just to talk about the design and whatnot.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And through those through those meetings over that time, through the many architects, we saw a significant improvement in the design. And we really listened listened to the architects on the board. Right. The people who should be making these decisions listen very carefully.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I want to echo Jim Emilia's concerns about the tenses, Ubers and lifts there. Yeah, they're not ride share. They're surrogate ride programs and surrogate chauffeurs. You know, I would like to for me, I would like to see and I've talked to the applicant and he was supportive of this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I would like to see some of that engagement on the on the ground floor happened. The lobby is going to be open to the public, and I think it should be. I think when this goes back to to design review with the planning board, I'd like to see signage and how the design of this first floor is'",
        "'speaker_2': 'going to actually look like it doesn't have to be a Starbucks, but it should look like it's a coffee shop that somebody who lives across the street should feel comfortable walking into. That goes with the design inside the building, etc. It should be very clear that it's open to the public and if you want to go use'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the wi fi and sit down and drink a cup of coffee and grab a snack from the from the snack machine, then you could do that. I would like to. I would like to see the team program much more.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know, I think my colleagues have really said it very well, so I won't say it, but I would like to see that that that team shift. And, you know, this is one of the places where the 21 bus literally stops outside.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Right. And gets you straight to the airport. There is no reason why we are not just giving people a free pick up at the airport and drop off in front of the Holiday Inn. And if people decide that they don't want to do that and they want to pay for our TNC or something like that, if they'",
        "'speaker_2': 'want to drive that, just like driving their car, they will do that better. But I think that that we should be taking steps to not encourage it. I would like to you know, I think the appellant tonight raises a good point and a good point that he raises is is not I do not they will not find'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that there is a violation of sequel, because at the end of the day, the planning board actually helped them force them to meet the parking requirements with the with the the valet parking. But I do think the way in which we keep going through this, not just with this project, with other projects, it is the way we'",
        "'speaker_2': 'have written our parking requirements is not it's a 1970s mindset and here we are. And you know, I want to say post global warming, but in mid global warming mindset where we know that, we know that those requirements didn't make sense in the seventies and now they don't make sense today.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But we keep trying to pretend they do. And then we get very almost every project comes to us. It's a variant. So let's let's change that and look at, you know, removing them or doing parking maximums or something like that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think that that's probably a pretty quick fix that we could look at while we come up with our new one. And then lastly. Yeah. That's it. I oh. Yeah, I'd like to, you know, I do think we continue to have conversation some hotels come forward with, uh, you know, with agreements for the workers and some'",
        "'speaker_2': 'don't. And I think that it's something that we can look at as we go forward. You know, we have to be careful in not putting our position ourselves in a position where we can require, you know, no city can require labor use and whatever else.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But we do, too, that we had a couple of we did have one speaker who was not glowing about the project. And one of the things he talked about is where will these people be able to afford to live?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we want to make sure that when people are working in our city that they can afford to live in our city as well. Part of that is addressing the housing issue and the other side of that is addressing the the wage issue.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I would like to have some conversations around that because I don't think this'll be.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The last that I will see. So those are my thoughts.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Councilmember Desai wants to speak before I do. If I can.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Just add one more point really quickly. You know, as a west ender who lives right next to Webster Street, literally, I always, you know, go to restaurants and eating places on Web's history. Kapok Nation's West Cafe Cafe Zola You know, I mean, those are my go to places.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But I have to say, though, you know, in the few times that I, you know, venture on the other side of Grand Street to Park Street, you know, Park Street, north of Lincoln Avenue, especially, you know, the where the monkey restaurant is or whatever or where the you know, is.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's a whole bunch of great restaurants that that I just say to myself, I want to go to there when I go to there. So I know that when this hotel is made that the people who go there will feel the same way.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So, you know, maybe my presentation tonight is a little dry, but. But I find this project exciting.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, my turn. So I am supportive of the parking waiver. I think the planning board has done a good job on that. I in no particular order, just maybe the way the topics came up, I think it's great to get people to ride the bus.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I ride the bus a lot. I think it's unrealistic to expect every guest who flies in from out of town to hop on the 21 bus. Sometimes you're jetlagged from, you know, flying across the country. Sometimes you're elderly or have some physical limitations.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I'm all for having a variety of options available. And I was just thinking of maybe a month ago, I tagged along with my husband on a business trip to St Petersburg, Florida. It's quite lovely. We were seeing a beautiful hotel right on the water.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We took a Uber, Lyft or a taxi, I don't remember in because we didn't want to pay for parking in the hotel. And once we got there, St Peter's St Petersburg is a very walkable city. It also has a free shuttle.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The free shuttle is paid for by all the businesses and the hotels in the downtown. It is not borne by the most recent hotel developer. I also feel like people, even Alameda Inns, don't realize just how widespread AC transit is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I do like the idea and maybe will consider including it as a condition to make available day passes for AC transit because as was noted, there's nearby bus routes. But and then the other thing about rideshare, I know there's the argument that's been made.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I will also say I love talking to my rideshare drivers and asking them about themselves. The majority are immigrants. They're here. This is a way oftentimes they you know, as soon as one spouse comes home, they go off to work or they go off and drive.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that's how they handle child care and that's how they handle establishing a foothold in in a new country. So I the model I get, there's some arguments to be made. I don't think we want to throw the baby out with the bathwater on that one.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I think the Army, the shuttle, good idea. We're not going to have it right now today. But and then I I don't think the comparison with Webster and Park Street as far as will show us how many how much business the Hawthorne Suites has generated and their different streets.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But what we are hearing and we heard from a lot of business owners is that you need the foot traffic. And I know from talking to many of you, you are barely making ends meet as far as, you know, paying your workers and your benefits and your insurance and all that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So if we can bring a hotel to the downtown to increase business visitors and getting people to stay in Alameda, I think that's great. The other thing is we did just have a really serious discussion about climate change and our need for more housing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But isn't the idea that we want to get people out of single occupancy vehicles? I don't want them all to just drive their. Their rental car in from the from the airport. But I do think there's a range of options.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The bike share. Yeah, they had that in St Petersburg too. They also had this parking meters that we're going to do where you put in money to donate to homelessness. But that's off the subject right now. But anyway, just I think that we we definitely want to that that's why the parking waiver makes sense.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think Councilmember Brody said it, if you keep saying, yeah, for every room, we're going to give you a parking space, it's not a disincentive. And as far as the housing on the upper levels, an inspired idea for a future project, but it is not fair to hold an applicant to a standard that was not set'",
        "'speaker_0': 'forth for him to meet. I mean, we don't keep adding on as we go. So but I will say that I'm not 100% on board because I also served on the city council. And no, I'm in the city council now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I served on the planning board when Vice Mayor Knox White was on and I was part of the group that drafted the the the North Park Suite north of Lincoln form based codes. And that is indeed the gateway to Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I am not taken with the current design of this hotel and I want it to get better. And I don't care that it's already been back to the planning board because this, this design and I don't mean to be unkind, but I'll just be frank, I would describe it as nondescript.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It could be located anywhere along a freeway. It might be better viewed at 65 miles an hour, but it doesn't seem appropriate to the historic gateway of our downtown. I will hasten to add that I'm not saying everything has to be Victorian or Brick or whatever.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There's a very nice building going up even closer to the Park Street Bridge. It's Morris single's glass and steel, but it's really exciting quality architecture and so that that is what I am looking for. I do not find the streamlined moderne architectural style appropriate for the site or for the adjacent neighbors.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And again, you don't have to look too far down Park Street, north of Lincoln. You've got the market place. You've got the the brick building that is the Walgreens that is there. And that's more what I'm looking for.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I consulted with our very capable city attorney, deputy city attorney, Selina chan, and she gave me some framework that I I'm going to just propose to the council. If any of you share my ideas, we can break out the different issues before us.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And this is a de novo hearing so we can consider other things. We can take a vote to approve the parking waiver. And then I believe well, I'm not sure would that be the time to add whatever conditions people were suggesting to make it better?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mischin At I think somebody had said about easy transit day passes and. Bike shares. But. But anyway, just, you know, interested.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Mr. Thomas I'm just saying I was just whispering back there. I think in terms of process, I think the first issue to to decide as a group is, are you are you upholding the appeal and sending it back to the planning board?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And if you are, then then get to the question of, for example, on the design as you were arguing or making the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Case for the appeal doesn't go to the design right.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Of the appeal. So think of it this way. Project gets approved by planning board. Somebody appeals it. What they're saying is, don't let this project go forward. Stop it in its tracks. In this case, one of your options is, you know, and send it back.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You might send it back for the reasons they argued in this case, parking waiver. Or you might send it back for other reasons, like design. At the end of the day, it's a de novo hearing. You get to decide whether this project is ready for prime time or not.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I think what I was hearing from just your position here is that you're not sending it back for the parking. You're sending it back for the the design, if that's the feeling of the board, I mean, the full council, what's good about articulating why you're sending it back?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so the planning board knows what they need to work on.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Absolutely. I've been in the planning board before. We appreciate that. Okay. So I would be in favor of sending it back for the design. Does anyone want to chime in their thoughts? Council Councilmember Vella.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I'll I'll second that. I do have a question though about the the parking. My whole thing with the parking is I actually think there's too much parking and I would like to see I would I think there's too much parking.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think we over park our hotels, to be honest with you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, that's your proposal. So, you know what could we I was thinking maybe we would handle one item at a time design and then go to parking and that's fine.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay, that's fine. But so if it goes back to planning board, could there be one community meeting or something like that or notification to the committee? I mean, we, we send out notices for other projects, even if there isn't a community meeting because I think when it comes to the subject of design, people have a lot of'",
        "'speaker_8': 'opinions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That is true. Is that what you're thinking of as far as sending it to a community meeting?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But I know it could go back to the planning board, but just that there would be like a community meeting or that we would notice the community to let them know what specifically is going back to the planning board relative to design and input.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mr. Thomas, you want to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Come back up.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Please? Okay.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We if it goes back to the planning where we can certainly notice that the community that it's coming back to the planning board then is a study session. If if the council wishes that there be a separate community meeting before that, the planning board reviews it, that's also something that could be orchestrated.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I don't know that I'm saying that because I think, you know, we also heard in the course of a little bit different because it's talking about housing. But we we want to be fair to our applicants as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so if we do, we need a separate, separate public meeting on the design. I want to go back to planning, but.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm not saying that there needs to be a separate meeting. I'm saying that it might be helpful to have, if it is a work session, whatever, to let the community know, because I think there are strong feelings about design.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, absolutely. The community would be noticed. I mean, it's it's a public meeting and then.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But specifically about what's on the table.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right. But that might also be your parking waiver. But hold that thought. Well, and then I would also say that if we are going to send it back, I agree that we need to send it back with some specific guidelines for what we're looking for.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Vice Mayor, I sense you might want to say something.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's not a flag that I mean, this is had at least two public hearings that were on the front page of the newspaper with drawings before the planning board did it. And I guess I'm a little I'm not going to support that is sending the design back because I think the design is fine.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean, that's fine. It's that the personal tastes on that one. But but I want to be careful. We didn't have 60 speakers. We didn't have one person stand up and say they hate the design. So I just want to make sure that it's going to go back for design review that which is going back to the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'planning board and that we're not adding multiple more meetings to that to solve an issue that I don't think we've actually heard.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I'll just say to that that I feel a responsibility as an elected official voting to approve a project that it is as high quality and is appropriate in appearance as I think believes belongs in our downtown. Gateway corridor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Brody, did you have your hand up?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'No, no.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Decide. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'On something.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'll just. On the issue of design. Like I said, having reviewed the staff reports and having reviewed the planning board report's documents, I am satisfied that the project has been properly vetted, which means that I am satisfied with the design that we have now.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'More importantly, I am satisfied that the design is consistent with north of Lincoln Avenue Park Street strategy that we put together. One of the reasons why we have reversed the project that's near the the bridge, because I think we had demonstrated that it was not consistent with the north of Lincoln Park Street Plan.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I believe this project is consistent. So I am satisfied with the project. And I would I would encourage us not to return it for design review. More importantly, on the issue of parking, I am satisfied with the vetting that has gone through on the parking and the TDM strategy that was put in place.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So for that reason, I will still continue to encourage us to deny the appeal. And yeah.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Councilman Brody. Okay. I mean, since you brought up design, I'll chime in. I mean, I kind of agree with the mayor's comments about. I mean, fitting in with that neighborhood. I mean, we have like the the Rialto Building, the marketplace, the Walgreens, I mean, the City Hall, which is not quite there, but, you know, that kind of'",
        "'speaker_5': 'feel as opposed to something that looks like this is not a bad thing. But, you know, it looks like an office building on the base there. Nothing wrong with office buildings on the base. But, you know, all those kind of look alike and they are totally in character for that neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But, you know, if it if it does come back and go back for that that reason, you know, that's kind of my thought on the design. Again, I mean, it's all a matter of taste. So, you know, I'm not going to be like insistent on it, but I mean, I would like to see something a little bit'",
        "'speaker_5': 'more fit, for lack of a better word, traditional brick that kind of fits in with, you know, with the surrounding buildings, not the Salvation Army.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But something I'll take it that now and there are findings, there are three design review findings we have to make in those last two that the proposed design is appropriate for the site compatible with adjacent or neighboring buildings or surroundings, and promotes harmonious transitions and scale and character in areas between different designated land uses and proposed design'",
        "'speaker_0': 'of the structure and exterior materials and landscaping are visually compatible with the surrounding. Development and design elements have been incorporated to ensure the compatibility of the structure with the character and uses of adjacent development. I think I'm hearing that there are three councilmembers in favor, so with that I'm going to make a motion that we will.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm sorry, I lost my train of thought that the. Oh, so this is help me out with the mechanics. Can we, can we move to, to send it back to planning board on that to improve the design.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To be more compatible with those last two designs.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And in making that motion, if you don't if you, if you're satisfied with the planning board's action on the parking, then just say so. So they know what they what it what you want them to work on and improve.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And Mr. Chen.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Good evening. Celina Chen, on behalf of the city attorney's office, I think more specifically, if the city council can't make all three of the findings that are required for design review, we'd like you to specify which findings you can't make and for the reasons you've enunciated, in which case, you know, the motion would be to uphold the'",
        "'speaker_6': 'appeal for reasons independently reviewed by the City Council. These weren't raised in the appeal, but you do have because it's a de novo hearing. You do have the ability doesn't. Decide if it's a council's will that that one or more of the required findings has not been met.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then with regard to the parking waiver, can we take a vote this evening or does it need to be a straw vote and, you know, of direction?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So the resolution that's in your packet tonight is in staff's recommendation is to deny the appeal and approve the project. We don't have a resolution prepared that reflects these these considerations that have been brought up this evening. So if that's.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If the council if there's a motion in a second which there has been to move in the opposite direction of staff's recommendation, what we'd ask you to do is take a straw vote. And if that motion passes, you would direct staff to return at the next regularly scheduled meeting with a resolution that has the appropriate findings that'",
        "'speaker_6': 'reflect your discussion tonight.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we'll do that both for design and then for parking waiver, because I think we have some I think we have some concurrence on the parking waiver issue. I think.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's a.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Do we need to make them all in together?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think you could do it together. You could.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And you know why I think we can't? Because I can hear three. I can count. And I've got three votes in support of the design review. But I. I don't have. But I don't think if the design review were in there, that two of my colleagues would join in.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So can we bifurcate those?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I think to uphold the appeal, you can base it on either not being able to make the design review findings or not being able to make the parking waiver findings. You know that you're finding that the planning board erred somewhere, made a mistake somewhere by making all these findings.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'My sense is I think the council is going to say that they do uphold.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Plan. I think it's just my sense that they're going to uphold the planning board's parking waiver. So. And I want to just hear from my colleague, Ms.. Vella. You're going to say something.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Earlier, the vice mayor had said that he thinks that there's a fix, pretty easy fix relative to just treating parking in general.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Do you?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yeah. So I'm just wondering, rather than do a straw poll, I mean, I'm just saying, if it's going, I'm fine, you know, basically upholding the the parking waiver. I just think that in general, we need to look at that, what we're doing with parking.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think that that's something that we could perhaps separately agenda as at a future meeting and address since we all have input and ideas and perhaps since this is already going back to the planning board on a design review issue, that that there's going to be leeway there, further leeway that they could discuss relative to the design'",
        "'speaker_8': 'and what what they might be able to get on those tradeoffs. So if that's possible.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah. What I what I would suggest is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To read.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That if there's three votes to uphold the appeal on the basis of design, that you take that vote. And then separately, if you want the planning commission, while is reviewing the design aspect to look at the parking issue more generally, then take a vote on that to direct the Planning Commission to look at that in context of'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the. Of reviewing that design review, not in context, but as part of that review. I think that's what Council Member Valdes saying.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right. But I mean, I also want to be clear that, yeah, that's bifurcating because then will vote on the parking waiver next. That's what you said, isn't it?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, essentially, your if I'm hearing correctly, that the parking waiver is not really at issue, but there seems to be a a feeling that the whole parking the parking issue more generally needs to be discussed at the Planning Commission level because there's concern about the way it is, about the way it's currently written.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, Miss Chen.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And here's an idea. What I heard Councilmember Avila say is that the the parking waiver may not be an issue to the council. And I think what you could do in the motion is if the council is going this way, the council could approve the parking waiver because that's under your consideration right now.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And first and also send, you know, say that you can't meet one or more of the design review findings and remand to the planning board for that purpose only.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It sounds like two votes to me.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Question.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, sorry.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Maybe that's a.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Comment. I'm sorry. But I think there was also some concern raised by more than three of us on the transit component and, you know, the Ryan chair. So the thing is, I don't want to relitigate the parking so or I don't want the planning board to have to relitigate the parking when they reevaluate this.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So if there's a wait staff that we could do that and perhaps I mean, assuming every there's a majority, please tell us.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I'm if I'm hearing you correctly, so we could approve the parking waiver, but ask that it be augmented.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'By.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Certain suggestions that were made by my colleagues.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I think for me, look, this is I think we're making this all more complicated and needs to be. What I'm hearing is there's three of you who at least three of you who are wanting to go back to the planning board for to look at the design of the project.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That's what I mean. You haven't voted yet, but that's what I'm hearing. I'm hearing that a number of you are also interested in having the planning board relook at the ride share aspect, not the parking numbers, just the ride share aspect and how that's going to work.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And you can just tell us that and will tell the planning board that. I'm also hearing that there's a majority of you were like, don't miss what you did on the parking and the waiver for the six of you spaces is fine.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'What what Salena is suggesting is if one of you were to make that vote and make that motion sort of in those terms, if if it's clear that there's three of you who support sending it back with those directions, you've closed the public hearing tonight.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'What we would like to do is then come back with a resolution that is written to reflect what you just said, hopefully will, or that you voted at your next meeting. So then we'll have it actually articulated in writing for you to approve on consent.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'In the meantime, we can start working with the planning board and tell them why it's coming back and specifically what the council wants.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To look at.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And again, I'm probably getting a little laggy here, but. Two different votes on that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I think you can just reticulated it that way and you can make a motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But we have one motion window.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Why don't you do it? I mean, because I do hear there is sort of a difference of opinion. So why don't you do the design aspect? Get that out of the way. And then if there's a desire for the planning board to look at the ride share issue, then make a separate motion to do that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Point of inquiry.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Council Member.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So if, if, if the majority of council are going to find that the design review is questionable and on that grounds, basically they're going to send it back, don't we have to have particular findings that constitute the parameters of what the problem is with design review?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, not necessarily. I mean, if you can't make the required findings that's know, it's sort of the end of the issue if there are particular aspects of it other than what's been articulated. Yeah, that would be helpful. But you don't necessarily have to articulate you don't have to be the architect on the the project.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah, I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Know that that is helpful. Yeah. I think some of the things that I mean, it's paying attention to the second and third required findings and your design review and again concern with the streamline return architecture and also maybe even the earth tone and colors that fin.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I just think it needs another look to be more consistent with the second and third findings and your design review. So I do think we had a motion in a second to send the project back on design review.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So all in favor. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Discretion.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Vice Mayor, I want to ask your question really quickly about the North Park Street plan. Has design guidelines a streamline moderne, one of those? Yes. So I just I would just like I am not going to be supportive about this, but I think it would be fair to the applicant if it's going to get sent back that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that there be really specific, like what what do we want to see? Because we have a whole design guideline booklet that says, here's what you're allowed to do and we'll pull from this design language booklet. Oh, we're going to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You're good. And I think it's I honestly think it's a little if the problem is we don't like the way they've done the the streamlined model. And I think that's one thing. But I think it's a little problematic that we're going to send this back without really specific streamlined doesn't work on this site because of this reason'",
        "'speaker_2': '. And so therefore we'd like to see one of the other things that we've already done all the work around to decide. Well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So there is.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'If I go away and I think it doesn't I think it doesn't work because of the size of the building relative to what's around it and the fact that they're it's a very abrupt design to kind of walk into.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And that's what I've heard the mayor say, is essentially that there's other there's other design options that are nearby that might better kind of fit in terms of. Building into the fabric of the street. And part of the two other points, two and three, are specific to that in terms of streamlining and fitting in with the overall'",
        "'speaker_8': 'neighboring buildings.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I will just tag on to say that there might be a streamlined moderne building for that site that would work better. I just find the design very stark and just that's what looks that's what I was calling nondescript and out of place.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think it's improvable.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So with that, we've had a motion in a second. All in favor.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I, I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. The motion passes 3 to 2. Yeah. Three to that was a 3 to 2. Right. Okay. And now do I have the motion to approve the parking waiver and perhaps with some conditions for it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Do we can I ask a question quickly? Do we have to the parking waivers approved? We don't have to approve.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Correct. I thought the issue was if there were.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Other.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Aspects such as the ride share or other parts of it that you want the commission, the board to look at, that would be the appropriate motion at this point. I think the waiver is is off the table.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Right. So so I move that we we as a part of the design review, a quick review, a review of the TDM program that relies less on tanks and more on public transit and and multi person shuttles as well as bike share, etc. In align with our climate goals which we declared an emergency today, be a part'",
        "'speaker_2': 'of that as well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That would be an appropriate motion.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Would you bring. I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so we have discussion. Mr. Brody.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm sorry. Would you be willing to, instead of saying just tenses, tenses and automobiles.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I'm sorry, tenses.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Being.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Uber and Lyft.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What's it? Stanford tents.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'British, generic Japanese. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And automobiles. Automobiles, I mean. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Wait. So what is it we're saying?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So. So we are asking them to re re.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Reassess.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This plan with less emphasis on transportation network companies and automobiles as a way to get to and more reliance on multiple person vehicles, public transit and bicycles in a line in compliance with our or in alignment with our climate goals.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So adding more more options than just the.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Couple that were presented.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They were just going to pay for you to get over it. We're not saying you can't take over. I personally I'm not saying you can't take Uber and Lyft to or from the airport. I'm saying we should not tell the hotel they are required to provide that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We should tell the hotel you can provide free transit. If somebody wants to take a ride.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They'll do it in Saint Petersburg.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Because I think we want to encourage people to come out the front door and walk down the street.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right. But not from the Oakland airport.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Right. All right. And then we have the hours. I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Can I have just a quick point and then what it might be helpful to have? And this is not going to be part of the motion, but if staff could come back with some update on the shuttle, because I have been hearing questions on why we haven't had any update on that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So let's try to take that. That's another. Yeah, that's another. Okay. Yeah. That. Okay. Okay. We have a motion. We have a second. All in favor.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Wait, wait. Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'One more.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thing. And also, when we're looking at the rideshares that there be a specific designated safe drop off space in the in the parking lot, that it's not that basically because otherwise what happens is the rideshare companies will drop off right in front and that's just not safe.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We could have a very.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Good point and perhaps I think there's a way that the hotel can list its location actually on the side street, which is Buena Vista way to us, too, so that when it comes when it comes up in rideshare, that's where the rider goes rather than we don't really want to encourage double parking on Park Street, I would'",
        "'speaker_0': 'imagine.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. All right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Shall we try this again?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sure.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'On these machines spin segment. All in favor, I.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'All right. Well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Opposed and opposed. Sorry. And when opposed? When opposed. Okay. But the motion passes for the. The resolution.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Coming back.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So that was a.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'No, no, no, no.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But what you need from us is to, um. What do you. What you need from us is that to bring it to you, because the resolution has to come back to us with these items in it and.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Your vote on it. And that point, you know, to be on the consent calendar and you can vote, you know, I'm voting no on this on content calendar item three. Well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I, I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Think, Madam.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Clerk, I'm sorry we kind of pout about this a little earlier and we were thinking is since you've closed this public hearing, if you continue this item to that April 2nd date consent calendar, could we.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Not say that?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You didn't say you continue to thinking, sorry. I was technically looking for in the motion that that was what you meant. Okay. Which she said didn't hear it. Yes. So and okay, so you're continuing this public hearing to the resolution.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Do you want an amended motion or. No, no, no.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I just didn't hear it specifically stated in the motion was concerned. So my that just a no.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No. All right. Thanks, everybody. Thank you, everyone, for who came out. Yes, sir. Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I wanted everything. So I. I understand your concern about, like, not having the the the project. Add requirements at the end, but I would like to see something come back to us that we can discuss that talks about the future of development on Park Street and Webster Street, that it does include the ground floor, retail and commercial'",
        "'speaker_5': 'and then residential. If my colleagues don't have a problem with that.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Hello. Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Good evening, Madam Mayor and council members. I'm Eleanor Dyer, finance director. And tonight we are going to discuss mid-year budget update for current fiscal year 1819. I'm going to be trying to be fairly brief, but I am going to ask to possibly hold your questions in at the end of which section we'll be able to have.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We will do that.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Questions and answers. Well, okay, quickly, what we're trying to accomplish today. One, provide you with an update of a general fund financial projections through the end of this fiscal year, review, pension and OPEB funding status, as well as discussed mid-year budget amendments, requests from not just general fund programs but other programs outside of the general fund action'",
        "'speaker_10': '. In the end we would like to take is, as you know, there are three resolutions that we would like to ask you to approve if you agree and moving on with some of the highlights. So definitely we will start with General Fund and give you a little more details on some revenues.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The revenues are still coming in fairly strong and again, part of it is our property tax are doing well, but our transfer tax is doing just as well, not as good as last year. It's actually reduced a little bit.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But for this year's budget, it's actually 13% of our total budget for general fund. Last year it was only 10%. So a word of caution. It's fairly volatile revenue, more of a one time type of revenue. So when we consider how we plan on budgeting for it going forward, we just need to be cautious.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Mid-Year operating expenditures request. As I mentioned, it's for general fund and other programs as well, including capital. And we'll look at CalPERS and OPEB assumptions on the revenue side. Overall, our current year revenue are projected to be at about $96 million.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That includes the increase for this midyear update of about $5 million. As I mentioned before, the big part. Almost half of this $5 million is actually coming from transfer tax. And again, those were two particular parcels or two transactions that happened that amounted for those two as just kind of an update I looked at at the time'",
        "'speaker_10': ', we even still currently we only have revenues for transfer tax received from the county through January. And if we compare same time period of this fiscal year, July through January versus last fiscal year, July through January of transfer tax, generally it declined in the transactions that happened more frequently, which is under $20,000.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So we did have these two transactions at the higher value and we're increasing the budget for it, but they are slowing down a little. The other revenues that are presented here, a third of our budget is property taxes and anything related to property taxes, which are motor vehicle license fees as well, is a pass through tax increment'",
        "'speaker_10': 'from redevelopment agency. Sales tax is budgeted. AD Exactly same flat amount. You will see, however, that we do an increase on a different type of sales tax that's been recently approved as a transaction and use tax in everything else generally stayed the same.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'To focus a little bit on the property tax. Annual citywide growth for 1819 was 8% in prior years. Traditionally it's been in the past four years before then. It's about 6% growth. Now, this is a reminder. This is city wide.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'This is not general fund. General fund specific. The increase was about 7% in RDA or successor agency related areas were actually up 11%. The property tax, as I mentioned earlier, includes three different components. Our regular property tax that we collect the residual tax increment that comes in from redevelopment and then VLF.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So the increase for 1819 budget is really a component of those three and the total of those is $1.1 million that we're projecting to increase the budget for the revenue compared to the mid-cycle update when it happened in June 2018 and the council back then approved at.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'As I mentioned, sales tax we're projecting to be flat for this year at $10.4 million. We're not projecting to make any changes at midyear for that revenue source. This particular slide is not the sales tax that we normally talk about, which is 1%.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Brad Burns This is a transaction and use tax that was approved by the voters in November of 2018 and it will be effective April one. It's a little bit challenging to estimate what the revenue would be from this particular tax.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Reason is it's applied differently than a sales tax, even though it's collected. At the same time, the application is a little different. For example, 1% Bradley Burns is based on the origin of the transaction, where transaction and use tax is based on where the goods are received.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'A good example would be cars. You will go and buy the car in a different city, for example, and you will pay the transaction and use tax that is applicable to Alameda and the city will receive that particular tax will receive it.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'For example, if someone comes in from out of town and decides to buy some groceries at the store, they will regardless where they live, they will pay it here. Bradley Burns as well as transaction and use tax. We decided to be a little bit more conservative in increasing the budget for 1819 for the transaction use tax and'",
        "'speaker_10': 'only estimating $100,000 for the period from April to June, particularly because we expect some of the vendors are going to be taking a little bit of time to figure out that they still have to collect it, even though the state will reach out and make sure provide them with the letter saying this is the new tax.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Traditionally, it's been a little bit, at least from the surveys that we've heard. Other organizations, it will take time to adjust. On top of that, we don't know because we have such a large base for business to business transactions, including our consultants.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We could not necessarily precisely estimate if the transaction, the use tax will be collected on those transactions again, because it's applied a little bit different and we don't necessarily know for our sales tax producers business to business if that is going to be an origin or is an actual destination here in Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'On a transfer tax. We kind of talked about it a little bit already. Again, we're increasing it for the two transactions that happened. And you will see that originally mid-cycle year, a little under a year ago, we've adopted it at $10.3 million.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We're projecting currently 12 and a half million dollars. It's still, as I mentioned before, generates significant revenue. 13% of our budget is transfer tax. However, again, word of caution, it is a volatile revenue and more of a one time type of revenue.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Program revenue adjustments. These are more specific to each individual departments that are being collected through fees or specific activities that are done by the departments. There's a few. Fire department, mutual aid. Mutual aid is your car fires where we actually send out our staff to go and assist.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We are expecting a department is expecting a little over half a million dollars in reimbursements. That includes staffing, services and supplies as well as usage of some of the vehicles that they had to take out of that amount.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'You will also see that it's actually is offset by the overtime that they had to use in order to perform that work. Additional revenue is ambulance related fees. We're seeing that the trend, how much we've been receiving is a little higher as well as ground emergency medical transportation that's going up.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Total for those to 295,000. And the other net that's listed in the attachment that actually provides a detail, but it's really is reduction in the false alarm fees for fire, $85,000, an increase of approximately $85,000 for the fire prevention revenues.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So the net effect is zero, but one is up and one is down on a police. Same thing. Mutual aid. We had to send the staff over to, I believe it was Sonoma where they assisted. I believe it was also on the news.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Same thing. We're increasing the revenue the department already received full amount and we do know that dollar amount, which is $85,000. One of the bigger items that we're reducing is the animal license fees. Since fees primarily we've budgeted a full amount of 150.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We're not expecting to collect really anything in 1819, partially due to the staffing issues that we've had to try and get somebody on board to actually start up the program. We are expecting at this point the department has hired somebody and the person has been working on this program for quite a while and expecting to send out'",
        "'speaker_10': 'to Billings and actually realize the revenues for next year. There were some other miscellaneous revenue changes in the fire and police department related to overtime reimbursements and some fingerprinting fees that for net in total were about $8,000 in departmental revenues between city clerk and finance are up about 18,000.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'This is just a quick summary. What we budgeted in June of 18 is $5.9 million with the current revenues updates for program revenue. Specifically, we're expecting about 6.7 million. This provides you this slide, provide your full recap of just the revenues.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Again, property taxes going up, transfer tax transaction, use tax franchise fees. I did not have a separate slide on it, but really reality of that is our cable is trending down mainly. You probably know that a lot of people switching from, let's say, watching cable to Hulu and things like that, and therefore we're not getting as much'",
        "'speaker_10': 'in terms of franchise fees. It also includes a small portion for the PGE and the bankruptcy. We receive couple of sources of revenues from PGE in one as utility user tax, which is a true pass through. So we do not expect any changes in that because all they do is they collect and disburse it to us with'",
        "'speaker_10': 'a franchise fees. That's one of the sources that is potential that in a bankruptcy would be a claim and therefore we may not receive it. So we're reducing it just as an estimate of $50,000 for that transfer in.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'You're all aware we've built our EOC in the fire station three. We had an open house for those. The construction is complete and what we are seeing is that general fund put up some money to build those particular projects and we believe we're going to be about $241,000 that we've contributed more than needed, and therefore, it's going'",
        "'speaker_10': 'to be returned back to the general fund purposes. So that's revenue. So before going into the expenditures, are there any questions related to the revenues?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I had a question and the question.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I forgot.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It. So sorry. Okay. Let's see here.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We can all hold that.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That's fine. We'll come back to it if necessary. For the time being, I'm just going to move on. On to the expenditures. Oops.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Oh, yes. The question was, you had three components to the property taxes. You had the one called the ordinary. Then you had the.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And VLF.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The that the VLF the VLF is is that the trade that for the VLF that we gave up, we were getting property taxes back.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So that's correct. So sometime ago and I want to say in early 2000, the state took away motor vehicle fees from the cities, but instead they put them in as a property tax. So that now grows with the property tax.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That increases and we collect that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. So it's not VLF property tax per se. It's it's property tax actual.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But VLF is kind of the place we use to explain it. Okay, great.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you. Any expenditures? As you will see, the biggest components is going to be public safety, police and fire. But what you also see in here was showing a trend of four years, 15, 16, 16, 17 is fairly flat.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Reality is, 16, 17 actually had about $3 million in vacancy savings or labor savings. So if we were to put it in a budgetary terms, that number would have been higher. But in the actual terms, it ended up being somewhat flat compared to 15, 16, 17, 18 has a huge jump.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Part of the jump is actually something I want to focus on since we put in quite a bit of money for one time type of expenditures which were capital, were put in money for jeans, 20 park license plate readers.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Our ERP project, which is the financial system, so was money a one time money using a one time sources that we've invested in our infrastructure and other capital items? The big component you will see is also pension and OPEB reserve.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'What we call it overall from general fund would put up $16 million in 1718 and there was an accumulation of several years of money. With the Council's policy that was adopted, we'll put in 16 million in total between direct down payment with CalPERS, as well as putting some money into our OPEB and Pension 115 trust, which is'",
        "'speaker_10': 'in the revocable trust for those specific purposes. I can tell you that with direct paydown with CalPERS, it saved us in this current year, 18, 19, a little over $1,000,000 in our PERS payments. So thanks to the policy that Council adopted and putting up and making an effort to actually pay down those liabilities, we are realizing the'",
        "'speaker_10': 'savings already.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So a little bit of an update on the CalPERS pension and funding status. You may have seen this last year somewhat similar. I actually included three years worth or ten years of CalPERS to show where the funding levels were and where we are now and shows both the safety plan as well as your miscellaneous plans.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The safety plan is obviously the biggest issue for us for General Fund. It's all funded by General Fund. And as you can see, in 2007, we actually had in that particular plan 91% of assets to fund the full liability.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'In a five year period, it dropped to 73%. And then currently, this is the most current valuation we have from CalPERS, where at 59%, the state average is actually 65%, actually 69%. So we're 10% below what the overall state average for just the safety plans is.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'One of the reasons why is in our safety plans, we actually have more retirees than we actually have active participants. So that is driving our unfunded liability much lower compared to other agencies in California. Kate, miscellaneous plan, as you will see, ten years ago was actually overfunded.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We were at 105% and then it dropped down to 89 and then 73. The average for miscellaneous plan across the entire state is 72%. So we actually within that area combined safety miscellaneous over just a five year period for unfunded liability, it actually has gone up $142 million.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So if you compare the liability of 2012 versus 20 1417, it went up $142 million.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'll have a question on that, but it's fine.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The general fund component and you will see on the slide we've presented is unfunded liability is 201 million. It's 100% on the safety and it's only a third of the miscellaneous. We have other programs that are outside of general fund, which also include sewer and AMP that contribute and pay for their employees.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So what you see here outside of General Fund Box is city wide. General Fund specifically relates to just the general fund component. One of the things I just want to mention is and we've said that before, we did not makes any changes necessarily to our process.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Part of the reason why we seen this unfunded liability is because CalPERS is changing their policies and changing their assumptions. We've always paid the bills that we paid. The CalPERS presented to us. They all been paid. But because of those changes, that's what's going on with our unfunded liabilities.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And this is really for the services of employees that already happened in the past. Just as a reminder on pension and funding policy. So the policy is we have a couple of close plans. So anything unused, we froze it at 1516 balances.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And anything that we do not actually spend on those pensioners goes into payment of pension. The other big component is the general fund. So 50% of available balance from a prior year. We always look at it in hindsight in a way in arrears above the 25% set reserve and was set by council.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We actually committed to pension and OPEB. As you can see in prior years. We put in quite a lot of money in June of 2018. We've estimated what we thought we will be putting in for 1819 year, which was six point close to $8 million.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Today we're actually presenting it to you and we're saying the actual number based on 1718 actuals is $7.9 billion. So we've done better. Partially, again, because we had either unspent services and supplies or vacancies savings that now drop to the bottom line and create a difference.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'In one of the attachments we presented, we are projecting our 1819 fund balance and based on that front balance, we believe it will be about three and a half million dollars that we may be able to contribute towards pension and OPEB in the 1920 year, but we won't actually appropriate those funds until the audit is completed for'",
        "'speaker_10': '1819 and then we will bring it back to council likely at mid-year again. Councilmember member previously have asked a number of times to include the account balances in both the pension and OPEB. And so this slide is actually presenting what has happened.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It does not include current year appropriate current appropriation that we're asking you to approve. So as I've mentioned, direct pay down to CalPERS last year was $10.7 million. We've also contributed money into Pars, which is the one six and 115 trust.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It has more money in total. The balance in that account, which includes employee contributions, is $15.6 million as of January 31st. That's the most current information we had available at the time of publishing. We have received some in the February statements and now at $16 million.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Big drop was actually in October, November timeframe when the market went down. But that's the balances as of right now. And the total that the city contributed outside of the requirements by the mill use was $17 million, over $17 million.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So this is a quick recap of general fund expenditures and what we're asking council to approve. I do see that there's an error on this slide for a grand total amount. So it's $5.5 million. It's actually $10 million.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That's over ten you got. So economic development, we are requesting $88,000. This amount was actually a blue approved last year in March of 2018 to allocate for homeless type of programs. The staff finally got all the programs going and now ready for payment and contracts to encumber the funds.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And so we have to reappropriate those monies. Fire department net total for all the expenditures, $476,000. Again, this includes the overtime of about $318,000 for all the mutual aid. And then there's also an additional money for services and supplies that they are experiencing increases in, which includes utilities for the city clerk.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That's one big amount. We have an April 9th special election. The dollar amount from the county actually ranged all the way to $740,000 and the low part was 580. What kind of went with a mid level? So we'll see what the actual number is going to come in.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'You'll also see that we are putting in some capital projects contributions, about $1,000,000 for that and there are several projects there we are asking to fund there. Again, one time type of money and a large component is the pension OPEB reserve contribution of $7.9 million out of the general fund.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'With that, I am going to take questions on expenditures and pension OPEB.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'As I know, Councilmember Vella had one to ask something.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It's going back to page 12 of the slide on the CalPERS pension funding status. Lina, I mean, obviously you made the comment about the safety split in terms of the retirees versus the actives. What's the impact of the pepper new hires on that?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Actually, as of right now in terms of safety overall. So and that includes police and fire together. We only have 25 participants that are pepper employees, so we only have 25 and we have 150 actives. So our active is 175, but we have 260 retirees.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Can you give those numbers again? You said we have 25 peprah.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Yes. That's the new tier. Yes. For safety, 150 classic.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'One for the classic. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And 260 retirees.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So the 175 are supporting the 260?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And how many vacancies do we have?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Well, not really supporting.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I am actually not aware to say how many we have specifically in each department. So I, I do not know that information right off the top of my head. We do have some department heads here that maybe will be able to assist us with that and perhaps our H.R. director.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But I'm not sure if we were per se prepared for that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Our customers is currently in fire. We have 11 sworn vacancies and one civilian vacancy.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And it can fluctuate from day to day. But I think employees were at about ten vacancies.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'One of the things I do want to mention, though, with the unfunded liability component for prior service, not the normal cost, which is for the current employees that are currently here working, but for the ones that are already retired.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'CalPERS got pretty smart over the years and so instead of actually charging it as a percentage of payroll that used to happen, they now provide a flat dollar amount. So it doesn't really matter now how many active positions we have filled.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'They just provide us with a dollar amount and say you need to pay it regardless. How many people are actually filling current positions?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But we also only have 150 classic employees remaining in that in that division.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Correct out of 175.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Desai.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Councilmember Vela, are you finished?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh, I'm sorry, I. I didn't mean to cut you off where you. So, I mean.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I was just saying that we only have 150 classics kind of remaining. It's not out of 175 would be out of out of whatever plus the vacancies.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Well, no, the CalPERS actually looks at it as.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Only as.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It would have been two years ago, because the valuation is of 2017. CalPERS is always behind. Mm hmm. So they're actually looking from two years ago, and I'm not sure what the vacancy rate would have been back then.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Yeah. So then Councilmember Desai.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So two points on this chart. I think the thing that really concerns me is and I heard your explanation as to what's driving the miscellaneous the increase in the read portion of the of the bar chart there, particularly for miscellaneous 2017.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I heard your explanation. I think it's it is still concerning because, you know, when you look at the miscellaneous retirement formula, I mean, is it still 2.0 at 55 or.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Something for the classic?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yeah. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And then and with the pepper, I believe it's 2% and 62.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yeah. So the retirement formula, I mean, from if you're, you know, penny pinching type of person, you like that retirement formula. So to see such a favorable retirement formula still resulting in an increase in the and the read portion of that bar chart, that's concerning.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I mean, on the flip side, that's why I understand why, you know, the read portion on the public safety, you know, in my opinion, the retirement formula is a challenge. So that that certainly explains, you know, 50, 73% number of 59% number that you're seeing.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But but it is concerning to see the red increasing edging up there on the miscellaneous. I hear that it's you know, we're at the we're at the state average or slightly above the state average of 72. It's still is because the underlying formula is from a penny pinchers perspective, the underlying retirement formula is favorable.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The second point that I want to raise is, you know. Seems as though we now have a policy where some portion of the of the reserve above 25% is dedicated to OPEB and and retirement. I certainly want to find out a little bit more about that, because if I'm doing my math, you know, part of what's driving'",
        "'speaker_7': 'the reserve conceivably could be holding down expenses on on the vacancy side. Right. So to the extent that you have revenues coming in, but you're holding down expenses on the expenditure shy because you're not filling vacancies, well then that's going to.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Wouldn't that drive up the reserves mathematically so.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It would I wouldn't consider them as as holding. To be perfectly honest, I think every single department is trying to hire aggressively. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But but to the extent that they're not hiring. The reality is there is there is not actual dollars being expended. So that mathematically means that the reserve the revenue side is going to be more than the than the expenditure side.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And so it's a one time, one time revenue, if you choose, because it may not repeat itself again in the next year.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Year by year in, year out, certain departments I think have had unfilled positions and so, so on the expenditure. So I think you get where I'm getting at. And so if the formula then for what to do with what's, what is so-called excess reserve is then being.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So there's a certain concerns there that I think we should probably talk about and certainly revisit the the math formula that results in how we divvy up the excess reserve beyond 25%. That's that's my sense, just so. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Q I'm Counselor Vice Mayor Knox White.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sorry, I honestly didn't follow. I understand that you're.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You have I.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Understand the math you're doing. I'm not understanding why it's an issue.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's an issue because you have revenues coming in and oh.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I didn't know whether this was the time to ask questions of you, but you're asking of councilmember.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'From what I from what I'm looking at. You have revenues coming in, which is all good. And you also have on the expenditure side, you have staff people for whom you are, you have expenses right in their actual expenses because we're cutting people checks and they're, you know, and which is good, obviously.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And we also have other expenses, not non staff related expenses. But by the same token, on the expense side, we also have all these unfilled positions. So to the extent that you have unfilled positions, you're not expending as much as perhaps you should because because the fire department is down ten, police department is down ten.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So the revenue side is here and the and the and the expenditure side is here and that results in a surplus. So then the formula of the surplus then is to say some portion of that surplus then goes circles back into as into the OPEB trust.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But that surplus that some portion of that surplus would not be there had we been filling the positions. So that's, that's what I'm getting at. So it might be a readjustment to the formula. That's all I'm getting at.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I'm going to chime in because I was one of the people that brought this suggestion to the council and they adopted it. And it came from attending a League of California Cities meeting that was focused on helping cities pay down their open and CalPERS liabilities.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And one of the things we looked at and again, everything's relative. We've been in some strong years and so we looked at our budget and we had a lot of surplus. And I want to say it was my colleague Frank Materazzi who said, Why are we just sitting on all this surplus?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But of course you want you want a safety net and you have to have your rainy day fund. But we established that 25% was a pretty good reserve. And then anything above that and sometimes it's that one time windfall from a, you know, a large property transaction.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I get what you're saying, Councilmember Desai, that some of it's there because we didn't spend all the money allocated. But the point being we never can afford to lose track of the fact that we've got this growing, looming CalPERS and OPEB liability that we I, you know, feel we have a moral obligation to pay our retirees.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'As you know, we've contracted with them. But more seriously, when we come to the lean years and I just think we have to expect that we will hit a recession at some point there. So right now, as Ms..'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Adair pointed out, we are saving on by paying down in advance our CalPERS balance. We have saved up to $1,000,000 a year. And I forget when you look over the seven. Over time. It's pretty impressive what we've saved.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So that's good. But also the trust fund is important because the CalPERS money we pay directly to CalPERS, the trust fund we put in into that lockbox, but it's there when we might come to that time when our city can't afford to pay the bill that comes due for CalPERS.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we've got that rainy day fund. So I just think I think we sock it away. Well, first of all, it's a council policy because we voted on it. But I think we just keep socking away that percentage as much as we can.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And and then, you know, we're prepared better prepared for that rainy day at the same time. And I've used this analogy, you can't dig out of a hole with a shovel, you know, on the one side while you're shoveling the dirt back in on the other, which just means we have to be extremely careful about whenever we're'",
        "'speaker_0': 'adding to that OPEB liability. But that was they just didn't see that. I'm just having money sitting in a reserve, about 25% made sense.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So let me try to frame this. Why I think it's important as fast as possible to on the expenditure side, to have the right expenditures, because if you don't have the right expenditures reflecting the amount of staffing that you need, what you're saying, what you're doing is you're shortchanging the current residents from the amount of services that'",
        "'speaker_7': 'they need. With regard to the staffing, in an effort to put the revenues of the reserves that's generated by by the two in an effort to put the reserves towards, you know, post-employment things which you understand, understandably you have to do, but we can't systematically keep under under serving the residents.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So it's getting late right now. And I think we're just rate I'm just raising concepts and I think we will flush it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Out again, immature in the form of it and miss it as well in just a minute. But I just want to say, I, I, I'm, I'm taken aback by the characterization of shortchanging our residents. Neither the police chief nor the fire chief is saying, I'm not going to hire this many more firefighters because I want a budget'",
        "'speaker_0': 'savings. And and we know that will go to pay down CalPERS debt year after year. They try to fill their open positions. And what happens I know, you know, talking to the police chief and fire that they've got folks coming through the academy, folks training, that's good.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They come on board. But then there's these retirees that, you know, keep keep going out the door. So, Miss Vella, were you going to speak to that?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I would. So my questions were really just to understand, because she had said that we have more retirees than we do actives. And to just understand that breakdown, it wasn't to suggest that essentially we're keeping our expenditures artificially low by holding open vacancies.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I don't think that that's happening at all. And I think when you look at the number of vacancies that we're talking about, it's a very small percentage and they're in two departments that have a very hard time recruiting because they also have to put people through academy and they have to do background checks.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It's it's it's very involved process. So it's not like you can just hire somebody off the street tomorrow and say, okay, you're a police officer or firefighter now. But, but I did you know, I do kind of want to go back to the the chart that we talked about that's on the screen.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Essentially, what you're saying is that the big spikes have come from the new discount rates that CalPERS have put out because they've gotten smart about how they're billing us, essentially. And they're they're billing us. It's that flat rate that they're giving us.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And it has nothing to do with the vacancies or the number of held over positions or anything.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'No. And partially because of they've changed their assumptions, as I mentioned, which includes discount rate. It includes how long people live. It includes all the losses that they, you know. Yes. Passing. Now, that happened in the last recession.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'With that, they now figure it out. Well, maybe they shouldn't invest in certain type of, you know, investments that they make. So as part of all of those changes and also over the time period that they end up amortizing their losses, their assumption changes in terms of demographics and things like that.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'They've shortened them partially because they're trying to be fiduciary responsible and saying in order for us to pay all of these retirees that are here, we really need to get that money, which makes an impact on all the cities or agencies that are participating with CalPERS.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And in two, part of the change was because they weren't recovering as much as they were actuarially planning through percentage of payroll. They instead went in and said, okay, we know we need this number. For this year. Pay it.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And that's a flat amount from starting about two years ago. And so the city has to pay a flat amount regardless how many employees you have. And unfortunately, that amount is going to continue to grow for us. Councilmember de Sok was not here last year when we did have a presentation of a bell curve when it goes'",
        "'speaker_10': 'to 2031, I believe, and it continues to rise. And at that point in time, we said even in a five year period between what we have paid, if we froze what we said we were going to pay CalPERS for general fund alone, an additional amount over a five year period was $35 million just within five years.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So for us, that is the full wall of debt that we are trying to deal with and the cash flow that we have to assume and cover in. However, whether it's five years or 20 years in this case, in pay for those obligations and still maintain the ability for us to provide services.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And so with the prepayment, we're trying to shave off that top of that bell curve so that we don't have to cut it as much in as many services. It may be possible, I don't know. I cannot tell you going 15, ten years from now what it's going to happen.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But our goal is to not have that occurred. So we do have a budget and a part of it is to drive those pension costs down.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I'm just going to make a little this is a commercial to my colleagues that I and this is something I've also gotten from League of California Cities. It's important for us as council members to monitor what CalPERS is doing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They have monthly board meetings in Sacramento and where, for instance, they will decide things like what mix of types of investments are in the CalPERS portfolio. They've traditionally been very conservative and maybe they need to move away a little from that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Obviously, none of us are CalPERS board members, but, you know, people can show up, they can speak. And then last year I attended this is the first time CalPERS did a session for elected officials at its annual conference.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I was down in the desert somewhere for that. But this year the conference is in Oakland. So when we find out when I'll find out what the date is, and I would just encourage folks to show up for the the session for elected officials, because we need a better understanding of all the different ways that other'",
        "'speaker_0': 'cities. We're doing a lot of good things, but you can always learn what other cities are doing too. So other questions, concerns, discussion. Councilmember Day So I just want.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'To quickly say I didn't mean to say that the department heads are holding it down. I mean, that that's I mean, I don't know how to elegantly say it at this hour. So I just want to make sure to say that I'm not saying that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But what I am saying, though, the effect of that, though, is something to, you know, for us to really think about. It's not done on purpose. But but the effect of it is, is we have to review that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Odie.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'll just add my $0.02 because I was here when we adopted that policy. And I think the mayor's recollection is pretty accurate. I mean, we do get I think what Ms.. Bello was trying to mention is that, you know, as we go forward, we're going to have more employees on Peprah than we are on classics.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So just by the nature of that and the lower benefits that and over time we are going to see that bell curve eventually drop. And I thought we were pretty prudent when we decided if we had an excessive amount of we use that word, excessive amount of reserves that rather than just sit there, we would actually put'",
        "'speaker_5': 'it to work. And by putting it to work, we've saved the million dollars a year in purrs. And we've also, you know, put it aside that when we do have a shortfall or we have an economic downturn, you know, we're able to say we can pull from this to pay some of our liability instead of cutting officers'",
        "'speaker_5': 'on the street or closing a fire station or any of those those options, which just are not very palatable to us. And, you know, one thing I have noticed, and I think this is the fifth year, you know, our revenues always seem to be underestimated and our expenses seem to be overestimated.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So that's just a comment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, it's called being conservative, which is the way I would want it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But I prefer to be accurate. I mean, because I mean, I just prefer to be more accurate if we can get that way.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You know what?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You raise Mary Knox ways.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No, no, no, no. I have no more comments on the here. 50% of 24 over 25% reserve fire operations. The mutual aid. For some reason, I thought when we go and do work for the state that is reimbursed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sorry. This is just new guy on the council. So this $318,000 of mutual aid overtime incurred during the car and campfires, isn't that something we get reimbursed for? These are changing that because we won't get reimbursed until next fiscal year or.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We are getting reimbursed hands were recognizing the revenue from mutual aid for fire. And if you look on the revenue side, we're bringing in over half a million dollars for fire specifically and $85,000 for PD in those reimbursements from the state.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But not all of those reimbursements are all overtime. It includes other components to it, which includes the equipment that they take with them.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Correct. So part of that 550 figure is including the overtime of the personnel that we do send. It includes vehicle charges on the vehicles, our own city vehicles that we send, and also our city's overhead rate, which is on top of that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Some reason I'm having a hard time finding the 550 in the staff report. Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. 12:30 a.m.. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The first exhibit, if you want to just look at the numbers, the very first exhibit for the fire department. Under program revenues, you will see 550,000 and corresponding expense increase of 318. 318 is your overtime side of it.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It's just i think it's prudent to actually give the department their share of overtime that they've incurred. Otherwise it will put them over budget, which is not fair because they actually are bringing in the revenue.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That makes complete sense. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Just as a quick comment on CalPERS, I do want to mention that in 1718 there were 195 agencies. Obviously, Alameda was one of them that made additional contributions to CalPERS above and beyond. What were the normal required contributions for the year?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And the total of those amounts across the entire state were $538 million that was contributed just to pay down those liabilities. This is a problem, obviously, across the state. It's not just Alameda, but those are the numbers that are coming out directly from CalPERS.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Um, I, I think I've said I need to say about CalPERS, just that I really do want to urge colleagues to, you know, let's look at our budget through very fiscally conservative eyes, because I just feel that we're going to run into a recession not that far away and we've already got liability.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's that's unfunded. But I want to hearken back to something we talked about earlier. It was probably yesterday now, but on the the climate emergency. And so one of the things that this came up this Saturday, last Saturday, when we did our council priority setting workshop, is that I really want to see every vehicle that the city'",
        "'speaker_0': 'looks at purchasing for our fleet. I know there's a policy, but I want to see every decision looked at that, you know, should this be an EV. And I, I think that we just make assumptions that we have to replace, like with like but for instance, at the last council meeting, we approved a new position for fire'",
        "'speaker_0': 'and we approved $75,000 for a vehicle.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'For a.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Deputy fire or the fire marshal or a deputy division chief who's going to have the fire marshal. So that's not a fire truck. It's a vehicle that this inspector or the head of this division will get around in.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I don't see any reason that that couldn't be an EV because we can't declare climate emergencies on the one hand and then keep buying fossil fuel vehicles without even considering alternatives. Something for council to consider. Other comments? Questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Otherwise. Do we want to entertain some resolutions? I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Were you finished?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Not yet. I was going.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To say, you just stopped. You stopped to take our questions. Yeah, yeah, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'On that section. So this is a quick recap of the general fund. What you see in front of you in terms of adopted budget, and this is for people that prefer numbers over graphs. The graph is going to come next.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We have an adopted budget adopted in June of 2018 and the operations were about $8,000. Pretty much breakeven for the year. We did make some adjustment during the year. So between July and now, council made approvals for several items, which is about $2.9 million.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And then you see the mid-year column, which is what we're asking you to approve today. With all of those together, mid-year projection is what we are actually expecting through the end of the fiscal year. One of the things we try to do is pull out the one time unusual events.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'One of them is obviously the transfer tax from the just the two properties that were mentioned as well as pension and OPEB reserve. Those are using existing money from prior year. In this particular case, $7.9 million. And I really didn't want to show it as net impact for the year with just that amount because it's really it's'",
        "'speaker_10': 'not a true operations for the general fund. And so with the two operations right now, excluding that particular one time, we are under by $174,000. However, we have tried to look at to add vacancies for general fund departments, and we believe that by the end of the year we will have sufficient vacancies and maybe even more to'",
        "'speaker_10': 'even cover that particular deficit at this point.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's a good thing, right?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Councilmember Desai So just to go back, the $7.9 million is a one time amount of that results via the the formula that was agreed upon.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's correct. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'All right. Each.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So here's a graphic presentation of exactly what you just seen on prior slide. It shows your revenues, including one time revenues and outside of one time revenues. Same thing with expenditures. And what we're seeing is obviously we're breaking at 174, 174,000.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Again, we expect to make up that number by the end of the year with the vacancy savings.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's why I say that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's a graph that uses colors I can't see. Oh, it's fine. I can interpret it, but.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Huh.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'For. For future graphs. The more you can use primary colors, the better. They're ugly. And.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But red and green are primary colors.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay, but are they? I think I guess it depends on the red in the green, but the yellow, blue, red.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, we'll look into that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Are there any questions on the general fund projection for the year?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No hearing, then move on.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. So at this point, we're going to talk about other programs. So outside of the general fund and they're more concise and to go over those rent stabilization well familiar program. Originally, when we put together a budget for it, as you know, we do a two year budget.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The expectation was that we would be collecting $120 fee as we did in year one. However, the council adopted in the year or two, which is 1819, to collect it at $106, the revenue was never adjusted and we're just adjusting it now, but it lowers it by over half a million dollars.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And the question was but was wasn't that based on a year's worth of data that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'School showed because we needed to make the the fee commensurate with the cost of administering the program?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That's correct. But our budgeted revenues were still showing higher than we would have brought in fiscal lease revenues. Originally, department did not expect or did not expect any lease revenues. This is the area of Alameda landing. And the expectation was that we were going to turn all of the buildings that are out there and warehouses over to'",
        "'speaker_10': 'a developer. That did not happen. We're close to that, but we're still receiving some of the lease revenues. And so the department is showing a budget that that's coming in on. Transportation Services received the grant. So they are budgeting for the grand community development.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'This is your building planning permits. They're experiencing higher revenue so far and so they're increasing those revenues. And then we have several other funds where we actually asking for expenditures for the Tidelands, for internal boat launch. There are some portions of that.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Projects are within Tidelands areas and therefore some of the improvements that are making, we're asking Tidelands to pay for it. Park Street Corridor had that particular project had a little bit of a shortfall. And so we asking general fund sorry, not general fund gas tax to contribute to to cover that shortfall.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We're showing the closed pension funds. We originally projected a certain amount and budgeted that will be left over. We actually experiencing a little bit more money because we unfortunately have some pensioners that are passing away. And so we appropriating those funds and again those are going towards pensions.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We have a few internal service fund programs that we are asking for, changes in expenditures in equipment replacement, fire battalion chief vehicle that was unfortunately in the accident and we have to replace that. The second item for police taser maintenance contract in fiscal year 15, we actually moved the money to pay for it, but we omitted the'",
        "'speaker_10': 'appropriation for that particular contract. And so we're just correcting an error with the employment insurance where unemployment insurance we're seeing a rise in the claim payments and with h.r. Departments request because of those claims going up, we asking to increase the budget for that cable franchise equipment replacement.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Again, we're dropping franchise revenue and this is specific to the 2006. It's called abbreviated as difficult act where we receive a portion of franchise fee specifically for an equipment. And as I mentioned earlier, the cable franchise revenues dropping on the general fund side.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It's also dropping on the franchise side here for that particular replacement. And then we need to appropriate additional moneys for chamber timing system installation, which you all use here fairly regularly on a general liability. The Department of Risk Management is experiencing or been told that they will not receive an equity distribution for the general liability component of'",
        "'speaker_10': '60,000.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Can you explain what that means?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The way it was explained to me actually was during the time of the recession, the risk pool that the city's participating in for general liability. What they did is when we had to pay for our participation in their and what they did is they if they had a lot of equity, they distributed it to the cities to'",
        "'speaker_10': 'kind of assist with the payments to to pay for the insurance. This is the first year that they are looking at their own reserves and saying that they would like to rebuild some of their reserve, some of their equity, and therefore they are not doing that distribution.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They use.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Microphones.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The city manager, an actuary to assist them in all of these insurance pools. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The next part is pension stabilization fund. This is where we actually make the disbursement to either CalPERS or pay the one through the 115 trust, which is with pass total would be $7.7 million. So all the reason why it's different is in here, it's actually combines everything together, general fund as well as are closed pension funds.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And we're setting aside for OPEB payment half a million dollars. We have several projects. As I mentioned earlier, you've seen the some of the funds that are contributing towards projects. General Fund. Tidelands. Gas tax. So this particular slide actually shows where the monies will be spend in the internal boat launch facility specifically.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We actually received a grant of almost $1.5 million. And so we're recognizing the grant as well as appropriating the money. Same thing for the climate change. It's a grant from Caltrans where recognizing the grant and also establishing the expenditures for that.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And then we have two projects that are being funded by the general fund money, Shoreline Park, pathway, lighting replacement. Those are the projects that are ready to go. But we're short on funding and this is a funding that might be available at one time, money for one time type of expense.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Same thing with the Alameda Point Gym for the modular restrooms.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Quick question on the might of the restroom. At the gym, it sounds like a great idea is just the well, it's a capital fund. So is that just for supplying the facility? Because who takes care of the maintenance and repair and that sort of thing is that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Captain? I see Ms. Wooldridge coming up.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To help people.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's just the capital cost and all maintenance would continue to be would be under recreation and parks department.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So they because they've been maintaining the restrooms in the gym up until now, but they're not going to be used because they're not ADA accessible.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And all that. These are in addition to. These are because to supplement their they're there to supplement. We have tournaments at the gym that are sometimes upwards of a thousand people a day. And the groups have to rent portable, portable toilets.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So you have a thousand people using a whole bank of portable toilets almost every weekend during the busy season, throughout the the the fall through spring for the most part. So this has been an ongoing need and this was a a solution rather than taking on the expense of trying to renovate within the building and everything that'",
        "'speaker_6': 'that opens up.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. All right. Thanks. Good explanation. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Are we still talking about expenditures?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Whatever you like.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Odie.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. Sorry. I mean, there's one thing that's come up recently that we don't have a line item for. And I mean, it'd be great if we can do it tonight. If we had to do it at another meeting, that would be great.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And that's making sure that the support that our public works and our safety people provide at parades and festivals. So I know there was a meeting yesterday with the police chief, among others, and I think that was one of his suggestions.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I'd like to see if there's a way we can do that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Vice spirit knocks. Knox.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I guess it's a question here is I know the recommendation is to approve these changes if we have other things we'd like to talk about. And I'm thinking we have an item after this that's talking about installing something in the city that the city probably should.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Is there a place? What is the process for somebody who's never come through this for me to. Or for somebody here to say, hey, you know what? Breast breastfeeding stations are $10,000 a pop. We have none anywhere in the city, but we have probably at least five or six buildings that need them, fire stations, etc..'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Well, usually you would as a group make those suggestions. And if we need to incorporate them, for example, into our budget because we're so close to the two year budget at this point, we can do that. You can also request the staff to bring it as a separate item sooner, and that would be part of analysis in'",
        "'speaker_10': 'preparing a staff report. And if it's an adjustment that's needed for the budget. It's going to be a just a resolution that's going to be part of that particular report.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Any other questions at this time?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Are there any other questions before we move on? Not right now. Okay. So the next slide is actually going to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Be I'm sorry, I can't remember, Bill. Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I do hope to notes. Okay. I do have one question, which is the pool which we had talked about at previous meetings and gave directions on specifically for, um, just to cover whatever maintenance we need before May 31st.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Is that noted in here or is that going to be a separate change that we do later on in the next budget?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'This has not been included in the mid-year budget at this point or by the time we have this report completed. There was no specific dollar amount and no specifics to that particular item. So it wasn't included. It would be depends on what the wish, I guess, of council and what the available information is either would be brought'",
        "'speaker_10': 'in as a separate item or will be included likely because it has to happen before June 30th would be a separate item that would be brought up. I would defer to the Parks director to let me know if that's true.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Yeah. The cost is so unknown at this point that that that was the primary driver of we did why we didn't include it. And so that would come back as its own separate item for an allocation. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I was married, actually. Oh, no, you were just me.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Replacement.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'This actually concludes the a non general fund programs information. And I'm going to ask our retired director to come in and actually talk about workforce changes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good morning.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good morning, Mayor. City council members Nancy Brownstein or H.R. director? I'm going to.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Very briefly.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Talk about some of the workforce changes that are being recommended as part of this mid-year update. We are requesting two new positions, a requesting to add a permit. Technician three Right now at the permit counter, there's such a high volume that we're pulling planners to provide that support, and we'd like to hire somebody on a limited, short'",
        "'speaker_1': 'term basis and be able to put the planners back to planning. And then we've also asking to add a senior management analyst in finance. This position would be a non accounting analytical position that would do budgeting, budget monitoring, cost allocation policies and special projects that need to get done in that department.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Question Ms.. Oh, I'm sorry. QUESTION For you, Mr. Bernstein or maybe for Mr. Thomas. Why is the permit technician position just a two year term?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You can answer it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Permits are up. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So we're very busy the counter. But since we're completely fee based, you know, we were just as you were saying earlier, a little bit worried about a possible recession coming along. So that's why we were thinking, let's just do it as a two year term.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'See where we're at. If if permit fees are still way up. We'll keep going. If. Yeah. And, you know, it's just we didn't want to get. That's that's the reason.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. Appreciate it. Question is there.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And also for this position, Andrew, we you know, one of the things that we've been talking about has been the amount of design review and kind of plan checking and plan review that goes on there. This position is is specifically to staff the counter.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But are we doing an accounting of how much time we're kind of spending on on the other stuff? And do we know?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yeah, let me explain this. I think we're on the same page. We are actually. Although permit fees are up and permanent activity is up, the number of design reviews, which is our sort of bread and butter, the number is actually going down.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Two years ago, three years ago, we would average about 250 design reviews a year. But we've been instituting streamlining procedures, design review exemptions so that we don't have as many of those where we can just basically check at the counter.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay, you're exempt. Go get a building permit. You don't have to go to design review. So that's that's good. But you would what it has done is increase the workload at the counter. So those people are checking and instead of putting in a pile saying a planner will get to it in a couple of weeks, they're just'",
        "'speaker_9': 'doing the time right there to check to see if they qualify for that exemption. So it's less work, less money for the applicants, a little bit more work for counter staff.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. We're also recommending two position upgrades an engineering office assistant in Public Works Executive Assistant. We had a study done and the work needed and the work being performed is that of an executive assistant. And then also to upgrade a transportation engineer position to supervising civil engineer due to the complexity of the transportation projects.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then we had some equity adjustments. We are having difficulty recruiting in our code enforcement building inspection areas. So we've done a salary survey. One of the things we'd like to do is add a new classification of combination building.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Inspector one Retitle Our Current Combination Building Inspector Combination Building Inspector two.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Gives us a.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Little bit a couple of different ways to recruit for that position. And then we wanted to do equity for the other classifications within those positions. And if there are any questions otherwise, I'll turn it back over to Alina, dear.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Questions, I guess, Mary. Not quite.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'First.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This is probably a question for Liam on the public works. Transportation Engineer. Two Supervising civil engineer. Is that going to change the focus of what that person does and who gets hired in that position? Because we already have lots of conversations around, you know, just kind of.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Modern transportation engineering practice. I'm just very sorry. It's getting really late. My words are escaping me worse than ever. Yeah, right. Yeah. Are we concerned that that's going to change the focus of this position at a time when we have more transportation jobs going forward?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, only that it will improve our ability to deliver in the transportation arena. So the supervising civil position will be a licensed transportation engineer. What it is, is a higher level position who can manage more complex projects and people in a way that benefits element as transportation system.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'No other questions. I'll turn it back over to Alina.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'This were one of the last slides that we had. And so as a wrap up for us, one, do you have any questions now that what you've heard everything? And then with that, we're going to ask we ask you to take the actions.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'As we've mentioned before, there are three resolutions in front of you budget resolution, workforce changes, as well as adjustment to the salary schedule.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, Counsel. Councilman Brody.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay, I'll go first. I'll try to be quick, though. Thank you for all of all of your hard work. You and all of the department heads in putting this together. I know you guys are very prudent with your ask, so that's much appreciated.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Just a couple of quick points. I mean, I am concerned and I think there's a difference between accuracy and conservative projection. I am concerned that, you know, for five years now, our revenues have come in significantly higher than estimated and our expenses have come in lower.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And, you know, I somehow get the feeling there's like a forced. The word escapes me. Austerity. Thank you. That I mean, there are some positives to that. But, you know, I think it causes undue stress in the departments and undue stress in the community.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'One thing I did want to point out, I saw that the slide where we talked about the assessed value and I know you can attribute some of the increase in the assessed value to the market, but I think a lot of it can be attributed to the hard work of the people here in Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I'm thinking, you know, among others, even our police or fire, our public works in maintaining our core services and making Alameda an attractive place to live and making sure that people are willing to pay them the property values and the cost that it is to live here.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So as we move forward, I want to make sure that, you know, we don't cut off our nose to spite our faces and, you know. Trying to cut those core services in a way that actually hurts us because it ends up decreasing our property values.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I hopefully, as we do future budgets, will keep that in mind because I think it's it's hypercritical to maintain our quality of life and our total assessed value to to maintain those services. I am prepared to move forward with all of these items.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'And I would defer to the appropriate department heads, whether it's whether it's the police chief or public works or Sara Henry to figure out what the appropriate amount is. But I think that is something that I think our community needs to know is going to be taken care of and that our long term that our department heads'",
        "'speaker_5': ', such as police or public works, know that they're not going to have to find ways to raise that or take that money in the future out of existing budgets. So that's my comment.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I can just briefly address that. As I've been looking at the budget for the July 4th parade, we've identified available funds in the Non-Departmental contingency fund for this year's parade. So we don't need it as an additional ask on the budget.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And we've already put in the request for as part of the overall request for the next two year budget cycle. And so we are looking towards both of those.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'The comments. I'm okay, Mossville.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I know one of the things that we do that we kind of do differently and I have noticed this the past couple of years is that the mid-year budget not to put more work on Melina's plate or to push it up earlier, but the mid-year budget comes several months into the year.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I think, you know, it's a little bit confusing. I mean, obviously, we need the time to to work back and everything. But I think one of the things that we as a council and that, you know, I love feedback from staff on moving forward is, you know, is it possible to me to get this report kind'",
        "'speaker_8': 'of done a little bit soon, you know, earlier in the year somewhere January, February, something like that, with still giving time to to give to give feedback and everything. Because I think I feel like we end up doing the mid-year budget and then like a couple of months later we're, we're back in the, in the budget cycle'",
        "'speaker_8': 'and I feel like it just ends up getting really compacted. So that's again, this is more just I would like to have that conversation about, you know, what that would look like and how that might impact things relative to, you know, hearing from department heads on that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I'm ready to support the budget requests as as they've been listed. I do think that we need to kind of. Figure out the pool costs just to keep the hood open and functioning. I know that that's something that Amy is going to be diligently working on, as well as a number of other issues.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But that will be coming up in in future budgets. And I think that there's you know, I think our policy that we put in place regarding the spend down or the pay down, I should say, of PERS and OPEB has been serving us well.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think there's many things that are outside of our control, but that's not one of them. And I think that we continue to to do, you know, to to help our future by continuing to do that. I would I would like to know kind of where we've we have overestimated in terms or underestimated our revenues.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Um, if that's, you know, what kind of, what the trend has been where we have had those. Because I feel like every time we come here we hear that it's a, it's a one time savings, not so much on the staff vacancy side, but on maybe on the on the T on the transfer taxes and some of'",
        "'speaker_8': 'these other things where we've we've seen kind of a continued under projection of that. I'm not saying that we're purposefully doing that, but I would like to understand kind of where we're where we're missing the mark on those a little more.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'For the comments.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Jason.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'm going to support any resolutions with regard to workforce changes. I'm going to abstain on the amendments to the budgets. For the reasons that we discussed, but also for two other reasons. One is, you know, it's just it's difficult for me to vote for a budget that's coming in negative.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I recognize that what's driving the negative is that one time I recognize that. But I'm also going to abstain because, frankly, this is a two year, 24 month budget. And really I'm having only involved in the final two months.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So for me it's like, well, well, it wasn't my budget, so I'm going to abstain on the budget and look forward, you know, when we start the next two year budget cycle.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'A couple thoughts. I, I actually appreciate the conservative projections that we've seen, both in revenue and expenditure. Ms.. Adair came to us from the city of Stockton. And, well, you know, all of us have been on the council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's been in good times and in revenues have been coming in strong. But really, if you look back a decade, Mr. Thomas certainly remembers cutting the planning staff in half. And so none of us has a crystal ball.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we one of the things we just shouldn't, in my opinion, be so anxious to do is spend, you know, whatever excess revenues we have. I would rather have conservative estimates. I think we're just better served as a city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And again, the vacancies in public safety are not because the city council has said we're not going to fund those positions. I'm saying what belabor that. So one thing that strikes me every time I'm in the clerk's office, I think the city clerk's office is to be commended for the passport services they're doing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have such happy customers. I run into them in the halls and these adorable families and things to me. But oh my goodness, the the environment in which you have to, you know, do the photos and everything. I have no idea what it would take to make that space better.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But if there is anything I mean, and again, this is increasing revenue for our city and it's a nice service to to the public. So I would just encourage the clerk's office to think about what what might be needed, might be possible to make that space better.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Ms..'",

        "'speaker_7': 'to be an issue. But by the same token, I don't recall us having been told that limit ourselves to issues. So while I myself might have held a hat that said, okay, this is how I'm going to this is the lens through which I'm going to look at issues.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'Yeah. And fleshing out the the remedies. If the remedies are appropriate for the charter. I'm not sure they are, by the way, but if they are fleshing it out, I'm also interested in what I believe is at the top of my head.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I believe in section two, Dash four, which has to do with qualifications for council members. And I think the qualifications to dash for says that if you're a federal legislator, state legislator or county legislator, you cannot be involved in commissions or things like that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I would expand to Dennis for four reasons that I am happy to go into later. But I think it's to dash four, by the way. So so I am interested in in dealing with, you know. Dealing with the issues that our community dealt with in 2018.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I think that's an appropriate place. But by the same token, I think our charge was to look at other issues.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So. So just for clarification, the the title of this is Review and Discuss Charter Amendment Timelines. So you say you look to the charter and you thought perhaps it should be amended to address all of these things.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'No, no, no, no, no. I am not bought into all those things I am most interested in to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This is not a mutually drafted document.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Is that Councilmember Vela.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Not.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Giving to the late hour? And the fact that I think this this conversation might better suit us to a different time. I think what I'm hearing is perhaps there needs to be a little more council discussion on what the topics specifically are.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I think that there, you know, perhaps we could continue this conversation to the next meeting and with the specific mindset of we are we now understand that we're trying to set up a couple of workshops, but we're also trying to narrow the scope of what those workshops will cover.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And if we could at the next meeting, all come with kind of what we think should be covered. We can have that discussion and then we can actually approve or set out a timeline.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'How does that sound to the subcommittee and then others? Oh, what's that? What do I need to do? Oh, we have to just.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You're fine. I just to give you guys a little more background since your thinking about coming back, just for your mindset, please. The distinction that Vice Mayor mentioned earlier is in election code section 14, dash 15, and I can shoot an email off to you tomorrow.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But it basically prohibits an employment type of anything that's related to employees. And you all are considered employees from being on the March election. And one more thing about the March election and putting anything on that date would the city would then be paying for participating in that election, which be in addition to anything to consider for'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the March date as you're coming back just to open your head?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No, that's helpful thing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And Councilor Brody, I just want.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'To clarify, because I was intimately involved in this. The impetus of this was that there was a charter provision that an investigator found was unclear and vague. So his recommendation was to look at that charter provision and kind of clarify the do's and don'ts, what's allowed, what's not allowed.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And if you read the document, that was the impetus. You'll see that there is a process outlined to deal with that in statute. And I think that the city attorney could probably update anyone that's not familiar with that process.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I think we need to be careful and not overstep our boundaries and make sure that we abide by the statutes in that that the state as adopted in this area.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, I am again, I think Councilmember Vella is correct that the hour is late and we will have a more productive discussion. But I think that anything should be able to be discussed. What we decide is something else.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So, Madam Clerk, can we just continue this item? Do I need a vote.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To do that or.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is that okay with everyone?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay with you? Okay. All right. Okay. All right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So. So thank you. And then, Councilman Rudy, did you want to speak briefly on Tennessee?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'No. Let's just talk about it next time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So then we are at adjournment and I'm going to ask everybody if we could adjourn. We started the meeting on a happy note with the announcement of our new city attorney said they were going to end on a sad note because I want to adjourn the council meeting in memory of some people.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Who.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Who lost their lives in the last couple of weeks. One of them is Victor McElhaney. He was 21 years old, the son of my friend and Oakland City Councilmember Lynnette Gibson McElhaney. His mother attended our swearing in ceremony in in December.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'She was introduced, if you remember. And very tragically, he was a gifted musician studying at USC and just out on a Saturday night. And he and some friends were held up and he got shot and killed. And it's you know, there is nothing where you can say, but I want to do his memory, the honor of remembering'",
        "'speaker_0': 'him tonight. And at the same time, I want us to adjourn in honor of the I believe it's now 50 victims of the terrorist attacks on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand. Last week, again, more a sense of gun violence, but maybe on a a little more positive note.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I also want to announce that this Saturday, March 23rd at 6:30 p.m., I'm right here in front of City Hall. The Islamic Center of Alameda is presenting a solidarity vigil with Muslims. And so I hope that you all can attend and members of the public who might listen to this tape later, I hope you can attend, too'",
        "'speaker_0': '. But if we could just rise and have a moment of silence and then this is adjourned. Thank you, everyone. Thank you all. Good night.'"
