    "Recommendation to Authorize the Acting City Manager to Execute a Service Agreement with Gig Car Share for a One Year Point-to-Point Carshare Pilot Program at No Cost to the City. (Transportation 91402)": [
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Good evening, Mr. Mayor, and members of the City Council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I am Gail Payne, a senior.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Transportation coordinator.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'For the city. This item before you is a staff recommendation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'To initiate a one year pilot program for a point.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To point car share.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'At no.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Cost to the city with getting car share. And we do have two great representatives of key car share audience.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And here to help with responses to any questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That you may have, it's Dermott.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hickey and Sloan Morgan here. And would you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Like me to go through the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Description of.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The pilot, or what would you like me to cover? Well, I guess I'd start with. My understanding is you'd have 35 to 50 cars. And would they be parked in designated places or where would they be parked? Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Specifically or just go forward. I have a couple of slides here and.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'll just move forward to the actual pilot that staff is recommending. And what we.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Are recommending along with GIG.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Is to launch with up to 35 vehicles.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'On the main island of Alameda only and not Bay Farm Island and that's up to 35. So it could be 20 probably to start as a soft launch.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And providing no more.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Than 50 vehicles within the main island of Alameda. And this would be anywhere within the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Public property on street parking.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Within the main island of Alameda. So where would they be parked on street? Okay. So are there specific so in the report, sometimes as designated spaces. Are there actual designated spaces? Like if you go to other cities, you know, where there's designated spaces or is that what you're proposing?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Or.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we are different.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This pilot, we are piggyback. We are recommending to piggyback on.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'To the existing pilot that's happening in Oakland and Berkeley. And Oakland. And Berkeley does.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Have a different type of pilot that we're recommending because we're not recommending.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That the cars and stop and end a trip or the the gig members end trips at parking meters.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Or at the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Parking structure. Whereas in Oakland and Berkeley, there are instances where people gig members can end trips at parking meters. And so it is different. And we did back in 2015, we have exhibit three, I think it is, that says has a policy that Transportation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Commission did approve.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Back in.'",
        "'speaker_0': '2015. That does that does say that we are allowed to do that, but we.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Are trying to go a little bit more cautious on.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This pilot.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And two staff is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Actually.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Recommending not having a transactional circumstance.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Here with gig.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Car share for the parking meters or.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The parking.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Structure.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Madam Mary.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Member.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I was wondering if your questions are great and I saw the, the long list of the answers from MBS pain and massage. But I'm wondering for people in the audience who might not even be familiar with the concept of gig car, if maybe this pain might just give a quick overview and then maybe they would understand your'",
        "'speaker_4': 'answers, the answers to your questions a little more in context.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So how how long is your presentation? How many pages? I just have a few slides here and so I can start off with could you just describe what car sharing is that's going through that?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's a great idea, right? That's that's basically what.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The presentation boils down to. And that in Alameda, we already Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Are.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Already benefiting from three different types of car sharing. We have dedicated space car sharing here in town for spaces.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We also have.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The peer to peer car share where.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Neighbors are actually renting out the cars.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To other neighbors.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And both these types of car share are led and operated by another.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Company called Getaround.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And Getaround has over 900 members, Alameda members. And this is a third.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Type of car share that we're.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Are.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Wanting to bring to Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's already.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Operating this point to point car.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Share. It's already.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Operating as a pilot in the East Bay, Oakland, Berkeley and.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Albany. And what this is is called point.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To point car share. It's also called one way car.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Share or.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Free floating.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Car share.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And what that means.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Is that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Someone can rent a car here and then.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Take it to Berkeley and into trip. You don't have to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Take it back to the same.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Spot, a dedicated space and that spot.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Here in Alameda, if.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Someone were to return it here, it could be, according.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To the pilot, anywhere here on our.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Public streets that are unrestricted, that's no parking meters or.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And no time limits. And so the benefit of this and why Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And are wanting.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To have car share and are signing up for these car share programs. And keep in mind get car share there's.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Already 200 comedians who are going gig car show members even though we don't have gig Karcher in Alameda. So and the reason.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Why aluminums.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Are.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Interested is that it costs a lot less.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Than owning a car.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have rents that are really quite high now. We have mortgages that are quite high. And so people are looking at their household budgets and trying to figure out.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'How to cut costs. And transportation is a big expense. Owning a car is a big expense. And so.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We are trying to find as a city transportation options other than.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Driving alone and driving your own personal car.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And even though this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Is still driving alone per say.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'When people become car share members, they're much more likely to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Reduce their car ownership.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To postpone buying that additional vehicle, to give up a car, to avoid buying a vehicle.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so this really is moving in the right direction.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'National studies show that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You reduce.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Vehicle miles traveled, reduce.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Greenhouse gas emissions, increase walking and bicycling headed all in the right direction. Where we've been wanting to go as the transportation choices plan that you just passed in January, it's all consistent with that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so that's why we are recommending it here and we are recommending to become piggyback onto the gig car.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sure, it's already in the East Bay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It is attracting rider or human members who are younger.'",
        "'speaker_2': '16 to 44 with these type. Of one way trips they tend to make it's they tend to be 15 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Long and about two miles. And as I mentioned before, where on this site can you go back to that former site? Yes. So 16 year olds can rent these cars? Yes.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I don't think so.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I just ask because the slide says 16 to 29 so that maybe it's.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'He wouldn't do it. He just said it's the age bracket. But you're right, it's 18 to 29. Is is are 18 is the youngest that can become members of good car share.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Oh.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Is that that okay?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. So staff is recommending that we.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Launch here in.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Alameda gate car share and we are recommending.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'A maximum of 50 vehicles.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We're recommending.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'To.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Launch on the main island of Alameda and only on Bay Farm Island if it makes business sense.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And yeah, I have that's I think I have a question related to that. I mean, first of all, you have to have a license, right? Yes. And then do you have to have insurance as well if you want to rent this?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I mean.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'A driver's license. What about I am Sloane Morgan from gig car share.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And you need insurance as well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Insurance comes with the gig car share.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. So you don't have to have your own insurance, correct? Okay. That's thanks for that answer. And then my question on Bay Farm. You know. I know. You know, there's the there's the park and ride lot over there by the Grand View Pavilion.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I think we're also trying to where you can actually catch the bus right out there. And there's all we're also trying to encourage folks to who use the ferry to park at the golf course. And, you know, at some point we're going to have some transit options between that lot and the ferry.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I wonder if, you know, we would consider, you know, devoting some spaces here because then, you know, if you're not driving your car to the ferry and you can drive it here and then leave it and someone else could pick it up and so on and so forth, that that's that's something we might want to consider'",
        "'speaker_10': ', you know, because someone who used to live on Bay Farm people, they don't like to be felt left out. And, you know, we do have some, you know, last two mile or last three mile issues out there as well, especially with the ferry station.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So this pilot program, it definitely leaves that open for good car share to that make.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If it makes business sense for.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Them to do that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Then this agreement allows.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Them to do that. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If how many cars, if any, in the cars. You said that there's different types of shared cars already here in Alameda. Do you know how many cars those are? I've spoken with Get Around. And what they were able to tell.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Me is that they do have over 900 members that are in Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that the four dedicated spots in Alameda, they have from those four dedicated spots, 100.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Trips per month.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So those are four dedicated.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Cars to those four spots. And with those four cars, make 100 trips per month.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So that company has dedicated spots. Yes. And this company would not have any. So they would just park in front of someone's house and then leave it there for up to the 72 hours. Do they move them after 24 hours?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'After 8 hours? When do they make sure that that car is moved? Yes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So gig two.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'For them to have a successful business model, they really need to keep those.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Cars moving. These are big as this is a big asset for them. And so for.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Berkeley, the average time that the cars.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Are in one parking spot or is 2 hours in Oakland, it's 7 hours. And so they do a gig, car share company does.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Have GPS is on.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Each vehicle. So they're able to track and see if a car is not moving. So they want to keep those car at that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But my question goes to let's say the car doesn't move. When do you guys come and move it? Because we have had issues in regards to, for instance, lime bikes, right? So we've had to work with that company to try to step up on their customer service.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But it's a specific question. You guys come around and move that car. So I'm going to just say the car is parked in front of my house, right? The 12 hours you make sure that car is gone, 2472 went when so they were required.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'll let Dermot answer 1/2 as. Per this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Agreement, they are.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Required, like any other car, to move before the 72 hours. And yet, like I said, that to be a successful business model.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They really have to keep those cars moving. 72 hours comes along. Do they make sure it's moved or is it my responsibility to call the police? They have the think tag and then we wait a few days till actually gets towed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, they they do.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I'll let Dermot answer more.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Great question marks. Spencer and likely one of the most common questions we get Dermot with Gig. Yeah. So we are, I don't know if we're it's familiar but we're actually a division of triple-A. Just want to make sure that's clear.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We are much more conservative than maybe some of the other operators you've had to work with in other industries. But just to clarify your specific question on the actual alert and how it's managed, so we have a full time fleet management team, we call them fleet magicians, and they are dedicated to operating our existing 500 vehicle fleet'",
        "'speaker_8': 'across Albany, Oakland and Berkeley and hopefully one day Alameda. And so within that, as far as the vehicles are located, we have GPS systems. We know exactly where the vehicles are and we have alerts that go out that's tied to also street sweeping in addition to vehicles that are left idle or what we call gigs in the'",
        "'speaker_8': 'wild. So on occasions, a vehicle's left a far distance from a cluster of members. In those cases, there's an alert of the 54 hours that the team has enough time to schedule and go rescue that gig and put it into a location where it's getting higher use.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'What we're proposing here is not to add additional vehicles and, you know, order another half $1000000 to $1000000 worth of assets for Alameda specifically. But we see the demand and the opportunity within our existing member base or members in Alameda and how the their home zone is currently located.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'To use that as to make the holistic ecosystem to help it work great.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So OC Vice Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I do have a follow up question. Sure. So what happens? And the reason I ask this is because it's the question that's inevitably going to come up. And I've already seen some of the gigs around town. People are using them already picking them up.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I see them at the dedicated spaces at BART and seen people drive them over to Alameda. If somebody parks, what happens if somebody parks and they block your driveway because this comes up all the time here? Who do we who who would the members of the public call?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Who would they call?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yeah. So we have a 24 seven dedicated member care center and that's that's actually built into the Triple A member care centers. We have a huge amount of responsiveness as a result of that as well as like language issues and anything else like that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We're already prepared. We're very fortunate that triple-A is is our our parent organization. So with with a situation like that, we have a very strict member agreement that our members need to follow the rules of the road, whether it's ADA Access only commercial or your driveway.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Those are places people should not be parking my car, their own car, a gig car. So in a situation like that, someone is welcome to actually call us. We'll get it removed if the thing gets towed as a result of it being in the space and you're in a rush to get out, we pay the bill, we'",
        "'speaker_8': 'then engage with the member to understand what went wrong. Maybe they made an honest mistake. Maybe their wife was giving birth and they just had to run down to the hospital. But long story short, we follow up with every single member, and if they're just being negligent, we remove them and they're not allowed to be members anymore'",
        "'speaker_8': ', unfortunately.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And is that number on the vehicle or would people have to go to our website to find it? How would they go about accessing that?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Currently it is not on the vehicle.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so they would have to they would have to, like, look up gig through an app or they would look up online in order to get that either.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Online or their welcome to the app app. But online would be the fastest way to find that. So every vehicle is a jet black Prius hybrid. And the goal there was really to be low emission and conveniently sized to park.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So the logo's there. So thus far with our experience in Oakland and Berkeley, that is that has worked well. Unfortunately, we haven't had that many reports of people parking in front of others driveways.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But have you had any reports of anyone parking it wrong?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So then why don't you just put the phone number on the vehicle to make it easy?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So it's a good question. I think it was a balance between managing branding and and how the vehicle looks. Members are like private vehicle owners. They want a vehicle to look like something that they're happy to drive around all the time so that they're able to feel like it's their vehicle.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So the more the more things you put on it, the less likely a member is to potentially shed their own vehicle or or.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So the cities you're currently in, do they get phone calls about complaints? I just happened to get quite a few, for instance, about lime bikes. I'm wondering if the cities that you're currently in, if they get phone calls about the cars, you know, being parked in the wrong place that they.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Have relative to other initiatives the cities are working on for sustainability goals. The. I'd be happy to give you contacts of those cities so they could they could speak to that themselves.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Do you know how many calls they get? Do you guys keep track of that? How many complaints we have? We do all.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We do because I'm the direct point of contact as well as Sloan for the cities of Oakland and Berkeley, now Albany. So we receive them directly and we. Work with our operations teams to manage them. Right now. I haven't received it.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I don't recall if I received the call in April. So just as an example.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right. Any other questions from council members? In regards to the insurance, what type of coverage is there?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yeah, it's comprehensive offensive coverage. So there's a minimum deductible to the member for, say, if it's a fender bender. I think I believe the deductible is. 750.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Could you speak in the mike, please? If you're a triple.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'A member, it's 250. If if you're a general member of the public, I believe.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I need you to rise and speak. And then Mike, one of you. All right. Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If you are a triple AA member, you get a reduction in that deductible, putting it at $250 as your deductible. If you're not a triple AA member, it would be $750. And then just a friendly follow up. If you put in gig car share customer service, you can test it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The phone number comes right up. We're not hiding the number at all. It's right there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So is there any insurance for injuries? Someone gets injured in the car?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. There's comprehensive coverage.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You have limits, though. There are no limits.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm sure there's limits. I can show you the. I can get the paperwork for you and show you that. But it's what?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. So, yeah. So at some point I'd like to share with the public or actually myself and it's probably in here somewhere, but I'd like to know what the coverage is. Any other questions? And I'm going to go ahead and call the we have two speakers.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Pat Potter and then Brian Maguire.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Potter. I'm part of CASA Community Action for Sustainable Alameda. I'm on the Transportation Committee and I'm also part of like Mark Alameda on the board. And I'm, I'm talking about the importance of looking at alternatives to everyone owning a car.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So UC Berkeley's Transportation Sustainability Research Center has studied car share and has come up with some of the advantages to it. And the Research Center was formed in 2006 to combine the research forces of six campus groups, the University of California Transportation Center, the University of California Energy Institute, the Institute of Transportation Studies, the Energy and Resources'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Group. The Center for Global Metropolitan Studies and the Berkeley Institute of the Environment. Since two years since RC was founded, it's been a leading center in conducting timely research on real world solutions for a more sustainable transportation future.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The benefits, they say, of car sharing can include increased vehicle use and ownership. Increased transit. Ridership. Biking and walking. Cost savings to individuals and employers. Energy savings. And air quality benefits. And reduced parking demand at participating transit stations, member employer sites and residential locations.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I just want to say that I fully support a gig shared ride type of business, and I think that they would do a great job. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Brian McGuire. And then he's our last speaker on this item. If you want to speak on it, submit your slip, please.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Good evening, brian werbach, mark alameda. Just to refresh and if I didn't get a chance to read this version of this out of four, but I did see it at the Transportation Commission. That commission, I believe, unanimously supported this and they unanimously supported changing the staff recommendation to include Bay Farm, if possible, in the pilot, and not'",
        "'speaker_9': 'leave all those residents out at the behest of maybe a couple of outspoken leaders of the Bay Firm, HRA or OAS and the Transportation Commission. Not exactly a you know, not a bunch of spandex clad, you know, cycling car share, you know, alternative transportation, you know, forefront leaders of the community.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But they very much supported this and they understood the value that this could provide. And so I think there's a the point there is that there's a broad support for this from different aspects of the community. A lot members of the Transportation Commission from all parts of the island, including Bay Farm, who wanted to participate in this'",
        "'speaker_9': '. This is exactly the kind of thing that we should be supporting with, you know, that we talked about in the Transportation Choices plan. It's exactly the kind of thing that when my six year old car gives up the ghost that I put a couple thousand miles a year on, I won't have to replace that and take up'",
        "'speaker_9': 'a parking space. You know, when I occasionally need a car, that can be our second car instead of being a two car household. We can become a one car household, hopefully. And I think a lot of Alameda families would like to do that, reduce the number of cars, if not become completely car free car lite.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So we would support this wholeheartedly and we look forward to it being successful in town. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I have a couple more questions. The staff and one of the questions that I had asked, I got a response that Gigas projected 108 almost $200,000 revenue from May 3rd through April 30th, 2019 revenue. How does the city make money off of this?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Or is there some? I know sometimes when I look at shared something, there's like every time a ride takes place is a dollar that goes to the city or something. Is there is that any part of this proposal?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm not a tax expert yet. Forever. All the revenues that are generated, there are taxes that are paid to alameda. So I can't speak to the precise.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But have you heard of that? Like every ride, it's like a dollar goes to the city, whether it's like scooter things or the bikes. Different shared means of transportation. And is that any part of this contract based on the number of rides?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. The reason why that's not part.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I've just never heard of it. I didn't know that was ever a model at all.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Another public benefits is there. That's another thing I've heard of, of when you're sharing something that something is wrong, like for the lime bikes, bike racks, for instance, but for cars. My guess is there's other public benefits that are can be negotiated.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Any other members would comment?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I mean, I think that the I didn't know where those came from, but I appreciate those questions. But I think they were very comprehensive and appreciate the answers. I mean, if we do some type of AQ on our website for this and I think it'd be helpful to have those questions listed.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I do think we do need to consider, you know, Bay Pharm, you know, especially those two parking lots, which I think could be a big solution to some of our transit issues over there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is there a reason why we don't? I know you know, the line box is coming back. We're going to do an RFP and get quotes and offers from multiple companies. Is there a reason why that's not being proposed for car sharing?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We are recommending to piggyback on this pilot that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Already is happening.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In the East Bay. And the reason is, is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'More because.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The members need a place to go.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And this is actually one of the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think the first multijurisdictional our share in the country. And it is most successful when you have more jurisdictions involved because for.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Example, a.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Third of our morning trips go to is Bay Communities. So it's the only car share that does this and because it's all very new. And so they're the only ones who have approached us. They're the only ones who are doing it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's why the pilot is with them. No other company has approached us or is doing it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I remember Ashcroft.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. Spencer. Thank you, Miss Payne. And the folks from Kershaw. I am I'm very favorable to this proposal, and I'm prepared to make a motion. I will say for disclosure, I'm a triple-A member, so I get that nice VA magazine.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And they've been talking about gig car share for a while. So when I heard about it first from city staff a few months ago, I said, Yeah, I know that's that's the triple AA company. And I admire the fact that Triple A, which, you know, is I don't know how many years you've had your hundredth anniversary.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think it was all about, you know, getting people out on the roads. But now their focus is also to help us reduce the impact of traffic and the pollution and the wear and tear on our infrastructure and our roads and our bridges.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I think it's the sort of thing that we all have an opportunity to do our share. I really appreciate that. In Alameda we have CASA, this great organization and and bike walk Alameda and I think this is where we really can step up and do our part.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm always inspired to meet new residents who come in, even, you know, young families with kids. And they tell me we've gotten rid of our second car. We've gotten rid of both cars. They're they're relying on this. And I think if we make this opportunity available, that more and more people will avail themselves of it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so I think it's a step in the right direction for our our city, for our planet. And I would like to make a motion that we authorize the acting city manager to execute a service agreement with car share for when you're point to point cars, your pilot program at no cost to the city.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I think within the agreement, there's some possibilities for one year extensions, if I'm remembering my agreement correctly. Those are my thoughts.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I had a follow up question. You had mentioned that, and I saw in the staff report that they're going to be getting a city of Alameda business license and then you estimated what their revenues are. Are those revenues tax taxable for the city of Alameda?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think that's what the mayor was trying to get at. So can we just get that on the record?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I don't. You have an estimate of revenues that the city would receive. Does anyone know.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's based off of their revenue projections? But can you just.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Say I'm slowing again? Yes. I completed the business license application and I estimated the number of cars that would be here based on a just a projection for next year. And that was the amount that came out.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hundred and 89,000.'",
        "'speaker_2': '$189,000. So that's what I submitted to in the business license application.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But that's their standard. The company is.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Based on the 189.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It was aren't tax revenue or the company's revenues estimated to charge for their business license fees.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right. So I was trying to figure out there's a city make you know, how much money does the city make off of this? Because the different types of businesses are taxed differently.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I guess, are you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Expecting to make money off.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Of this? That is not.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Which is why I think some cities negotiate, for instance, a dollar a trip or something like that, that then there's revenue from anything from a transportation shared. Now remember matter.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'First of all, on a second, the motion. And then second, I want to make sure that we focus on what the benefits are. And I would I would like to. Make sure that in the agreement that we have.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Some measurement of some of these benefits and also measurement of the complaints so that they can be managed because we're we're effectively allowing 50 cars that are owned by somebody else to use the public street at no cost.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So. That. If it's true. And this is where the pilot comes in. And in my opinion, if it's true that it has fewer results and fewer vehicles on the city streets, then it's worth it. But if it's just adding 50 more vehicles to the city streets, it's not worth it because we're giving a company that makes money'",
        "'speaker_8': 'free use of our streets. So I'm willing to go further with this. If we have a measurement that we're not increasing, we're actually reducing the number of vehicles on the city street.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So my understanding is it's a one year pilot. Is that right?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That's what you do, pilots, is to check this out and then.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So would you be willing to consider a friendly amendment of six months or a lesser time than a year?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well. Oh, well, I was going to say I would probably defer to the company about how long you would want to do a pilot to have statistically relevant information, because I would imagine that there's a little bit of start up time and as you ramp up.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I mean, maybe six months is not enough, but I would think the idea is that at the end of the one year pilot, they want to have the agreement renewed. So that could be dependent on certain data.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah. Performance metrics that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If I could just add a couple of things is that we are planning on doing surveys of gig car show or gig car share members. Exactly.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Trying to quantify those benefits. And we're planning on that in early 2019. And so that's about seven months from now. And then we would come back to you all.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The Transportation Commission in the spring of next year. And so and and the reason is, is that it's.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Timed with the other pilots that are.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Going on in the East Bay. So we're going to wrap the all.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The benefits up.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Together and.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Not only show you the benefits of.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Of this Alameda pilot, but the entire program.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And matter I.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I want to make sure that it's not just planning to check after seven months. I want to make sure that we know we're starting with. As the baseline. And then after seven months, we know what the change is because we allowed these cars on the street here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I also want to follow up. Okay. So you said 54 hours, you get the alert. What is the estimate of time that you think someone's car, one of these cars is going to be parked, parked in front of someone's house?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I can tell you, I get complaints as it is currently about people that don't think that there is sufficient parking anywhere in our town. And I'm trying to figure out what is the impact and when when am I going to be getting the calls?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Are you guys going to be getting the calls? And are you guys going to respond? What is the average time you think a car will be in front of someone's house?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, our goal is that if a car's in front of someone's house, that means someone's using the car. And then when you open the app, you would see, Oh, I can take this car. So our goal is to maximize the use of these cars because they are very expensive resource for us.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Our fleet team is very carefully monitoring this expensive resource. And if an if it's, you know, as our marketing team tries to build memberships so that we can make this successful excuse me, make this pilot successful here in Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We also want to optimize their use. So we will if we see that there's areas where they're being used, for example, maybe in front of an apartment building where there's less, where people don't have cars. We will be watching that so that we make sure that we meet demand with supply.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That is part of our goal. And we have a fleet team dedicated to that. Does that answer?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Okay, I'm ready.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I guess my question and this is why for the acting city manager and it follows up on my colleague's question. I mean, do we get any money from the city? It's a super complicated triple flip VLF swap based on is that based on like the folks that register cars in the city of Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I know that's kind of a super complicated, but.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm not an expert on VLF.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'As my point would be, you know if these are 50 cars that are not. Registered to residents of Alameda. I mean, I still haven't heard, you know, at what point the city's going to be taxed. I didn't hear that it was sales tax.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I don't think it's VLF and I don't think it's property tax. So I mean, we are allowing our resources to be used for the benefit of a private company without any type of, you know, assistance or fee recovery like we normally get from, you know, folks who pay for their VLF or folks who pay sales tax or'",
        "'speaker_10': 'so on and so forth. So I guess those are some questions that need to be answered.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, as we said before, you are getting business license tax.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And how much is right. Do we know.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Or will it be based on it's you know, it's based on their gross income, right? So their gross income is roughly 200,000. It would be something, I don't know over my head what the number is, but it would be based on that number.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So you are getting some tax based on the business license tax and then of course, they have to have pay the business license fee, the fee to actually have a business license. So there's two. Components.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. It was questions that, you know, still need to be.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I was also going to answer one of the other questions that the honorable mayor asked. Sorry, I didn't have it at my fingertips, but it is in the member agreement. So I was going to read what our insurance coverages for drivers bodily injury covered up to 100,000 per person, 300,000 per accident and property damage liability up to'",
        "'speaker_2': '50,000. Also, you are covered with uninsured motorist, underinsured motorist, bodily injury, up to 15,000 per person, 30,000 for accident. We also have a certificate of insurance. Where the city itself.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you. Vice Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I'm inclined to support this to see how it does. I think that a lot of the benefits won't be realized in a year, to be honest with you, because as you are talking about building membership, part of it is getting people accustomed to using this other mode of transit for these short rides.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I think changing behavior takes a longer period than a year. So I don't know that the data that we collect is going to be necessarily helpful with regards to removing vehicles from the road, because I think part of what people are trying to see is, is this a dependable service that I have bought into that I'",
        "'speaker_7': 'will have long past a year? I do have concerns about not having it out on Bay Farm Island just because we have a number of people who live out there. We have a lot of first and last mile issues, and I think enforcement is going to be difficult.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And that's really where I would like to see the feedback from staff in terms of what we're looking at is are people parking where they're not supposed to? How many calls are there? What's the response time? To me, I think those are things that we can get a handle on.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And if those numbers aren't looking good, that's going to be cause for concern in a year. And I think it's also in the company's best interests to make sure that that doesn't happen because it becomes a brand issue.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Right. And the cars are well branded. I also, you know, in terms of some of the things we put in the agreement about not parking in the in the garage, you know, I don't think that parking in the garage is a problem.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think parking in the garage overnight for several days or for several days in a row is a problem. Right. And so I do kind of cringe at some of those strict requirements in the agreement that I think become prohibitive, where we start telling people where they can and can't go with the vehicle and how much time'",
        "'speaker_7': 'they can park it in different space spaces. I think the bigger concern is longer periods of time and being left there multiple days in a row, that sort of thing. And I know that in, you know, in the in the agreement we talk about that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But I think I don't know if we can have signage or something that just lets people know, hey, don't park it here overnight. If you're going to use it to come to the movie theater, that's fine. But just don't leave it here overnight.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You've got to move it somewhere else. So.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Jan.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'If you mind, Mayor Oh, I just want to clarify that people can park in metered spaces and in the parking garage you just have to comply, just like any other cars you pay and you can't stay. If it's a two hour meter, then you can write it into our meter.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So you just want to make sure the folks know that you can use those resources. You just have to act like any other car. You can't end your trip at those location right.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Where you would leave it for the next person overnight and not pay.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But I do think that the enforcement on that is going to be difficult. And I think that some of these issues come up. We don't always have the best well-lighted marked streets and driveways. And so these issues come up all the time.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I hope that they get worked out and they get worked out in an expeditious manner. But I do think that over the long term, the use of car shares I think is a is a good thing. This is a little different, I think, from Lime Bike because we already have other rideshare and car city car share'",
        "'speaker_7': 'companies operating here in Alameda. This is just a different twist on it in that there aren't defined end points. But I do hear the mayor's concern and I think it's should be well received. And I think the point of it is to make sure that this comes back to council and it's a council decision and we are'",
        "'speaker_7': 'engaging any one off contracts with different vendors where there's a profit to be made, where we're not putting it out to RFP. And I hear her concern on that. And I do hope that, you know, I think in this case where we have other rideshares already operating, it's it's different.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I'm prepared to support this tonight.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Could you speak to that ride share that's currently offered there? I thought I heard four cars. So this is. Do we have anything of this size? This is this is a different type of.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Car share that's a dedicated space. So we have four dedicated spaces in town with another company. It used to be city car share and they got bought out by Get Around. Right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And how many cars do they actually have?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's it's one car per spot.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So they have four there. Four. Okay. So that's this is significantly this is ten, ten times more than just even a double, right? I mean, right. We're going from four to I'll just say 40. Okay. And I did find online of add on fees that other cities are charging.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'San Francisco's projecting anywhere from $0.20 to a dollar per ride. Seattle, Chicago, other cities are adding things to car sharing, like Uber and Lyft, where they're getting money per ride. And I think that that's something else that we should be looking at.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so because right. So the difference is that there will be impact to people, right? And we are offering our streets. But it's also a way that cities are using to to make a little bit of money per ride when you're making having a company that is earning their estimate 200,000 a year.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So that there's other models that the cities are making a little bit per ride and we can wear and tear on the streets, all kinds of things. During the pilot, we can evaluate.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That, just to be clear that Jake Carter does not operate in San Francisco. So what you're reading, I think is more for Uber and Lyft, and that's a different type of model.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that's that's fine.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We can I just.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hadn't heard that right. So I continue to hear why is Alameda. Offering new things or, you know, and we seem to go back to people and say, let's pay a sales tax that's to parcel taxes. But then we have something like this where other cities seem to be more creative about another way that's a little bit per'",
        "'speaker_0': 'ride that we don't seem to be negotiating for our city. I don't see that here. That's something else, I think.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Oh, if I did want to make it, my understanding is that in the agreement that it can be amended or approved administratively. And so I'd just like to recommend that we make sure in the agreement that it says it comes back to council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh, so I.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Think we.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Need. I appreciate that. Thank you. So there's a motion. And second, all those in favor.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I oppose and I look forward to not receiving any complaints. Thank you. All right. So that I'd like the next.'"
