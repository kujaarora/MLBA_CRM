    "Recommendation to Accept the Fiscal Year 2018-19 Audited Financial Statements and Compliance Reports. [City Council/SACIC] (Finance 2410)": [
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, this year there is no management discussion of analysis because there was nobody qualified at the management level to discuss the results of operations. This, again, is serious. So I guess I will conclude with this. I hope that you see that this is a significant problem, that you give it the adequate funding.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I hope this doesn't happen again because this this this is this is bad. On a positive note, let's end on something positive. I wanted to thank personally Nancy Braunstein, who took over from her position as the head of h.R.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And fulfilled this role as interim finance director. And I think for some, I think she did the best job she could. I got emails from her at all hours of the day and night. We had a lot of conversation and I think that she did a fantastic job in the breach.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But. You know, putting her in that position, in my opinion, was a very, very tough assignment. And I congratulate her. And I just hope that the council feels that this is important, as equally as important as I do.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you for the time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Rooney. We do. And I appreciate you bringing these things to our attention. And I also second your thanks to Nancy Bronstein, who did an amazing job in the midst of all the COVID crisis. Madam Clerk, do we still have two other speakers on these items?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes, we still have two more people with their Henrys. Hopefully we can clarify and make sure they want to discuss that. Next is Aaron Frazer.'",
        "'speaker_4': '30. Good evening. I was hoping to comment on non agenda items and.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We're not quite. No, no worries. It's confusing. We're not quite there yet. We're going to wrap up this special meeting on the, ah successor agency to the the old redevelopment agency, essentially. So hold tight and we will get back to you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. And the other person lowered their hand. So they probably were also oral communications that we haven't gotten to yet. So. Okay. That is it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Very good. So then could we have a a motion to approve the consent calendar, which is items to a to be in to see vice mayor?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Then I have a question for staff, please. The city manager, Leavitt, the auditor, noted a number of times that the city council needed to fund or provide the. But I guess my question here very quickly, I know that we have a lot.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'None of.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It is there. I didn't see in the audit where it said we hadn't budgeted for enough staff. My understanding is that staff left and that we didn't have that. But we changed the budget so that there's a staffing concern that was out in the budget discussion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mr. HARVEY.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes, I can I can address a couple of those that question. I'll try to do it quickly. First of all, I agree with the city auditor on some of those concerns. I share those concerns and have. And so, for instance, this year, I'm closing the books.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, right now we're scheduled to close the books, and that's a very technical term, but we're scheduled to close the books probably a good four months plus earlier than we did last year. And I think that's because of the excellent work Nancy's done in working with the staff.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We had three key positions, two key positions just coming in in this calendar year, 2020. At the same time, the finance director left some of these issues, and my experience from past should never have happened. We're working to correct that, and I think we're putting the staff in place, including a new finance director, to to make sure'",
        "'speaker_5': 'that these things don't occur. Going forward, we are I think we did add one staff position, and I think that city auditor referred to that. We're trying to be cognizant of the budget and the budget constraints, especially with COVID and its impacts on the budget, but at the same time make sure that we utilize our staffing to'",
        "'speaker_5': 'the fullest extent. I think Nancy's working on that and we're recruiting, and he did refer to the two new accounts we're bringing in. So part of it was that it was budgetary. Part of it was we had several vacancies also on finance.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I would just ask thank you for those questions, Vice Mayor. And I will note that as mayor, I'm interviewed each year by the auditor. And and, you know, I expressed some concerns. But, Mr. Levitt, could you just give the council and the public an idea of where you are in the hiring process?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Because, as the city auditor noted, we are both without a finance director and I believe an assistant finance director as well. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We don't have an assistant finance director position in the city of Alameda. And the person that would be sort of the second person in the city for accounting purposes, she came in after the first year. So her thing was typically this audit would have been done by January one.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So her thing was trying to catch up. And I think she did work with the auditor on that, the the finance director themselves. Right now, as of today, we're in the process and probably in the next week will be offering a position to a finance director position.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And if we come to agreement, we hope by hopefully Labor Day or shortly after that, we'll have a new finance director in place, or maybe even shortly before that, we'll have a new finance director in place.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And so I imagine that council might like to have an update on this item. Just. Moving forward to today. Tell us what progress you've made. And I see Councilmember Desai with his hand out.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, thank you very much. I just want to make several quick points. One is I just want to express my appreciation to the city auditor, Kevin Kearney, for for emphasizing the key points that were raised in the memo.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think that was exhibit seven. I think while there are several new key points, that memo also goes over some of the issues that were identified in previous years, including, you know, where we are with regard to how we handle those issues.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So that's an important memo. The second point I want to indicate is, you know, it's really important to have complete full reports available for the public because that's the whole point of the the audit the audit, exhibit one.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I want to make sure to to double emphasized the need to have a complete and full report so that the public can can can look at the issues while we're on the subject of of Exhibit one. Their full 200 page audit.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'When I'm going over it, you know, the thing that I'm always looking for is the is especially the fun balance to see if if where we were at last year, we were relatively healthy. And I would encourage I mean, there's 200 pages.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There's just so many things to look at. So. So I try to figure out, you know, what are the few things out there that to me, you know, that I should really be aware of. So in terms of the the reserves, I would certainly direct your attention to page 85 of 205 or 85 of 205.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah. There you'll find a nice table that that expresses where we are with regard to our reserve. The total reserve that we have on that page is $41 million, believe it or not. So so if you do the math, you know, we're doing we have a fund balance of more than 40%.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So, you know, we have to we still have to be cautious because obviously COVID 19 is going to throw us a curveball, like it's going to throw many people a curve ball. But that's our total, the amount that we have not available or available like it's so the credit is so tiny is something like 20 million.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So so we have like roughly $20 million of, of, of fund balance that's available to us and another $20 million. So I'm rounding the numbers here that we've already reserved, but, well, $41 million out of a total expenditure of $9,099 million or so is certainly something to be proud about.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know, I think things like the where the economy is now and where where we'll be with the continuing COVID 19, I think, you know, we have got to hang on to our reserves. So I just want to end by saying let's make sure to have the the full publications available to the public as early as possible'",
        "'speaker_2': '. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember this like any other council comments. All right. So Councilor Vice Mayor Knox White.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I was just ready to make a motion to approve of the audit.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Please do. Okay. I mean, actually, the whole consent calendar. Do you want to pull that one out separately?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah, I guess. Sorry. I thought we had several removed from the calendar.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. There will be one less roll call vote. If we did a consent calendar, we had a motion by the vice mayor to have a second second. It's been seconded by Councilmember De. So any further discussion since then?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have the roll call vote, please.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilmember de SAG.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hi.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, everyone. Okay, so we now adjourn the the joint meeting of the city council and the successor agency to the Community Improvement Commission. And we move on to the regular city council meeting. Roll call, please.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Rocco has been noted. Five present.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And so then the next item is agenda changes. And I want to throw out a couple of ideas council, but it's whatever the majority's pleasure is. So we are starting this well after we get past a rather lengthy closed I mean consent calendar over on page eight, we start with a couple of short should be'",
        "'speaker_0': 'fairly short items and on six day we have staff waiting literally outside. So we don't want to leave them there. Too long. I my suggestion and see what you think is that. Although item six C was withdrawn and revised and added to a revised special meeting because some new information was discovered that had to be added to'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the staff report that threw the timing off. I would propose that we hear this item about the proposed charter amendment, also known as Measure A after A and B, and then then we go ahead to hear the item six D, which is the the appeal of the Planning Board's decision on the K Avenue property.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Then I would suggest, because I think there are a number of speakers that we hear the Jackson Park item after that and then the Greenway Golf lease and just then go into the rest of the regular items. And so fairly, fairly quickly, well as quickly as possible, move through those items.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So if anyone agrees with me. But I don't want to spend too much time in deliberation because we want to just keep things moving along. Councilmember Vela. To send mute.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm fine with those agenda changes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. I'm seeing a counselor O.D. nodding his head. Is that fine? Okay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Have you kept track of them, though?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I did. And the city called the city clerk and I discussed this this morning. I was just trying to be efficient, so. Do we need a vote on this? We do. Okay. So was that a motion by statement?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Vice Mayor move. Councilor Oti seconded roll call vote. Any further discussion thing then? May we have a roll call vote, please?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilmember de SAG.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hi.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Next, right. Hi, Odie. I Bella. Hi there. As Ashcraft, I carries my five eyes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, everyone. And so now the next item would normally be proclamation special orders of the day and announcements. This is what I'm going to do. This is kind of an accelerated adjournment. No, we're not leaving early. But it was my intention.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think you would all agree to adjourn this memory tonight in memory of Congressman John Lewis, an icon of the civil rights movement who passed away last week at the age of 80. So I just wanted to quote one of his many quotes, and I haven't had the chance yet to watch the documentary.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'John Lewis, good trouble, but I've heard some great reviews of it. So. So look that one up when you've got a minute. But one of the things, one of his quotes and this is a man who was known as the conscience of the Congress and managed to reach across both sides of the aisle and touch and influence'",
        "'speaker_0': 'his colleagues in all parties. But he was known to say, if not me, who? If not now, when? And I think that's something that all of us take very seriously. And it just is all the more timely today with everything before us.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we will adjourn our meeting in his memory at the end of the agenda. But it's a long one in for anyone in the audience who might not still be with us. I just wanted you to know that we are going to do that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So then we come to oral communications, and this is where a limited number of speakers may address the Council regarding any any item that is not on the agenda. We are like 15 minutes for these public comments. Now, if they can't finish in that allotted amount of time, there's another time, another opportunity at the end of the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'agenda. So I think we may have a speaker to enter oral communications. Do we, Madam Clerk?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. Yes, we do. First is Aaron Frazer.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And can you tell us how many we have? Because that helps us.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have two and then I think we have one zoom comment to read.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So it sounds like 3 minutes apiece.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hi. Welcome back.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. So I have some, uh, just to two quick things, and I'll, I'll be brief. The first is I would like to renew my call for all city council members to publicly state their opposition to any public safety unions conducting any independent expenditures or other campaign activity on their behalf.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think this is an easy thing as we're going through this special time for the city council to say, you know what, we're not going to take money from a special interest group that is opposed to us reforming them.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think it's pretty much straight forward. I know. I think actually a majority of you have agreed to this concept, but you haven't so publicly stated. So I encourage you to do so. That's comment number one. Comment number two is in contrast to the public health crisis.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'For discussion on tonight's agenda, I want to urge the City Council to take seriously the public health emergency of racism and declare such an emergency rather than take baby steps towards talking about, talking about.'"

        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So a U.S. drone attacks have been working in partnership to identify ways to address these mental health needs. Together, we created a whole new system of supports in the elementary and middle schools, which had the most significant gap in service.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'However, there was still a need to address the mental health needs at Alameda High and Encino High. And so the Board of Education in Alameda sought out support from the city and designated AFC as the recipient of the city's support to address these needs.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Subsequently, a new position was created to ensure that any youth coming to our health centers, regardless of insurance, was going to be able to connect with a clinician that's going to assess their level of need and support them in connecting with an appropriate service.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Next slide. So over these next two sides, I'm going to go over the services that we provided. So screening and assessments, initial meetings with the clinician, including you selling out a screener and a clinician conducting the in-person assessment.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We really wanted to make sure that any student who came in was going to meet in person with someone. They were going to get screened to determine their level of need. And then our therapist, through this funding, was going to provide them the resources to connect with an outside provider or provide that service themselves.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The next thing that happens a lot in the high schools are check ins. So some youth come into the health center and they don't necessarily want ongoing services, but they do just want to be able to talk to someone about a timely issue that's causing them distress.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We see this a lot during the beginning of the year, especially for freshmen who are coming in. And we see this a lot during AP testing, when the holidays are coming up, when you might be traveling to a different family member's house.'",

The drop in crisis drop ins and the briefing interventions that I spoke about earlier, there are 43 unique students and families that were supported. Many of them were in multiple locations where she was continuing to connect with the family and make sure that they were connected.'",

Additionally, this youth was also concerned and struggled with their perception of how their parents would re-inject their gender and sexual identity. And so this youth engage in our services, undermined our consent at first, meaning without parental approval.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But our goal was always to be able to support the youth in having support at home. And so we connected them not only with our our therapist, but our clinician connected them to some of the other events that are hosted and workshops by the health center that that client was able to connect with peers who are experiencing'",
        "'speaker_7': 'similar struggles and eventually got to the place where she was open and being able to have a conversation with their parents. And this connection was so great and being able to provide those parents with psychoeducation and guidance and really being able to increase that level of support at home.'",

You know, families were experiencing losses of income and jobs and being able to figure out ways to work with our local food bank, working with family support centers, and really trying to to make sure that family were getting their basic needs met.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Something that was awesome that this clinician did is we actually contacted every student that had come through our three health centers but did not have a confirmed source of support. So as I mentioned, you might have a student who comes in and does a check in and then they don't continue with a service or we don't personally'",
        "'speaker_7': 'connect them to someone. And so we went through and contacted all those youth just to do a quick check in and see how they were doing and see if anyone wanted to to start services. This clinician opened up six additional clients in the shelter in place, which was great.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You know, there was a shift in the in how her services were being delivered because we didn't have as many students walking in. So we were able to shift that more towards individual services. And then we actually also increased the frequency of those sessions for those youth who are really struggling.'",

So what we would recommend is that you give each party 5 minutes for their presentations and then you will probably have additional public speakers.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I would expect that the public speakers either want to speak in support of one of the two, the appellant or the applicant. So you might want to consider limiting theirs to a minute or so unless there's new information that needs to be brought forward.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But that's our recommendation on the Council's decision. How allocate the time?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I was supposed to bring that up too. So, Councilor, how does that sound to give each side 5 minutes, up to 5 minutes there? Okay. With that, I'm seeing some nodding heads.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Anyone object? Mayor?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You need emotional approval.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, we do need emotion. Okay. Device. Mayor's made a motion and Councilor Otis seconded Councilor Vella. So your hand up, did you have discussion or were you just going to second? Okay. Okay. All right. Any discussion? CNN May we have a roll call vote, please?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilor de SAG I not quite right, Odie. I Vella. I may Mayor as the Ashcroft. I am sorry. By five eyes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Excuse me. Thank you. So do we start with the applicant, then the appellant? Or what order do we take? Mr..'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I would recommend the appellant. All right. He is requesting this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The moving party. Okay. Got it. All right, sir. And that is Mr. Healy, is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I see his name has just appeared on screen. Are you ready, Madam Clerk?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Hello, Mr. Healey. Good evening.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hey. Thank you for taking the time. I just wanted noted real quick when I first logged on today. Before you start taking my time, I was able to hear your special session, your closed door session that you guys were going through and all that material.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I wanted you to know that I don't think I know I wasn't supposed to. But somehow when I did, I was able to hear what you guys were talking about.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That was on that was a completely separate meeting on WebEx. You logged on to Zoom.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'However, I logged in. I logged in on this. I could hear your conversations about workman's comp, about how you were going to pay people, how much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah, that was the recording out there. Recording out.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I was sorry. It sounded like your it sounded like your closed session under the minutes that you had presented. So I wanted to make sure that you knew that. Okay. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And just here, I had a moment of panic there, but.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Or maybe several. But no. On, on certain items and worker's compensation cases are one of them. It's very prescriptive how it's reported out. And so, yes, because we actually are on a completely different platform, I'm not going to tell you how to get into it, but completely different platforms.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So, okay, I'm going to get my heart rate down and listen to you speak. So we will start your timing when you speak now. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, dear honorable mayor and members of the city council. I appreciate you taking the time to listen this. Obviously, I disagree with it, Mr. Thomas, and the other people, and I respect their decision in this process. Even if you look at their record as they presented, they are stating that they have their design review process was'",
        "'speaker_4': 'based on the objective design review standards set forth on February ten, 2020. Normally, and I disagree with Mr. Chan, I've looked at this, you know, I went to law school, you know, lawyer to, um, I have found that you must present those documents to be enforced before City Council for them to approve that statute.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You know, that ordinance exists. If you're giving the city employees and board members appointed board members plenary power, you're given the ability to make ordinances and enforce things. If someone does not meet the design review standards, they can't get their building application, they can't do anything, and they have go against that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You can find them, you can cite them, you can have all those kinds of things to do to the board by itself, which is appointed, cannot make law. And that's clear in California, in the California statutes. So I'm I'm not going to rehash a lot of the time that we spent over about what Mr. Thomas talked about'",
        "'speaker_4': ', because, you know, there's you're going to go by council, what you have. I'm going to go by what I have. I just wanted to avoid a legal battle. I am not against this project. I'm wanting to see it go through properly of what we voted on.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We voted on a convalescent hospital, a hospice and a medical clinic. Those items are what we're having. What we're seeing in the plans are some permanent supportive housing that is not zoned for what we're doing. And if you're going to remove Measure eight, then and you're voting on that, I would recommend that you postpone or the proper'",
        "'speaker_4': 'word on Hawaiian moving this this this hearing move, this hearing until measure has passed, then you wouldn't get into these legal issues that are going to pop up before you. They will pop up and they're going to be an enormous cost to the city.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'My appeal was based also on the fact in this design review saying that I made no architectural decisions under the design review. Of course I didn't because as I read the code section and the historical planning part, I did not bring up in the planning board anything to do with the historical monument.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'When something is put on a historical watch list as based into the California law, it must go before the historical historical review board. This is a case it's well known in the city of Oakland with the Montgomery War Building, which is probably going to have to be revisited here.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So my concern is, is that we don't meet this an under the Allegheny Municipal Code. The penalty phase by not meeting this is that you have the penalty where no one can build for five years. I don't want to see that happen here.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And if we don't meet these steps as we set forth in the element admissible code and I don't know why they're exempt somehow you can go and look at the records when other people have buildings that have these designations and we'll look at the planning records.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They have to go before that process and it is designated in the planning board documents. It is not designated anywhere in this process that we've done here. So in an important issue, if the APC is going to receive funds from the Federal Government and from the state for the hospital.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The skilled nursing facility, the hospice, the medical clinic is a separate issue that does not have application to the state. And if it doesn't go through the ops, they cannot receive funds from those agencies. I'm not trying to stop this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm trying to set this on track. You guys have to go through that process. If you're going to approve the design review process, you're going to have to add them in that process. So, you know, I'm very concerned because I see all kinds of things in the application that was put forth to HHS and in that application'",
        "'speaker_4': 'are saying we're going to put X, Y and Z, and you're saying we don't have to abide by that because we're talking about the outside of the building, what it's going to cost $10 million in re remediation for the asbestos.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So why are you going to paint the whole entire building was taxpayer money. And after you do that you've got to take it all down because you got to do all the remediation issues. And the last question I have when you guys take a look is I'm running out of time in the application.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Mr. Big States that he has $600,000 of black grant bonds guaranteed for him for this building. Is that true? Where does that come?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Healey. Your time is up. And who is our speaker for the applicant?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Doug Biggs.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right, there's Mr. Biggs. Good evening, Mr. Biggs.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening, Kenneth. Can you hear me okay?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I can. Good. Yes. Nodding yes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening, Madam Mayor. Members of the City Council, as the staff report points out, accurately and in great detail, planning staff met the criteria laid out by section 3237 of the Alameda Municipal Code and acted properly, appropriately in approving the design review application for the senior living component of the Wellness Center Project.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There will be multiple design review opportunities coming before you. This one was specifically about the senior living component. The appellant's application, while making many unsubstantiated and outright false allegations, provides absolutely no justification or grounds for the appeal and should be resoundingly rejected.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We are working hard to alleviate the immense suffering of people who are living sick and dying.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'On the streets in Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'County. Since Mr. Healey and his backers first launched their attacks on housing medically fragile homeless seniors. Five homeless individuals have died in Alameda alone. APC has a place.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And we have a project plan that is ready to.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Go. The current health crisis has highlighted the urgent need to shelter and care for medically vulnerable individuals to protect not only them, but the larger community as well. The people of this community have spoken. The planning staff has spoken.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The planning board has spoken. Now it's your turn to speak, to deny these frivolous attempts to stop critically needed services for medically fragile homeless in our community. I'll in my comments here, in the interest of allowing you to move on to much more important topics that you're facing tonight.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But I'm available to answer any questions.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'About the design review submissions.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Or other aspects of the project you may have. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Biggs. And Counsel, do we have any questions of either the applicant or the appellant? Okay. I'm not seeing any hands. Should have. Councilmember de disagree you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Just a quick question.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'For for.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The for Mr. Healy. Is Mr. Healy's contention that this should have gone through the historical advisory board for for some kind of guidance?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes. For the design review process of the building as set forth in the Alameda Municipal Code, it should have gone as it has in standing for the building. Yes. Presence. It should have gone before the design review board.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The Historical Review Board with the proper terminology. I apologize. It must have gone before them to make the design and approved the design of the outside of the building to make sure it met the requirements as set forth in the Alameda Municipal Code.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm going to ask Andrew Thomas to add clarification from Steph's perspective on that question.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The code does speak to this very, very specifically and determined states that you need to be essentially demolished 30% of the building to trigger that review by the Historic Advisory Board. This was discussed and documented at the planning board.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And this project, these are the exterior changes don't represent and don't trigger that threshold as determined by the building official.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Okay. Any advice here? Hand it. No. No, I was just drinking water.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh, that's okay. That's allowed. Councilmember Vela, did I see your handout?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I just want to clarification, is Mr. Healy the new attorney for this group?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mr. Healy, are you there?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah. I'm. I'm sorry. No, I'm not. I'm not an attorney representing this particular group, and I'm not in a group. This group that Mr. Biggs is talking about, I'm not affiliated with, I don't know anything about. I'm not involved in that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I'm not sure. My focus is on making sure this is. I'm not against the homeless and I'm not and I'm not in a big group making some nefarious plans, turning my mustache. This is just to make sure we do this correctly.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So that's a no. And any further questions from counsel? Councilmember de SAC.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's called our legal staff.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Any time soon, identify the specific municipal code where the 30% trigger is described. You don't have to look at it. I mean, if you can just tell us within it before the night is out, that would be great.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Appreciate that. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Or any staff who wants to do so now.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean, if they can point to it, that'll be great.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's a historic advisory and historic preservation ordinance. It's the trigger, the threshold for review, for a certificate of approval. It's in the municipal code.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Thomas.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'll try to look up the citation right now.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I will take your good word for it. Okay. So then do we. So I think we've now heard from the appellant and the applicant, but I do believe we have some public comment. Is that correct, Madam Quirk?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Correct. We have two comments that were submitted and no one else on Zoom has indicated they want to speak.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Let's have our public comments. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. The first is Harvey Rosenthal. Before last year's special election, Alameda Point Collaborative Inc's campaign mailer asserted a wellness center would get homeless off the streets and had, quote, such as, I love my permanent housing and permanent supportive housing changed my life.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In fact, no housing is being planned at the site, as Mr. Biggs clearly wrote in his application to the Federal Government to obtain the Mackay Avenue property for free. Permanent supportive housing will not be provided at the project.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Voters were deceived. His initial proposal to the Government for 25 senior units has now mushroomed to 99 units. His application to the federal government states that the City of Alameda had committed a community development block grant of $600,000 to the project.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'A public records request to the city indicates no record of this grant. If that is true, it appears false information was submitted to obtain free federal property. The City Council is being asked to approve the design review of what is now being called a convalescent facility.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'No toxic remediation of the highly contaminated site has even begun. An extensive 2018 homelessness study done for the county by the Urban Institute emphasizes two things the need for affordable housing and better coordination of homeless services. Nowhere does the study mention the need for a centralized county homeless health facility, nor why one should be located in Alameda'",
        "'speaker_1': 'with its 231 homeless and no access to BART as opposed to Oakland. With over 4000 homeless are Berkeley with 1100. So who are the principal beneficiaries of this facility? Corporate hospital group funders said the facility will save many millions by more quickly, discharging county homeless patients to the Alameda facility.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Notably, Mr. Biggs. APC receives public federal land for free and after 20 years, can resell it to the highest bidder, potentially profiting tens of millions of dollars. The very communal nature of the facility with small individual rooms and shared dining and activities pose extreme risks in the middle of this and future pandemics.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In addition to their age, medical and mental illnesses, drug and alcohol addiction and smoking, the county's homeless are 61% male, 47% black and 17% Hispanic. Factors that increase their risk of dying in this type of facility. It is unclear what authorized health agency, if any, has approved the physical plant or layout of this facility to decrease the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'risk of contagion. To put the most vulnerable of homeless in such a potential death trap is inhumane. In approving this project, will the City Council accept responsibility when these deaths occur? And will Alameda taxpayers be liable for compensating the families of victims who succumb during epidemics in this communal facility that was never designed to prevent these deaths'",
        "'speaker_1': '? So does Jim Edwards.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The entire Mackay Avenue parcel for the proposed 149 bed facility for Alameda County's homeless population is on Almeida's historic study list with an AC designation. According to the Alameda Municipal Code, proposed modifications to a building with an AC designation need to be first presented to the Historical Review Board.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This was never done without first having this necessary historic review. The City of Alameda Planning Department and or its staff had no jurisdiction to approve the design. Therefore, the City Council cannot endorse the Planning Department decision to approve the design, since the Planning Department did not have jurisdiction when its decision was rendered.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The entire site is on the Alameda historic study list due to its significance as part of World War Two history. Alameda is contribution to it and to the men and women who fought and died during the war by covering the building with a sheet of multicolored metal panels.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The current proposed design totally conceals the building's very nature as an historic military installation and turns it into a generic looking commercial office building that could be seen anywhere. The up and down wavy design above the entrance door seems to make more architectural reference the roller coaster of the former Neptune Beach amusement park than to honoring the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'military history of the building. The design erases the authentic, unadorned exterior, which is a testament to the urgency of its construction for the war effort. Architectural vestiges of our nation's heroic efforts during World War Two are rapidly vanishing to conceal this building's military history and significance.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Beneath the flashy new veneer of the proposed redesign is to dishonor and devalue the memory and sacrifices of those who served the country in the war. It will also permanently, visually erase from public memory the historical and military significance of the site.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And Mayor, we had one additional person on Zoom indicate they wanted to speak. So that is just dire.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I was thinking that there was another speaker. Thank you. She texted me. Hello, Mr..'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Chair.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah. Hi. Can you hear me?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. So I joined this meeting to comment on another item, and this item was a little bit surprised.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Surprising to me. I was listening intently to the.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'People speaking on either side.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So this is this is about the facility that's.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Across the street from the Crab Cove Center.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And it's a former military facility.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I think, first of all, that if my history is right, World War Two ended 75 years ago. So that's that's the average that's.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's like around the average lifetime for for an American. That's like three generations ago. Those those buildings have been sitting vacant for a very long time. And yet, as as as.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The called one of the other.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Commenters mentioned, there are many thousands of homeless people in Alameda County who in some of whom need.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Are elderly and need a convalescent care. Well, the question isn't, why should these why should this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Facility be in.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Alameda? The question is how how can we how can.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We maintain an empty space that could that could that could accommodate these people who are suffering in our county? How can we maintain this empty space and not and not use it to the fullest extent to help these people?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And lastly, I would say that I think that what.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There is a number of.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Kind of canards that they wouldn't even try to enumerate in those two letters about various things. But the point.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Is, what are we doing with the assets that we have to help our community at this time where everyone's struggling? The homeless problems only get worse.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The esthetics. I don't think a convalescing elderly person.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Is going to care about the esthetics. I don't think we should either. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Q Mr. Geier, and just for the audience clarification, this is not city property, but it is located within the city limits. So is that, Madam Kirk, is that the extent of our public speakers now?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes, we are complete.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. With that, I'm going to close public comment on this item and open it up to council comment or and or a motion regarding this appeal. So who wants to start? Councilmember O.D. or vice mayor next. When I say if.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I was going to just make a motion and then we can discuss it, I was going to move that. We deny it. Move to deny the appeal.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. We've had a motion by the vice mayor. Is there a second, Councilmember de SAC? Was it your hand up? I don't know. Okay. So you got to be really careful about moving on screen people. Councilmember Odie, would that be your hand up?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes, it would be fingers. The second filing board's decision, right?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, that is correct. It's. Oh, hello. And the wrong idea. But, yes, it is just. Yes, it's. We're hearing this is a hearing to consider the appeal of the Planning Board's decision to allow the rehabilitation as stated. So it would be.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The motion was to uphold the appeal, as if I understood the vice mayor correctly. Yes, but I think if you study.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Deny the appeal.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'No, they for all this and uphold the planning board's decision.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. Okay. Did you second that, Rudy?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I will second that, yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. All right. And then, Vice Mayor, did you start the discussion?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I have to start the discussion. Thank you. I want to thank our staff very greatly in listening to the comments both from the appellant and from and that were written. And it's clear that there's a clear lack of understanding of what design review is, what is important.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I just want to say that I'm very grateful to have professional staff and actual lawyers who can review these things and make a determination as to what is and isn't following our rules. I know that our staff has a significant, significantly positive track record in defending these decisions against all comers.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And it would be my hope that if the appellant is not is true to his word and not against this project and not against the homeless, you know that he will understand that this was not a design review discussion that that that was tried to be had tonight.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think that this is that the voters did approve a project similar to this. They did not approve this project or conditioned the city council on approving this project. But it's clear that it's followed the appropriate process and has gotten all the appropriate approvals are really want to thank our planning board for doing a really fabulous job'",
        "'speaker_4': '. I did listen to the entire conversation that they had. I think that they really looked into the issues, took them very seriously and unanimously denied the appeal that went there as well. And tonight, I look forward to moving this forward and seeing this project get up and running.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor and outside counsel, go to your next.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Madam Chair. Thanks to the our staff for its very thorough analysis and point by point discussion on all of the issues raised on appeal. And we have it as a judicial body in these circumstances and not as a policymaking body.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But I did want to just point out a couple items that I wanted to make clear. And I think the ballot measure that was approved by the voters was to confirm the city council's zoning change. It was not to approve any design, any use of the property, it was just the zoning change.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I think the competing measure, if I'm not mistaken, was to reject a petition that some residents had submitted to rezone it in a different manner. So the whole purpose of that election was to litigate in front of the voters that decision based on that petition.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So, you know, the cost of the election. You know, I think if you're going to discuss the genesis of that, it was not with the city council, it was with the folks who wanted to, um, override the city council decision and zoned it something different.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So the other thing I just want to say, as far as the zoning relative to, you know, the war effort. The. It just struck me a little bit. You know, we've heard it in the public. You know, someone who holds a leadership office in this country basically say that we had two wonderful world wars and we shouldn't'",
        "'speaker_6': 'change the name of the bases because the troops that came out of these bases named for Confederate generals. You know, one these two wonderful world wars. So, I mean, all that it says to me is, you know, just because something may have been used during a world war doesn't mean that it has to remain the same in'",
        "'speaker_6': 'perpetuity. And in this particular instance, I think we all know the issues that homeless veterans face. And I can think of nothing more fitting than to reuse a building constructed urgently to fight the war effort. Granted, most of those veterans are gone, but to go play it, pay it forward, and assist other veterans who have served our'",
        "'speaker_6': 'country and that for whatever reason, our society has neglected them and forced them on the street. So I just wanted to get that in there, but just a couple of things. You know, I was a little disappointed that the cover argument came that we should delay this.'",

So I'll leave for my colleagues, especially those that have worked more closely on this homeless issue, like our mayor, you know, to kind of speak to that.'",

So 13 Dash 11.5 A reads No building structure site that has been designated a historical monument shall be demolished.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Comma removed or altered. Without first referring the matter to the Historical Advisory Board for US certification of approval. So we're clearly not demolishing. So that 30% threshold test is not relevant here. But I suspect we are altering. So my question to the legal staff is why?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Are we not following the strict, narrow language interpretation of 13 USA that says anything that's on the historical monument that's altered must go to the historical advisor? That's a question.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'All.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Can.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Follow up question. So under 13? Oh.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, I would just say I don't think she was arguing. I think she was just citing the municipal code.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. So so the follow up question is so under 13 dash 21.7 A, you are saying that? Removal doesn't occur. Any parts of the structure are not removed. When work is done.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And it's adaptive reuse.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This is the the we've been working with this portion of this code for many years here in Alameda. And if you're on the study list and you which is not a monument as. You. You just you're on the list.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Our codes were written to, and the intent all along has been. And this is the way it's always been implemented by this advisory board. If you're a historic study list property and you are going to demolish that building, you need to go to Historic Advisory Board first.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'To make sure that it's not a historic resource or something that should be a monument. And then the definition of what is demolition is 30%. So if you're just changing some windows or some siding on a study list property and it's not doesn't represent 30% demolition, you do not need to go to the historic advisory board.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So in answer to Councilmember de SACS question, if I understood it correctly, Mr. Thomas, you're saying that this project, this rehab rehab, it's an adaptive reuse project, essentially is not removing 30% or more.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'From the building, and that's the determination made by the building department. So each project, when we get the application, we take it to the building department. They make a determination if the changes the building represent a 30% demolition, if it doesn't meet that threshold, then it go to the advisory board.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'In this case, it did not.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. No, exactly.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. Final question. So removal has its own definition within 3013, dash 21.2. Which is called definitions. So within 13 days, 21.2, there is certainly demolition, which is certainly a word that's defined and including the 30% trigger. But there's also removal.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Removal is its word, and removal as defined, says Shami me the relocation of any structure or buildings from one location to another, as well as the removal of designated plaques, trees, plantings and natural features. There is no triggering mechanism there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There is no trigger that says if you remove 30% or if you remove 29%, it's okay. It just says removal. So. So what does. How does the 30% trigger of now apply to removal?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's there, but there's nothing that's being done with this project that represents removal under that definition. There's no designated plaques, no designated trees. None of those things are being removed and the building is not being removed. It's just being decided and putting new windows on it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So you're not removing kind of materials from the property designated.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If you read the last phrase of that designated plaques materials. Nothing's designated. No materials that are designated specifically such as palm trees.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm referring to the the part of the definition that says removal shall mean the relocation of any structure or building from one location to another. So building could mean, you know, you're undoing walls or you're doing undoing interiors.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's a building. So it's part of the building at least. So if you're moving it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I, you know, I think I'm hearing answers, consistent answers from Staff Councilmember Desai. That may not satisfy you, but we'll get a chance to vote on this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. And Councilmember Vela, you had your hand up, I believe. Did you? Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah, yeah. I was just.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Going to say, having served on the historic advisory board, I think we have a pretty good understanding and our staff has a pretty good understanding of of what comes within the jurisdiction of that board. And I think the standards that are used are are there and they're adhered to where appropriate.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The other thing that I would just add is, you know, in this came up when I was on the historic advisory board, but we spend a lot of time talking about how to keep these quickly erected military buildings, you know, conforming with their historic style.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And, you know, that that is very much in conflict with adaptive re-use and making them reusable. They were erected in some cases for purposes that really have no current use or applicability. And some of the ways some of the materials that were used were were used because they were readily available or because they would prevent too much'",
        "'speaker_8': 'destruction in the event of a bombing. Those might not be applicable here. I also want to get away from talking about how pretty a building is relative to, you know, this conversation. It's a matter of taste, which is subjective.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So we have standards that we adhere to in terms of the types of materials that get used. And of course, safety is going to be a top concern and priority. Often times that's not part of even the review before the hab is what materials are going to be used to make the buildings safe.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I just want to be very clear. I think, you know, our staff has given consistent answers. I haven't heard anything from their answers that are different from the interpretation of when I was on the Hab. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Gila and I will just wrap up the comments by saying yes. And you've heard me say this many times. I am the co-chair of a vice chair. I guess I am of this League of California Cities Statewide Policy Committee on Housing, Community and Economic Development.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And Councilmember Vela happens to sit on the statewide body with me. And we have studied the dilemma of homelessness in our state. And it is a growing concern. It has not diminished during COVID 19 and to the COVID 19 argument that would you really put these people in vulnerable categories together inside and during times of COVID 19'",
        "'speaker_0': ', I would pose the question Would you rather they have no chance of getting better and just die on the street? I would not. In fact, I am. I find it very sad to think of people coming to the end of their lives.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And in many cases, these are veterans. And you're right, whoever said maybe it was at one of our public speakers that most World War Two veterans, there are some still out there, but they're they're certainly diminishing because of their age.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'However, there is a significant portion of the homeless population today in California, in fact, in across our country, who are veterans of the Vietnam War, of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. So these are people, men and women who served their country.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And for a variety of reasons, they have ended up sleeping, unsheltered, living on the streets. So this to me, when I look at this project, I see a very exciting opportunity. It's adaptive reuse, taking a building that was there and converting it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And it's always less expensive to build to to renovate a project than it is to build new. It's still extremely expensive in California, but I know you. I mean, the opportunity to house fragile homeless seniors should be something that unites our whole community.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think that sometimes we just have to say stop and think how grateful we are, perhaps that our parents did not, that, you know, we were able to care for them or they had the means to care for themselves.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But that is not the case for everyone. So this is a time when we need to have compassion for others. And I'm very grateful to our stellar city staff. And I will just say Ms.. Chan has a very impressive track record in court.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'She's she's a great land use attorney, and I'm very appreciative of her legal counsel and as well as Mr. Thomas on this project. So with that counsel, did I see your hand go up again, Mr. Desai? Councilmember Davis.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. If I if I can just have offer my closing comments and if that's appropriate right now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If you may, because we are going to take a vote.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Then I'll just file for my comments.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'As Councilmember Otis said, I'll render them sitting in a quasi judicial manner. So I believe that Mr. Healy has made a compelling argument as to the necessity of going through one more public review of this project involving the Historical Advisory Board.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And the reason why I believe it's compelling is because when I look at the definitions, one of the definitions that truly strikes me is. So so here's the thing. The the operative municipal code is 13 dash 21.7 item A and that says and by the way, it was our city deputy city attorney Selina Chen who pointed this'",
        "'speaker_2': 'out. So I don't I don't want to you know, I want to give credit where it's due. Any building that was constructed prior to 1942 shall not be demolished or removed without the approval of a certificate of approval issued by the Historical Advisory Board.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So any building that was constructed before 42 shall not be demolished or removed and removed as a keyword without the approval of the Historical Advisory Board. And the reason why I think removed is where we should be focusing our attention on is because in the definitions of the municipal code at 13 Dash 21.2, removal is defined accordingly'",
        "'speaker_2': '. Removal shall mean the relocation of any structure. The removal shall mean the relocation of any structure or building from one location to another. And then there's the other part about plaques. Now, immediately after the definition of removal is a definite definition of structural alteration.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Structural alteration says structural alteration shall mean removal or alteration of the original foundation or structural elements. Such as floors, staircases being blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. So I have to believe. That there is going to be removal when work is done, removal of structural or removal of that fault, that that falls within the classification of structural alteration'",
        "'speaker_2': '. And structural alteration is a form of of a removal. And and. And 13 dash 21.7 The Key Municipal Code 13 Dash 21.7 Part A refers to removal of structures. So. I do believe that we need to give it one more go round to the Historical Advisory Board.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I don't think it you know, I don't think it delays anything incredibly. So for that reason, I'm going to side with John Healey. I do think this is a matter of my narrow involvement in this issue, is that I do think that there's a case for the Historical Advisory Board to render its decision on this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'When I look at the definition of removal, when I look at the definition of structural alteration, and I put that and I put those two definitions within the context of the key municipal code, which is 13 to 21.7.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So thank you, Mr. De. Thank you. Thank you. We've had a motion. It's been seconded. We've had council discussion. May we have a roll call vote, please?'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And by Magic Recreation Parks Director Amy Wooldridge has appeared.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening. Good evening, Mayor. Good evening, Mayor and Council. I'm here before you tonight to recommend that Jackson Park no longer hold that name and support the removal of the existing park sign. Parks are an important public spaces and their names are very impactful and should represent the values of our community.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And in that vein, on July 9th, the Recreation and Parks Commission unanimously voted to recommend to City Council the Jackson Park be renamed, since it's named after President Andrew Jackson, who's well known as a slave slaveholder and is responsible for the forced relocation and death of thousands of Native Americans among during the Trail of Tears.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The commission also unanimously voted to recommend removing the existing Jackson Park sign as soon as city council approved removal of the park name. Both commissioners and public speakers felt this expediency was important to send a strong message to our community that the racist views and actions of President Andrew Jackson do not represent our immediate values.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'A community committee representing diverse interests is currently being formed to recommend a new name for the park to the Commission and subsequently the Council before December 31st, 2020. The naming committee will bring name recommendations to the Rec and Parks Commission and subsequently the Council for final approval, as laid out by the City of Alamitos naming policy.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I also just wanted to point out that the purpose list of the city's naming policies is listed as, quote, to honor persons, organizations, places, or events in the history of the city by naming city facilities after them. This process acknowledges and memorializes those honored and enhances the value and heritage of the city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I look forward to hopefully bringing a new park named to you soon. And I thank you. And I'm open to any questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Ms. Wooldridge. And do we have any clarifying questions from the Council before I take public comment? So we have quite a few public comments. Any clarifying questions about the report? Council member Vella.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I understand.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The process. I guess my question is on the timing. Ms.. Woolgar, you said that it would come back to council in December.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'No later than December. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Is it possible that it would come back to us? Sooner than that. It just depends on the the committee.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Exactly. I hope to bring it to you sooner. I would. You know, it takes. But just timing wise, getting it in the commission that a month to get through approvals to a council, it takes a good month and a half just to get it through the bureaucratic process.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so that's why we're giving ourselves at least the committee to two or three months at most to come up with the appropriate names and hopefully a short list of names to give to the commission to review.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'I also have I want to share some concerns with Melody Montgomery that she mentioned about how committees and leaders within the community are chosen. You know, there's been a lot of talk about getting community input on a lot of these topics, and I kind of think that that's what we're doing here.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But the input here doesn't seem to make much of a difference. So I just wanted to second her there. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Our next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. So that's our last on Zoom. And we'll now go to the submitted comments. Ralph Walker, I nominate Don Grande for the renaming of Jackson Park. Excuse. Rosemary Jordan. I would like to add my name in support of a three part action today named Jackson Park, including one.'",

Develop one or more memorials or exhibits to be positioned in the park in consultation with Indigenous communities and informed by artists, teachers, librarians and curators who are experts in creating a positive and healing learning environment outside something that is a public health professional, I consider a high priority for our community's racial healing and learning and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'development. One option that I cannot support is a return to the generic original name of the park. We are at a moment in history where it's important to take bold steps forward. It's important that this park represent part of the awakening of our community to the trauma of past racial violence with a new community developed name.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We can help forge a new future with new symbols to unite us in a positive and loving vision of our future together. Thank you. Next is Laura Katrina. Good evening, Madam Mayor. And City Council. I support option one Denim Jackson Park, removing the sign immediately and starting the community renaming process.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Next is an anonymous text message I'm writing to support renaming of Jackson Park given he was a racist slave owner. Racism is a public health emergency. Please accept the Parks Commission. Unanimous vote to rename the park.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. And another. And I have a text message. Hi. I support renaming Jackson Park. Andrew Jackson caused irreparable harm to black and indigenous people in the US. Parks are a place for healing and rejuvenation. Renaming the park will help ensure that our parks are inclusive and feel safe and healing to all.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Next is Rashid Shabazz. Greetings, Mayor and City Council in memory of the African people that Andrew Jackson trafficked, hunted and held in bondage, whose true names we may never know. We ask you to Denham Jackson Park immediately remove the signage and support the community renaming process.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Andrew Jackson's monument does not belong here. Remove this racist symbol from Alamitos First Park. Thank you. And the last one is from renamed Jackson Park. Dear Mayor. City Council. City Manager and Recreation Director. Over the past five years, a renewed effort to eliminate and remove monuments to white supremacists in public space has taken place throughout the world'",
        "'speaker_1': '. In addition to memorials to the Confederacy, other symbols of colonialism, slavery and genocide have been removed or come under increased scrutiny. Alamy This first Park Jackson Park should be renamed due to Andrew Jackson's oppression of African and indigenous peoples.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Specifically, Jackson enslaved hundreds of African people at the Hermitage and the White House. Jackson earned the nickname Indian Killer for his participation in the murder of indigenous people. Jackson, as president, advocated for the forced resettlement of indigenous people in the Southeast.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Until we select a new name. Alameda must stop honoring the Indian killer, Andrew Jackson. Start the community process to rename Jackson Park. The Recreation and Parks Commission did not take action for two full years. We want racial justice and equity as criteria for the new park name, and we want an inclusive, renaming committee to select the new'",
        "'speaker_1': 'park name, including peoples impacted by Jackson's legacy. Develop the memorial at our new park for Communities Oppressed by Jackson.

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that was the last comment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Okay. So we go back to council discussion and Councilmember Vella has her hand up. Councilmember Vela.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So a few.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Things. One, I'd like to make a motion in support of removing directing staff to remove the sign at Jackson Park immediately and to approve a process, a community led process for renaming Jackson Park. I would also like to.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well, I think part of this discussion for me at least is remember that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we get a second and then we'll come back to you for discussion. Okay. So Councilmember Vela has made the the motion to approve. Councilmember de you have your hand up second. Okay, so we have a second. So, Councilmember Davila, back to you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Point of order.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, sir.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Does that include the naming also, or is that was that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes, to remove the sign. To remove the sign and to.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Organize that the community led committee to give input on naming.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The remaining naming it immediately.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'll add that, too, if you want clear clarity on that. Okay. You name it immediately.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To name it or you name it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To name.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It immediately and to form the committee on the renaming.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right. Okay. Okay. Continue, Ella.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Did you?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes. So, you know, I think a couple of things. One, to the speaker that that I think was Rosemarie Jordan who mentioned that, you know, we could go back to the original name. I think, you know, I'm in agreement that there are lots of things named for tree lined streets, our city or county.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'A number of streets throughout California are named Alameda. So I think going back to that name actually is not in line with, you know, the opportunity that we have here to take a stance and to be anti-racist. There are very few monuments that are named for black indigenous people of color.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'There are very few monuments, parks named after women of color or black women and indigenous women. I think we have an opportunity here to do more than just name the park, but to really honor, to honor people who are typically not honored through through this process of naming or erecting monuments.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I also want to add that I think this is one of these issues are renaming policy. I think there are issues with it are naming policies for our streets, for our parks. Is is a general issue. I hope that this is something that can go to our community led committees that are reviewing our various policies, that this'",
        "'speaker_8': 'doesn't happen again, that we don't have these these missteps where we're naming things for individuals who have been people who are slaveholders or who have committed genocide. And so I just want to put that out there that I think this is part of a larger conversation.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I also hope that this will come back to us well before December. I think it's there have been a lot of really great suggestions that have been put out by community members. I think this should be a fairly could be a fairly rapid process.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I also was a little troubled by some of the park discussion. There was a conversation about our parks have really been used and, you know, across the island by everybody. I think that that, you know, there is some concern by both folks.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I think that that's where who's involved in this process matters and how are they chosen matters. So I guess, you know, I know that we're reaching out to people, but I also think we need to create a process where people can also let us know that they are interested in serving.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I think that that's part of the question, too. It's not just who we're tapping, but who, you know, getting the word out so that other individuals can participate. And finally, I would just add that, you know, I think in selecting the group, I know we don't want to have too many people, but I think there have'",
        "'speaker_8': 'been a number of people that have been involved in the renamed Jackson Park movement who are. I have a connection here and who are from diverse communities. And so I do think that there needs to be representation from that group.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And just for clarity, the council is not being asked at this point to make any recommendations about what the park should be named, because that is up to the community group. I also echo what Councilmember Vela just said and also what Ms..'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Montgomery and Ms.. Anderson said about I would like there to be some sort of outreach process. Certainly. And I also was watching the Recreation Parks Commission discussion, and they're certainly the people we know who have come out and and we might have reached out to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm really excited that we're hearing names that we haven't heard before. And I always like to make the tent as expansive as possible to include as many people as possible. And I know one of our speakers talked about actually having that was Janice Anderson has ties to people who were involved in The Trail of Tears and perhaps'",
        "'speaker_0': 'she might be interested. I'm not volunteering you, Ms.. Anderson, but just say I would like there to be some process whereby people can express their interest and then there'll be some sort of selection of council members. Just like you said in this motion, you have your hand up.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So, yes, I just want to make a comment quickly. And I you know, we we must absolutely cast the net broadly when it comes to involving residents from all our different neighborhoods, because this is really an exciting event for all of Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'One of those rare pick me up that we can point to in the year 2020, in this time of COVID pandemic sheltering in place. So I see this as a very positive thing for our community. I think it'll rally us together.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So when I mean, you know, casting the net broadly, whatever the committee, a community committee, community committee that we come up with, you know, I want to make sure that I hear what their strategy is in terms of reaching out to Facebook, reaching out to next door, reaching out to whatever.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's what I need, that casting the net broadly sell this. This really seems really something that I think all of the residents in this in the future will turn back to is how gosh, remember that 2020 how what kind of a year that was.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But you know, people did come together to rename this one park in a vital part of Alameda. So I look forward to getting as much input as possible between now and December. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilor ODA, you're next.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Madam Mayor. Thank you as well for putting this together. The speakers who talked, you know, this is way beyond time for this to happen. I pretty much would agree with everything my colleague, Ms.. Viola said. I actually watched that meeting, too, and I normally don't watch commission meetings, but I think I watched two park board'",
        "'speaker_6': 'meetings in the last year.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But we didn't know we were on. So it wasn't.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You? No, I was right.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'By where I couldn't.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Get and I couldn't see anyone else.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So yeah, I was a little concerned about the discussion about just renaming at Alameda Park because my concern is that in 15 years it would be Alameda Park of the kind of be, you know, to use the term whitewash, nobody would really know the history.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And you know what it used to be, why that was a problem and why we changed it. So I hope that as my colleague, Mr. De Stark says, you know, we'll look back on this and remember it. But I think the best way to do that is to make sure that the name reflects you know, it reflects'",
        "'speaker_6': 'our true history. I think, as Alexia mentioned, we have to be honest with our history. And I'm just starting to understand all this. And I think I told the story on a town hall, I thought until about a month ago or three weeks ago that Jackie Robinson was the first African-American man to play baseball.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Because that's the way history story, right? Well, the reality it is. He was the first black man that white people that play baseball. So how do we tell our story and how we tell history? I think it's a massive changing in this country.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I'm glad that we're going to do this and to offer a valid point. There are a lot of other places Gosford Park, Calhoun Street, you know, just to name a few that. I mean, can you imagine if you're a descendant of slaves and living on Kelton Street and having to tell your your family or, you know'",
        "'speaker_6': ', look at your mail every day and be reminded of, you know, that man's history. And, you know, that's a trauma that most white people don't understand. So I think we need to work on this sooner rather than later.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And that's why I like the idea of sending this to this committee that we're going to talk about another agenda item. But, you know, this is way past overdue. I tell somebody, if, you know, I wasn't on council, I probably would have taken a chainsaw to it, but I'd probably be in jail.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So. But the sign needs to go. The name needs to go. And we need to make sure that, you know, we learn from this and we teach others in a way. We change this name, you know, and honor those that were victims of this man.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You know, it's kind of weird that, you know, some guy's a hero because he wins a battle after a peace treaty is signed. But, you know, that's a whole nother story.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is that it for you, Counselor?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We, Amir. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. If I say and I say thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I'll try not to tread any any ground. Of my colleagues, I think I agree with everything that has been said very, very wholeheartedly. I think for me, there are a couple of things that I want to focus on.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I was listening to a podcast, still processing podcast yesterday, and they were talking about the Dixie Chicks changing their names to the Chicks and how. All right. Basically what they said was we didn't want to miss out on this moment.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And the response to the folks on the park from the band from from Jenna Wortham was That's just FOMO. That's just performance. If you don't move on and exclaim what the changes and and explain what the harm was that you are removing as you benefited from, etc., you have not moved the issue forward.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You have just hidden it. And so I think in the guidance, I'd like to make sure that we are sending and you know, I heard it from from a number of my colleagues already is that coming out of this can't just be a name that is rappers more representative of Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There needs to be some sort of acknowledgment that this change happened, why this change happened and what this change reflects. I think that's for the community group to to determine how to do that. But whether it's on the signage, etc., I think that that's really important.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I also want to encourage our staff when we cut this thing down and I've got a large saw, if you want to meet me up there in about 3 hours, I can. I'm happy to. You know, but seventh here.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Let's go. But when we cut it down, we're going to have a good six month period where there's going to be no new sign and whatever else. And I want to think about what we're doing with that space.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think that this is an opportunity, while we're engaging the community, to actually use it, to encourage the community to engage, but also to really call out and point out that that change has happened. I don't think it has to be a big, fancy $10,000 sign, but I think that I think that I know that we have'",
        "'speaker_4': 'three more parks coming online soon. Councilmember Odie mentioned Got Free Park if we're changing Jackson Park Godfrey Park named after a mayor who literally said and we have city minutes where he says we need to put policies in place to keep black people from moving to Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We can't perform at some long dead history historical person and not look at our own direct personal history at the same time. And so I would like to I would like this committee to start engaging a little bit around how we're going to move forward with all these parks and the names of these parks.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then whether or not it's a part of this, the police enforcement and safety committees or not, I think that the city really should look at we do have this movement. We had an official letter submitted to the planning board today or yesterday asking for Calhoun Street to be renamed.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We are going to hear more of this. And I think that this is an opportunity for our city to actually engage some citizens and thinking about how do we rename? When do we rename? You know, you get into these trickier issues.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'George Washington, first president of the first president of United States. But on slaves, you know, where do you draw it? Where were our lines drawn? I don't know the answer, but I think that if we could think about engaging our community and kind of just this this this discussion around naming and whatnot, it's not the truth reconciliation'",
        "'speaker_4': 'work that Mr. Shabazz and other have encouraged us to consider, which is something I look forward to, to supporting at some point in time, but at least is a step there. And I'd like to look at that. And then lastly, I just I want to you know, I want to use this opportunity, you know, to to echo'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Councilmember Vella, Mayor Ashcraft, their comments. This opportunity should allow us to question how we're forming committees and to start developing not just this committee's way that we do it, but the city's way that we do it. And then we can put it in place.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And honestly, I know that there's a rush to get a new name and whatnot, but if it takes an extra four or six weeks to kind of figure that out, and that's why it's going to take it to December, I think it will be a huge win for the city if we come out of this with that'",
        "'speaker_4': '. So I think it's an opportunity there for that as well. But, you know, I do have a great appreciation for for our rec and park board with some of the members made some shifts over the last two years after listening to our community.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I appreciate that. You know, big shout out to Commissioner Barnes, who I really, really stepped up and answered the call along with others. And I just wanted to give great appreciation. I didn't watch live, although I did get Councilmember Otis text who said, Hey, should we see if we can get this on tonight's meeting?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I was happy for him to make that request because I know that we are for the public who says we don't move very fast. This was slated to come in September and staff work to make sure that it had hit the last meeting in July.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So, anyway, I look forward to supporting this. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And I also concur that I, I would like to see a little extra time taken to put the application process out to the public, because there might be people who spoke tonight. There might be people who are watching tonight who didn't speak, who might be interested.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think this is is an important opportunity to be inclusive. So we've heard from all the council. Oh, I'm sorry. Of course. Ms.. Walters, let's hear from you. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I just on a high note, I just wanted to to add. So we sort of take I've heard all this feedback about committees and putting in outreaching about. That now we're able to do that. And also since we have so many people listening.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Anyone who is interested in serving on the committee, who's listening, certainly feel free to email me. It's on the website. It's LAPD at Alameda, S.A. and that will get to the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I imagine will come up with a public announcement, too.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Absolutely. But I just thought I'd put it out.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, I appreciate that. Now in real time. Councilmember Vela.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I had a question.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Threw the chair chair vice mayor. He mentioned some things that he would like to see. Is he asking for an amendment to the motion that there that there be additional direction added for staff to look at ways to create to use the space of the signage to to allow for I don't know, artistic opportunities or are you'",
        "'speaker_8': 'just giving that feedback?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I would certainly welcome it being at it, but I offered it as feedback. But if there's support for that, we want to have that. I would certainly support doing so. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And is that just from mis voltages perspective. I mean we're not I don't think we're allocating any funds to go along with that but. No, but but to look into it I think was the was the direction.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah. And I think we do have a we do have a.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Public art and city hall program and there have been other opportunities where we've engaged with members of the community. I think that there is something that perhaps can be looked into by staff about seeing if there's an opportunity for.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think in particular, if there's an indigenous a local indigenous artist or something like that, that could could perhaps use the space. I think there's different opportunities. So I'm willing to amend the motion to include the direction to staff to look into that opportunity.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So that original motion has been amended. Councilmember de so will you. So second that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sure. Second.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. All right. Yes. I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'One last thing. I just want council in the community to know we will get the sign down as soon as possible. But as much as I'd like to take a chainsaw to it, it's actually made out of solid concrete, concrete, not wood.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so that means it's not coming down tomorrow. Just so the council knows, we have to rent heavy machinery to pick up this solid concrete sign. So we will we will call tomorrow. We will get it done as soon as possible.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'With it with a fairly substantial base, as I recall from the recent Parks Commission decision discussion. Okay. So thank you. Anything. Thank you. From anyone. All right. We've had a motion. It's been amended, but that amended motion has been seconded.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'A motion made by Councilmember Vela, seconded by Councilmember de Sok. Madam Quick, may we have a roll call vote, please.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilmember de Sang.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hi.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Knox White.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Great appreciation to Rasheed Shabazz.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Aldridge. And counsel, it is 10 minutes to ten and we have been meeting since 5:00 tonight. So I'm going to call a little break. I propose that we come back at 5 minutes after ten.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That work, thumbs up. Okay. All right, everybody. And just a reminder, you probably want to both mute yourself and turn off your camera. All right. 1005 seven. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Who do we have to see? Looks like we're missing Councilmember De Saag.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Oh, he says.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'He's slipped under the table for this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'He has a little desk there that he's at that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. Okay. Then it looks like we have everybody. The city manager. Uh, there's Mr. Abbott. Okay? Yes. You all very.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We've gone through.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Beg your pardon?'",
        "'speaker_6': '33 items I think we've run through.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We are on a roll. You guys are doing. You're doing incredibly well. Thank you for helping move things along. I appreciate it. I'm sure the public does, too. Are we ready to go, Madam Clerk?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. And we're on item to see, I believe.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, ma'am.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. It's a recommendation to authorize the city manager or designee to execute a one year license with Greenway Golf Associates for the Grandview Forget Pavilion located at 300 Island Drive, including an option to extend the term of the license for one additional year.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And Ned, do we have are you presenting Mr.. Leavitt? We don't have Mr..'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Our present will be pretty. It'll be relatively brief. This is a the proposal before you as a21 year with a second year option for a license agreement with Greenway for the grant grandview grandview pavilion to Lisa Grandview Pavilion because of the circumstances with COVID 19, it is a license.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's short term and would typically be an approval that could go through staff. But because of the history with this particular facility, we felt it best to bring it to council for approval. The first year is split into two sections, the first six months because of COVID 19, and the uncertainty of whether they will get any income'",
        "'speaker_5': 'is for a 5% of gross revenues. The second six months would then be for 10% of gross revenues, which is a doubling of the first six months.

        "'speaker_6': 'And maybe that's maybe that's a legal question. But my my concern is you can kind of see, right, that we have these side agreements and then people don't for some reason are unable to comply with them and then they're going to get evicted.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then someone can say, well, the agreement trumps the ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Like the ordinance does not require an agreement. So beyond that, if you choose to enter into an agreement, then I guess I, I mean, I guess I would defer to the city attorney on what that then becomes a breach of.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I guess when this was in your record.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Then I think it would also depend on the nature of the agreement and the drafting of the agreement.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This is.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Highly unusual. So we won't. It's difficult to predict what a court would ultimately conclude. We think that it is likely.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That a court would conclude that it's probably just a breach of contract.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But because we're talking about hypothetical agreements and we don't.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Know what they say, it's difficult to conclusively say what.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They would be on it. It is our it is our thinking.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That most likely those agreements.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If these are these would be private agreements without any input from the city, nor could we, because they're not we're not a party to these agreements. We think that that there is a reasonable likelihood that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'A court would construe those agreements to be contractual and not subject to.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Unlawful detention. But we certainly could not render an opinion without knowing what the agreements substantively say and even if we did. Given the unprecedented nature of.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This type of.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Order and the lack of judicial guidance. Of course, we'll have to ultimately resolve it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. I mean, you could tell it my concern is right, that, you know, these would be substituted for leases and or you know, we already know there's unequal bargaining power between a landlord and tenant. So, you know, I, I could see where someone could be pressured into agreeing to some waiver of rights that they're given by this'",
        "'speaker_6': 'ordinance and then, you know, suddenly being subject to eviction. So if there's a way to fix that, maybe we could think about it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, if I may respond to. Yes, but landlords require tenants to.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Enter into those leases. It would have to be.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Voluntary if a landlord required to do so, it would violate our fair housing of a well.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah, but we know there's unfair bargaining power positioning, so.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. So we hear from our public speaker or speakers, please.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Catherine Pauling.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Good evening, Ms.. Pauling. Hi.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's just Katherine. Can you hear me now?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, I can hear you just fine. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm I'm I'm honorable mayor, vice mayor and council members. The Alameda Renters Coalition supports the expansion of repayment and ordinance 30 to 75. We believe this action is also a necessary component of the recent declaration of racism as a public health emergency.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Given the disproportionate impact of COVID 19 on too many communities of color due to systemic racism in terms of work, health and housing. Additionally, we are hearing many renters are confused about their rights under the various ordinances. Our requests that a greater effort be made to inform tenants of their legal rights and the resources available.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'As Council has noted, 25% of Alameda residents do not have online access. It's reasonable to assume that most of these are renters with local papers, limiting print editions and COVID 19 limiting gatherings. It's difficult to communicate with our diverse communities.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'For these reasons, ARC requests a mailing to renters be done by the city, possibly drawing from the rent registry and provided in multiple languages. Respectfully submitted the Alameda Renters Coalition. I also want to add our concern to families point.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Debby Potter. Just Miss Potter just mentioned that tenants are being encouraged to go into agreements about repayment. And at a time when people are not back to work and don't know what their future income or employment is, I would request that you not encourage agreements at this time, especially given the tenant has to be able to go'",
        "'speaker_3': 'into court to present these arguments and so many ways the power imbalance really precludes going into this, or have them talk to an attorney or our legal service before they enter into any agreement so that they have some advice on this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Okay. So. And Ms.. Weisler, that was the extent of our public comment on this item we did.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'One more person raised their hand. So we have Janet. Jennifer Rakowski.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. Good evening.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hi. Thank you. Council members for contact. I staff a landlord tenant counseling line for a neighboring city. And so I can't speak directly to Alameda, but I can tell you that our phone lines are flooded with calls from people who are struggling to pay their rent even more.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we are constantly inundated with people who are seeing the writing on the wall with too short of a time period to pay back the rent that they are already owing. And so they are breaking leases because the prospect of paying it back on a really quick timeframe when they're still out of work just is overwhelming.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And the reason. So everything from people who have personally had a health issue due to COVID 19, had a death in the family due to COVID 19, had roommates move out due to COVID 19, loss of job. Just the stories I hear on a daily basis are heartbreaking and the ways in which the city can take this'",
        "'speaker_3': 'issue seriously and look at ways that provide for. A reasonable planned expectation on the part of landlords, but also a pathway to stability that is achievable for tenants because tenants are already moving out because the prospect of paying off the debt too quickly is overwhelming.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And we have one more speaker.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I understand now we have two more, so.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Another one added Grover Whitman Brown.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. Good evening.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hi. Good evening, counsel. Grover Cleveland Brown from Eastbay Housing Organizations. And I'm calling on behalf of oppose membership to ask you to vote yes on this important extension of the repayment period. And also to echo the previous caller, the need for tenants to have protections is only growing as each month goes by and as unemployment insurance is'",
        "'speaker_3': 'about to be reduced for many thousands of residents. And so we ask that you consider the strategy that's been adopted by other cities and counties, which is to try to translate the unpaid rent into consumer debt so that tenants are not faced with eviction when they can't pay essentially two month's rent at once for six or eight'",
        "'speaker_3': 'or 12 months, which is unable most people are unable to pay two rents any month, let alone month after month after month once they return to work. So thank you for considering it, and please reach out to us if you have questions about how other ordinances are working.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. One more speaker. At least one?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes, just one more. Kevin. Lauren.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hello.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I again.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hello again.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Really in support of this because I am a fellow renter. I moved here about two years ago, leaving my family's home and taking care of my grandmother. So and I'm an artist and obviously there's no work to be done and everything is very uncertain.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So knowing that Alan Miller would have my back in a situation and like want to keep me here, would make me feel really, you know, cared for in a the fact that something that we want to implement is really going to be for showing compassion to our citizens, especially if I'm struggling and I'm white passing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I can't imagine what people who are forced to work, who are, you know, of the minority groups like being black or because of color, like they probably are really struggling even more than I am. So I think it's really important to think of assistance in this situation.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then 1/2 everyone go over and have them probably like I think they make really strong points and I hope this passes. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Now we have one more and then a public comment submitted in writing to next is Alexia Orocobre.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hello researcher.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hi. And I just wanted to quickly echo, support and urge that you all vote yes on this extension. I think it is very important not only for residents but to be able we all know what's coming. And I think it's important to protect the renters.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I just second everything that was also previously said. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And a written comment, did it say.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes, Rosalynn, to Courtney, property owners or not? The bankers have tenants. If the city wants to pay the rent through subsidized payments, that is up to the city. Thank you. And that's it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'With that. I have a clause, my own commerce clause, have a comment and we will go back to the City Council for a motion and for the discussion. Who wants to lead this? Councilmember Odie.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'll start. No hands came up. I'd like to move approval of this, but if possible, in my companies that are amenable, give direction to staff to come back with an ordinance that allows us to treat any of these side agreements and even this type of unpaid rent as consumer debt that we we did this one in in'",
        "'speaker_6': 'March. So I use my CPR skills. April, May, June and July. So now we're coming up on five months of unpaid rent. And maybe the truest thing that ever came out of the White House was that the worst is still yet to come on this so mean we could be looking at another five months and then what'",
        "'speaker_6': '? We have tenants with one year worth of rent that you know, it will end up being double. And I don't want to see people get evicted over this. And there's to me, there's no action. You know, in our state capital, there was a bill to do this exact same thing to reduce consumer debt, and it died because'",
        "'speaker_6': 'the real estate lobby killed it. And, you know, there's nothing coming out of Washington anytime soon. So if we have the ability to do that, I'd like to see us try to do that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Um, I just to follow on to Councilor Brody's comments and other public speakers. I would actually like a clearer understanding of what. What exactly that looks like. And then the question I would have for counsel for the city attorney is, would that be a significant enough departure that the ordinance would have to come back to us?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But. But can someone explain what how does that work for to convert? Oh, okay. I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes, sorry. My suggestion was to give direction to direction, not to amend.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Got it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we could do that, too.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Um, well, I would think that passing this ordinance is of the essence. Time is of the essence. But that's. I'm one opinion up here, so. Okay, so. But could I. Could I get an explanation briefly from the city attorney or from Miss Potter or whomever?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'How does that work? What is it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Is.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I would like to defer to the city attorney who I think has provided direction on that issue of consumer debt previously, and I think has indicated, at least previously that it was maybe not something that he felt we could do.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I don't know if at this point like a federal issue to look at that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. If we could just have one speaker at a time. That would be great. And actually, are you prepared to comment on this, Mr. Chen?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'll generally.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Say that we're more than happy to look at ways to look at these side agreements.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And to provide as much protections for tenants as possible. And we obviously strive to effectuate your direction to us.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Whatever it may be.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And we've expressed some concerns to you about a general conversion of renters debt to consumer debt, notwithstanding other jurisdictions having done so.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But we're having express.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Reservations, too. We're happy to take your direction and we'll effectuate it to the best.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Of our abilities.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you. Okay. So. Do we have? My iPad always has a moment where it decides to freeze, so help me out. Councilmember Vela, you had your hand up. Did you?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I was just going to say that, you know, I think that I'm fine giving direction. I don't want to change the current ordinance before us. I think that we need to get it enacted and give people as much notice as possible that we're we're we're giving this change.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I also think that essentially passing protections without notifying the most vulnerable of their rights, it means that we're essentially not passing protections. I have read a number of different articles. There's an article in the New York Times about a bar in Oakland and the people that work there.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And many of them were concerned about making rent because they were worried about addiction. This article came out at the end of June. We all know that there have been a number of protections that have been passed preventing and effectively putting in a moratorium on evictions during the pandemic.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I'm very concerned that people don't know their rights. I've gotten some emails offered to the city attorney, and I'm not just talking about residential tenants. We have commercial tenants who don't understand their rights, and I think there's a little more.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'These are folks that have potentially have more resources available, things like that. And they're dealing with the same landlords, frankly, that that also have residential tenants. So I just I think, you know, we need to get the word out about what, you know, what the protections are.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We need to do it in multiple languages, even if it's that we do a mailing and or require a posting in buildings, we require landlords to notify the tenants or we require postings in apartment buildings, on the community boards, things like that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm very worried. We also have a number of very vulnerable tenants who are not leaving their houses because of preexisting conditions or their age or a number of different things that put them at risk. Maybe they're immunocompromised. Some of these individuals do not have access to the Internet.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'They're not seeing what's being posted online. You know, I know of some individuals who didn't even know about the opportunities that the food bank and things like that or opportunities to get food delivered. And so at this point, it's really become a word of mouth thing.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'In the past, I'd also spoken with the mayor about doing something similar to what the city of San Leandro is doing and what some folks are doing in Oakland of going through and calling individuals. I just want to put out there that I'm more than happy if we do have a registry.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We have phone numbers and things like that. I'm more than happy to volunteer my time to call through and let people know about the update, not necessarily to give legal advice, but to just let them know, you know, what the updates are and what services are available.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Because I think the word isn't getting out to our most vulnerable. And I think that this is an opportunity for us to not just do the work, but make sure that it's the protections are really having the effect that we intend them to have.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Councilmember. And you know it. And just a little housekeeping detail. It is 1054 and before 11:00, I'm going to have to ask for a motion. But do you have a quick comment or should we slip?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I mean, I'd be happy to amend my motion to give some direction to notify people in whatever way you think is appropriate. You know, so that's perfectly fine.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Would you like to do that?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes, I would. But we can talk about that after.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, I didn't know if we had a motion to vote. We take care of this item. But you think there's a lot more discussion still?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, I don't know if.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You know, if if what the customer suggested is okay with everyone or we needed to have staff come back with a plan that we wanted to review. And, you know, I don't I don't know. I mean, I'm open to whatever whatever my colleague feels is the most appropriate and effective way.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, I think I heard the staff direction made that council member who remind me can call somebody. Did you make the motion?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes, I did.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And Councilmember. Well, you seconded, correct? Okay. Um. In less than 5 minutes. What can we do? Or we can.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Do you if you want to.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Oh.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, sir. Councilman, I mean, city manager.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'If if you want to just put direction. I'm all right. If you want to put direction at the end of the motion, the staff can create a communication plan and follow through on it and communicate it back to the council.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We could do that, especially since we're going on break between now and September or potentially that way we could go ahead and get that communication out in this time frame.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Makers of the motion.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I mean, that works for me. We still have a second reading on this this ordinance. So I don't know how that would play in, but I think the sooner the better.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think in the discussions that staff has had, we would begin that. We've talked about starting the communication outreach after the second reading so we could test the materials and then after September one, knowing that it would become effective 30 days later.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then he knew what it was. Sorry. I hate to interrupt you, but I get nervous because the city clerk is counting on us to do this before 11 and it's 1056. So council, we have to. We've got a couple of remaining items to go.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have item six G, which should be pretty fast. We've, we've looked at this before and and then we have items ten A which is designation of voting delegates for League of California Cities Conference. I mean, that shouldn't take long with conferences until October, if I recall correctly.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But anyway and then we have our two big is the two A and the five the continuation of five A. So do I have a motion? I tend to think we can get all this wrapped up the same evening by midnight.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But he's got a motion. With 3 minutes remaining.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I remembered that notion that we continue until midnight.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. With a motion to continue. All items until midnight. Do you have a second? A quick second. 6 seconds. Any discussion thing then? May we have a roll call? Vote, please.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilmember de SAG.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Next flight.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Odie I.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Vela. I may or as the Ashcroft.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Carries by five eyes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. Good work, everyone. Now it's 1058. We had 2 minutes to spare. Okay, Miss Potter, I cut you off. Please continue.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's quite all right. I was just going to say, I think it would be helpful for staff if we had a little more direction. Part of the motion is council would council be requesting us to come back with an ordinance dealing with the side agreements and the consumer debt?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Or would you like us to analyze that and come back with with. I was a little unclear about that piece of the motion. That's all.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Understandably, the vice mayor has his hand up.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'He's got those.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Plans.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Jason has had his hand up for about 10 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm so sorry. I just didn't realize that you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Had a lot to say before we get into.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Clarification. We might want to talk.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So just.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Further, thank.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You very much for.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Your time. Here's the thing, Councilor. You are low on the screen. Oh, sorry. You have to really wave to me or text me or something. I've got it. Thank you. Yeah, I did not see that. My vision, you know, it's just.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I have to look out of the corners of my eyes. See, you are so Councilmember Desai. Great.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, thank you. All in. Good. Just so my comment is basically this, you know, homeowners and renters alike are definitely struggling through this pandemic. But I think the census data clearly indicates that renters are especially vulnerable given that their incomes typically are half that of homeowners and the fact that they lack the assets that homeowners have.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean, right now I'm in. Interest rates are so low, they're at historic lows for homeowners who are contemplating refinancing. So it's incumbent on city council to step up when it comes to helping out our tenants, our renters.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I see. And the and the item tonight, a reasonable effort when it comes to assisting renters. In addition, I believe that that it's a it's a reasonable effort that also were would benefit landlords in the end because it you know they can keep their their tenants around if they have a more reasonable debt load to carry'",
        "'speaker_2': '. And basically, what we're what we're doing is amortizing it instead of over seven months, over 13 months. And I think and I think, you know, that's reasonable. We're not saying five years or anything like that. So. So. So that's why I definitely support this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I support this also because, you know, originally the ordinance did not have a loan payback provision and it was there was a modification to it. And I think the modification to it was reasonable. And the amendment that we're contemplating tonight is reasonable.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'As to the two other items, you know, if they're part of the motion, so be it. But you know how I feel about those two other items because I don't know I don't know about this consumer debt issue.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And in terms of the other matter that was raised, I'm not too sure. But but I think for the main the main issue that we have before us in extending out the repayment time from seven months to 13 months, I think that's quite reasonable.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think, you know, in this time that we're in, I think renters needed to know that we were on their side.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And again, my apologies for missing you. Okay. I need to raise my hand.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Or wave or jump up and down. You know the simple vice mayor.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. I will second the Councilmember Baysox comments and the comments of my my other colleagues. So I wanted to ask a clarifying question. So because we have to have a second reading, this does not pass on September 1st, correct?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If it passes on second reading, the second reading is actually the beginning of.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'September and it actually becomes effective then 30 days following the second reading. But there is sufficient protections in the existing ordinance so that it will be a routine ordinance versus an urgency.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes. No, I think I think that that that makes sense. I guess what I was trying to think of is, you know, given that that direction, which will be clarified about communications plan, you know, which I will absolutely agree, needs to be multilingual and robust.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It would be very helpful to me that we are getting to that point where we may be asking certain certain people who might have a second unit or something like that. And we do hear from seniors who are who are impacted by this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It would be helpful. I don't want to undo this work. I think this work is important. We need to do it. But it would be helpful to me if maybe even during the second reading, we could have a presentation of what else we are doing or could do to help those landlords whose tenants are not paying work'",
        "'speaker_4': 'or are not are not able to pay rent. I'm not interested in, you know, subsidizing, you know, kind of corporate large corporate entities for whom this is just a giant investment. But, you know, if we have people who own one or two units who may actually be really impacted by not actually seeing rent for a year, which'",
        "'speaker_4': 'quite honestly is very possible, you know, if 25% of people are already not paying their rent fully, it just might be. I would like to know kind of what is available in terms of protections from the state and the federal.'",

And, you know, again, reserves are for rainy days if we need to be helping renters who can't pay their rent to landlords who can show a financial hardship, I do wonder if we should be looking at that as a follow on something as well'",
        "'speaker_4': 'as this, you know, as this drags on, it was much easier for me to say three and four months. You know, that that's a tough quote, but we can fight that. But if we're starting, my guess is this the state of emergency isn't over before the end of the year.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I just I just I want to start looking ahead instead of finding that people are in dire straits. And now we're trying to help them out of dire straits and just think think through that. So it would be great to have that come back sometime in the near future.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I don't want to add a whole nother new priority, but if we could think about how we can have that conversation, I think it would be good. But I'm here to support tonight's resolution because I think this is a step.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'It's more heavily weighted to local businesses that there's still some allocation for renters. So I would I think it would be useful to know that information. Okay. Let's see. So, you know, my feelings are this is is very necessary.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And. Back when we were looking at this first one in April, we just had no idea. That's not cool. I know. I've got to stop. I'm just going to fold my hands in my lap and stop fidgeting. Of any way back in April, when we looked at this, I think it was April, we just had no idea'",
        "'speaker_0': 'where, where we were going with this. And we we still don't, although I'm hopeful, ever hopeful that, as I like to say, time and science are on our hand, on our side, if we can just get people to really comply with the COVID guidelines.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So there's not a whole lot of them wear masks, socially distanced, watch it wash your hands frequently. Don't go into crowded places. We can make a difference. But in the meantime, people have not been able to go back to work.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And and it's, you know, you think of all the stress that, ah, people are facing who are struggling to put food on the table. And, you know, to the extent that we can help out, I think this is a very thoughtful ordinance that came forward.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I also do agree that we need to make sure that the information is out there in multiple languages. So however, that can be done and and disseminated as widely as possible. But I think, you know, we've got the rent registry and we have other ways of knowing where the renters are.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I am sure that's doable. So then, okay, so we've had our motion, it's been seconded, we have staff direction, anything further that needs to be said before a roll call vote. Okay. Let's have that all covered, please.'",

So I'm wondering if you could release some very clear public document, maybe not written like a staff report, which is great for council, but less so for a general public, really clarifying the process in ways that's clear because even I still.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Don't fully understand. And I've spent a lot of time reading and talking about it and also. And. What was the. Oh, and then a question is if how as the public at any point in this in the process, if something happens, you are the person able to hire and fire police.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And this the various subcommittees are going to be making comments.

I am concerned that weeks and we are looking at an appointment of a subcommittee that will then appoint various task forces that mainly seem to revolve around review and maybe data, but not enough action. I am also concerned about the amount of autonomy the city manager appears to have in appointing a subcommittee.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There's already plenty of data and reviews regarding policing policies and racism, specifically in towns and cities similar to Alameda. So it's unclear why folks still feel we are so unique or immune to racist policing practices. The community has spoken time and time again, especially last week, regarding the resolution that disappointingly did not pass.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This plan tonight has limited detail on how the community, the committee will be chosen and and the rest of the task force's. It's very unclear. It claims it's community wide, but there's no definition of what that means. Will these groups be reflective of the island's makeup?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Will these groups be reflective of the marginalized communities impacted by these issues? Or will these folks be primarily those with privilege and access to the people who are choosing? For example, if folks are already emailing and that assumes that they have access and whatnot.'",

They may or may not be working still and trying to make judgments of how much time they can give that clarity of expectations and avenues for real, meaningful input from people who are most impacted gets through in what feels right now'",

The Council needs to instead set up a process where the community gets to choose the steering committee members.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I suggest doing so by having the council or city manager with community input select various local stakeholder organizations such as the League of Women Voters, the local ACLU group, the Alameda Point, Collaborative, local faith leaders or communities, and have each organization entity select a steering group member.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That way, the steering committee will truly be community led. Thank you. Next to Seth Marvin. I'm writing to support the resolution before the council tonight to release Paul O'Leary from his role as Alameda police chief. The chief's got to go under Chief Roll Aries leadership.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Alameda has only grown in reputation as a son downtown, meaning a place where people of color don't want to be caught after dark for fear of being treated the way Mr. Molly Watkins was treated. Is that the Alameda you want to live in?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The videos clearly demonstrate and the district attorney has now confirmed Mr. Watkins was unlawfully detained and unlawfully arrested. He was also disrespected, provoked and then assaulted. Chief Roll Airey has taken no responsibility for this. He should have declared outright that what happened to Mr. Watkins was clearly unlawful and shameful.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And this was only the most recent incident that was caught on video. The chief's gotta go. His inflated salary and benefits package alone should be reason enough. It's way more than that of chiefs in much larger cities. The chief's gotta go.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Chief roll area also demonstrated he's willing to give the appearance of making sweeping changes without any input from the community or council. He's also demonstrated he's willing to use paid time to lobby the city council by soliciting emails from supporters and then forwarding them to the city clerk.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We see that he wants to keep his power, to keep his status, and he wants to keep his budget. But he's also actively working to undercut much needed change within the police department. The chief's gotta go. His continued leadership of the Alameda police is a danger to Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And. Next is Savannah Cheer. Good evening. While I appreciate that there were some initial efforts made to address transforming Almeida's vision of public safety. I'm very concerned with how these efforts are starting out. If this entire process was meant to be community led and sourced, how come the community wasn't engaged by the subcommittee?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If that engagement is instead going to be left to the city manager and the formation of the steering committee. What was the purpose of the work done on this for the past four weeks? What are the specific ways in which you will amplify the needs and contributions of black Alameda and Alameda INS who have experienced harm from'",
        "'speaker_1': 'policing and have been most affected by oppressive systems? I am hoping that you will provide a great deal more detail in tonight's discussion. As it stands, what was published in tonight's agenda is insufficient. Coupled with your total bungle of last week's Public Health Emergency Resolution.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Things are looking great in our city's pursuit of racial justice. As you've heard me and countless others comment in the past six weeks or so. There is no time to wait. Marilyn, you invoked the heroic and beloved John Lewis earlier and said precisely what I would like to know.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If not now. When? When? I hope that you'll be able to answer that question tonight in your discussion of this topic coming out of this meeting, it should be abundantly clear when we're going to see action taken on divesting from policing and investing in our community.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. And last is Dorothy Marvin. Dear City Council. Given that the Council agreed last week that racism is a public health emergency, I would suggest that health care providers voices are included in the steering committee. I further suggest that each steering subcommittee is comprised of at least 50% bipoc and that we compensate members of the steering'",
        "'speaker_1': 'committee. This will help create inclusive structures that support diverse participation and avoid exacerbating the minority tax. And that's all.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. So with that, I closed public comment. And I am always impressed with the the depth of the comments that we get, many of the comments that we get. And I wanted to just address a few things that jogged jogged my memory.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So, I mean, I'm happy to hear more from the assistant city manager, the city manager about that. I know you were taking notes, but I think that the public asked some good questions about how is this going to be an open process for application.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What I would say is this is the first time we've done something like this, at least in recent memory. There may have been previous councils, but not not in the time that I've been involved in city government. So it's an ambitious undertaking.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think it was Jennifer Rakowski raised some questions that we had. Councilmember Bell and I had certainly raised in our meetings with city management that what are the reasons? And this is something that the community members have spoken to us and I think or would like to be that the city manager had spoken with about.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Taking the lead in this community members, not him is one of the the things that you look at if everything starts out to be Brown act is just the length of meetings. And so while tonight council we would have spent what 7 hours in a meeting, not all on this one topic, but any of these topics could'",
        "'speaker_0': 'certainly run a number of hours, especially with lots of public comment. Again, not to say never any public comment, but but if we've heard even people calling for let's move out of formal meeting roles to have real ordinary communication, I think that was the sort of first level that that people were interested in doing, however.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So the time commitment is something we have to be respectful of. We knew what we signed up for when we went. We might not have realized the full extent of it, but we ran for office. But these are community volunteers.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Val and I would like to find a way that there be stipends paid perhaps to those who participate or meals provided. I mean, even though you'd be doing this from your home because we're not having in-person meals any time, if you know that there's ways to to be respectful around that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But anyway, what what other suggestions.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That Madame Mayor and I think that direction was that that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Direction was expressly given by the Council at previous meetings where we authorized the use of stipends, making sure that equipment was available for people so that if they were going to do Zoom meetings, they would be provided with technology to do that and things like that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think the council unanimously, I believe, gave that authorization in June. So I do want to put that out there for people that are trying to connect. How does all this fit in together? But I do think it would be helpful for staff to talk a little bit about the selection process, how people let let it be'",
        "'speaker_8': 'known that they're interested, that sort of thing. And I know we talked about it within the subcommittee generally, which is kind of generally what that would look like. I do want to also address there. There's some people that are saying, can you just make the change?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Now, it's hard to have it be a community led process as the council is just giving direction on changes. So I think this is trying to strike that balance. I also think, and I believe there was direction previously given about including black, indigenous and people of color and centering these voices in this process.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And then also that, you know, there's on the one hand, people don't want politicians and electeds involved in these in these committees. They want it to be community led. And then on the other hand, or you know, and by the way, I got emails from people, I got, you know, calls from folks.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That's who I heard from our people that reached out throughout this process. But if we if we as council start selecting individuals for who's involved, then it becomes this very bureaucratic Brown Act process. And for people that are concerned about timelines, for the community to get back and make recommendations through the city manager and to the Council'",
        "'speaker_8': 'about actions, concrete actions we can take, that's going to prolong the process.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Councilmember Odie mean just a question through the chair. I mean there was a suggestion from I think maybe more than one of the four live commenters that the subcommittee involved. I mean, does that also entail as much bureaucracy and, you know, bring bring the process into the purview of the Brown Act?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Or do you still have that flexibility? If we just said, you know, it's the city manager with the two of you or not? I don't know. I'm just asking.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Let's hear from the city attorney, Mr. Shin.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We believe that if any council.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Members are involved in the selection process, whether one or two, it will be a Brown committee.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I would just say in answer to your question, Council member Odie, I, I have a lot of faith in who I think would be the steering committee to reach out. And I mean, well, not only to reach out but to receive any and all applications.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think just because I just want to I do want to touch on something that Councilor Vella said that I know people want this done yesterday, but I just want you to know that we hear a lot about what other cities are doing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I will tell you that tonight the Oakland City Council is considering their task force to move forward with speed and diligence on reimagining public safety task force. That's the task force. And they have the following project timelines. September 29th, 2020 is the introduction of the task force and December 31 is the draft task force recommendations presented to'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the Council March 31. I think we've what we've lined out, lined up what was in the staff report about short, medium and long term goals. Some things we can accomplish more quickly. Others take a little more time. And we've heard other members of this body say, you can do things faster, you can do things well, but you'",
        "'speaker_0': 'can't always do both of them at the same time. Councilmember Odie.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm going to when it's time for comment, I'll make my comment on that. But so then I thought the four live speakers, they all were good, but the four speakers ask them questions that. I don't know. Are we able to answer those?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Because there is some concern about like who speaks for for who. And I'd like to make sure that, you know, the the voiceless are have an opportunity to participate. I mean, Melanie mentioned that both times that in her comments and, you know, her and I had a discussion today about it, I open open disclosure.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So, I mean, that's a concern.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I'm maybe.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You can talk about it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Maybe you can't. But let me out here. I'll listen.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, I'm I'm pointing that to staff. And I am I do hope Ms.. Montgomery is going to apply in whatever format there is. But staff, I think we've come to the point where we could use a little information for you so we can make informed suggestions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Ah, but counsel. Oh, they are. There are 4 minutes left until midnight and I know we said we would go to midnight. Do we want to give ourselves a little more time on this item? The other option that the city clerk and I discussed briefly earlier today is that if we had to continue to another, can you'",
        "'speaker_0': 'change the meeting to another date? Thursday of this week is a possibility. But I've seen shaking heads so. Okay. Councilmember Ody if with what to what motion.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'd like to at least go to the 1230 because I think we have some momentum on this topic and you know, we all are like, I know it's late, but I'm kind of engaged in it, so. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So there is a motion to extend to 1230, is it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah. And then, you know, maybe we can consider maybe tacking it on to Saturday or something.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Oh.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And the vice mayor has his hand up his knee. Okay. So it's been moved. It's been seconded. Any discussion since then? We have a roll call vote, please.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilmember de SAG. I like.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'My.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Own. I though.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'May be Ashcroft.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I carry sci fi eyes. All right, thanks, everybody. KASELL, Brody, I think you were still speaking, right?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah, I'm in. I can just get my comments, then. Um, well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I. I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Sorry. I think three of us now have asked the question of what the actual process would be, and then that doesn't include the the public speakers. Would it be helpful to hear from staff about how people can get community members got engaged?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I didn't want to. Councilmember. Yes, that would be helpful. The council member already was in the middle of a sentence.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I mean, to the extent that that can be answered, yes, because, um, I'm going to be really brief when I say what I'm going to say. But I if we can answer that question, sure, I'll wait.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. All right. Who on staff would like to address the questions that you've heard the.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Audience sell out all the attempt to answer it? Marisa Ashcraft And say council. And so I'm what I will the way I will answer it is if it was a city manager appointed committee, here's how I would visit it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm not trying to compare it to any other type of established committee, but just sort of how how I envision that is that there would be probably 3 to 5 steering committee members. I've it's been somewhat flexible at this point.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And the reason it's somewhat flexible because I wasn't sure what this discussion tonight would produce. So you can't have anything definitive until you have the discussion. So I'd see 3 to 5. I'd see that starting hopefully appointments probably within the week.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then that would be starting. I as far as people wanting to be involved, I do not see that the committee would have I don't see that the committee would have what I would call designated people representing entities.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I would see that people would represent themselves and that anyone would have that opportunity. And I think when people talked about marginalized individuals or individuals of color or just marginalized individuals in particular, that I want to encourage people to do it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And that's part of the reason I don't want to have people that represent groups or interest groups, but more people that represent their own views so that you have a natural, more community based approach. So that committee would be appointed and then I would rely on that steering committee to then or subcommittee to then make the decisions'",
        "'speaker_5': 'as far as what I call task force. That's my term task force. And there's five or six areas that we're looking at. And then that could be very flexible people, could it? If you don't have it under this committee concept, if you under this committee concept, if people come in mid process, they could still add people mid'",
        "'speaker_5': 'process. So if people find out about it through the process, they'd be able to be added. How do people let us know? I actually put my email here on the chat here for those that are still on here, but you email myself or the assistant city manager or the say manager's office.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Any of those three emails or you could contact councilmembers and councilmembers to forward your names to us. Any of those would approach and I I'm trying to have a process to be more inclusive. That's how I would see as more inclusive and including different viewpoints.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think that's the way you would go. I believe the assistant city manager already laid out sort of the timelines that we're looking at, which have some consistency and probably a little more aggressive than what the Oakland timelines that were set out in the mayor's statement just a few minutes ago when you were talking about what was'",
        "'speaker_5': 'on Oakland's agenda. Hopefully that answers some of the questions and I can clarify more.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And in addition to emailing you, can we also put something out on social media, different platforms that we you know, that where we reach people.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes. The answer is yes. The question, Eric, I think he had to get up for your light. It was social media was we can we get it out on social media as well and other platforms like that? Yes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes, we can.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Let's see. What. Were there other questions that. Oh. You know, I had one starring in to you, John. Vice Mayor, there were some speakers who and they expressed their concern with how you having. Oh, too much autonomy.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so what? Tell us what the city manager or city assistant city manager's role in this would be as far as any recommendations, what comes back to the council? Can you give us some information about that?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So this process is is probably a little different than some processes in that people really want a community based process. And so that's where the appointment of the the subcommittee or steering committee, as I call it, would happen.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then they would be involving other I would be we would be a filter of getting names to them as well as they would also have names, but they would appoint those committees and then they would be looking to collaborate with my office and getting resources.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So if they have questions, if they're trying to get data, there would be a flow and collaboration and support from my office. So that would be how I see it. But the recommendations that were being come in to my office would then be put together in a report and go to the council.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It wouldn't be filtered. It's just that's the way the process. We're trying to have a community based process. At the same time as something that has a city element that brings back a formal recommendation to the city council eventually and so or and reports back to the council.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so that's how I'm trying to create the process. There were some other questions and I want to just steer to another thing real quick about Brown Act. So a lot of people when I deal with committees, a lot of people don't understand with Brown Act that understand the sunshine ordinance that so for instance if you have'",
        "'speaker_5': 'a committee so let's say one of these subcommittees has five or six let's say it has six people. If it has six individuals on it, some people don't realize that if three of those individuals get together, they've actually violated state law under a Brown act, because under Brown act, you have to do noticing if you're going to'",
        "'speaker_5': 'get together and talk about a subject. So if they wanted to have an informal discussion, they would have to have to do it. So there's a lot of rules and regs and sometimes people don't understand that. So this would give a little bit more flexibility while also involving the public and also trying to have a formalized process'",
        "'speaker_5': 'to get recommendations back to the council. Because ultimately, when you're talking about things like police services and you're talking about budgets, those will be city council decisions eventually between now and the spring of of 2021.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And Tony has had a cancer day. So sorry. You've had your hand up. Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sorry. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Quick question. How do you envision the task force taking community input? Or is is the task was just going to talk among themselves over whatever subject matter there. What's what's the engagement?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That that's a good question. And I think some of that has to still evolve and some of that has to evolve from how the task force believes it's best to be able to engage the community, or I call it the steering committee or subcommittee.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We've called it three different names. But but the committee or the overall committee, how they get public input, I would want that to somewhat evolve from what they think are the best routes. So I don't have that predetermined at this point, but I don't see it that it would just be from within themselves.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I don't see that as an option. But how they would engage people, whether it be through social media, whether it be through other means, I haven't predetermined that because I think you need to give a certain amount of that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They need a lot of autonomy. And that would be part of.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The point is that they will and they just happen. Yes, they will. It's just how they do it is the issue. Okay, I get it right. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hey. Did I face me? I was calling on you, but I might have been muted.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I have some comments that I had another couple of questions. I've heard a couple of times that there were people who informed. Who are the people who informed this process? I'm curious.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All the people the same age she's been talking to.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Or the subcommittee talked to you about the subcommittee. You both have mentioned that you've spoke to people who gave you the advice and curious who was.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Will give them the conversation, I think. Okay. Who's informing?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Why do I keep doing that? Okay. So I can.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I can list people. I've talked to a number of people throughout this entire process. Rashid Shabazz, Robbie Wilson. I could you could you could do I could send you every email that everybody sent me about this topic as I've read through those.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'John, you had recommended that I talked to Shalom. I talked to Shalom that that also informed it. I think that, you know, I listen to public comment. I mean, I could literally I think probably hundreds of people have kind of informed the process for me.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I haven't had specific conversations about who's going to serve on different committees. My recommendation has been for people to email, and so that's what I've done.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'll jump in. Most recently last night I had a Zoom meeting. The youth activists of Alameda asked to meet with me via Zoom and and I told them that I hoped they would apply to be on these subcommittees because one of the things I've been doing a lot of reading about what other cities and not just in'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the Bay Area but in other states, because this is this is happening around the country, which is a really good thing. But they do talk about the need to have representation of typically underrepresented people and not just somebody who knows someone.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so one of the two individuals. But I think there's a third I guess I'll throw out the name and they can tell me if I'm wrong that I reached out to because I was so impressed when I heard him on your town hall this there was a gentleman named Al Mance and he's with the public defender's'",
        "'speaker_0': 'office, Alameda County, and he was interested in helping guide this process. And he knows Joleen, right, is someone who's in the community and oh, I'm lips. You know what? I guess I've been steering this discussion so much that I'm out of time that I was just informed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'll tell you more if you vote me.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I will move to waive the time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And you would second that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Can.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Maybe we have a roll call vote, please.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm remember they said not. Not. I O.D..'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Uh, let's just try to keep it short, though.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I vellum high.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'As the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Ashcroft I and I will. So al-Mansour was interested in then Joline Wright is someone that he he knows and she's that there are parents of school children and they know each other in various ways. She she's an amazing organizer.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think she's a she's an operations manager for an architectural firm. And man, she runs circles around me as far as organization and then a name that was mentioned for one of the steering committee people. But again, I have not been involved, so I don't know if they've connected with the city manager, but it was Christine'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Chilcott, who is well known as the executive director of Girls Inc of the Island City. And so I think and what when I have gotten emails from people saying I want to be involved, I'm forwarding them off to the city manager saying, you know, put these in in the file.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I don't you know, I would never want it to just be people who know to email a councilmember. So that's why we want to get the word out far and wide. I would say that I do think that the people who have been following these discussions and attending these meetings and speaking are really natural constituents.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I take copious notes and there's a number of your names you can always say, know that we'll try to hopefully will be will be contacted. But I I'm just like I said, I'm excited about just doing something that we haven't been done before, but spreading the word far and wide.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Brody, was it who's who? I mean.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I can just go out. I'll just make my comments and then I'll turn it over back. It's really not for me to decide who's who the leaders of the black community are. It's not for me to decide who the voices of the black community are.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I hope that in selecting people that our staff has heard, for example, the four speakers that spoke live, this agenda item and that has spoken to other agenda items and real and recognized that that's going to be a challenge.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Um. I'm going to quote an African-American mayor, and I hope that it's better than the last one I did. I read an article where the London breed was interviewed talking about her Vogue interview, and she goes, I want people to respect the opinions, the feelings of black people, and allow us to decide what is in our best'",
        "'speaker_6': 'interest. The black community is capable of speaking for ourselves and deciding what's in our best interests. And she went on to accuse white progressives of projecting beliefs onto African-Americans and stating that many progressive policies historically backed by whites in San Francisco have not worked for the city's black residents.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So what that tells me is if I say, Oh, I would do it this way, or No, I would prefer that, or maybe you should do it that way, or I should be critical of that. Or No, that's not for me to say.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's not for me to project. It's not for me to say, you know, this policy should work, uh, or, you know, pigeonhole the committee into a certain direction. It's me. Step back and listen and let the community process take its.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Take its place. Because, you know. It doesn't really matter what I think. It's going too fast or too slow. It matters what the people who are most impacted. You know, whether it's going too fast or slow. So I'm not going to be critical of anything until I hear what they have to say.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then I will use the levers of power that I have to accomplish what they're asking. But in the meantime, I'm going to step aside and not try to project what I think is best for them. And on this community, I want to hear what they have to say.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So that's kind of where I am. And I appreciate the work of the subcommittee, and I hope that the city manager and our staff has listened to these comments that our commenters have been making over the past few weeks about this.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And let's the black community in Alameda tell us who their leaders are and who should represent them and let them decide what's in their best interests. And, you know, not white people.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I just have to say, when you were quoting what London Mayor Breed said, one of the young women last night in the youth activists of Alameda said something very similar. Vice mayor, were you next?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Sure. So I have an issue with this not being a brown act body. And with the exception of the noticing, which I think is not a problem. I don't think the other issues that were were highlighted is why it shouldn't be a Brown act are really that amnesty.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I mean, I think that, you know, a committee can have subcommittees and that subcommittee can meet in without violating the Brown Act with small groups and get input when there are sensitive conversations that need to happen with groups that don't want to come to public meetings, etc..'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I think setting up a process that is supposed to be very public and transparent and bring everybody in, bring the entire community into this conversation. I think setting it up where it's unclear when they're meeting and who's meeting and where the the committee members themselves are meeting as a majority, possibly without notice, because they're just having'",
        "'speaker_4': 'conversations and developing answers, I think is kind of problematic for me. I am struggling because on the 29th we heard last week about, you know, we unanimously appointed a subcommittee and gave some direction on what we'd like to have come back.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And what we're supposed to come back with by the 31st was, you know, kind of a subcommittee, some community objectives and goals and a work plan. And we're three little over three weeks past that, and we don't have any of it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so I'm going to reflect a little some of what we've heard from the community about the what is going on. We don't seem to be moving forward. And my concern is that we are slowly getting to the place where we're really probably not going to have real recommendations in time to have the budget conversation that we'",
        "'speaker_4': 'committed to having in October. I will be really surprised if these subcommittees are really up and running before the end of August because of how long it's going to take. If we're really going to do this, I don't know how we can appoint the steering committee made up of a broad group of community members who don't know'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that this steering committee is going to be done in the next week. So I've heard a strong commitment to making sure that we have a have a deep pool who have been pulled in for this conversation. But that's going to take some time.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You know, I think we need to be also clear because I've heard some confusing comments. You know what, we gave direction on and what came back to us tonight is about policing. And not a broad overall conversation about systemic racism in the entire community and everything that falls under that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so I think that we are we are having conversations about conversations that need to happen. But I think that we need to be clear as we move forward with what the scope of this is. Personally, I would like to see us give some very specific direction to the city.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I want to be really clear. I have no problem with the city manager making this decision. I have no problem with him empowering a committee of community members to take this and run. This is not about community or not, but I think that, you know, giving some real strong guidelines of expectations is one of the goals that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'we have in this in terms of, you know, how we would like. You know, I'm kind of this considered. And I think also, you know, I would like to have some commitments to timelines for when things are going to be done.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And well, you know, there are some check ins that may be happening. They are not we don't know that they're going to happen. And I think some of them are we should talk I don't know with what is this check in in September going to look like if the group is just starting to meet and engage the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'community at the end of August and early September. So, you know, I think I don't know how to do it, but I would like a commitment to the to the steering committee. And if the subcommittees are going to be independent groups working on their own, that they you know, I would call it a steering committee and then'",
        "'speaker_4': 'have committees and then you can have subcommittees on the subcommittees that can go out and have non Brown Act meetings when when those are needed. But the community will at least know that the committee is not meeting in secret in the old backroom of all these days, you know, with the way the way we used to do'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it. So, you know, that's that's kind of where I'm coming from. I honestly feel a little frustrated that after the conversation last week that that we're still kind of trying to figure out how to how to even start moving forward.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It feels like we've kind of gone backwards from the 29th at this point in time to starting all over again. So I guess I'd like to hear their maybe just their maybe majority support to move forward, and that's fine.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But, you know, if we can't make a commitment to having this be an open and transparent process with our actions, I won't be able to support it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I just want to call in Councilmember Vela, but I just want to point out that one of these subcommittees is about addressing systemic and community racism and also anti-racism. It's not all about policing, although I'm sure it's tied up in there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Vela.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And you know, I just want to address a couple of things. There are a lot of resources that go into having publicly agendas, notice meetings. We have to have staff present. We have to agenda is that we have to make sure it's not at a time that conflicts with council or any of our other committees.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'They have to then agree to the meeting, date and time, get it posted ahead of time so there is no impromptu. We're going to have able this group can meet next week. We're going to go meet with this group next week.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I don't think the intent here is to not have a transparent process. I think that's been made abundantly clear not only by this council that that's the expectation, but by the community. And I think that if we end up with a process that does not include publicly agendas, meetings, that does not include opportunities for community input, and'",
        "'speaker_8': 'where the task force essentially nobody knows what they're doing and nobody knows who they're meeting with. I think this is going to fall apart really quickly. I think it's going to fall apart basically before September. So I want to put that out there.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We always have the ability as a council and frankly, if we wanted to, we could agenda something for September to say, you know, if we if we want to do to say, look, we want to have a very transparent process and we're going to all now start picking people, because I think this goes back to who is'",
        "'speaker_8': 'doing the selection and how do we go about doing that and who is making the decisions about who's in the room. And I I'm of the mindset that I do not want to be the one making the giving the direction about this is the goal.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think I've heard a lot of different things, frankly, from the community, all sorts of different things from from various community members. And I think the whole purpose is to allow them to goal set. And I you know, I would also add that I think and this is something that I've struggled with, is how do we make'",
        "'speaker_8': 'this a transparent process, but how do we also allow for and stretch our resources to allow for the most meetings possible and things like that? When I'm looking at other cities and seeing what went into their reform processes in terms of how they got the feedback, it was a process that wasn't confined by or expending resources on'",
        "'speaker_8': 'like, you know, 50 different meetings that were all televised and very formal. They went out and they had these informal meetings. And I don't know that there's the same benefit of speaking with a subcommittee of two as there is with actually having these meetings with a full subcommittee.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I think, you know, and this is something that I struggled with was how do we create this process in wanting a transparent process and warning of a place for people to just to go to to have a voice, is trying to figure out how do we do that with the resources that we have and how do'",
        "'speaker_8': 'we expedite it? Because I do think there is an expectation that they will make recommendations before our week before we meet in October. And again, if they don't come back with, hey, here's some short term recommendations that we have, I think it is going to be a problem.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But. But I guess my question to staff is, is there a way for us to get report backs and updates in terms of the progress? So if we don't like it, we can come in and create a formal council led process that's subject to the Brown Act.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And before IT staff. Simpson To answer that, I wanted to also just add on to Councilmember Velez addressing both remarks. Sweat's concerns. I do understand, Vice Mayor, the Brown Act is a very important principle. I don't believe that any of these subcommittees are going to be doing backroom deals that will somehow be to the detriment of the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'city. But I understand the principle and why it exists, but I am wondering if and again, I really want to respect the process of hearing from the community and letting them lead. But I think the benefit. So what I will say is maybe there's a hybrid approach, maybe that initially the you know, maybe all the groups get'",
        "'speaker_0': 'together, all the applicants, I don't know how they want to do it. And then somehow people must self-select or they I'm sure different individuals have different areas of interest that they have of subcommittees or working groups, whatever they are that they want to serve on.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Perhaps it would work if and again, this is just suggestions to consider that an opportunity for committee members to get to know each other because I'm I'm assuming I'm hoping that people will come together who've never met and and then have that opportunity to to get to know each other, get to feel comfortable talking among each other'",
        "'speaker_0': ', not necessarily in the spotlight. I find when I'm dealing with the youth that sometimes they're amazing, but sometimes some shyness sets in and you might not hear from them. And but then perhaps after some initial meetings of getting together and goal setting and and, you know, figuring out and again, setting their agenda.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But within the the framework that we were wanting to be advised on, then maybe it transitions over to Brown Act. But I just it it is it is just something that I was just trying to respect suggestions I heard from members of the black community.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Brody's got his hand up, please. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I mean, I didn't hear when you all made your presentation that this was going to be a process done in secret behind closed doors. And I believe that by the time before anything comes to council, that there's going to be some public vetting of it with the people that are involved.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Otherwise, it's not going to have any legitimacy. Right. I mean, we have the privilege to sit here for seven and a half hours, you know, and we also have the benefit of, you know, in some cases 20 years out of council or being on committees, you know, boards and commissions and understand.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And we also have, you know, a very large and capable staff behind us. We are asking the community members that have none of that. Now was the time. Not the privilege, not the time. Not the staff to be involved in this process.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And there have been a lot of brave people come speak that I am fairly sure. Well, first of all, they hadn't spoken before, right? I mean, there were stories, you know, I heard at some of the marches that, you know, were teary, teary eyed from the people because they'd never spoken those stories before.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So, you know, to have them have to give their name and show their face, you know, at the first time they speak, that it can be overwhelming. And I think we want to get the best input possible. And the most real experience is from our communities of color, you know, experiences that I don't have and I'll never'",
        "'speaker_6': 'have. And none of us really will because none of us are black, to be honest with you. So we're never going to know what that's like. So I'm I wish we had some flexibility in the Brown Act, but, you know, to me, the Brown Act is, you know.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Forgive me.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'For.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'A bunch of it's passed by a bunch of white people, you know. So, you know, why are we going to wish that on our communities of color?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Brody, I am getting the text from the city clerk that it is 1228. We can do a couple of things. Council. We said we go to 1230. We are meeting again on Saturday. This that will be our prior two setting workshop will be Zoom, but it won't be broadcast.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'On the other hand, this was an opportunity to give the city managers suggestions. Perhaps we feel that we have. But quickly, in 2 minutes, tell me what your what your pleasure is. I guess I've heard from Councilman Brody.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I've heard from Councilmember Vela. Councilmember de SAC has his hand up.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know, I just want to make a quick 22nd comment. And my 22nd comment is simply, you know, I find myself hard pressed to support a process that doesn't actively notice the public and engage the public. So, you know that that would be an important issue.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You want to make sure that that was part of the process?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. All right. Any further suggestions before we run out of time? And do you want to come back to this on Saturday or have we given enough suggestions?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You might. Oh.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'City manager if for continuing email. Although I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Regret. I'm not sure we are. I'm not sure. Let me. Let me hear from the council, please. Council.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I you don't. I mean what you guys want is, is a non action so there's no vote to be taken. So I won't call a vote, but I'm not supportive of moving forward in the direction that is proposed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You would like to see more Brown Act involvement or a total ban?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I don't I don't believe the Brown Act causes half the limits I've heard tonight. So.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Okay. I. And I'm not sure that I think continuing more of a discussion. On Saturday would make a difference. I think maybe we have to see what comes out of this process and we can still refine it further if we don't feel that it's working.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Staffed. Okay with the process, by the way.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilor Rody, and I think two others of us are too. But I understand this is it is a leap of faith. As I said before, we have never done anything like this before. And, you know, you want to proceed carefully.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Did you have any any clarifying questions from staff before we adjourn? I'm going to assume you're unmuted and just have nothing to say. Okay. Vice Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Jumping to the next item, are we going to get that guy?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, it's 1231, but I don't.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Want to start right now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. All right.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So comment, give, give.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is that being continued? Is that being.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Continued to Saturday?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. Shall we continue that to Saturday?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I just.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. The. Yes, Councilmember. I mean, I'm going to make Mr. Levitt a member of the council. City manager Levitt.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes, I, I what I was going to recommend is you may want to think of moving it to different day because Saturday with the agenda for you have in front of you, we're looking at 6 to 6 and a half hours just for the agenda you're looking at.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's the concern.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Crime. I'm just concerned. Adding an item like that. Well, we'll extend it further.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's not a quick item. Okay. We could do one of a couple of things. We could go a little longer tonight, but maybe that's not advisable. And then, as I said, the city clerk mentioned that Thursday is a possibility Thursday evening.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Vela, did you have your hand up or your muted your muted.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I would like to make a motion to continue tonight's meeting until 1240 so that we can make a decision about continuing this other item.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh, okay. Because we're out of time. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I will. Second, Councilmember Abdullah's motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. May we ever recover, please? To ever think that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Next like.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hi.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Odie.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hi.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hi, Mayor. As the Ashcroft.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Carries by five eyes. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, so who's got the floor?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Matt Amaya It seems like there's two options. One is to continue it to Thursday, the other is to continue it to Saturday. For this, the third option, which is to continue it all the way to September, as my understanding.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Or a city manager. Or am I muted and a city manager?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Or you could continue to a third complete. Like if you wanted to continue to the first week of August or something, no.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'One's going anywhere.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You could do that, too. That's a that's a fourth option.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'No meetings next week either.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Next week we talk about this item or the next meeting's item.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The next meeting's item.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Thursday doesn't work for me, but I'm happy with any of those.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Um.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I have a conflict on Thursday as well, but.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Um. Well, I mean, we do have a full day Saturday, but we could maybe say on. You're fine with.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sweat.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm fine with either Saturday or finding another day next week. But I do not want to wait until September for this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, I agree with what his next week look like. So we we could do this. We could ask the city clerk to poll everyone about a date that works for us for next week.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We need you have to we need to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Continue to a date certain. So. So why don't you pull us now?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'How about next Tuesday, which is a Tuesday night that doesn't have a council meeting?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Let me chair.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I could do that. But we've done with the other item, or is that in limbo?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There's no action taken. There's no.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Action.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I thought there was a we were supposed to.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Say, oh, you're not allowed to play action.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We make suggestions.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. It said, accept the report so we don't have to vote to accept the report.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Do we need a vote to accept the report, Mr. Shen?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'My recommendation is that you do not.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Take a vote. Okay. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. We could do that. Okay. Harris. Tuesday. Excuse me. What were you saying, Councilor Brody?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I said we'll accept The Hague.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Look at that advice. That was easy. So then we're looking at. Can't see my calendar. Tuesday will be the 28th. Okay. Is everybody good with that? What time?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Phys ed. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Early.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It does.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Do it. Let's do it.'",
        "'speaker_3': '5:00 o'clock. That works.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And for those listening, it's still no public comment, right?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Because I know public comment was closed last time. It does get opened up by moving to yet another date. Okay. City Manager Levitt. Yes, sir. But you have to unmute. And you're.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Right. I am.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Here you go.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It. This is not a barrier to having on Tuesday, but I have a conflict with another city meeting that I have to be at between 430 and six. So. But that's fine. I don't need to be there for that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is that is the assistant city manager available?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think he could be.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Well, and I don't I mean, I don't know that we need them, but. Yeah. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So yesterday, was that the. Hey, you just threw me under the bus. Look.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The assistant city manager is good with this stuff. They, um. Okay, so I think we are ready to adjourn, so we need a vote. Oh, we need.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'A vote.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Because we do. Yes, we do. So do we have a motion to make?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'A motion to do this? I Oh, yes. The final item to Tuesday night, next Tuesday, the 28th at 5 a.m., 5 p.m..'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mean. Okay. The vice mayor has made a motion to have a second. Somebody. Come on, guys, we don't have time. The second from Councilmember de SAC. Oh. All right. It's been moved by the vice mayor, seconded by councilmember deaths.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Any discussion? Seeing that we have a roll call vote with.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilors based on. Yes. Next site.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Odie.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Vela. I may as the Ashcroft.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Carries by five eyes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So we will see you all. A week from today. Well, the week from yesterday.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Saturday.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. Well, yeah, Saturday. We'll see. See everybody on Saturday. All right. Um, I think we're at the end of the meeting, right?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Little over time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. We're under 40.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah, just.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's not quite, but. Yeah, but we voted to extend. Okay, so as I noted in the beginning, we will adjourn this meeting in memory of Congressman John Lewis. All right, everyone, thank you for your good work tonight. We covered a lot of territory.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I know it was a long meeting, but you don't often see 12 page agendas. I hope not to see one again any time soon. All right. Good night. We'll see you Saturday. Take care, everyone. Thank you. Thanks, staff.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Bye bye.'"
