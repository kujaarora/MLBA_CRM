        "'speaker_6': 'Now, the history of this project was that really the city council had clearly indicated that we want to be part of the planning of the process, not just at the end, but at the beginning. And when you look at the minutes, the minutes clearly state with amendment made by council member Matt, R-S.C., about having us on the'",
        "'speaker_6': 'front end. And that was on an issue that I had also raised that night. So I want to make sure that the person, the organization that's being funded here will be on call to come to the city council.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Who will have the final say and who will have the say before that? Because we're not going to have a Main Street plan where the city council gets it, gets the the outcome at the butt end. So it's going to have to be upfront.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You speak to that?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah, absolutely. That's we have an item, in fact, tonight on the agenda. One of the major issues of that very night was about the disposition and the units and how it was going to work and the phasing. And that was the direction we heard when that contract was approved.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You're having to go. And that's why we're actually here tonight with an item which includes maps. From that we're happy to come. We're just getting the draft plan done that's out for public review probably next week. And then we're happy to come back and get council.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Ultimately, it's an ordinance of the council that has to approve this plan. We're happy to get feedback from the council as part of that process.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And let me just make sure that when we approved the contract, it was in March 2015 and. Looking at the minutes. When we moved it. Councilmember Ashcraft made a motion and I second it. Then Council Vice Mayor Matt, R-S.C., had requested an amendment to include that the council is the body that selects a preferred alternative for moving'",
        "'speaker_6': 'on to Task three and Task four of the report. And in response to Council Members Inquiry, Vice Mayor Matarese stated that he is also suggesting in the minutes is also suggesting that there be an in-process check. And that the Council approved the preferred alternative before the design goes into task three before.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Mm hmm. So and I'm raising this also because I do have some problems with the matter as stated in the and the agenda item. I can't be on the but end of of what their plan is going to be for the or the main street area.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There's a lot of issues and concerns that are being raised right now, particularly with regard to moderate income housing, first time homeownership and and all that. And we need to begin to as a council vet that.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'I wanted to add that was a unanimous vote member Ashcroft.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Maybe some of my colleagues did as well draft an existing conditions profile and the number three is a market assessment and feasibility of varying housing types. I, I would imagine we would want to leave that to the experts in the field who do those sorts of things.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That doesn't seem like a council task. Number four is draft said alternatives for public and private spaces described above. And this is probably where you would bring plans and proposals back to us before a final vote. Is that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, no. I mean, certainly we want to get the advice of professionals who know what they're doing. But also the profession has to be guided by a council members who have a sense as to what the pulse of the community is.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I don't agree with your statement that that we have no role whatsoever in the intervening process.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I didn't mean to imply that at all. I think we absolutely see the council as instrumental in defining this plan. And so we will be back to you with the draft plan for your feedback and discussing phasing and alternatives.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's what we're here tonight, is that we see it as a process. We didn't want to get release a draft plan until we got feedback from the Council on phasing because we see that was such a big issue and we approve the contract.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We'll be back to you with the draft plan. And we will we will not be asking your approval of that plan at that night. We want to get your feedback before finalizing a final plan.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'm here and I understand this agenda item is just to extend the contract because this is not correct. Finish within the original envelope and the agenda item that's further down on the agenda I think is where the discussion of where, because that phasing point that's highlighted in tonight's agenda item is really at the core of the concern'",
        "'speaker_7': 'that I think we all agreed on back in March of the previous year, that we don't want to be too far into that fate, into the project without having seen it and and provided direction before things are locked.'",

It's really a pleasure to come before you with a project measure, IRR, which is a fix it first bond, three and a half billion dollar reinvestment to rebuild an aging infrastructure.'",

Let me just share that. Every morning during the morning commute out, peak commute, we're carrying over twice as many passengers under the bay as travel over the bridge.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. But overall, it's my understanding we're talking 48 years from the date we vote approximately. Yes. Okay. And then the moneys that will be brought in from this, they are brought in over time then. But you issue your bonds early.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So when do you anticipate that the money will be spent? By how long is this money going to last?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We would. Our plan is to issue the bonds every other year for ten issuances or ten tranches. So over 20.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Years we would.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Bond.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And each of those bonds, by state law, you're obligated to perform, deliver 80% of the projects in the bond measure. And that will also be scrutinized by an independent oversight body headed by not only project area experts, but to League of Women Voters.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. I want to get back to that. 20 over 20 years, you're going to be issuing the bonds, right? Well, the money you said 80% will be spent within 20 years. 80% of all the money. But we're.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Saying.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Actually if you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Times your.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Child the second the last bond would be issued 20 years from now, then that would be two years of. That we would have to perform that last, say, $350 million bond.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And then that property owners, the estimate is that property owners will be paying this for 48 years.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. And does this include any consideration of having a station in Alameda?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'As I mentioned, this is a fix it first bond focused. 90% of that three and a half billion is on the existing infrastructure, which is deteriorating. We've reserved 10% for access and planning studies. Now planning studies include a second transbay two, and I need engineering feasibility studies first before I can start even drawing broad brush lines on'",
        "'speaker_3': 'a map showing where it's possible to build a new line and potential new stations, he said.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And this includes money for an engineering study, but not to build anything.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It would not build.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Would be of a very substantial and robust study that would guide.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Us and that would require that some additional bond at some point. If at some point someone comes up with a plan to have anything, and it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Would be one of the largest transportation projects in the United States.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we'd be looking and we'd be looking to the federal government for assistance as.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well. But I appreciate clarifying that so that the voters know what they're being asked to vote for any other promotion.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Because I know it's getting late and we've got still.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You want to make a motion?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I would love to make a motion. So I move that the city council adopt the resolution supporting the Bay Area Rapid Transit, general obligation bond measure, defend BART Safety, Reliability and Traffic Relief Program 40 year maximum personal tax measure on the November ballot.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All those in favor I motion carries unanimously. Thank you very much. You all right? Now we're on ride. Regular agenda item six A.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Adoption of resolutions appointing Lisa Hall as a member in the Commission on Disability Issues and Carl Jenks as a member. The Social Service. Human Relations.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Move approval.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Second.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All those in favor. Motion carries unanimously. Thank you, Counsel. Are they here? And can you repeat what we just did?'"
