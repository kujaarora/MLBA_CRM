        "'speaker_0': 'And the Vice Mayor had requested this before. Did you want to?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We could get some clarification for staff. I know that we've looked at a number of the different positions and we were approving our budget and this is an amendment to what we're doing. Or what we had planned to do.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Good evening, Mayor. Councilmembers Nancy Brownstein, H.R. director. We actually were still in the process of reviewing this. And so we thought we were going to be making a recommendation, but we just hadn't finalized it. So the reason we're not asking for any funding here is we actually budgeted money knowing we were going to be doing something different'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Good evening. I'm Ruth Abby with Community Action for Sustainable alameda and we wrote to express our support for this agenda item. We think it's very important to have the fully funded positions because transportation is our number one greenhouse gas emission source.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And we think that you have a large number of transportation projects that are in the docket and will be coming before you. And we would really think we need that extra staffing to make sure that we can fulfill our commitment to climate sustainability.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'So move.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Second.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'I appreciate you joining me in this important effort. You don't really have to add anything unless you want to know you have a speaker. Oh, okay. And we do have a speaker with Abby.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But but Mayor Spencer, you did miss that. I believe Mr. Garland at the meeting brought a big glass canister full of straws that were collected on the beach. Clean up day as an exhibit, as a show until. So that's what's missing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I had received a piece of art from Pat Lamborn, also from her husband, picking up straws. And, you know, there's someone that makes art from what they pick up.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Ruth Good evening, Ruth. Abby from Community Action for Sustainable Alameda. We really support the passage of this agenda item. We wrote to you about the importance of Alameda leadership on this issue. Because we are an island and we are very impacted by litter in the marine environment and we can do something very concrete, you know, working with'",
        "'speaker_5': 'our very supportive business community to make Alameda a real sustainable place. We kicked off this week the reuse of, we think, disposable campaign. The mayor and I have both been trained to be rethink disposable ambassadors. And we will be volunteering our time to work with our restaurant community to help them transition from disposable packaging to reusable.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then if they are using take out packaging, that should be also compostable or reusable. And so we really think this is a part of that. We very much appreciate the council's support of this issue, and we really think that Alameda will be a leader in sustainability.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And this is a good step on the road. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And I also want to thank Ruth, Abby as well as CASA for their efforts on this, as well as, you know, every green effort in this community for years. And then we had received letters of support, I believe, from Edison School students.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we also appreciate students voices weighing in on these important issues. And.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Brody Thank you, Madam Mayor. And I'm glad you called. You pulled this because I was going to pull it anyway so I could give you thanks for bringing the referral forward and making sure that we we got this done and we expanded it to our campus tables.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'In just a quick note, I think it's Thursday at 630 that there will be a CASA workshop regarding the next steps for updating the city's local action plan for climate protection. And I think that was a referral by Councilmember Matariki that pushed that and make sure that we prioritized that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I'm glad that that process is moving forward and just thank you for doing that. I'm glad you have an opportunity to speak on the item.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then I also want to thank staff because I know it's a heavy lift and it was, you know, us kind of pushing and pushing it faster and making it bigger. So thank you also for stepping up and joining us.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But this is really, really important. So it's one of those good things that we're doing as a community. That being said, do you like the motion? Do you want to move?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Chair I move. Final passage of the ordinance amending the Alameda Municipal Code Section four dash for disposable food service where to prohibit certain single use plastics such as straws and clarifying compostable for foodservice wear requirements.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'So Miss Price is the chair of this committee. He's been doing it forever. So actually, before you speak, I want to give a round of applause to her.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. I was going to tell you that tonight is my last night on the program.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Well, let's take that now because.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'What you're saying. That was a joke, right?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah. It's kind of one of those things that it gets into your blood. I think you end up staying forever. But we do have some of our committee members here and our executive board. We are a501c3 foundation now.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we're very proud that we've added the Coast Guard festival this year to the 4th of July festivities. We had over 4000 in attendance this year, which was amazing for a.'",

So we're looking forward to next year. The Coast Guard is already committed to this being a multi-year event, and we're looking forward to being.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Oh, thank you. That's nice. Great. Thank you. And we also have Mark Sorenson, who is our treasurer in charge of all things, money. Blake Brighton. We referred to him as Judge Blake because he is the guy you can bribe if you would like to get a trophy.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And Betty Dittmar, we could not do this parade without. She is in charge, of all things, horse cleanup oriented.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And managing the ending of the parade.'",

    "Consider Directing Staff to Conduct a Workshop Involving the City Council, Water Emergency Transportation Authority (WETA), San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission (BCDC), AC Transit and Others Relevant Groups regarding Recently Implemented Harbor Bay Ferry Terminal Parking Solutions.  (Councilmember Oddie)": [
        "'speaker_2': 'Other relevant groups. Regarding recently implemented Hervey Bay Ferry Terminal three.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Think I put this as important, but not urgent. So if we're still talking about it in 5 minutes, I'm happy to continue the conversation to the next meeting. But we all know that we we just implemented the new parking procedures at the ferry, and there's been some complaints from some ferry riders.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So my thought was that, you know, either in December or later, if we don't have any meaningful data until, you know, January or February that we have some type of public workshop, you know, that includes multiple agencies because there are some complaints about AC transit and, you know, it may be there on time.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Maybe they're not. I mean, what will the data show? There are some potential questions for Bccdc about the extra spaces along the water. So it'd be good, I think, for the community, you know, when we actually have real data and meaningful data, which again maybe 3 to 5 months down the road to actually, you know, have this'",
        "'speaker_6': 'type of discussion and see where we are and how it's working.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Can you tell me what was plan in regards to when they report back where they invite these other agencies or what was? Because when this came to us before and was just supposed to come back and give us an update.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right. So staff was asked to have an annual status report and collect data for the whole year, which I think Councilmember Odie is referring to. It is scheduled right now. There's actually preliminary data that will be discussed this Thursday at the Rita board meeting, but it won't be the full year.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so at the in a couple more months, we'll have the full year, December 15th, November 15th, that goes to the Transportation Commission and December will be coming to the council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And at that time then would we have representatives from other agencies will have.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'An AC transit BCCDC is a little harder to get here. But we're also sharing the request for I think it's 46 parking spots along the shoreline to that's a, B, C, DC jurisdiction and we're encouraging our residents if they want to do that again.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So the idea of a workshop, I think that so that we would have sufficient time when it comes to. Is that right? Is that why you're saying a workshop.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Workshop.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And agenda.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Workshop more to have like a dialog with these different agencies rather than have them come up to speak for 3 minutes and us not being able to engage with them.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So that's the point of that, especially. I know that. But you've you've like that idea on other things. I mean, I like it as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. So what if we want to do it, like right before a council meeting? Are you thinking a different day?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I don't really care. Okay. Doesn't really matter when. I mean, if it doesn't happen until January or February, that's fine too. I just like December two.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And looks like.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's scheduled for the first meeting of December.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So when it comes back December, would you prefer that that be like a workshop prior to the regular council meeting to allow such a thing? Or we could actually probably recess our meeting, do a workshop.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I mean, I'm open to whatever, you know.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So allow me to.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Know. I mean, a lot of people take the ferry, may not be able to make a 6:00 meeting.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So let me ask real quick. So could we recess our regular meeting during that time, then do a workshop at the like 8:00, 7:00 or whatever on that issue to allow the back and forth dialog that have it here so that people aren't limited to the 3 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then go back to our regular meeting. Is that would that accommodate that concern? Is that a possibility?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Would you take another another suggestion along those lines? I think.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'My.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Concern would.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Be if you're having.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Other agencies involved, it would be kind of weird to juggle.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Them in and out. That would be like just kind of, you know.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Technical concern about like making that happen and whatever. And if they'd be waiting and, you know, so.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We would have a specific time for the workshop. But could it be during a regular meeting where we go to that format or can we?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah, I mean, you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Could do it. There's nothing to prevent.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You from doing it. But I would just just.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Legally possible. But when I think the city clerk is saying.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is it's really going to be.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Messy.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'For your meeting.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yeah, because I don't think it I don't think it serves the the purpose if we're going to try and have a dialog here, that's I think that's untenable during a council meeting. I think the the notion of having a workshop is probably a Saturday thing.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And we do have a Transportation Commission agenda item, which I fully expect a recommendation from them on this very issue because it's listed right here as an agenda, a future agenda item. And we could use that to set up a.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Pending on the outcome of that set up a real workshop. There would be a dialog where we could actually sit down and talk to people on this issue as well as with other interagency issues. On the other. I wouldn't want to waste this just on on a very narrow scope of one section of the system.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The suggestion if we're going to spend a Saturday morning someplace, I want to talk about the rest of the week to D.C., D.C.. City of alameda relationship because there are two other sites. There's Main Street and there's potential new ferry and all these water taxis that everybody's talking about on all these North Shore developments.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So that's my opinion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Member Ashcraft, thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And one question I had was, I guess for the city manager, just someone from city staff attend the Ouija board meetings. Yes. Okay, good. And then my idea I agree with the council referral that Councilmember Odie brought. I mean, right now we're hearing a lot from these Bay Farm ferry riders because they're impacted.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But trust me, the main street. Well, parking is better because we have the DeWitt parking lot. There's still that, you know, bicycle getting there on bike. It's kind of treacherous as you get closer in. But if we were trying to be responsive to our constituents who are already saying, you're making it really hard for me to commute'",
        "'speaker_4': 'by ferry, by throwing up all these roadblocks. How about if we go to them sometimes? So it's not as broad as all the ferry systems, but there's the Harbor Bay Community Center. If we were doing a separate workshop and given that these are Harbor Bay Ferry riders, we could arrange to hold a meeting there and not make'",
        "'speaker_4': 'people, you know, figure out child care for the evening, somehow throw dinner on the table or takeout or something. But I think it's important and I'll respect whatever priority rating you gave it. But we are an island community.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We know that we need to be adding more housing to do our part in the regional challenges for housing. And we tout our ability to have water transit. So we need to walk the walk and talk the talk at the same time and make sure that we're making it as feasible, as positive as possible for people to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'use these alternate means of transportation. So I just would like us to consider, if we did a special workshop, maybe not requiring everybody to come here and we could use the community center, I would think.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Vice mayor.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And if we do that, I would hope that we also think about using doing one on the West Side, either at APEC or Missions Theater or the old club, something like that, where we could have folks come out there again to meet us if we do have a joint meeting.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All I was going to suggest is that we actually agenda. At what point in the meeting we're planning on talking about which terminal so that people know when to come. So if we do have one joint meeting, I think letting them know in the morning, you know, we're going to start off talking about Harper Bay and you'",
        "'speaker_2': 'know, and then the next agenda item after that will be Main Street or however we want to do it. But I think if we can agenda is that by sight that way people know.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So if we're having two different venues, then we'd have two different agendas. Right.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And is it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mayor, I'm sorry. Let me let me ask a question because staff was already going to come back. They're going to the Transportation Board November 15th, and they were going to come to us December the first meeting in December.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So with a workshop, the after they come to us or sometime between when it goes to transportation, which is obviously around Thanksgiving.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think just from a scheduling point of view, if you're looking for a Saturday during the holidays is not a good time. So it would probably be mid after mid-January.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So would we want to come to us in December without for that? The workshop come before it comes to us. Which cases.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Are we going to defer to staff, figure out when they can fit it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well. And the other logistical issue is trying to get the other agency staff and elected to come out on the other.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Can I just give them direction to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We will. Why don't we look into it? Talk to the other agencies and. And we can keep it on here if you want to. Or we can. I can tell you. We could see what data are available.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Maybe another put there. Yeah. CRAFT Thank you. Is that. Is there a way that we could or maybe we could all ferry riders either you know, paper ballot when they come the here to see if there were a special community workshop about her obituary issues.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Would you prefer a Saturday meeting? Would you prefer a weeknight meeting? Because again, we I don't know. It's been a while since I've had kids in soccer games. And I just remember Saturday being kind of a logistical nightmare.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So maybe sometimes, you know, after school, I mean, after people get home from commute, that's the best time. But shouldn't we at least be respectful enough to reach out and ask?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah, that's a very good.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Way to then I there might be some other questions that could be asked at the same time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. We have. So that's. So did you want to make a motion for a direction or.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Sure. I just like to give directions to move the approval. But, you know, to expand it like a council member matter, as he said, to include more than just the Harbor Bay Ferry.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Oh, second. That with the recognition that it was important, but not urgent.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's what I said. Important, but not okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And the surveying of to find out when the best time is.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah. If that can be done. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think that's appropriate. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. All those in favor. I know she cares. Unanimously. Thank you. Council Communications, Planning Board. I'm going to do that part now to comment before 11, I will be nominating Penny Cozadd, CEO Z a D and then I'm going to go to other council members in regards to Council Communications.'"
