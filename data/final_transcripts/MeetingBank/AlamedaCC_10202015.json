        "'speaker_1': 'All right.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you for being patient on this. I kind of recall when we had the discussion on the 6 million, we were going to talk about purse smoothing and OPEB funding. And one of the options may have been, you know, 2 million for existing retirees, 2 million for per smoothing and 2 million for current employees.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I know you're going to come back with, you know, a more media analysis on what to do with that 6 million. But I just wanted to make sure the record was clear that that was one of the things that I suggested during that discussion.'",

I have no doubt that it's needed, but in my mind I just felt like the substantive analysis was never there.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'At least, you know, I couldn't recall and I still can't recall it being there. So I really had wonders about $800,000 being devoted out of the 14.5. So it's a continuing concern. The second point I want to raise is.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And before I raise a second point, let me just make sure to preface my remarks by saying I support my vote that I voted before and I will continue to do so. And as I think it would be bad faith not to do so.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But I think it's worth. Expressing. Some. Hesitancy about, you know, the vote that we're going to be taking. And I think it's worth expressing that hesitancy or reluctance because, you know, for example, we mentioned measure O, you know, for Measure O for the library, that was a $10.6 million bond, $9.6 million that we had to take the'",
        "'speaker_7': 'people to to confirm and ratify. And tonight, you know, we're making a vote of basically 13 to $14 million. I recognize that, you know, as one of five council members, you know, that is that's one of the authorities that we have.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And we make that work in conjunction with the with the city manager and executive staff. So it's not done in a vacuum. But I think, you know, when you put it in the context of how much we had to go out for a vote for something like Majuro at $10 million.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And now we're making a vote on 13 to $14 million. I mean, that's. It gives me pause. But I'm going to remain consistent with how I voted previously. So, no, but I think it's important to note that as as I had voted previously, I would prefer to continue to not vote for emergency water supplies.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So if it's okay, I'd like to move adoption of everything but emergency water supply. I didn't vote for it last time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. So there were some we got in response to member de SACS comment. There are multiple items here that were not unanimous. However, they're presented as one item for us to approve.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Except of the majority.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So there was a majority on each of the items. However, there are multiple items that were not unanimous, but they are being presented as a package here. So if council wants to. Approve it as is so we can see how we have emotions and whatnot and see what you want to do with that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Vice Mayor I would like I understand the comments and I would like to make a motion to, to, of vote for this measure that. Allocates these funds. And I think the different distinction between measure row and this is measurable.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We're asking the people to indebt the city to the tune of $10 million. This is money that's already been collected. And this is this is our fiduciary responsibility to manage the budget. And the budget includes this. But these funds that that are in our hands, it's not like we're going out and asking for the city to indebt'",
        "'speaker_3': 'us for $10 million. So that's the distinction I drew and I, I move that we approve five d as recommended by the staff report.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sarah Second Circuit Member Ashcroft I can do.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The comment just to the vice mayor. I mean, what we did with Metro, the 10%, $6 million bond is the voters property owners are voting to tax themselves. But the city was certainly paying the debt service on that money.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And for every dollar that comedians put in, we got to back. But nonetheless, as is often the case in a council vote, we don't have unanimity, but of course we vote by a majority rule. So I'm perfectly comfortable seconding this motion.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Thank you, Mayor Brody.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you, Madam Mayor. It sounds like the sense of the council that we go ahead and vote for this as a package. I would kind of. I originally voted for the the water supply. But, you know, you look at the number 800,000 and you look at the other items that are comparable.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You know, Alameda point buildings that was in the news. We had a couple of meetings on that estuary park and we've had a number of meetings on estuary park, the Tidal Canal. We've had a number of closed session and open session meetings on that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The EOC also the same thing. And, you know, I think in you know, in hindsight, it would have been nice if we had a little bit more public discussion on that in the 5 minutes we had on it during this budget meeting late at night.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But unless there's know a sense that more than two of us want to revisit that, you know, I'm prepared to support this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I'll add member Ashcroft.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, no, go ahead. I didn't want to cut you off the sentence.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I was going to add that in regards to the emergency water supply, it's 800 of the 875,070 5000 will be coming back. And we'll have a more comprehensive presentation at that time, is my recollection of what we agreed to at that back on.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And this came just before September 15th, and I plan to support this. There were items within this list that I voted against. However, this we operate by majority. We are giving direction to staff. And I think that person I would have liked to have seen the September 15th vote included in the presentation or if that can be'",
        "'speaker_1': 'somehow linked so that it's easy to see that break out. I think that would be helpful. And I think that this includes many items that benefit the public, that the public will see a noticeable change and improvement in our community.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I think I appreciate council support to vote on this on these items. And I would say the first one that member I believe already referenced, Alan, made a point buildings 575,000. I think that that is critical that we move forward on that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We do have valued members of our community that live near that area. And I think it is imperative that we do our utmost. And I think that's what the community will see to support all members of our community.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I think that this list and that's just one of the items, I think there are multiple items here that it's very important that we move forward for the benefit of our community at large. Member J So did you want.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Mad at me? I just want to make two points. The first point is that, you know, I will support the motion. I don't think, you know, making this grant a grandstanding vote of voting no, it doesn't serve anyone any good because there are some things without a doubt that the public benefits by.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'No one disagrees with that. There are no doubt that we've had a series of meetings for a number of items. No, no, no one disagrees with that. But I think it's safe to say that any time you're dealing with magnitude of dollars, that we're talking about $14 million.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You know, I think a special consideration is certainly triggered at that amount. For the same reason that, you know, when we are going after $10 million for our measure out support measure, only asking the voters for that, you know that the level of consideration was given.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But, you know, let's move forward. I agree. I have my reluctance about the emergency water supply. But, you know, I've made my point and.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You can be convinced.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'One member already. Did you want to comment?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I just. You convinced me. Another person.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Never. Ashcroft. And just to wrap up, I think Mayor Spencer, it was almost like we were reading from the same notes, because I would have said just what you said. And I think you look at these expenditures and bear in mind, we know this is one time many and we are these are one time expenditures, but they're'",
        "'speaker_6': 'also things that had been on our list. You know, they're not all sexy, but we are going to do some needed clean up and, you know, abandoned vessels. And as far as the emergency water supply, I think this is what the mayor was also saying.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Sure. I'd like a more robust discussion of what that looks like and what all the different ways we can approach that are. But having come off of and I'm not even sure we're done with the fire season in this state and just seeing the horrendous impacts in counties not that far from ours, I think emergency water supply'",
        "'speaker_6': 'is something that this island community that's, you know, prone to earthquakes does need to look into. So, yes, I want to I want a fuller and more robust discussion, but that can still come even after this vote. Thank you.'"

        "'speaker_5': 'We got to do something. We got to do something. Now, this Iraq is not cutting it. We need a moratorium. We need a rent control.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We have to do something.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I just heard about another complex that just is given 60 day notices to all the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Seniors on Section eight. They're planning on evicting everyone else in 60 days or by November. Has a moratorium tonight.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And stop it. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Jason.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. There are no other public comments on this item.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Member OTI Thank you, Madam Mayor. First of all, I think we have a meeting set for November 4th to discuss all of these issues and different possible ways we could solve the crisis of affordable housing here in Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I realize that it's not today, but, you know, it's sooner than December when when it was originally planned. And I wonder what the harm might be given that there have been some suggestions both tonight and in previous meetings that we consider a elected rent board.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We may not we may we may do that. We may not. It could be that we give it expanded powers. We may or we may not. And I think that, you know, these positions deserve a lot more scrutiny from the council.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I don't always agree with the mayor's appointments, but what I do respect about the way she makes them is she does a tremendous amount of due diligence and interviewing and checking with them. And my understanding is that that was not done or these reappointment is usually they come before the council and the mayor makes her suggestions'",
        "'speaker_9': 'from a list. And, you know, we move forward in the following meeting and then the mayor appointees are approved and we haven't had that opportunity with these appointees. And I'm not being critical of their work. It may be that we decide, you know, these are perfectly fine individuals, but I think given the gravity of the rack and'",
        "'speaker_9': 'the gravity of what decisions we may or may not take on November 4th, it might make sense to just put off this re reappointment at least till after November 4th, when maybe we can consider, you know, this when we when we talk about other rent issues.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Remember De.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Well, thank you. I think the recommendation by Council Member Oti speaks to at least the in one respect, the magnitude of the housing situation that we're in. So at least by temporarily putting this off. We can certainly send a message that, you know, we need a Iraq that understands the needs of the of the rental community here'",
        "'speaker_7': 'in Alameda. I appreciate the data that was provided by Mr. Kline. And. I think, though, the responsibility lies not with Iraq, though the responsibility really lies with the city council. So it's the Iraq and the city council that have to come together because, you know, the buck ultimately stops with us, not just on November, but on any'",
        "'speaker_7': 'day of the year. So I think in that regard, I see temporarily putting off on the the appointments. I see. At a minimum, no harm in that whatsoever. And I see a lot of benefit out of that. So I would certainly entertain if if Council Member OTI suggested that we put off the selection of the nominees tonight'",
        "'speaker_1': '. So I'd like.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'To see me run away.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So go ahead. I can wait until you're done.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, we have BRAC meetings continuing, so these members would continue to serve as my understanding until we decide. So these members could continue to serve under the current BRAC. I think this was a response to the prior agenda item that we approved, that staff was going to just have it seamless, seamlessly continue in that respect.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Did you want to respond? To clarify? So. And so I would like to respond in regards to the the this item actually has staff recommending that I nominate the existing four members. It's a five member board. We did have a resignation recently from from the committee and that someone had moved outside of the area.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So this is for four of the five members. There was a comment that suggests that stated that someone that was just appointed recently would very well vote as those before. And I would submit that. This is a new person.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And with all due respect to how this person would vote, I think that it would be appropriate to see how this person votes. This person actually is someone that has served our community in many different capacities over the years.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Ms.. Lucas. The other three members that I was being recommended that I reappoint have served. So whether or not they would continue, I think that there is that that council does create the policy and that we can give input.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And in fact, in regards to that, I have attended, I believe, every meeting since I've been mayor. And with all due respect to the members that have been serving, they. I think that they try really hard to serve and meet the needs of our community.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And whether or not that's actually working, which is I think is why the council has actually made changes to Iraq. And we have there was a long a lengthy process and recently it came to council and we all weighed in on that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I am interested in hearing so and so in regards to the due diligence of my accepting staff's recommendation. I do think in regards to at least the person I just appointed in 2015, I would hope that that person would be allowed to continue.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We just appointed her. She has no prior record on this and I would like to give her the benefit of the doubt in regards to her service, in regards to the other ones. I have seen them interact with the community members.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I'm comfortable reappointing them. However, I'm also interested in hearing other council members comments.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Member Ashcroft Thank you, Mayor Spencer. I am inclined to agree with my two colleagues, Councilmember Odie and Desiree. I think we are finding ourselves in some new, uncharted territory. And because we have this special meeting that is coming up on November 4th, and I know staff is going to a lot of time and effort compiling the data'",
        "'speaker_6': 'that we asked for. We are all looking at how other cities are tackling this. It's a very much a regional problem, but cities are coming up with their ways of addressing it. And I think we can do some of those things in Alameda when it's brought to a full discussion.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I, I do understand that until we finalize these appointees, the current slate would stay in place. And I, I would like the opportunity. I think that we may decide to give the RAC a little different function after we meet on the fourth.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I would like to have the opportunity to ask questions of our newest appointee. Ms.. Lucas I, I actually put in a phone call to her today and perhaps she's out of town, but you know that I wanted to ask her about some statements she'd made back when she was on the city council, but I don't think'",
        "'speaker_6': 'it's fair to bring that up unless she's here to to respond that. But I do have some questions I'd like to ask and probably, you know, in light of what the some of the folks have raised, we you know, we probably should take a little closer look now.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I will say I like the idea of diversity, economic, ethnic, geographic. What have you. It could be decided. I'm not sure how having an elected body accomplishes that, because it all depends on who runs and who wins, but whether those would be criteria.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And of course, and I know we've got an application out now, right, because I saw a copy of the for the winners slot.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'At CNN.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It sort of.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Saved the rest of that. Yeah. Yeah. So all of you tenants out there, you know, I hope you've picked up an application. If not, is it online? Yes. Yeah. So we can get it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'From.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Oak or from the clerk's office. You can get one anywhere. I would entertain the idea of putting this decision off until after. Mr. Deaver, you say until after sometime after the November 4th special meeting.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I think we could reconsider this. And November 4th, when we talk about all of the the rent issues and know if we're going to come up with a. Direction to staff and come up with an ordinance or not.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You know, I think it would behoove us to talk to all four of the members of the RAC and make sure that. Given that's our authority to to to confirm then to see if if they're in line with with our direction.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I would also encourage if that's the direction of counsel, I would encourage counsel to attend the meetings where you can see see them in action. And in regards to comments that we could select council members based upon being a single parent or economic diversity of Kansas City attorney.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Would you like to weigh in on that? I think we may be entered in regards to our ability to ask some of those questions.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You know, I mean, maybe we don't ask, but someone tells us.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, I think what the mayor is referring to is just issues of privacy. And so there are certain questions you can't ask people when you're looking for them to be hired for a job, those kinds of things. So that, I think, is what the mayor's concern is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that's why the current ordinance, frankly, is drafted such that it talks about being a tenant or a property owner and being a resident of the city of Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And there's you know, if you just hypothetically, if we decide we're going to do an elected rent board, we could say there's two tenant positions or there's two landlord positions or there's one at large or, you know, there's there's ways we could do this.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But, you know, I'd like to defer this until that discussion and, you know, not commit to, you know, to people with four year terms and two people with two year terms when we're grappling with how to solve this crisis right now.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And my understanding is that was part of that part of what we've voted on before.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The makeup of the commission was included in the ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So that was part of the ordinance that we approved September 15th, I believe.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If I may just clarify why staff brought this forward as we didn't want to not allow the REC to continue operating. When we are hearing from the community that there are so many issues and because we adopted you just adopted these two new ordinances, one that that constituted the rack and one that talked about the duties of'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the rack. And they both went into effect October one. We wanted to try to give the rack as much authority and have it properly appointed and all of that as quickly as we can. But I think what you're saying, I'm hearing you and I understand what you're saying, and I think that it's certainly true that we could'",
        "'speaker_0': 'allow the three members who are still on the rack to continue until their successors or.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'More members together. Therefore, we have one to be appointed, but we have four.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'She's not on.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Then. I thought she was appointed before.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'She was already of. Okay, my mistake.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So you do.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Have a second?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mm hmm. So they were.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Seated.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'At the time. That was the mayor's appointment.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But we have four currently serving on rack and but it would be coming up next this. On the appointment to fill the fifth seat. Member.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Ashcroft did it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So quickly and the vice mayor. I I'm glad to hear that we've got the meetings coming up again, because I did do my own little survey and a lot of the meetings had been canceled this year. So, I mean, I do want to see people avail themselves of the park, something perhaps we can discuss at the meeting'",
        "'speaker_6': 'on November the fourth. I'm just thinking about the composition of the rack. This is the Rental Rate Advisory Committee and only a rental review review review advisory committee, but only two of the five members. So a minority are actually renters.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I wonder if that's something the Council might like to. On the fourth.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'One right now, because there's a vacancy.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, but I'm saying the slots are four to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So so the composition, which I believe was part of the ordinance we just firmed, is to renters, to landlords and one person that owns a home in the community.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Exactly. And I do understand that. And I'm just saying, sometimes thinking evolves and my thinking is evolving here. And it's something I don't want to go into this because it's not agenda. It's but I'm just saying, when it comes up on this, the fourth, maybe we should stop and think, I know it's in the ordinance, but maybe'",
        "'speaker_6': 'it's worth a discussion.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Vice Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. And I think that point of of. Looking at the composition is is an interesting point. I think the point about whether it's an elected body or an appointed body. This body has to function. And even if we decided that it was going to be elected body, it's going to be a while before that election can happen'",
        "'speaker_3': '. And this body has to be able to function. And if the body can function now. Without interruption. I see no problem with waiting until after the end of the fourth. If there's a problem if there's if there's some some disadvantage that we get from not making these affirmations tonight with the authority that we've given the rack and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'in the audience change, then I'm inclined to vote for it tonight so that we don't lose any advantage that we have. But I I'd like to hear that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So the ordinance was actually silent about how this transition period would happen. But because all of our other boards and commissions, pursuant to charter and municipal code, the people who are in the seats remain there until their successors are appointed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think it's it I think legally we can allow that to happen here. It is silent in the ordinance we wanted out of an abundance of caution, to have the council make the actual appointments pursuant to the new ordinance, which is why we are here tonight.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But because of the hesitation I'm hearing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'For good reason. I think we.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Can continue on with the four members.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Who are on the board. So I'd like to speak to that. The fifth member that is. I would like to be able to appoint. Is a renter. That is the position. Correct. Correct. Correct. So that is the position.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I believe that we should continue through the process with the appointment. And if at some point counsel wants to reconsider this, that I would hope that we would do that. Then I would I. From the comments I heard this evening, I don't believe the suggestion from the speakers is to have only one renter as opposed to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'two. Mayor Spencer, that would be a concern, yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Maybe just so that the council gets a better understanding and Mayor Spencer could be making her nomination at the November 3rd meeting. But, Mayor, since I think it would be okay because you would make your nomination and then that would come back for the council on November 17th, which would be after the fourth.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right. But so we're all aware that I would like to proceed with the applications coming in from the possible renters who would like to be on this seat and not all. So so I would appreciate your support with that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we can continue the process, make the nomination, and then depending upon what happens and try to try to at least get one more renter on the committee.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That Mayor, I think it's I think it's imperative that you that we have that fifth seeded.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Because there is going to be a time with this as it's the ordinance sits right now. This body has to meet. It cannot not meet and has to have a full complement. But I definitely think that has to happen.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. And in regards to member Ashcroft's comments that meetings have been canceled. It's my understanding that meetings are canceled when a tenant decides not to go forward at that time, usually because negotiations have are being made and in cases are being resolved.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But the tenant is the person that files and requests that it be. Proceed, proceed. And then it is the tenant that then withdraws or requests a postponement. And it's my understanding that's why the meetings are canceled. That's not arbitrary.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I'm sorry. So.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I would just add this and I have asked staff to please capture that data of what happens when someone has filed the application and withdraws it. I want to know all the particulars because, again, we're just we're trying to be as data driven as possible so that we can fashion the necessary remedies when we meet on'",
        "'speaker_6': 'the fourth.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we already had public comment. Did you want to add something quickly.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Or.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'No? All right. Thank you. Do you want to add something quickly? I would entertain that. And I appreciate your patience. And sometimes when that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Happens, what you're talking about, the cancelations because negotiations are occurring is an issue that we've talked about. We think the RAC should retain jurisdiction, even though they've said they've reached an agreement, they should come in and tell what that agreement is.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So the same way that a landlord must appear, the tenant must appear also.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much. Appreciate that. All right. Any. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I'd like to move to table this item until November 4th.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But the I just want to clarify that I will continue the process that receipt the tenant.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Correct because the that's not in this at all.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I appreciate that. All right. All of us in favor of.'",

(Base Reuse 819099)": [

        "'speaker_1': 'All right. So go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening, mayor and city council members. I'm Ninette Mercado in the Community Development Department and Base Reuse. So tonight, you have in front of you two leases that as a mayor reported, we're going to present together four buildings, nine and 91.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm the basics of the leases are in your staff report but basically these are two buildings nine that's been vacant for a while. It's formerly a document storage facility and it's been vacant for many years. And the 91, which currently has a tenant, but it's been a building.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I don't know if many of you recall it was originally in the homeless accommodation and it was returned back to the city and we've had some problems leasing the building, but we have a tenant in there now. And so the repurposing of these two buildings for what we call a food and beverage incubator, accelerator project we think'",
        "'speaker_4': 'is very exciting. It is a niche that much needed at Alameda Point. And together they're going to they will be introducing what essentially is Alameda entree into the slow food movement, which is the move that creation of or the production of food from locally grown products.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And as as our country has gotten more green, we've gotten the consumers have also gotten more selective on how they eat. And so these these makers are local local makers who will make products and have an opportunity to grow their products.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's essentially the old world, growing your food and bringing it to the marketplace and having people buy it and then creating your own market and and and making more and more and more. And so I am I think that it's an opportunity for entrepreneurial ism.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's a big word to say late in the evening. And it is it's an exciting project. In addition to these individual makers that the developer envisions to creating public spaces where people can come and eat. Building 91 will be essentially a big, huge makerspace where you will have the country's first more organic, mold growing organization.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And there's going to be a granary where flour is green and milled and whatever that means, I don't know. But it will be an opportunity for people to see these processes take place by their food. Sit down. And it is really the beginning steps of of marrying maker space and place making for people to come eat.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And it's we believe it's a perfect complement to our Spirits Alley, which is much needed for food for that area because people come and they drink wine and beer and distiller distilled drinks and they need something to eat.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so we think that this this makerspace food and beverage space will be perfect. And the applicant is here. I want to just say one more thing that the the name of the entity, 707 West Tower, 631 West Tower are created, but the developer of the space is S.M. Sorry, I'm Ernst, and we think that they're a'",

So we think that they're more than qualified to undertake these two buildings that that have been a challenge for our for'",
        "'speaker_4': 'leasing and take it to the next level where they were going to have new tenants, new life and bring a vibrancy to Alameda point that we think is a perfect complement to the town center.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Speaking of, can you speak to so that the community is aware of what you're talking about the this the diagram but buildings they are.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Sure. So as you turn from around the seaplane lagoon and Palladium, which is a nice landmark for people who come on to the base, these are the two large buildings across the street from Palladium. 91 is on the corner and nine is directly adjacent to it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So it's those two buildings that are highlighted there. That's nine. And previously you had 91 on the screen.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. And both of these leases also contain options to purchase.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They do. Nine has an option to purchase. It's a 4.2 acre space and the option to purchase is 5.5 million. That's the purchase price. Previous for formerly, we had said that we thought that the fair share infrastructure price for the land is $1 million per acre.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That calculation is $1.3 million per acre. So as we have gotten more purchase options in hand, we've kind of inched our price up. Building 91 is a 2.2 acre site and we're getting a $3 million purchase price for that, and that is $1.36 million per acre.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So again, nine was in negotiation before 91. So even between those two buildings, the purchase price went up.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And can you describe how the option to purchase gets exercised?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Sure. So in the current state, the city cannot transfer ownership to the property right now because we don't have parcel maps. So the city is undertaking a parcel map process. We are feverishly doing it, by the way, in order to get everything in place that we need all the entitlement and easements and things like that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so that has to go to the planning board and I believe it here for approval. But so it's we're going through the internal processes now. It's going to our development review team this week. So once we create the pass a legal parcel, then we are able to offer it to the tenant for purchase.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But until that process happens, we cannot sell anything.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But that is part of the lease. Yes. So it's not in the title of the document that it includes an option to purchase. And I and not every lease does include an option to purchase. So I would request that when we do an option to purchase within the body of a lease, that that be part of the'",

        "'speaker_1': 'All right. Thank you. And do you know if those are any of the people that turned in slips? We have.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'You know, which really comes down to people want to know where their food comes from. There is a greater appreciation for that sense of it being made locally. And as a result of that, you know, we're seeing broader distribution for local food.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You know, at once it was, you know, the domain of specialty food stores and places like Whole Foods. And, you know, more recently, we're seeing food services markets, your standard grocers getting into the local organic food scene. One of the challenges for these food companies are two of the biggest challenges they face are production and capital.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And in order to attract capital, they need to be able to scale. But they they can't scale without the proper facilities. And, you know, they raised so much capital. They need the capital for their operations. And it's unfortunate when they have to pour so much of their capital into building their own facilities, because these these projects don't'",
        "'speaker_7': 'exist in our market today. So we are looking at a band that is 2000 square feet on up to 20,000 square feet. You know, we see a lot of shared kitchen space in our market. We see small, dedicated one off private kitchens or, you know, 5 to 10 private kitchens, but nothing at scale that can bring deliver'",
        "'speaker_7': 'this at a competitive cost. These. And then on the other end of the spectrum, obviously large industrial kitchens. So, you know, it's again, this middle urban local food producer. And what's unique about this project is we're not just offering facilities.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This is not just a real estate project. We're going to be providing services through an incubator and an accelerator. There's going to be opportunity to get into bring these food companies into different channels like Whole Foods, for instance.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We will be able to offer capital to these companies and retail opportunities, both at the place of location and through our relationship with city. We are going to be offering what we call plug and play ready, license, ready space again so these companies can come in, plug in their equipment and do their business, focus on developing their'",
        "'speaker_7': 'product and growing their business and not pouring all their capital and time into building space. To date, before we've had the lease approved here, we've already toured nearly 25 companies through the buildings. Over 80% of those we are either have under LOI or have a proposal we are negotiating or clearly have expressed a desire to get a'",
        "'speaker_7': 'proposal and we have a good number, another 30. You know, our plan is to have about 30 to 45 companies in this project. And we have procured capital to invest upwards of about 40 million between the two buildings.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So very significant capital investment.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Can you give us a breakdown between the two?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Building 91 will be about 9 million and the balance in Building nine. You know, again, this May.'",
        "'speaker_1': '31 million on the other building.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That's right. You know, so again, this team here, I think between, you know, what we bring is that we bring a knowledge of Alameda point through our work with city understanding utility infrastructures, understanding the challenges of some of these buildings.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We bring development capability, we bring food company development experience. And I'll let Harv talk about that. And with that, you know, a lot of market knowledge. And again, what I think really makes this unique and what I think really makes this a valuable offering to this market is half my partner on this project and would like to'",
        "'speaker_7': 'let him offer his words.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I just wanna come and use the microphone. Thank you. I hear you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I just wanted to take a few minutes just to express, like, what a beautiful concept this is. And in the last 15 years of being involved in the local food movement, from running farmer's markets to helping local growers and local food makers grow their businesses, in the last ten years, working as a local food forager for a'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Whole Foods Market, everything is really kind of come to this point. In the last two years, I've been seriously looking at what is needed to grow this movement to the next level, and having adequate, affordable product production facilities for entrepreneurs to work is at the top of the list.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Having access to market, having access to professional resources, and how to teach these folks how to grow their businesses to the next level. And that's why we've created a company called Forager Ventures, which is a small food business incubator accelerator program that's going to help to scale these businesses to the next level with Whole Foods Market as'",
        "'speaker_5': 'a retail partner. When you look at these two buildings together, nine and 91, what entrepreneurs want is a space to collaborate, to work together and to create a sense of community. And we have that opportunity to do this.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's going to happen and we want to be the team to do it. And I think I believe I have the experience and the network and the relationships to make this happen. I've got 15 years in the industry, last ten years with Whole Foods Market, great relationships with partners like Food Craft Institute, Eat Real San Francisco Street'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Food Festival Cassina are partners a who's who of the local food industry. We're really excited about this vision. I live in Alameda. We wanted to do this in Alameda. We think the location is perfect. We think the buildings are really ideal and suitable to do this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. So the nine other quick comments and then I'd like to call the other speakers. Or you're finished. All right. All right. Thank you. The other speakers. Ron Silverstein. Alexandra. Michael. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Good evening, Madam Mayor and city council members. I'm Alexandra Cohen from Jeff Cohen Sellers. I thank you for taking letting me take the time to speak. I want to move to Alameda. My husband would have been here, but he has to get up at 4:00 in the morning to drive to point Richmond right now where we're making'",
        "'speaker_0': 'our wine. I don't want to make it there. I want to make it right out there. So you have Ron Silverstein, you have Joe Ernst, you have Harvard saying they've put together $40 million worth of. Investors that want to invest in Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Let's move this forward and do this. Let's have the tourism. I'm still dreaming big. Remember? I'm still dreaming big about Alameda. And I just think it's a great thing, and I hope that you approve it. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Good evening, council members and Madame Mayor. My name is Ron Silverstein. I'm an Alameda resident as well. I think we have a lot of them here tonight. And I'm respectfully requesting approval of the leases with option.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'To buy for 991.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Briefly, my background. I am the owner of Thirsty Bear Brewing Company, which is San Francisco's first and only organic brewery. It's also the oldest brewpub in San Francisco and the founding member of the San Francisco Brewers Guild, which we're probably best known for San Francisco Beer Week.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I will be leasing 20,000 square feet in Building 91. And now what I want to do is talk to you very briefly. I hope I don't run out of time about my business. Why in Alameda and why with Joe Ernst?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'What we're going to do is California's first malting facility, California craft maltings. Now, malt, just real briefly, is the single most the largest ingredient in beer is to beer. What grapes are to wine? Even though we're going to be doing small batch malting, this is a big thing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There's only 27 small craft malt houses in the United States, although there's 31.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In planning right now.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Or in construction. Our audience is the over 150 craft breweries that are right.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Here in the Bay Area.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There's over 600 in California, but there's 150 right here in the Bay Area. And they're all using.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Malt from Canada and England and Germany and everywhere.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Else. I have my business partner is another brewer in San Francisco. He wanted to be in San Francisco. I wanted to be in Alameda. I wanted to be in Alameda. I want to be with my colleagues and friends on spirits highly like Roger Faction or Lance at St George's.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And back in June of 2014, met with Jennifer, Art and Annette. And we originally was interested in a building. I couldn't get a long enough term lease, but then Annette showed us, showed me building.'",
        "'speaker_7': '91 and I really wanted that building.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I knew I couldn't develop my it myself. But I learned of Joe's vision for Building Nine and the and the Maker Project, the Artisan Food Project that he was deciding to do there. He's a Alameda resident, and I'll see him at a little house cafe, and his vision of the local artisan food production just fits in perfectly'",
        "'speaker_5': 'with what we want to do. His ideas are the accelerator, the incubator and the nurturing these artisan food movements half, as you know, local food for your Whole Foods. No one knows more local food producers than he in this world.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'One thing that attracts me so much is he's in this for the vision of it. He's here for the contribution he can make to Alameda. He more as a legacy project than a long term investment. May I speak just.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. Recently, he is investing $40 million in the two projects, 9 million in.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The building I want to be.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In. And he's building to suit for all the tenants. We have shared values. We're meeting next week with sewing. We want to install water. Recycle recycling system for the whole building could save enormous quantities of water. I've worked, I've looked around, I've worked with other attempted to work with other developers, landlords.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And no one has the commitment to the quality and success of his tenants as he does. We're in discussions for the other half of Building 91 with colleague breweries. Someone wants to do a brewery incubator there. There's other breweries that are interested.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It could be a really exciting, dynamic situation coming to close here. But my investment in this, I've invested a couple hundred thousand dollars so far, raised the money, invested it a most of it contracting local farmers to grow to to pay them a premium to grow malting quality barley.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And they're super excited about this, not just because it's another premium product they can grow, but it's a drought resistant product it can grow. We dry farmed barley last year that was our best barley that we grew it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And this kind of vision, again, with expanding the circle of who we work with from farmer to producer, will take that barley will turn it into malt. I have SBA financing for the entire project and I'm just really excited to be part of this campus of Building nine and 91 next to my colleagues on Spirit's Alley.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I'm excited to be part of this visionary project that will help expand and. Bring new industry to Alameda. So I thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. All right. Go ahead. Michael McDonough.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Good evening.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sorry that he's our last speaker on this item. Unless you want to announce that. Thank you. Go ahead now.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Good evening, everyone. I'm Michael McDonough, president of the Alameda Chamber of Commerce. Wow. I can't say more than these passionate people. This is exciting and visionary is is the truth. We have a trusted developer right here in Alameda putting $40 million into two of our buildings out there that badly need that investment.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And it sounds like it's a done deal except for you guys approval and hopefully that's coming. $40 million, I think, is closer to $45 million by the end of it. And we already have a lot of tenants lined up.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It really is a project that that answers the maker's vision that we have it for that area out there. It's not your typical L.A. style businesses that are coming in. This is truly wonderful. What what I'm hearing about there and with the tenants lined up, most of them Alameda residents already.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I know that that we all have known Joe for a while and he has been a trusted developer right here in Alameda and has proven his worth on parcels bigger than these two buildings and say they all put together out here at the Harbor Bay.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And we've all enjoyed the work that he's put in there. So if there's a question about whether or not he should be trusted with two more buildings, in addition to, say, they, I think his experience and his track record is well worth giving him that opportunity.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And it sounds like the investments are in place, the tenants are in place, the excitement is there. It's a wonderful complement to the other plans that are out there for Site A and as well as the other businesses out there.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I know of another maker out there and of its Alameda craft soda that is out of sight and outside out at the base there. It is just a wonderful opportunity to add to some of the success as we've already seen in that area.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I would encourage you to move forward with this with a trusted developer. All the plans are in place. It's just up to you guys now to approve it. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. All right. I have questions. And I'd like to start when I look at these two. This is a property of based upon what the speakers said of item 60. The my concern goes to the purchase price on these two as opposed to the lease.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I personally don't have a problem with the lease part. I do have serious problem with the purchase part. First of all, my one issue I have is I don't think it was really noticed as an option to purchase.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think that we do have limited buildings out there. When you're talking about purchasing a building, as much as this is being shared is what the current purpose of when someone actually buys a building. They it's it's very different in regards to what they can and can't do with it as long as it's under a broader'",
        "'speaker_1': 'zoning. So there's other things that can happen when a developer purchases a building. But in regards to the price of the purchase, six D Building nine based upon the report is 81,000 square feet on 4.2 acres of property.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think this would have been nice to have another visual and if you at so if you're talking 81,000 square feet 4.2 acres and the purchase price is 5.5 million and based on the comments from the speakers, there's an investment of 9 million or approximately 14.5 million of work to be done or the total purchase, if'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I include the investment. So $14.5 million for 81,000 square feet on 4.2 acres, which. I. Which to me is questionable in regards to that as the purchase price is separate from a lease. And I'm fortunate I didn't have enough time to run the.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The price per square foot of what that turns out to be. But I think it's significantly less than what housing is in this town right now, whereas 660, that one is is very different. That one is 41,000 square feet, 2.2 acres, a purchase price of 3 million, however, 31 million investment.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So that's approximately $1,000,000 per square foot, which is significantly higher if that's based on those numbers. And and I'm happy to have you come and describe the different numbers, but. So I think there needs to be. So so if you want to go ahead and speak to the purchase price, the investment.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So Building nine is currently an 80,000 square foot footprint. That is the building we're going to be investing about 30. It's actually about 32 to $33 million in. So the bigger building is getting the higher investment, the smaller building, building 41, 91, which is 41,000 square feet.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We have about a total investment in that building of 9 million.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. So it's still. Okay, so then so then it's the flip. So then my question would go to six E if the investment is 12 million for 41,000 square feet. And actually, I'm not sure. The other one may also be questionable because then.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Without having the numbers. I think that this presentation needs to include I'm happy to include the investment part, if that's what it takes to build the building or to get it operable. But I think we need to have some analysis of what the cost per square foot is to purchase not just the lease and actual those.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm sorry. Yes, go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'All right. So the all in cost for building 91 with our investment will be about $220 per square foot. That way exceeds the comps for comparable buildings in this market. You have some, you know, brokers in the audience who can talk to you at length about that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But that is a very significant investment which reflects.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that's for building 91. That's for building what one? And is that the 3 million plus 31 million then.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That's the three. No, that's the 3 million plus an additional 6 million that will put in to rehabbing the building and building out the tenants spaces. All these buildings need all new, all new electrical, all new plumbing. They need their sanitary sewer systems upgraded.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'They need all new sprinkler system upgrades. Building 91 doesn't even have sprinklers. They need seismic upgrades before.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But you're talking about $9 million for 41,000 square feet, correct? Is that correct? That's correct. And okay. So $9 million for 41,000 square feet. I think we have homes being sold right now in this town, $1 million for, I'd say 2000 square feet or 3000 square feet.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But so but it's a very different animal amenity. It's a function of the rents.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So it is. But still, the breakdown that I think needs to be decided if we're talking about an option to purchase, which is very different to me than a lease. And I think they do require different analysis. And then so your numbers on 16, what did you come up with for your price per square foot on that'",
        "'speaker_7': '? Well, with the $35 million or $33 million, we will be adding a second floor in that building because of its clear height, which is a significant capital improvement to the building.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sorry. Adding a second floor to the building?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Higher than it currently exists.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Either one.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So you're adding.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm not raising the rent.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Guidelines.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So that'll be, you know, with our investment will be about $220 a square foot and so comparable. But by the time we get done upgrading these buildings, all new seismic upgrades, all new electrical plumbing systems, gas, we have to bring the buildings don't have gas.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We need building 91 needs all new siding on it's weather side doors, windows, interior improvements. Well, we have invested $220 a foot in these buildings, which is a pretty significant investment when you look at comparable.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Work and staff work on the two different tables of the total cost to purchase per square foot in the meantime, and other councilmembers are asking questions.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I have that in front of me. So for.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Building, is there a way to do it so that we can maybe do it on that board or so that it shows up so that the audience can see what we're talking.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'With?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I'm confused because yeah, I thought we gave direction to staff on negotiating this this option to purchase amount. So I don't understand why it's at issue now. If we gave direction and you took our direction and you negotiated at least based on that direction.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Right. And we believe just to get to your question, we believe, given the condition of these properties, that the value that we're selling it to. This Developer four is in the market range for what the value of those buildings are.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So for instance and, and I can try to put it up, but I think just it's relatively easy math and you take the building and purchase price for building 94, Building nine is $3 million or is that right?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's a 5.5, I think.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yeah. The 5.5 million divided by the 80,000, it comes out to $65 a square foot, which is talking to our advisors, our leasing brokers that work for us that is on kind of the high end range of for a Class C building warehouse, kind of industrial building that's within the range of the value of a building in'",
        "'speaker_8': 'that condition. And then for building 91, that comes out to about $73 a square foot. So on a square foot basis, even more for a building that honestly is actually in worse condition and requires a lot more a lot more investment.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So we believe that we're getting market value for these buildings. We also, as our kind of what I care about kind of the most is that we are not getting less for these two buildings combined than the infrastructure burden that they're required to pay in both these cases will be, well, we'll be getting sufficient dollars to cover'",
        "'speaker_8': 'their fair share of the infrastructure burden as a floor, as a minimum. That doesn't mean we shouldn't try to get more because of the market value for our buildings. But given the condition of these buildings, given the condition, honestly, of the infrastructure and given the amount of investment that is required to bring them up to a use'",
        "'speaker_8': 'that will be highly utilized and attract jobs and the types of users that they're talking about attracting that creates a catalyst for this whole area. We believe that these are market value for these purchase prices.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I swear.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I, I think that the important things that were just stated there about the condition of the buildings. The infrastructure and the fact that commercial is much different than residential, you cannot compare the two. I think we have to move on this now.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I, I am ready to support a motion that authorizes the city manager to execute these documents because, number one. The investors are ready to. To make these buildings usable. Number two, the inhabitants of the buildings are ready to lease them.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Number three, these buildings will get off of the city's ownership and onto the tax generating private sector and grow our commercial area. And when we've had in the last 30 years much difficulty in growing the commercial sector in Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So it's really critical that we use this window now.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Our second that motion and I'd also like to add my comments.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To to move on the two properties for those two reasons. And I think the infrastructure costs out. These both lie outside of city, but we'll take some advantage of city infrastructure. These will contribute, as was mentioned, to the infrastructure cost that has been burdened on every property at Alameda Point.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And they're higher because we're going to need that higher because some properties, especially in the future, will not be able to get what we need. So I believe we have to get this now.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'A member already.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I think we need to motion. So I don't know if you're going to make one on.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'One or.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'XD.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'XD I move for the the second and 60 and then. So my comments were you you were making a promise I will do it that way.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'To save time. I would say everything that the vice mayor just said. So I'm not going to repeat it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And what I would just add to that is that in reading the staff report, you will note that Building Nine was last occupied in 2003. That's 12 years ago. There's a cost to having those vacant, decaying buildings. And what I've heard and what I read in the staff report is this is a movement.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's a healthy movement. It's something that people are embracing. It's another way to bring more people out to alameda point. I hope some of you in in the audience that may be watching at home have made your way out to the pumpkin patch that's added at on the water there now as part of phase zero.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But what I thought was great, I think I was out there the first weekend, which was also the first Sunday is they did this cute little court with the food trucks and then there's all the amenities for the kids, the petting zoo and the jumpy house and stuff.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But it helped get some people off of the roadway. So instead of leaving the antiques fair that for Sunday the month and everybody heading to the tube, they were heading into the point and enjoying the amenities out there.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We'll do even more of this. And something that I have long wanted is more of a retail component. Added Alameda Point. I know we have a lot of manufacturing going on, but our residents and visitors who will come to our town, they'll they'll spend their money if there's retail to buy.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So you made me hungry talking about all this great offerings. But I agree with the vice mayor. I think it's a great opportunity and we need to move on it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Remember days are.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. We have in Building nine and Building 91 two proposals before us that complement the vision for nearby site A as well as complement the nearby successful Spirits Alley already in place. Lady M is nearby as is right speed.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'With Spirits Alley nearby, as well as Palladium and Right Speed. The projects before us offer strong prospects for kickstarting Alameda Point as an exciting place of small scale artisanal craft manufacturing. In working with local businesses such as J.C. Sellers and a development team who has demonstrated success in other parts of Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think we have a set of players in whom we have a strong measure of confidence. This is an important point because in the transfer mechanisms we are utilizing tonight. Thus far we have had three projects fall by the wayside.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'm speaking of the two Caruso projects and the West Hollywood Shopping Center project. Base conversion isn't easy knowing that in recent years we. Actually strike that. John Russo set out a vision and ways to implement the vision to get developers and the type of businesses we want.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We've got quality folks knocking down our doors in right speed, J.C. Sellers and surround Ernst with the two projects before us tonight. It's time to get going even further. I have deliberately deliberated over the aspects of the business deal and have decided that these are investments worth making.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We have people in front of us with local track records that engender confidence, that engender my confidence. We are not getting less for these two buildings. What the infrastructure burdens are in place for these buildings already. That is not tonight.'",

There's a there is significant data here. And on regards to the the lease part, there is next to nothing in regards to analysis for the purchase.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'And as we as the questions have arisen in the last week, I drove past Building 23 and I called my Martin contacts and said, What are you guys doing? There's a trillion containers out there right now. And and so I was told that the containers are there.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'I am well, there's nothing that speaks to this specifically in the lease. However, because of the nature of their operations, they are not a large truck transit organization. I mean, everything that they have is in the warehouse. In addition, they will be using three.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They'll be using Pier three for three days a month to bring large ship parts that could not come on a in a container. So they'll have a barge to bring things over. But they're not a large truck traffic truck trip generator.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'And so we could bring this lease back end for review if they significantly change their use. But and we would feel that immediately. So I think that the consistency in the use would change and we could definitely bring them in for review.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Not safe turbines dapps things of that nature. But getting back to the point, we can assure you we can even amend the lease to say quite specifically that we won't be stacking cargo and that we will not be utilizing the facility as a logistics facility for for mass navigation, strictly warehousing or ship repair parts in America.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes, sir.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sir, would you be willing to put a restricted number of containers and in in this, along with the provisions you just mentioned. They can be revisited if if the need arises.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Talking. I'd like to hear what.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'I'm concerned with truck traffic, but I'd like to hear what our guest has to say about.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, sir. Well, most of the containers that we use nowadays are about 40 feet in length or.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Eight feet.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Wide highway use.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So do you know the height?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Typically 8 to 10 feet? Very slightly. So a single container then would cover about 240 square feet of. And that might have to help me with the square footage outside of the building, but I'm sure it approaches, well, better than 80,000 square feet.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So a single container, only 200 and 240 square feet. So if we had 30 in total there. You could see right away that we're we're hardly going to cover a small, small fraction of the outside area there with with use for any containers, because I can't imagine ever having so many parts that we'd have.'",
        "'speaker_5': '24 to 30 containers outside at the very most.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'What is the height of the screening?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I don't know if the fencing is six foot or eight foot around the area. I believe it's a six foot fence. So there would be if it's an eight foot tall, there would be to the tops of the of the cargo containers would be visible that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But that would be it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And how many containers do you currently have at your site?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Look how many containers. We're at a.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Really high number and we're at 30 right.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Now. What's your average then? What do you think your average is?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah. You'll have to repeat that for the record.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So even though you're saying you're you have 30 now because you're moving, you're anticipating to have 30 at the new site. That's what I heard, if that's correct.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The matter of my my question, my. Given the size of this and. I'm looking for ways to to quantify what the concerns are. And I'm satisfied that this use is compatible with this this zone. In fact, Thailand has maritime use for other public recreation use.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We're not going to get recreation here. So I think that fits. I think the question of stacking. I'd like to see the at least amended to put stacking prohibition of stacking any containers and in the lease. I'd also like a commitment that this not a logistics area.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So those 30 may enter and may sit. And I'd also like, you know, Ms.. Mercado said that we could bring this back for review. I'd like this to come back for review after a year of operation with fracking truck truck trips to see what the actual movement back and forth is and get a census of the containers'",
        "'speaker_1': '. And would you limit the number of containers to 30? Would you put any cap in at any cap? I would like to add the cap of 30.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And the screening, I think is also should be part of the emotion.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Can you speak about the screening? The screening?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'How do you mean.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That it would be included?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Well, that be included.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Wonderful.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So on the number and that's.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'To the recommendation. Just so is that we would come back to you and in a year with with information on the number of truck trips. We will screen the facility. We will amend the list to say no stacking of the cargo containers.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's where we are so far.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'And a commitment not to this not to be a logistics center.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'I'm sure you've already.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'Those are.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Two number.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'From the net and then we heard 30. So I mean, is that something you can live with or.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Can you limit it to 30 containers that you would have at the site? Can we include that?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We can limit the number of.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Containers.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To 30.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We need a machine.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Sorry to interrupt.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm sorry. Before we continue, we need a motion to consider remaining items six G, which is the Enterprise District, and six H, which is our move. Our second point, leasing i. All those in favor. I oppose the motion passes.'",
        "'speaker_1': '41. Thank you. And so then those were the additional conditions. So could we vote to approve the lease for those additional.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You put them in your motion, we can we can amend the lease and circulate it for.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And member Ashcroft. Mr. Odie asked the question of Mr. Hart, and I didn't hear the answer. So 30. If we limited you to 30 containers at a time, is that workable?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You're 36. I mean.'",
        "'speaker_6': '36.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It's a number that you feel comfortable with.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I appreciate that. We're trying our very best. We really want to leave this property. We really want to be tenants here in Alameda, as we have been for years. So I'm trying to be as flexible as I possibly can.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'If I if I commit to 30, I will admit to you that it's going to put it's going to keep me tight. 36. Feels very, very comfortable. I don't know if the council's comfortable with that, but I would be very happy with 36.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You know.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So. So this requires four votes to pass. So I appreciate that there's three of you that appear to be enthusiastic. I'd like to know. And there's obviously one that's not and I'm in between and between the two in regards to how much space is the 30 going to take, because it's going to be above our screening screenings'",
        "'speaker_1': 'at six feet, approximately, is my understanding. These can be up to ten feet. I am also concerned as a member of De SOG in regards to when we drive around here, we're going to be seeing containers. And many of us actually do this drive.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I appreciate that. So this is at this point, I would prefer if you could. Go as low as you can on the number of containers, because we really don't want them to become storage for containers.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Madam Chair, would you mean I mean, is it possible to increase the height of the screening?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So it goes to I really prefer the view of the island. I mean, many of us actually enjoy looking at the water and the boats, the ships and whatnot. So obviously screening this whole thing, it's a big area, but it sounds to me.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So you guys came up with 30 what you currently have.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I think they'd be comfortable with six.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah, I am.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I don't want I don't want to become.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yeah. I mean.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We need more.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Votes. This is this is a maritime use. It's a working waterfront. We we don't want to unduly tie the hands of our tenants in this tidelands area. So the difference between 30 and 36 and I think council member Odie threw out a suggestion that you could maybe raise the height of the screening, although it doesn't sound like'",
        "'speaker_6': 'they're going to get any taller you because you're not going to stack them anyway. And the water, if I'm looking at the map correctly, would be behind you, right? I mean, you don't come out to sea containers. You remember the.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Water, you're supportive. Currently, I he needs four votes. Do you mind if I ask questions? Because.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'No, I think we should all.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay, so go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Well, I think what we're trying to do is find find some.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I'd.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Like that. But something if you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If you want me to support it, I'd like to ask the questions to see where I can negotiate. I don't try to.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Which want me to ask questions I'd be happy to ask them. If otherwise, you can go ahead and call the question.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Ask if no one's telling you not to ask questions matters.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I'd like to continue them.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Would you like me to ask you to please ask a question?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So. In regards to the 30, that was the number you originally said that you currently have 30. Can you do this with 30? If the answer is no, just say no. And then tell me how much more square footage you need.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I'd like to know than in this visual, how much of this is going to be covered with these containers. So when we drive by, what we're going to be looking at.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. Give me just a moment for a quick calculation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'ANNETTE Excuse me.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sir.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Was that 36?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Jennifer 36.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yet 36 containers will take 8600 square feet of the outside area, which is about 15% of the building space. So you can see that visually it won't take a lot of the area 38. It'll be a small area in that yard.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Would they all be together or would they be scattered across?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'No. Thank you. Actually the containers would be set very neatly side by side, all with their their doors facing in a single direction for access. They could also be very neatly lined up along the outside of the building, perpendicular to the building.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And unlike the the old area photo there, where there were broken boats scattered all over the place. It'll never look anything like that. And will be shipshape in all of our containers in good order over there. And as I said, about 15% of that area outside of the building would have containers.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So a lot of free space.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So it'll be around the entire building. Where do you think these containers would be?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Just a moment, Michael.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And you tell me.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And you know what? Why don't you have the gentleman come up? Because it's. It'll be a little quicker.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I was just going to ask for an outside dimension of the building because of the containers eight feet wide. And we have 36 of them. We can calculate pretty quickly how much lineal feet that'll take.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I was just going to just what we've done is taken a calculation of the land area minus the building coverage, which leaves you about 145,000 square feet of outdoor space. If you had 36 containers, which it sounds like what you said would make me very comfortable for them, as about 8600 square feet, 8600 square feet of'",
        "'speaker_8': 'the 140,000 square feet of land area is about 6% of the land area. That would be on a the maximum day, which it sounds like does not happen all the time, would be covered by containers. So 6% of the outdoor land area.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Where do you anticipate the containers will be? We're. We're within here. But they sounded like they'd be adjacent to your building. Yes, ma'am. So is it. Surrounding your entire building. Do you think they're behind in the back of the building as opposed to the front, or where do you think they're going to be?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So my preference would be that they kind of be together in one area.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And answer your question. I just need a little help.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Right there. That's the doors. The first. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So on the exhibit. That's where the storage area would be, container side by.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Side, perpendicular to the building.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'From left to right or from west to east. Here.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. So would you be comfortable putting the 36 and that area as part of the lease? That's where they're going to be.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes, ma'am.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I do have a motion with that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But we have a speaker.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have one more speaker. Aaron May.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Good evening again. So it looks like it's going to go forward and I wasn't going to speak, but I really don't like this at all. I work in a site where a bunch of containers and it's just not a pretty sight.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I love driving through this area. I drive through it every weekend because it's there's something about the large ships and the Hornet that just brings me the sense of calm and peace. And I just knew that you guys were going to we were going to wait until we developed Building nine and 91.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And this property was is kind of explode in value. And we were going to go after some kind of a, you know, a ship, a cruise terminal or, you know, maybe expand Commodore Cruises or something. And I just.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I just don't think that this is the highest and best use for this beautiful location. And I'm and I'm again, I worked with and on a site surrounded by containers and they kept growing. They took us over a year to get rid of them.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And and now we're developing something beautiful. And I just I just think I just hope that we're not jumping too quickly to, you know, develop or to lease this beautiful site. It's it's just an incredible piece of property.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I feel strongly about it. And I wasn't going to say anything, but I, I, I, I'm a taxpayer. I love my community and I love Alan made a point, and I just think that this piece of property that we should wait and, and do something, you know, something wonderful with it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's just my opinion. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay, so I'm gonna go back. You currently you've been using this your current site that is smaller. My belief is the building is smaller and and originally this conversation started with you have 34 moving. Now we're at 36 to do this business.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I think there may be a problem there um other members member.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'ASHCROFT So I always appreciate hearing from our community members. Um, there's a couple things that I'm keeping in mind about this proposal. One of them is it's a ten year lease. We've said this council has said all along we are going to be in a 20 to 30 year process to build out the base.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And we are looking next at the development strategies for the Enterprise District and we're going to talk about some of those things. I don't I don't disagree that there's, you know, some lovely vistas out there, but it's also a tidelands area and it's also our heritage as a working waterfront.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And Mattson Mattson is a venerable old firm, currently based, I think, in Oakland and a little personal connection. During World War Two, my mother worked for mountain lions, but it was in San Francisco, and I think they were one of the shipping lines that transported troops during World War Two.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But with there there's the other piece of this that I don't think is in the staff report, but I would imagine other council members got the same phone call I got from Google. Google doesn't call me every day, but in the in the building that Mattson would be vacating because they've outgrown Google is looking to expand its'",
        "'speaker_6': 'operation at Alameda Point. So it's, you know, one hinges on the other. I mean, obviously, we look at the appropriateness of the use. But again, it is the working waterfront. We're creating jobs. Gosh, looking at container containers, shipping containers, there are worse things.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And, you know, it's it doesn't give you a sense of of what this this area is. Anyway, I we're talking about a ten year lease that would bring in some decent revenue during this time while we move forward with the development of this, you know, of Alameda Point.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And we also allow Google the opportunity that they would like to avail themselves of to expand in Alameda. And I for 1 a.m. interested in that thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Member coverage. The point about creating jobs, can you tell me how many jobs are going to be created by moving forward with this the Mattson site?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That there are no jobs created. The existing jobs will move from this Building 23 location. There are currently about six employees there that work in the facility. Alameda Resident. Generational. Alameda Resident And I think this is Madsen's effort to run kind of a me clean, mean, lean organization and not create a lot of, you know, not add'",
        "'speaker_4': 'to not have a lot of people coming in and out of their facility.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right, member.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you, Madam Mayor. So just to clarify, I think Google wants to expand their space. And the tenant that's in the space that they want to expand to would move to Building 23, where Mattson is now. And then Mattson would move over here to this space.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So, I mean, theoretically, you know, we would be saving the six jobs, keeping them in Alameda. But if Google can expand, you know, we don't know that number today. I mean, it would be good to know. But I mean, we would have an increase theoretically in the jobs.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We do know that that the the company that's moving into building 23 anticipates creating over 100 new jobs.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So if we kept. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. So if we kept.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Can't talk about the.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. So if we kept them in 23 where they are, then we potentially lose the possibility of those 200 odd jobs. So my question is to the mayor then. Are your conditions satisfied with with the extra, you know, the limit on 36 with the goal that it should probably stay closer to 30 and that it's stored in'",
        "'speaker_9': 'that particular space that that you identified. And then with the vice mayor be willing to do that, in effect, and the vice mayor be willing to amend his motion to include those conditions, because I'd be willing to to respond.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I appreciate that, actually. I really appreciated Karen Bass comments. I too have issues with having containers stored out there. The tops of them will be visible. I don't really understand. And my understanding is there's 30 containers being used now because of the move.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And yet now it appears that we're going to have to have 36 to do this business. So there's there seems to be a disconnect in the number of containers.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You know, a lot of times businesses, you know, we can have them come up and answer your questions specifically with regard to their business. But sometimes when you're creating something in a legal document with a lease, it you know, it doesn't give any wiggle room.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And sometimes businesses like to have a little flexibility to be able, if there are special circumstances that might exceed their average or their normal to allow that. I mean, that's typically when you're putting it in a lease document as opposed to something.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But so I appreciate that in the last five years, what's your average number of containers been at this business?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'He said third about 30.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So then there hasn't been an increase because of the move. This has been the average. If that's been the average, then there has not been a recent increase because of the moves and that was actually not accurate.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Maybe maybe it wasn't accurate, but I think I think the point is, if we have 36 there as a provision of the lease, I think that's a reasonable restriction. And if I cataloged the the additions to the lease that I thought I saw in order to hit on it was that in the lease, it's going to be'",
        "'speaker_3': 'explicit that the party agrees that this is not a logistics center and there will be no logistics operations. There will be no stacking of containers. There will be a maximum of 36 containers stored on the side of the building, as indicated on the visual of the site map.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There will be screening enhancement so that the visual effect of those containers will be mitigated and there will be a one year revisit of the lease, which will include a report on the number of truck trips that have been generated.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I'm willing to put those in the motion of my second year, willing to accept that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I have perfectly willing to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think the importance of this are three fold. One is it's fitting for the zoning and it meets the policy that the city had set. Number two, it keeps jobs in Alameda. Number three, it provides the potential for additional jobs because it's taking in an inactive empty a deteriorating building and occupying it, freeing up a building'",
        "'speaker_3': 'for another tenant to move into its interest and then freeing up another tenant that is interested in expanding. So I think it's a complicated piece, but this is another case where. For the foreseeable future, which is ten years in a 30 year horizon.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We're going to commit to this this user.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And just to follow up on that point, not that we have no problem. I don't have any problem with you being there. But, you know, it's good to get this industrial use out of Spirit's Alley and where our food incubator is going to be and stick it down there by the ships and the piers where, you know'",
        "'speaker_9': ', tidelands and industrial use is more appropriate.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'My comment, if I can, just to two points. As I indicated, this has been I think all of you know, when we went through the whole the general plan process, but even prior to that way, every time we did some kind of planning, I've always indicated a concern about stack containers.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So this is nothing new going back even to the 1990s. My feeling is that, you know, we're at a point now where we're moving fast with society and its quality development. That's fitting the vision that we have and.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I just, you know, zoning notwithstanding, I just don't see this as fitting the vision along the waterfront of having these containers stacked or not. And I think the message that it sends about moving forward with the Enterprise District is that, you know.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'With all due apologies. Lowest common denominator land users are welcome and. I can only speak as one council member.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Maybe I just want to make one comment because I think there were some questions about council member matters, you know, why staff is bringing this to and why we think this is a good use. It isn't necessarily a major job producer.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think some of that I just want to add some additional thoughts to this discussion, which is one of the things that's very compelling to us, is that it's in a tidelands area where we honestly don't have a lot of use potential.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So it actually and what they're willing to do is pay market rent for a building that honestly, given the fact that it's restricted from a use standpoint, has a lot less potential for demand and potentially less value in that building because of that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So for us to get a market value on a building that essentially is kind of restricted and is is important to us, it's been vacant for two and a half years. We built there's a $500,000 roof that has to get fixed on that building.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'They're going to be putting our $4 million into this. And it's not honestly the tenant we had there before we it was a very, you know, a tenant where we spotty payment and other things that happened that was very risky to the city ended up costing us over $1,000,000 to ultimately deal with the removal of that tenant'",
        "'speaker_8': 'and to have essentially a national I mean, the credit company like this that we will not have any insecurity in terms of payment, you know, good rent on a building, putting in a significant dollars, an investment into a building that's falling apart in a restricted use that kind of suppresses the potential value.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And we're getting market value for it. I mean, those are some of the reasons in a working waterfront zoning, which is essentially we really try to minimize, you know, those concerns that you have, Councilmember Desai, about that working waterfront spilling over into those other areas.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We really want to capture jobs here. We're restricting them, put it putting them as close to the marriage ships, which are big, heavy industry, you know, heavier kind of industrial feel and keeping those uses close to where those ships are and trying to do that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So those are I just wanted you to have the benefit of all the thinking that we had in terms of why we're recommending this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'What is the term of their current lease?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There is sub ten into West Coast novelties who has terminated their lease. So there there under their their lease which is expires at the end of the year.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So they essentially don't have a lease for the current. The current property is going to be ending. That lease has two more months or something on it. Correct. So then they're looking for a new site regardless or a new lease regardless?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, yes, ideally they would. I mean, they would want to stay in 23. However, because it's a maritime use, we have a maritime facility and we also have Google. We have other tenants who want to expand. We felt like this was a good fit.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I just want to piggyback on what Jennifer also said is that and to respond to Councilmember de SACS comments that we have had other interests in this building and some of the the users that were pretty exciting and dazzling high speed ferry we were and we were competing with that with new technology and those people love'",
        "'speaker_4': 'love the location, hated the building, hated the fact that they had to put millions of dollars into the building and would and and turned us down. And our brokers can tell you how many times they've toured people who ended up going to Seattle and getting a turnkey building.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so we have tried to lease this building for the last two and a half years to and to the people that we think would be a good fit to. And this is serendipitous that Madsen was needing a new home and they they fit the that island.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And it's also, again, I concur. It's commitment to the working waterfront, which is diminishing in the San Francisco Bay area.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So what about a five year lease? And we do that. Does it have to be ten years?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We would have to relook, renegotiate the entire document at this point if you want to take the term and it would impact because they have to finance the half a million dollar roof that they would need to put on the building as that in addition to the improvements that they need to put into the facility.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'How much is that?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So as I understand it, and you guys can feel free to jump in. As I understand it, the roof is a half a million dollars alone. And I believe that they're intending to put in about $4 million into the building.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Madam Mayor, I think that's that's another reason to to look at this, the investment in the building. We own it. Nobody else wants to invest. And that's number one. Number two, medicine is not a second tier name. I think you're it's an American flag line.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Right. And, you know, if you look on the back of their ships, they're they're registered in the U.S. of a not in Liberia, Panama or wherever. So they're a marquee name that we can also put as a as a a tenant at Alameda Point to attract other marquee names.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I think that goes with it. And as far as getting cruise ships out of I know this was talked about ten years ago, getting cruise ships out of the port of San Francisco is a daunting task if if not realistic within the next ten years.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I do think it's important. And I also believe that the tenants across the way who are our largest tenants, are going to be continuing to use that waterfront in a way that is industrial, just like with it is just kitty corner and it's not in the enterprise zone near price zone.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And when we get to that point on the agenda, that enterprise zone provides the proper buffer between the Main Street neighborhood and what is Tidelands Truss the remainder of our working waterfront. So I think we have to bite the bullet and do this, but I'd hate to lose.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This tenant, especially with the name Mattson associated with it at four or something that is is I think is doable for the next ten years.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Ben Amir, Question.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Member days out.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So just to clarify, so. Building 23. There is a tenant who has a lease and their lease will expire soon. And Mattson is a sublease. Yes. So when that sub10 it went, that expires. Then they're out?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So when they're out. Google should they so want or whomever it is. I don't know who it is.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Whatever tenant.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Whatever tenant and go in there. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This does not impact that, then.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Well, they might want to stay in 23 then. I'd have a hard time, you know, denying a lease to somebody that's been there and operating without any problems.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Actually, there have been problems or complaints about the containers. That has. There have been complaints about the containers.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. Well, that's going to be and I thought we've kind of taken steps to alleviate those complaints.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So let me ask you, in regards to the containers, could they be behind the building so that when we drive up. What could they do? You know what I mean? When I'm. When we drive up to Ticonderoga, could they be on the, you know.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'On the engineering side.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah. Could they be between the two buildings. So first of all, I think when you're driving around.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah. Well, this the blue is the fence line. So behind. So here. Right there. But back here.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Actually behind the building between the two buildings.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, the Madsen folks say that they won't fit. It's not enough space between the fence line and the building so that they could put them here in this location in the corner.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They have to unload them, correct? Yeah. I mean, you have to be able to get.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They have to be able to access them to get the equipment in and out of them. Right.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. What about? Um, actually. So I'd like to figure out a way to have these containers as less visible as possible. And so I think that that. Maybe. Maybe Karen Bass would like to tell me where this could go anywhere.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is there any place where they're less visible between the two buildings or even maybe to the right of the building on the other side? By or a scar.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'On the side?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah, on that side. So when we're driving around the water, we're not looking at them. Could they be on the back side and on the side?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's so we don't do it here.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Can I just ask a quick question about the nature of the screening fence we're talking about? I mean, is it just a cyclone fence that you see through or is it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's the black netting that you see on the fences.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. So it would be sort of opaque.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's it's opaque.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And this is we're talking about 6% of the yard space. That's 145,000 square feet.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. So what about those two locations? Would that be sufficient?'",

        "'speaker_4': 'You want it here?'",

        "'speaker_4': 'In between the two buildings is okay. Siding and close to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The building as possible. I don't think we drive on that road as much as the side. I think we drive around. So I think that would be less visible.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'I think I'm fine with that because when I drive by there, I'm certainly not looking back at Old Nelson's moran. I'm looking at the water. That's one thing. I think the fence will help mitigate it. That's another thing.'",

And when you come back and if there's a problem and it has to be adjusted, I would like this to be able to come back so we can adjust this provision, because this provision to me is minor'",

And although I'm focusing on the 2014 zoning amendment, the reality is when this the reuse plan was approved in 1996, the focus was on attracting jobs because we lost 18,000'",

I'm five and half million square feet of commercial that is ultimately got approved as part of the recent project. And then the 2014 zoning amendment was very strategic about creating a vision for attracting jobs.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I mean, first and foremost, we zoned a lot of land for industrial uses that prohibited residential use, which is obviously the first way to to, you know, to to try to put yourself in the best position for attracting jobs.'",

So the idea here really has been to focus on trying to attract new development, new construction to the enterprise zone. So what the zoning does and there was a lot of discussion and I think it's important to understand that this wasn't we just didn't'",
        "'speaker_8': 'say slap a zoning and say, oh, you just have commercial development in enterprise zone. There was a lot of discussion with the planning board, the city council, the community about this area and creating even subdistricts within the enterprise zone to address some key issues.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But I can tell you overall, the uses here focus on catalytic commercial uses with spinoff potential, really focusing office R&D, light industrial uses with that create jobs, really de-emphasizing storage uses, things like that. But also this working waterfront, which we're not going to get into, we just talked about, but that really creating this district for here intended'",
        "'speaker_8': 'to be a working waterfront area because it is tidelands, it's actually highly restricted, as we already mentioned. So we started to break this area up into different areas where you've got these four districts, the really the district one being that primary area of being able to attract a larger major campus user, possibly for a light industrial office'",
        "'speaker_8': 'R&D campus. Then you've got this second district, which is still that type of use, but kind of recognizing that, hey, you're next to this town center area where you might have some residential, you might have some mixed use.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You need to kind of tone down maybe some of these other industrial uses a little bit, be a little more sensitive to this transition with the town center, the district three, which is really the buffer area between what's going on in the enterprise district, in the residential area, really a recognition that we need to really kind of'",
        "'speaker_8': 'limit the kinds of uses have to be much less intense uses next to the residential area and then the District four, which is the focus on the working waterfront. So there was a lot of thought and this will frame essentially our approach to the next step in terms of trying to market the enterprise area to attract jobs'",
        "'speaker_8': ', is using this policy framework that was approved in 2014 that builds off the reuse plan from 1996. That said, I do want to say that that zoning is really your regulatory hat, that the city council, the planning board where in terms of regulating uses.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But I will say that we're you know, as we've talked about before, we said it is a unique situation where you also in this particular case where the property owner had. So even though these are kind of the policy framework that gives some flexibility as to types of uses you can attract here, ultimately the city council can'",
        "'speaker_8': 'be as particular as it wants about the type of use. And I will tell you, you know, my direction to Cushman Wakefield is that we are for especially the first deal, the first transaction. We want to be a catalytic use that attracts jobs.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It brings a big name that does something to really start to put this area on a map that we think is going to have that potential to either attract a lot of jobs, great business to business sales tax, or to really start to create momentum for something more so that we can really capture the other jobs that'",
        "'speaker_8': 'we want. So I just want to mention that that you kind of this is the regulatory framework, but the property owner that you also get to be a little more picky and particular about what you want. And we will keep that in mind as we move forward with our effort here.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Do you have any speakers on the side of the speakers? Right. Council members.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. So the recommended approach, I'm going to give you a quick summary on this. We can come back to this slide, but just want to summarize it first. You can be thinking about it as I go through a little bit more of why we're recommending this.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But the idea is to essentially use an existing contract with Cushman Wakefield. They have an existing listing agreement which includes that the sale of land, which is what this would be in. So just to and I want to and I should have done this a little earlier, I want to kind of emphasize this is different.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'What when you're trying to attract a commercial user, they're going to be looking for improved land. And what the difference between kind of undeveloped land versus improve lamb is really infrastructure for a user to come in and be able to develop their campus.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'They are typically out in the market looking for a land that's improved so that they don't have to put infrastructure in, but they can come in, build their vertical improvements, create their buildings, and then operate their business. And that timeline is much more predictable when you are have undeveloped land, which is essentially what we have here because'",
        "'speaker_8': 'of infrastructure, that's a lot less certain. You have this idea how you are going to fund infrastructure than the construction of infrastructure and then getting into the development of the vertical. And that is that is atypical in terms of users come in and they typically are when they're looking at land, they're looking at improve land.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I want to just have you understand this. You understand kind of where we are and we've kind of created our strategy around the idea of reducing that certainty related to the undeveloped land that's out there as part of this area B area.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So the recommended approach is to use existing contract with Cushman Wakefield, have them essentially act as our listing agent, which we already have a contract for them to do to try to attract users primarily to Area B, which is what they do all over the Bay Area, all over the world.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But to link the marketing phases to the site, a progress because we see it as so important to be able to create confidence around our ability to deliver improved land to a user is to show the progress was site because site is what ultimately brings in the trunk infrastructure that we can kind of tee off of and'",
        "'speaker_8': 'use to build the infrastructure for site B. So we really think we need to link our marketing phases and our approach to the site progress. And based on comments we received, we understand them in there. You know, we we think that this and we'll talk about why we chose this approach, but there probably is a need for'",
        "'speaker_8': 'us to come back every six months, staff comes back, evaluates the progress that's been made, or honestly, the progress that hasn't been made maybe, and make an assessment and come to you with our recommendation as to whether or not to continue this approach or do we need a pivot, we need to change, do something a little different'",
        "'speaker_8': 'based on the signals we're getting from the market or whatever it is. But to come back with a six month update to make sure that we still think that this is the right approach. So why are we recommending this?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think the it's a different approach. We went out with a request for qualifications from developers. At the same time, we did the site process. In the case of site B, we did not get we got much less response.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And when we negotiated them, they were willing to commit to a lot less and not because there was anything wrong with these developers. They were just responding to the fact there was a lot of uncertainty about the commercial market not wanting to commit to build infrastructure, pay for land when they didn't know what types of users were'",
        "'speaker_8': 'going to ultimately be there. And we decided to put that on hold until we got further along with site A, that's why we're here today. Back to you with that same strategy. So we did evaluate or that with a different, you know, with an approach and we did look at whether or not we should RFQ again from'",
        "'speaker_8': 'developers, what we're actually recommending today is not to do that. We think that going out again with an RFQ from developers is not the right approach. We think we think there would be kind of perceived in the market as, oh, you didn't get anything before, now you're out again, and that there might be a stigma associated with'",
        "'speaker_8': 'a second attempt at doing it with that same approach, which doesn't mean we can't do that later. We just think right now let's try a different approach. We actually think we should focus on end users instead of developers developer.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We think with using a leasing agent and broker like Cushman Wakefield, we can focus more on end users, which doesn't mean we're going to ignore developers of a great developer comes in with a concept and they've got an idea and they're willing to commit to some things.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We're absolute going to consider those proposals as well. But to focus less on just developers, we want to cast a wider net. Second, we think by using this approach it's more cost efficient. We're using a commission structure, which essentially means that until the city council votes and approves this transaction, Cushman Wakefield does not get paid.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So they only get paid if they deliver a transaction of this city council approves. So there's a push for essentially a performance based structure that's built into this. There's no upfront cost to the city we may elect to enhance some of the marketing materials with our own dollars to do, but we're not committing to that and it's'",
        "'speaker_8': 'not required as part of this. So we think that this is cost efficient. And then lastly, we think it's flexible and that. You know, you're not running in. You're not if you did an RFQ and worked to directly the developer, you're most likely going to be looking at an exclusive negotiation agreement that's looking at a developed disposition'",
        "'speaker_8': 'or development agreement where you're committing to a single developer. And we think this approach creates more flexibility upfront, which doesn't mean if you find the perfect developer or the perfect user that you can't enter into those agreements. But it doesn't put us on that path immediately and potentially prematurely.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So the proposed development strategy, as I said, is really linking. We're created three different phases which really tie to the site infrastructure and have assigned a, you know, started to put a schedule together based on the performance milestones in the site, a disposition development agreement.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But the idea is the awareness phase. We honestly believe over the next 9 to 14 months, while the developer site developers closing on the property, getting all of their final design review and other improvement plans and other entitlements in place before they actually close on their Phase one property.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We don't think that we're going to get a big transaction. It doesn't mean if there one comes our way, we're not going to take advantage. But we think of this more as an awareness phase where it's really going to be focused more on broker to broker.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We're going to be do it kind of create an identity, stop calling it site B, which doesn't mean anything to anyone except for here in Alameda. Start branding and create an identity around an enterprise district. Start creating marketing materials, new collateral.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Getting the word out and really starting to kind of create an awareness and a buzz within the community, but not overly. I mean, we will take advantage, but we don't think that it's realistic that we're going to get any big users at this during this period.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The next phase is really tied to phase one infrastructure commencing using that groundbreaking as an opportunity to get the press out to Alameda, start to create additional buzz and excitement in the community about ground, actually be, you know, having some of these starting to get built and using that again to kind of expand, not just talking to'",
        "'speaker_8': 'brokers, but starting to really talk to end users, talking to larger developers, expanding, creating a newsletter, starting to do more marketing collateral. And then ultimately once you have at least a major phase of the phase one infrastructure for site A completed which you're looking at 18 to 48 months, then that's when you would really start to expect'",
        "'speaker_8': 'there. We'd be able to give a major user a lot of certainty about delivering land to them, and then they can start planning their vertical, the building of the buildings and their timeline, and we'd be able to provide them with much more certainty around those timelines.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'A lot of and we have our Cushman Wakefield folks here that can talk to you about this. But when we've had conversations, I have sat in on conversations with potential users out here that have asked us to look at land.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I've sat in on those conversations. And when you start telling them, Well, we've got to wait for the site infrastructure, which we think is going to be around this time frame, and then that will be this many months.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And, you know, but it hasn't happened yet. I mean, you can see, you know, even when we're trying to kind of sell it, that they're from their standpoint, they're having to build a campus, possibly foreclose a lease or their leases up somewhere else and then promise to their operations folks, they're going have a place for those folks'",
        "'speaker_8': 'to land and commit to that and have an operate, you know, a building that's allowing them to move people in and operate their business seamlessly. And when you start talking to them about some of the uncertainty on these timelines and not being able to guarantee or to kind of really put us in a position to provide that'",
        "'speaker_8': 'certainty to them or more certainty they just weren't interested. You know what we're interested in? We're look we'll look at your buildings. But right now we're monitoring the land. And until we know that there's a there's more of a timeline on that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I've seen that happen in a couple of situations. It doesn't mean we're not going to stop trying. I mean, we are going to continue to try it with that. But we think that we're going to have to be patient.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We're going to have to be able to provide them with more certainty to really be able to attract a catalytic user out here. Lastly, I just wanted to kind of make sure that you, the council and the community understands the city of Alameda staff.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We are not going anywhere. We're going to stay involved in all of this. We, Cushman Wakefield are taking direction from us. We'll be providing, as it says here, ongoing oversight of the effort will be participating in these key user and developer meetings, will be leading the transactional negotiations and then evaluating.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think very importantly, the progress. Is it working? Is it not working? Do we think we should change based on the market indications that we're getting and then coming to you and recommending any changes to that approach? Cushman Wakefield on their hand will be executing the marketing, the outreach strategy.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'They'll be the front line point of contact filtering, folks talking to people on the front lines, participating in the transactional negotiations, and then prior any input and recommendations to us. But ultimately we'll be the ones making those decisions and coming to you with our recommendation.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Lastly, I just wanted to say that this is just one jobs. You know, this is to try to look at attracting job, new development and jobs in the new development area. We are not going to stop leasing and you'll hear if we get to it, the leasing update from that point.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But we are we are going to continue to be leasing our buildings. And I think ultimately we'll be looking at some of our buildings that have been vacant for a long time. We've kind of exhausted a lot of the low hanging fruit, to be honest, in terms of those buildings are going to have to really start to'",
        "'speaker_8': 'be creative about trying to attract jobs. I was recently at a conference in San Francisco and got some we all kind of talked and got some ideas about how we might be able to looking at bachelor and listed quarters for jobs, some of those other buildings thinking about, you know, maybe bringing an architect in to look at'",
        "'speaker_8': 'the BQ to kind of could it be adapted for a tech user? Could there be some ideas that come out of that? So. Works we think we need. We can't just be doing this. We also have to be looking at some of those big vacant buildings in the adaptive reuse area and thinking about how we might change'",
        "'speaker_8': 'them and alter them to attract jobs. You've got Spirit's Alley there. You've got the existing ferry terminals. We think there's potential in both places, and we're going to do both at the same time. But we think it's important to move this along and start to implement a marketing strategy in this enterprise district area.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So that's that's it. And I'm happy to answer any questions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Or remember Daisuke.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. First off, let me make sure to say is that, you know, we appreciate all the work that you have done. It's important to say that because the last agenda item was a tough agenda item, but we nonetheless appreciate all the work that you Mesma Cano, the executive staff have done over the years.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So let's make sure to.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'These are tough issues.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, these are tough issues.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So the question that I have, I have two sets of questions. First of all, it has to do making sure that. People who we go through the quote unquote, end user strategy, pay their fair share of infrastructure related costs as well as and I think it's part of it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Their fair share of the sports complex and ferry terminal and I think this is important to raise, especially in light of the commitments that that we are looking at with regard to infrastructure and and sports complex, the commitments that site is making because the overall infrastructure cost for elevated point is $566 million or phase one, which included'",
        "'speaker_7': 'at the time site A and site B for phase one, the infrastructure cost was $183 million. So those infrastructure costs are predicated on some kind of land use and intensity of uses. So as we go forward with this kind of the virtual going forward with a developer was that they were committing to a land use and an'",
        "'speaker_7': 'intensity of land use. Now, we're not too sure. We're looking for people and they're going to kind of come on a haphazard basis and hopefully we get the best. So the question is, in this context, how are we going to make sure that whatever land use end user that we obtain is going to pay their fair share'",
        "'speaker_7': 'of infrastructure costs that are program for site B? Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Great. Now, that's that's good as a question that's near and dear to my heart and one that I've had with staff. I mean, it's absolutely I think what we are, you know, and I'll tell you a different thing.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'There's our policy approach, which is what we're we'll plan on. Tell telling anyone who comes in is that there is a essentially kind of a flaw, and that is the the infrastructure burden. So it's about $1,000,000 an acre of land.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And we expect to you know, I think I'm not going to say never because you never know if there's some amazing proposal. But I can't imagine I'm coming to you and recommending that you move forward with a project that's less than that unless we have a way of paying for the difference, you know, that we're clear on'",
        "'speaker_8': 'how that's going to get made up. But our intent is that that is essentially the burden that any develop, any development occurs in this enterprise district would have to pay. Now, that said, and just to make sure this isn't just me, you know, making sure this gets done, we've actually codified that in our ordinances and our development'",
        "'speaker_8': 'impact fee ordinance, which requires any development out here to pay a development impact fee that's essentially equivalent to that $1 million an acre. So if you know I'm not around and, you know, whatever this is happening, I mean, there's there is a kind of a failsafe kind of trigger that's in our code to ensure that that occurs'",
        "'speaker_8': '. Now, I will say, and I don't want to put this I don't think too many people are listening and in terms of our negotiation. But what you know, our hope is that we would get land value in addition to that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But if there's a user, we don't think the market or the financial, you know, it doesn't look like there is value beyond that $1 million for infrastructure. The benefit of being a public owner is that you can write down essentially the value of the land to the value of the infrastructure.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Mm hmm. I'm not suggesting that that's where we would start from a negotiating position, but you have that flexibility in the event that a really great user that we think is awesome, that can pay $1,000,000 an acre for land, but maybe not $1,000,000 an acre for land and $1,000,000 an acre for infrastructure.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'There's that flexibility and there are some policy considerations that the council could make. But those we would you know, we'd have to look on that at a case by case basis.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And let me make sure to underscore why I think the question of making sure that people pay their fair share of infrastructure costs is important because one of the end of the day selling features of the whole program that we started in the past two years for Alameda point the end of the.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'End of the road benefit was that there will be a sports complex and that there will be a regional water ferry that we were going to, you know, make some sacrifices with a site, a developer and even city developer.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But the sacrifices that we made on the land sale, you know, decisions that we come up with, we're going to be worth it because at the end of the day, we will have these these amenities. So that's why it's important that as we change our approach to site, be away from that developer driven thing it with which'",
        "'speaker_7': ', you know, all our expectations were kind of, you know, calculated with regard to at least site B's pro rata share of the regional complex and water as we change our approach to site B that we not lose and mind that that that that the big benefit that we are all looking for.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. The second question, so I appreciate the fact that you said it's codified. That was a keyword. Yep. Second question is site B is a pretty large area. So we are there ways that we can guard against cherry picking?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That is, people want to develop the site that's close to the water. But I mean, or is it just, you know, when we cast our net through the the this process that we're talking about? Well, that's just the nature of the beast.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yeah. No, I think it's a really good. And so I want to talk a second about cherry picking. And so I do there's a couple of thoughts I want to talk about with regard to cherry picking. Here's the site B or the enterprise area that we're calling.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We intentionally, as you can see, we left off the land here. I mean, this you know, arguably, this is waterfront land we could have thrown into the enterprise district. And it doesn't mean that if some great user came along and the council made a discretion, they couldn't include it.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But I will tell you, from a marketing standpoint, we are not marketing this land in part for the very reason that you're saying, which is we don't want someone to come in, especially earlier on when we're creating catalist and cherry pick our waterfront land.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We would like to benefit from the value that this development which you know, when it gets started, we hope soon that we then benefit from this and deci and then try to really capture value and infrastructure dollars through the sale of this land at a future point once you've gotten things developed here.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I think that's an important point, is that we could have thrown the entire enterprise district in there, but we were selective about that for the very reason to kind of protect against the cherry picking some of that waterfront land.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That said, we did include some because we think that is one of the attractions of the site is to try to be near the water, near the ferry. So to have that as an option also is to create, you know, have some land that's in the waterfront area.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We did want to include some of that. So I wanted you to kind of think about I do also think that the logical place is when we sit down with the civil engineers and and with Cushman Wakefield is to actually start from an arc closer to Main Street, because that's where the existing infrastructure is.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And you're going to be able to facilitate development upfront a little more efficiently by starting there and moving over. And the development requirements in the town center plan are a little more intense because of the type of environment we want to create near the ferry terminal things.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I think you're actually going to see and I mean, you can't predict. I mean, someone could come in, but I think we're we're anticipating we're actually going to start closer to Main Street and then move over because of the infrastructure.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And then I'm looking at my notes here and out of my phone. I had some notes on that, I promise. And then I think the last thing is, is that ultimately the council decides. I mean, the ultimate you know, the city council decides whether or not this is a good deal or not.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And we're and we're not going to you know, we're not going to create a development that essentially renders another part of a block unusable. I mean, we're going to have our engineers and our planners ever look at it and say, you know, this is a usable area, that that leaves the remainder that we can still use.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We're not going to start to strand pieces inside that we can't then use. So we'll be very careful about that. And ultimately, the city council is the final arbiter as to whether or not we did a good job doing that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But we're going to go around the and vice mayor.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I find the slides actually quite succinct in describing what the approach is going to be. And I think that's really important to make sure that. We have a document and I, I would like to adopt this approach, but I'd like to have a term just like we have a develop a terminal development agreement.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'd like to have it have formalized description of what the responsibilities are of of our city department as well as our contractor, Cushman Wakefield. I'd like it to have the goals stated even though their stated elsewhere. I think you mentioned jobs.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You mentioned the preference for a catalyst occupant and the end user occupant and that everybody who buys into this area is going to pay their fair share of infrastructure burden. That that's our goal out of here. And you mentioned the six months of reporting.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'd like that to be memorialized in a in in in this in this plan that you've just described. And we can go back and measure progress against those goals. We can also see that if we need to make an adjustment.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And where that adjustment might be, especially if we're taking it to the site. And I, I think we should also tie it to the wider. A project because that's really going to be the first one out the gate and they're going to provide infrastructure that runs right across site B, they're going to open the ground up to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'put a water main and. I'd like to see a little more meat on how these efforts, whether they're short term leases or whether there's other action that occurs in this zone on taking advantage of the ground being open and that engineering being done to put that water main in that could raise the value of this land.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'd like to see what kind of latitude we have and in our lease revenues to do that as part of this the strategy and. Finally, I think it helps when we have things codified or otherwise described in zoning that we still mention in this plan and point to those documents.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Because sometimes it's difficult if you don't have the institutional knowledge to remember, yes, it was part of this ordinance or yes, it was part of this decision on zoning. So I'd like to have those pretty much, which is spelled out in here, formalized in our own development agreement, because the city is going to be acting as the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'developer. Mm hmm. And on this, if I if I understand.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It, always a little nervous about calling us a developer, but.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Not.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Intentionally. Functionally, that's what's.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Creating a document. And I think.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think that's really important for the public to have. It's really important for us to have something other than a PowerPoint slides is as well-organized as it was. It doesn't carry the same weight to me is a milestone document.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Right. I think that would I think if this is what you're asking, I think taking the essentially the concepts that are in the PowerPoint that you just mentioned and putting it in a written document official, I mean, it may only be, you know, 3 to 5 pages or something, but that kind of walks through these points and'",
        "'speaker_8': 'codifies, you know, puts them in a plan that we can upload to the website that people can see. This is our approach, this is what we're doing. And this is I think that we can absolutely do that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I'd like it to be approved by the council so that future councils can measure and adjust. And also it's a conscious decision to do to adjust. To terminate or to expand.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is that the end of your column?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Oh, that's. Yes, that's.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It. All right.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I remember.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I don't have too much more to add that my colleagues haven't already stated. You know, the concern about the share of fair share of the infrastructure costs. I have that, too. You know, you look at it and if we if we went with one of our finalist from last time or we went out to do an RFP'",
        "'speaker_9': 'again, you know, then they would effectively take the land, land, make it themselves. And, you know, it could be eight or ten years and they get it for the price it is now. And now if we do it ourselves and we landbank it, you know, that we can take advantage of, you know, as the value goes up'",
        "'speaker_9': ', when site air goes in and the we determine what goes in and some of that infrastructure is put in. And, you know, I think that's a smart move for us to be the land bank or as opposed to, you know, somebody else.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So, you know, I'm prepared to support it and echo the comments that have already been said.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Member Ashcroft.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Here. I met Councilmember Desai. I spoke again. Those are.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'My questions.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Right from the beginning. So I want to thank Mr. because this was actually on the agenda last time, and I sent her a long email before that meeting with lots of questions. And you did a masterful job, as always, of incorporating the answers.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I don't have to ask them. And I would just say that, yes, you convinced me that this is the approach because, you know, I had some some questions and I great presentation. I think the vice mayor makes a good suggestion that if you could turn it all into a document, that the council could say, you know'",
        "'speaker_6': ', yes, we approve of this. And then it, as was also noted, it has the advantage of being that roadmap for the future. So we can because, you know, we're doing that now. We're referencing back to plans that were made.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And it will it will help whoever is out there in the future doing this. So and good good work. Staff, all of you who worked on this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right, so my questions go to Cushman Wakefield.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This there's a conclusion that this is cost efficient, but I didn't see the numbers of how much Cushman Wakefield has been paid on any project or overall or anything about the contract we have with them that's not attached here.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think that that's critical information if they're going to be a key part of the strategy. I think that we should actually put it out and see if my understanding well, before I go there, in your paragraph, you have said that they were involved in the VF outdoor campus.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I thought Joe Ernst was part of that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Mm hmm. So they, in that particular case, before they were working for us, had we're working worked for Joe as their broker and helping Joe attract the outdoor so they have clients all over. And then we did an RFP, we did a request for proposals for leasing agents and property managers two years ago.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Mm hmm. And that and we, the city council at that time selected Cushman Wakefield and PPM Realty to be our exclusive essentially broker at Alameda Point, which includes. So that is a contract that we have executed with the city already.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That includes land sales at 5% commission.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. So I think a report like this needs to include how much money? Cushman And like what the contract, first of all, what projects they've been involved in and how much they've been paid. Because I don't think the statement can be made that it's cost efficient without numbers.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I don't know how much the city is paying Cushman Wakefield or what they've paid for two years. Do you know how much the city has paid Cushman Wakefield The last two years?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We can ask them to provide that, but the next report actually does document all the leases that they have been involved in since they came on and since that RFP.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And the costs that they've been paid.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So you can.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'As that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'In may be able to estimate. John McManus of Cushman Wakefield.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And first, this is John McManus with Cushman Wakefield. First, can I correct just one comment? We represented B.F. Outdoor on a contract. We did not have the listing on the land that at the time Lehman Brothers and Mr. Ernst controlled through a partnership.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We we represented B after that transaction. Just for clarity, I know that's important to make clear to everyone. We have a contract that was negotiated with the city attorney's office after we were engaged by the council. It goes back almost two years ago now.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I believe it runs through 2018. I can't tell you what month of 2018, but it runs out. The city does have some provisions if they're not happy with our performance, to come back to us and we can look at those.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But it calls for there's a lease schedule that is 5% of the value of the lease for years, 1 to 5 and two and a half percent of years, 6 to 10 tonight. Mattson, for example, was represented by Sorry It's Getting Late by Transwestern group based in Walnut Creek.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so half of those fees would be paid to them and half would be paid to Cushman Wakefield. So what we would need to do is take your totals and then break out what we've paid to other firms.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That will be the case in virtually every transaction we do. There's going to be an outside broker. There's not an outside broker. Those fees are reduced per contract with the city. On sales, the number is 5% of the value of the transaction.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Again, those numbers, those those fees are split if it's an option to purchase. And let's say that the the the commission on the sale is $10 and you've paid us $6, then we would only be able to charge you the $4 remaining, the net amount that was left and all that spelled out in the contract.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And certainly it's in the files.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so so I appreciate that it doesn't really so so what I'm looking for, I think the contract needed to be included I think the dollars so for and I appreciate you just brought up Mattson because I didn't know that you were getting paid for mats and mats and has been an existing customer here.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So you didn't. Go find them. They re actually, I think staff help move them. And yet Cushman Wakefield is getting paid. Do they get paid the same amount, the same percentage, whether or not they find the tenant?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes, they do.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The schedule that I quoted to you, is it 50% if it's a renewal? So if it's a tenant that stays in the same building, then the fee is half of what it would be if the tenant comes in and relocates or comes.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Back as a new.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Lease. But Madson has a new lease.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So they will be they'll be getting their full commission. They'll share it with the other broker. And that's the standard industrial industry practice for for this type of thing. And so there was a lot of time that they spend actually touring mats and working with mats and they actually assist in the lease negotiations.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'They actually do quite a bit of work with the tenants. We don't do that work. They do all the frontline work in terms of touring them, talking to them, looking at the buildings, going through the numbers, making making recommendations to staff about, you know, the term and whether or not they think the amount of investment is consistent'",
        "'speaker_8': 'with the term. All of those things they look at.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. So what incentive do they have to find us new tenants? Because when I look at the stuff that comes to us, it's an existing or it's Joe Ernst bringing companies to us. And I think we need. I think we need.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So can you tell me what tenants Cushman Wakefield has brought us separate from George and separate from existing tenants?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Right. Speed would be an example. I don't know what I can say about things that are in process that aren't on the agenda.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Probably nothing in the last two years, right?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Speed in the last two years. Right, speed, help me out here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Building 40.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah, yeah. Winery 43. Fred Grandy. Now, Brooks was was PM before we got here. You're right. Universal Studios. Restoration Hardware.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Can you tell me about Universal Studios? What is that?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That was the Steve Jobs movie that got filmed out in Building 530.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. So that's of.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That was I guess we can say it now. It's released. When they were in there, we were.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Actually in our next item on the agenda, the staff report list that. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But it doesn't specify which ones they bring and which ones are just leases. And that's so in regards to that, working with Cushman Wakefield, I think their needs for me, I would like to have seen more information and I am not comfortable agreeing to continue using them because I think we do need to be attracting.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I love that Joe Ernst seems to be a lead developer for our community right now. However, I think it'd be nice to reach beyond him and I would like us to. I'd either like more information in regards to this, or I would actually think that I'm comfortable proceeding thinking this is a big project.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's a lot of money that goes to this company and we need to make sure we're being broadcast and advertise wider than existing customers. And Joe and George and I appreciate that there's apparently maybe three or four in the last two years that are from outside.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Right. And I guess just to say, I mean, we did we agreed with you that when we were trying to decide what to do with the base, there was a decision to kind of we were working with PPM Realty to open it up, take a look.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We didn't do that. We'd cast a wide net. We had some finalists. Ultimately we decide and the council decided that Cushman Wakefield in their expertize and I'd be happy to have Jon talk to you a little bit about some of the other deals and things that they've done in the Bay Area.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But when we evaluated them at that time, we felt like they were highly qualified. You know, Jon, it's not just about attracting tenants, but it's about working with them, getting the leases done, you know, selling, you know, when you're trying to work through some of these deal issues and trying to help them understand the issues that I'm'",
        "'speaker_8': 'going to point presents, I will tell you that, you know, all the people I work with, John McMann, is one of the people who is raising issues that we've we've now sorted out so that we can market the land and understand the complexities out there, very smart and intelligent and comes, you know, rolls up their sleeves and'",
        "'speaker_8': 'problem solvers. And honestly and I'll make the point that, you know, that goes a long way in having someone do that. But I'm happy to maybe he could talk a little bit about what other deals and things he's done in the Bay Area.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So let me was there an RFP? Yeah. Choosing them back then, two years ago. Okay. So then I was not part of the council. I appreciate that. Some of you were. I was not. And I would appreciate having the background information of how they were selected and and ideal and also what tenants they have brought.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Because I really do think we need to be casting a wider net than what's happening right now and and how much money they're being paid.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I think it's a fair comment that I kind of made some assumptions about the relationship we have with Cushman Wakefield, that people kind of understood that. And I could've done a better job at explaining the background on why we why we've been using them for, you know, and the back story on that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So, so my concern with this plan is that I don't feel like this from my position that there's been sufficient due diligence in committing to using Cushman Wakefield for this big part of site B.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So given that it's going on midnight and we still have one more agenda item I hope we'll get to, I am prepared to make a motion to proceed with the new development strategy for the Enterprise District, formerly known as Site B at Alameda Point, and following the the specifications that were set forth by the vice mayor, because'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think he articulated them very well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Oh.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You can go.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'll second that with a comment. You know, I appreciate the, you know, bringing rights for Alameda as a home run. I mean, it's nice to hear about, you know, Steve Jobs and all that kind of stuff. I mean, whatever.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But that's a home run. And, you know, that's a company that's going to be a leading edge company that hopefully will grow. And it's along that alley where Joe Ernst is doing so. So I'm confident tonight for the same reason I was confident two years ago.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You know, when you know, when I heard about the things that you had done at Alameda Point and for Alameda. So I'm comfortable with moving forward.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Oh, Vice Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think one of the things that I alluded to was a measurement measurement of progress toward the goals. And I think that's where some of the questions that the mayor asks can be answered. And if we start with the responsibilities with the staff and with Cushman Wakefield and then the measurements, what are the key metrics that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'go with those responsibilities versus the goals? Whether it's the a number of of new ten new inquiries that are brought in, the number of new commitments, whatever those might be, those can be measured and reported. And I think.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'When you what I'd like to see in this plan that's it's formalized and we get another shot at some of those details that allow us to basically judge performance of ourselves and judge performance of our contractor.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And you seconded, right? Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And without more information from about Cushman Wakefield, I can't support moving forward with them at this time. All those in favor. I am opposed for the reasons stated. Thank you. So. Four in favor, one opposed. And six h.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Report on leasing an Alameda point. Oops.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'One again.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes. Hello again.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'To.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That. Good evening, mayor and city council members. I'm Annette McCollum. This leasing report actually the that the impetus for it was just to kind of do a check in with you guys about where we've been, where we how where we've been and where we are now.'"
