        "'speaker_3': 'Audrey Lord Houseman, who had done it for the prior eight years. And it was just sort of getting into a well-maintained vehicle that was just doing extraordinary things.

        "'speaker_0': 'And it is amazing because that is actually how we unite all of our nonprofits and social service organizations from the school district, the county, because we have a supervisor here and then the city. And that's how when we're all talking and meeting once a month that we can make it work, we really connect through that meeting.'",

    "Consider Directing the City Manager to Initiate and Begin the Process with the Planning Board to Propose Revisions to the Ordinance and Code Sections Defining Alamedas Inclusionary Housing for Residential Development.  (Vice Mayor Matarrese) [Not heard on June 21, July 5 or 19, September 6 or 20, or October 4 or 18, 2016]": [
        "'speaker_0': 'All right, then our next item is h r a communications, not a agenda. Public comment. Do you have any more? All right, then we move on to council referrals. And it's my understanding the city manager has yet to speak first on this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And what I wanted.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'To do is these referrals have been on your agenda for five months, which is repetitive, and there are a lot of people that are interested in having some of the referrals going forward. Some of the plans and projects that initiated the referrals are actually going through a concurrent process with the planning board.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So what I wanted to do was to I reordered them generally larger to smaller, more specific. Planning first and then the newer, bigger questions. And I just wanted to share with the public and the council what the staff plans are.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then maybe we can go through and talk about each one and get a vote from the council of whether to have this project go forward and whether the staff's interpretation of each of these referrals is correct or not.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So with the. Approval of the council. We can do that. That is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You guys are good with that. Good.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So please proceed.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So. I thought we'd.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'First talk very briefly about.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Nine B, which.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Is a priority setting work session. And the idea behind that is let's look at all the referrals. And it's also an opportunity for the council to say. I haven't put in a referral for this, but this is my goal for the next year.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so let's step back, have a meeting open to the public. Let's prioritize what are our jobs, you know, what our projects are, are there any new initiatives? And let's also look at what's also on the plate, because staff is really working hard and really has a lot on their plates already.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And we want to both respect the referrals and the new initiatives, but also do what we have to do because it's staff required. So that is scheduled for early 2017. As soon as we get the start of the new year, this should probably be an annual thing for the council.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The second is defining Alameda as inclusionary housing development. And this actually. Is what we talked about a lot today. It covers all sorts of things. It covers the number, the percentage of affordable housing versus market rate housing. It covers workforce housing, the housing that is not restricted, but by design, smaller and more affordable to the vast majority'",
        "'speaker_5': 'of the community. And then it also covers work, live housing. So those are the three things that we have heard repeatedly from the Council of let's step back and look at housing from the broad picture. What we are planning to do is to have have it start out with a council workshop.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But before we do that, we have two things in the pipeline that we need council approval for. First, to get that off our plate. And one is universal design that will be coming to the council and probably at the beginning of the year.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then also a definition amendment to senior assisted living ordinance. So what is senior assisted living? The regulations have changed or the interpretation of what assisted living has changed and our zoning ordinance needs to be modernized like are you a me?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So anyway, that is and then the next question is where should that senior housing be? Is it in only commercial or is it in residential? So that is probably a very extensive the whole housing inclusionary housing discussion is probably a very extensive, almost a year long effort for staff going through the process.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But it would start at council to get direction and policy direction. And as soon as we get the universal design so it's up to the council, as soon as we get that adopted, the next thing we'd be working on at a staff level is this zoning change.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The next two items.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Are.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We put together because we think we can address this? The first one is let's look at the land use retail, commercial, residential next on Alameda Land in the Catullus project. And let's also look at mixed use zoning or beneficial commercial uses.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And we started looking at and we had a study session and. Three months ago about the northern waterfront it was and Snell and Alameda landing and we got through 98% of that conversation and then the meeting ended and we couldn't finish the whole process.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And the direction those two projects are moving forward at the going through have been submitted, are going through the planning board, etc.. So what we wanted to do was come back in January of 2017, two months from now, and do a council study session on the northern waterfront.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And it would include the Alameda landing as well as Alameda Marina and Snell. And that way, instead of looking at. Just one specific project. Let's look at it globally. Is there housing that's appropriate in one area? And we look at the total number of all three of those projects together.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Where should we put maritime uses? Where should we put residential? How do we look at those at a project specific but all together, those three projects together.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You clarifies a study session, a separate meeting from a regularly scheduled council meeting.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We were talking about having it be a regularly scheduled meeting, but that is something that we can definitely talk about. It's a good idea to just focus on it because last time it took the whole meeting. So maybe it's a good idea to have a special meeting just on it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Member. Brody.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I just have a question on two of those projects I think have pending applications. I mean, to what extent can we. To what extent can we weigh in on something that's in the process? So I mean, if we're doing it on.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The concept in general and where it's applied to, you know, places where there's no zoning application or no project application. And I think that's a great idea, but I just worry about doing that on two projects where there's pending applications.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So on that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Right. Well, actually, all three of those have pending applications.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I think the Northern Waterfront referral was more broader than just. And I'll turn those now. You know, Arena, if I remember correctly, it kind of included that it was all encompassing and and included a third a third site.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. And there's also like a more global discussion about zoning, right, citywide. And I see that as a let's do specific and then a bigger picture of zoning citywide for the next zoning measure.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Let me finish up and then.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I guess I'm just I just want to be careful that we don't. Put ourselves in any legal risk by kind of modifying or saying we want to modify plans that are already in place. The idea of having a general.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Discussion on M zoning and the future of it in some places where we don't have applications. I mean, I think that's a great idea, but I'm just worried about our legal liability.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And it's actually I mean, both are allowed in the zoning and it's a question of amounts on each one. And it's a the council has the discretion, as does the planning board, to say, we want X number of residential here and X number of square feet of maritime use all within the same zoning district.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so we're not specifically as we were talking about the study session, we're not specifically saying we are going to change the rules of what the zoning is and we're going to change the zoning. We're not talking about it that way.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We're talking about everything altogether. There's a mixed use. How are we going to slice up that mix?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I swear.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think Ms.. Come back said what I was going to say. So I don't think you remember Ashcroft.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think maybe, Tony, number de facto.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Since my my referral is nine days.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Oh.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'See, I kind of think that the question I'm trying to pose and have a discussion around is a little more even more simple than, you know, zoning and intensity of uses, distribution of different types of uses across the north.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's more simple in that it's basically. Are we going to affirm the vision that we have in place through contract with with Qatar where the final phase or not.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I think that the question that I have for the council is, do you want to have. Two separate study sessions on this? Or do you want to look at them altogether?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'd actually like some legal input in regards to member Otis comments. I think we have to be very cautious if we're looking at this specific development and I would not plan on giving input prematurely and then being allowed to touch the issue.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But just to before a response is given, I want to go back to my council referral, which doesn't talk about those specific projects. It talks about the zoning and to to initiate a revision of the mixed zoning designation.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And related implementation policies so that we can take into account definition of mixed use and provide sufficient guidance to new development in areas previously zoned or are used exclusively for commercial purposes and also take into accommodating adjacent tidelands and shoreline uses establish portions of commercial use to residential use for retaining and increasing jobs in areas zoned for'",
        "'speaker_6': 'mixed use. Those are very generic. I mean, they may be applicable and provide some developer some insight into where the council's going. But this is is this is to revise our is our mixed use zoning code and the attendant implement implementation policies.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'To make sure we don't end up with where we had commercial before a residential development with a Starbucks as the commercial component of that. You know, and that's the intent. And it's not to shape to to interfere with an existing application, but it's to make sure that we get a proper mix.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Um, member. ASHCROFT Well, it seems to me I could make the argument for Ben holding a workshop, a study session on all three of these. But I think that might tend to be a meteor, a set of topics than we could reasonably handle in a session.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I would be okay with dividing them. One of the things, though, that I would like to be a topic of discussion, though, it's it's all well and good to say, oh, I want, you know, this use here and I want so much commercial and maritime commercial and that's all well and good.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I think we need to look at the ways then that we do things like pay for the aging maritime infrastructure, because that is part of what development is doing. And I'm certainly not adverse to saying, well, you know, maybe the existing businesses out there have to chip in their fair share.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I mean, maybe that's something to be looked at, but it's it's not that we're just playing Monopoly and putting, you know, different uses on different lots. It's there is an objective that is trying to be met. I mean, when but I think it's it's definitely a discussion worth having, but I just don't want it to be in'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the abstract. I want it to to be, you know, have practical value of what we could really use as a road map for going forward. So when I hear that, I actually am thinking maybe we do need flexibility.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'On the terms of her project. So when it comes to us that we can take into consideration things like that as opposed to being held to defined percentages. But all we're deciding now is do we want to do that as one big workshop with those three topics, or is that too much?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But then Brody, I mean.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But if you think about. If you add up all the numbers and you kind of want to look at the housing element and what we're meeting and what these projects may or may not do. And then what is that?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, do we want to shuffle some other things around because of the Project X and Project Y on some other and some other property? I mean, it might make sense to kind of.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Get the big.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Picture.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They could go both ways.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Have a good attorney, Madam Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm the vice.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Mayor. I prefer to have not to try and blend nine C and nine together in the same workshop. I think nine Sears is project specific and I think it's worthy of a workshop by itself. And nine E is a is a policy question is what kind of guidelines?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Because I already heard that there's a whole there's a want a desire for flexibility, but I don't want to Starbucks as the commercial aspect of my flexibility, you know. You know, I want I want something that really addresses preserving jobs and preserving existing commercial.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I think that's that should be either in its own workshop or with another policy policy point on on land use, which could be the assisted living one. So just to break them up. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so what I'm hearing and this is a question is that we do the Alameda landing as a stand alone study session and that we do nine e as a broader zoning ordinance discussion, zoning amendment and Alameda Marina and and Snell will continue to go through their process with the planning board because they did get direction from'",
        "'speaker_5': 'the council that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The Council looks like a good majority of heads nodding yes, yes. So it makes sense. And I think that addresses Councilmember Otis concern about we don't like to appear to be interfering as a council with a project that is already making its way down the approval process.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And the mayor's concern that it should be all of our concern.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, it is member data. And just to be.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Clear, in raising 9-3 regarding having a workshop on the final phase of at the Alameda Landing Project, I didn't raise that in a vacuum. I think there are certain there's a certain case that I that I think that I think needs to be raised and for the public to discuss, agree or disagree.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I think those are matters that probably are best treated, independent from, you know, these broader policy questions that that might be embedded in. 9-8 Councilmember Matt Arrestees So, so yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So okay the clerk was just speaking with me. We're approaching 1030. She's thinking that we do not need to do a motion to take any new agenda items because we're actually have collectively decided already that we're going to be addressing all of these.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Referrals at this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Point, and then we'll do a vote come 11:00 to see if we want to continue.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Agreeable to that and.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Just go.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So then and in regards to and I also want to let.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Council know.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This is brought to my attention. We have three speakers on referrals nine. Nine and one on nine. A one on nine and one on nine G.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So why don't I quickly go through the next three? Okay. So nine D is to have a Trump Social Service Human Relations Board look at a policy for aiding Alameda homeless and we are shrub and city staff have hired operation dignity to talk to all of our homeless.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Find out what their needs are. And the plan is to come back in December with a contract for council consideration to do the plan for Jane Sweeny Park and look at it citywide. That is the start of a policy because it has started a this whole issue has started a very good conversation both at a staff level'",
        "'speaker_5': 'with the fire department and the police department and the community and the neighborhood. And so that's the plan. And maybe we can tie in when we come in December, sort of what the big picture plan is and then get council direction at that time for the policy.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And if I could just Ashcraft, I really do want to give a shout out to staff who put together a workshop. It was about a month ago, I want to say, at Mastic Senior Center, and we had representatives from Operation Dignity and the police department, and we had some people who were residents of some of those encampments'",
        "'speaker_0': '. We had a young woman whose mother lives out there, and we had a lot of concern neighbors. But I was it was one of the more impressive workshops that I've seen in this city. And really a lot of sharing of different views was done.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I'm very supportive of moving forward with Operation Dignity, so I look forward to you bringing that back to us next. Next month, December, we're going to be speaking about it right now. She's just going over. Yeah, I know.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I just wanted to I just wanted to give a shout out.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then the last two are, well, one was July and one is new, this meeting. But enacting the minimum wage increase. So the state of California has a minimum wage increase for $15 by year 2022. It ramps up every year.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And this is not on our work plan right now, but if some cities are looking at accelerating that ramp up, and so that would be whether the council wants us to consider that or not. And then the final one is looking at regulations for taxation of commercial cannabis activities, cultivation, dispensaries, etc..'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The. Extent of this will depend a little bit or quite a lot on the election results next week.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right. So now, um. Yes. Member of Parliament. Right. But because. So what I would like to see done is deferring some of these items to a priority, scheduling priority, setting work session. And I have to say that one of my first meetings with Ms. came back when she became our city manager was to say, I really think'",
        "'speaker_0': 'we should do a priority setting works workshop. And it's something she's done when she was a city manager in another city before this, and she said, Could we put that off until after the first of the year? And I said, Oh, okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And you know, this is my referral right after I had.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Done it when.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'She first came. But I agree. I think it's a good thing to do. But some of these things, like enacting the minimum wage increase and like the cannabis regulation and I've got a few of my own actually that I'd like to have.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Let's, let's just I would like to support doing a priority setting workshop shortly after the first of the year and enveloping some of those. Okay. So at this point, I think it's appropriate for us to have these speakers we have.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Seven referrals. I think it's appropriate for us to vote on whether or not we want to proceed with them just like we normally would. First, listen to our speakers and then run through those real quick and give direction on each one.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So, Dorothy Freeman, you want to speak on nine a. And then you also want to speak on nine E. So she would have 3 minutes on each and then Alex.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They allow.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But beyond nine G the Dorothy, if you could come on up. And you get 3 minutes on nine and then 3 minutes on nine E. And then you get 3 minutes on nine G and then we'll be done with our public speakers.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Good evening again. I Dorothy Freeman and I'm speaking this is for nine A and nine C. Good evening again. At this time, account of all the approved and possible housing developments in Alameda is greater than 4000 units. Alameda has a few thousand more market rate units on the horizon than we will need for a long time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Continuing to build houses for people who do not live.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Here is not fair to the residents we already have.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'New residents do add to Alameda, but they will not help present Alameda Suave our Alameda and sweep our lack of housing. We all agree we have.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'A housing problem. What should happen is our middle.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Income.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Workers move up to nicer homes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Making their present homes available for the next group and so on. To do this, we need to have new workforce homes that the average Alameda wage earner can move up into. We want these families to stay in Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That will not happen with the very expensive market rate homes being planned right now. Homes with large mortgages, high taxes and high.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Insurance costs.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Make it only unlikely for our middle income workers to be able to purchase them. We need developers who are interested in helping us build the workforce housing we need. If they aren't interested, then we need to find a new set of developers.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Alameda is a prime place for development. We should be riding the development narrative, not the developers. We have enough housing in the approved category right now to satisfy our market rate requirements. We can afford to wait a few more years to find developers who are willing to work.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'With us and send out terminals.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And Alameda Marina need to be put on the back burner because their plans are for over a thousand market rate homes that are not the answer to our present housing problem. Alameda Landing should be told to work with the approved.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Plants.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And forget about housing we don't need. If we keep building housing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'On our building, on our.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Business land, we will never be able to bring the jobs here that we say we need. We should be approving plans that benefit Alameda and not the developers. At a previous council meeting, I was shocked when the speakers who spoke of development only referred to that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Two developments on the West End at Alameda Point. This tells me people do not understand that pending.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Developments on the northern waterfront where the number of possible units.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Will be greater.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Than the number of those planned in Alameda point. Excuse me.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'These developments that are just coming to the planning board should be required to provide workforce housing. Let's put Alameda first. Thank you. Thank you. So that's your comments for both nine, eight and nine E, correct? I see. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Oh. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So you. You have a difference. So then you go ahead. Go ahead. And you can. You're nine G.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Honorable Mayor and honorable members of the Almeida City Council. My name is Alex Seville. Speaking in relation to nine G, I'm not sure if this is true, but everybody hear me. Great. Thank you. I'm a regulatory analyst at a law firm in Oakland where I've worked for some time on canvas policy.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I have a number of other roles, including being the chair of the Local Policy Committee of the National Cannabis Bar Association, which is a national trade association of attorneys who practice in particular in cannabis law specifically. And I'm here to speak to you in relation to item nine to encourage you to at least explore the opportunities and'",
        "'speaker_6': 'options afforded to you by two pieces of law, really. First, the Medical Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act, which was passed by the Legislature and adopted by governor, signed by Governor Brown last year, as well as the vote, of course, on Prop 64, which the voters will be considering with, you know, within the next week, really just, you'",
        "'speaker_6': 'know, this day, next week. In particular, I just wanted to speak to understand this. This body moved in the wake of the adoption of the Medical Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act to preserve local control. Understandably, in light of provisions included therein which are presented the possibility of a preemption of state law and local regulations by state law'",
        "'speaker_6': '. The legislature moved to exclude those state preemption actions in that law with AB 21, and there was no possibility then that there would be authorization of activity without local approval. The Adult Use of Marijuana Act Prop 64 similarly protects local local control and says that businesses will only be authorized pursuant to local authorization.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so I think that affords an opportunity with that eye towards local control, really. There's 17 different types of licenses that span the entire supply chain involved in the provision of medical cannabis and potentially adult use cannabis. So we're talking not only, you know, the retail dispensing of the product, which people are familiar with, but also the'",
        "'speaker_6': ', you know, production, the manufacturing of specific products, the laboratory testing of said products and the distribution therein. And really the state legislation just as a menu of options afforded to localities. You know, there are 482 cities, 58 counties across this state.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'All of them are really given the leeway to adopt the policies that permit the activity that fit the character of their communities. And so I think that would be prudent in light of this local control afforded to this body, to at least contemplate some of the possibilities that might be appropriate for this community.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You know, certainly there are certain elements that certain communities decide are not appropriate, and that would certainly be at the discretion of this body. You know, I think that the sort of experience that California has had over the last 20 years, since the passage of Prop 215, which allowed medical cannabis use in some instances is not really'",
        "'speaker_6': 'prescriptive of what will happen going forward into this new regulatory environment. So I encourage you at the job start at $20 an hour and many of these sectors, it's a well-compensated sector and I encourage you to at least contemplate the possibility of benefit towards your community.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. All right. Dorothy Freeman. And now you're speaking on nine c.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'E.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Nine nine, eight, nine. Okay. Right. Thank you. Good evening again. Okay. In 1978, I moved to Livermore, which is about the same size as Alameda. At that time, Pleasanton, Dublin and San Ramon were just tiny ideas of the cities they would become.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Livermore was the hub of the tri valley area. There was a hospital in Alameda County courthouse and the Department of Motor Vehicles. The city council decided Livermore didn't need any growth, not even the existing businesses. For many years there was no tax base to fund the city as Livermore stagnated.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If I wanted to buy anything for my home, I had to travel to Walnut Creek or Oakland. For about 20 years, the other towns who were willing to.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Support growth grew.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But Livermore remained stagnant. Businesses that had been there relocated, as did the hospital, the DMV and the Alameda County courthouse. And no new businesses arrived. This was a result of a city government that did not do all it could to protect the existing businesses it had.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So other cities benefited from Livermore shortsightedness. Here in Alameda, we always hear about needing to recruit new businesses. But what we continue to build are retail type shops that will not support the tax base. We need to support our city and many of our existing businesses, old and new, are going out of business.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'While it's true, we need to recruit new businesses. We have a lot of businesses right here in town that need our support. One of them is the Alan is Alamitos Heritage Business, the Alameda Marina. Alameda owes its large marine atmosphere to the Alameda Marina and the boating services.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It provides. Several of the properties that were re zoned in 2001 for the housing element were not vacant or underutilized as State stated they were and are business area supporting jobs. Alameda needs to send a message to the existing business community that they are important and pledging that the city will step up to help them stay in'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Alameda and prosper here. The approximately 84 businesses and 250 or more good middle class jobs located at the Alameda Marina do not believe support for them is happening at this point. What is it going to say to new businesses?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We are trying to encourage to come here if we don't support the businesses we already have in coming years. Alameda well. Alameda be willing to throw them away also, especially as a bag and the MTA plan to bury us under an additional 7000 units above the 4000 plus in the plans.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Now, will we be willing to replace our South Shore shopping center and the existing existing jobs there as a big plans, alameda has stepped up to help our tenants. Now it's time to step up and show our business community that they are important to our city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Needs these existing businesses also. Thank you. Thank you. All right. So now should we go down the referrals starting at 9 a.m. and get.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Council's input on.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Proceeding with them and then we can plug them into somebody down to sort of nine?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm in need of motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'A motion to four.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I just want to make sure that that's the way we're going to go through these now. Going to do that? Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I move that. We follow the direction of the referral and follow staff's note to be scheduled in early 2017.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There are second.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Also, I'll second that we have a little discussion time on that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. And then discussion life.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So memorable. Did you want.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To do your discussion right now? Yes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. So this is the one that we want to talk about. Workforce or moderate income? Housing. I mean.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think we're live also right.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To bed to where Jen left. But, you know, the reality of it is, what was the number that was brought out? A family of four or 100,000? 112. So you think about it. They're not going to be able to afford even the lowest.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Unit over at Alameda Landing. Like 900 $1,000,000. So, you know, we got to think about what we're going to do for people making this amount of money because they're not able to do that, because to get 25% down payment, where are they going to get $250,000?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And a family of four probably has two kids, maybe three if it's a single parent. And for rent, 33% of their income is $3,000. So you're not going to be able to find a lot of rental units either.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I think this is something critical and I think the vice mayor for bringing it up because we really need to talk about this. We need to get real when it comes to providing housing options for all levels of affordability, not just the higher end.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I'm happy to second this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So there's a motion, a second member, Ashcroft. Okay. I am confused. We talking about setting a priority. No, No. Nine.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we're looking at in the order that they were submitted. And then that will be how we address the workshop.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So did we skip over the Priority City workshop? Yes, because it's it came. I want them in the order of how they were submitted and as we may very well run out of time. So at this point, nine came first.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we have a motion in a second. Did you want to make any comments in regards to that? I think. I would love to see none of this is going to take place before the first of the year, is it?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So I would love to see that a priority setting workshop actually triage these items in 90 may well be at the top. But I just so tomorrow we're just voting because for referrals we have to have council's consent to move forward with it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So that's separate from how we're going to address them. So I appreciate in regards to the city manager's proposal, but we have not. So right now we just need to quickly go through these and then we could in fact address them as she's proposing that I'm calling them in the order of how they were submitted.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So right now we're discussing nine whether or not we want to have that heard as a referral, as a referral. So we have to vote to approve whether or not we want to have a heard staff come back to the problem.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I guess I do understand what you're saying. The problem I see with that is that. I think this may well be one that needs to have its own meeting and that we could do some planning around that at a priority setting workshop and.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So right now, though, in garden. So we have emotion. And this is something you had in mind, Madam City Manager.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So you're saying that the inclusionary housing will have its own meeting or the priority setting workshop, so both will actually have meetings?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, it seems like I would actually want to see us directing the city manager and staff to to schedule that priority setting workshop and. On the agenda and it'll just be that workshop and on the agenda. The first item we tackle is whatever we consider most significant, and it might well be the Vice Mayors Workshop.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But that's separate from our open government rules. We need to for we need to get direction from council that we want to proceed with these referrals. So I have a motion. Second, I wanted to add that in regards to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'When this comes back, I would like to be able to also discuss in regards to the work live whether or not we count them as dwelling units and look at those the specific the city's ordinance work with ordinance because we currently have only three units under it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We're going to have 80 some units pretty soon. And I think it'd be nice to actually review what our ordinances and.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Look at all all of that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Together.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, I mean.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Remember De SAC on 98.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know I think outside of Alameda point how to bring to life a revamped inclusionary housing. Policy and programs outside of Alameda Point is very difficult to the extent that we don't own the properties there and to the extent that our levers to influence improving inclusionary housing, a revamping like inclusionary housing is limited.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I think you have nine a real have a have it really real outside of Alameda point. I think you'd have to have a discussion about a local housing bond to supplement where necessary money. So I would want that to be part of the discussion.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I distinguish Alameda point from outside of Alameda point largely because we own a point and how we sell land there and influence one way or another. Are affordable housing set aside? So I'm supportive of nine. I'm just saying that and I think, you know, we're going to have to contemplate discussing local housing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And vice mayor.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I think those are those are points. As long as they're included in the discussion, that's fine. But the the the referral and even with Councilmember Ashcroft's comments, the referral is to direct staff to look at changing our inclusionary ordinance and come back to us with a report.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This is direction to do it. And I reference what the city manager suggested because she gives it general time in the beginning of the year behind adoption of the Universal Design Ordinance. And if we want to change it, we get a shot at by voting to move forward on the referral for nine B, so.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I just want us to give staff direction to start looking at it and we can discuss it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And can I make a fine point too is the referral also says start the process with the planning board and what I wrote is start with the council workshop or our council discussion. You get sort of big picture policy direction so.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Sounds good. I right. I'm agreeable to that. Yes. Yes, I'm agreeable to that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You're good with the coming to council?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'First.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So would you think that if I want to discuss the work with ordinance specifically, though, I need to do a separate referral.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'No. Were you. Oh, we are looking as this is.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'A big that's a component of affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Just want to make sure.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Let Steph put that in the mix.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you. So there's emotion in a second. All those in favor, I. I oppose. Saying, You know, I'm going to vote no because I really think we should be looking at a priority setting workshop as opposed to just throwing out our favorite causes as worthy as these all are.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think it's respectful of staff and staff time, staff's time, and we want them to do this work for us to know, okay, what are things that are time critical because of some other projects that are coming along for approval?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We should put this one now I get that everybody put in their council referrals on the chronological date that they did, but I wish I could get you all to see the value of a priority setting. So motion classes 4 to 1.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Nine be.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Consider directing the city manager to schedule.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'A priority setting work session. All right. So I had brought this referral and, uh. Really? I think I think it's important that we do this. I appreciate city manager's idea of having it annually. That's what I was. But we used to do on the school board.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think it's very important that staff come back where they tell us all the work that they have to do within a year. And then we try to plug in all those others, all these different referrals and and have that discussion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's why I brought that. And a lot of times I just feel like staff's actually working really, really hard and it's hard to juggle everything. So I'd like to have a public discussion on that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Member Thank you. I just have a couple of questions maybe of staff. I mean, how do we envision this happening? Kind of to carry on the descent discussion from 9ai mean I just did this with the stop wasthat org board and we had a facilitator and it took two meetings and we went through our priorities.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then there was some discussion the staff was involved and the different that he managers were involved and the different experts that are appointed from staff that attend the meetings on the city's behalf. And, I mean, is it just going to be you know, we have our wish lists and whichever one is the most popular gets put'",
        "'speaker_3': 'at the front or, you know, are we going to have some thought to it in some facilitation? Because I do like the idea and concept, but in practice, I mean, last time we had a workshop, it kind of devolved into something that I don't even remember what to even think about.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I mean, is there going to be some organization behind it? And yes, yes, we weren't here. So, you know, I don't know that no offense.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That was succinct.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we've actually spoken already to the facilitator that did the stuff waste priority setting will probably I'm open to any recommendations. I think it's important that this council feel comfortable with the facilitator, but it's also important to look at our existing workload.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's the other thing. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I think it has to start with that. So there's understanding that we have requirements that we have to do annually regardless of the other frosting that we can add to this cake. And so that's the first part of sort of letting both the public know and the council know.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This is we're already. Book Solid on our workplan. But here is what we can do and how we can do it. And it's a conversation and a facilitation, but a conversation between staff who are having to do the work and implement it and the council.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, values. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And over time, I see if it's an annual goal setting, priority setting that it also replaces the need to depend so much on the referral program because it's an opportunity for the Council to say this is what I want the city to accomplish this year.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then the staff is judged by whether we can implement that. So the first one might be messy, but over time it should become more routine.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think that'd be good.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Nebraska. I that's precisely what I'm trying to get us to move toward. And at some point, we just have to say, okay, let's try doing this. It's it is much more logical. And the problem is we throw all these requests to staff without having a good overview of what it is they're doing for us on our behalf'",
        "'speaker_0': ', that we've requested them at other times and other things that they're mandated by law to do. So I'm not just looking for, oh, tell us what your workload is this year, but how is your workload? Here's a bunch of wish list items we have.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Trust me, I've got my own list. I've just been holding back for this workshop, and. And I think it will get us off to a good start. And I agree it might be messy at first, but I really think it's necessary and I would encourage us to get behind this.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And a facilitator will probably meet with each of you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Before the meeting for.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'To help in that process.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Member de SA Thank you. You know, I, I feel like I have a responsibility to my constituents when they come to me and they request certain policy or programs that I do my level best to pursue it. Now they might come to me in June or July, but if you're saying that we had a priority setting workshop'",
        "'speaker_2': 'in January or February, and therefore, well, we can't do it because we rarely talk, I'm going to have to raise some. Concerns about that. No. This is the city council. We are the policy setting body. You are the city manager.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You work for the city council. The city attorney works for the city council. We set the policy. We try to understand what your workload is. But I'm sorry. But if if if if we're creating a priority setting work regime, that's like a wind up toy that's done in January and February and therefore all of the rest of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the year is set. I'd have to raise some concerns about that. So for now, I'm just going to have to abstain on on this matter.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I just want to just throw in really quickly. I don't remember saying wind up toy pricing. Yeah, I know. But it was it was a reference you were making, but I think you actually raised some good points. I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And Mr.. DE So and so there's no reason that a priority setting workshop couldn't also include. And how do we make sure that we have time to address those items that come up that we couldn't have anticipated ahead of time?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There has to be a flexibility in any plan. I don't really see it as an either or proposition. I just think it's something that would benefit all of us and our constituents. I think every one of us is responsive to our constituents and our own ways.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you to remember. I'd like to let the city manager respond. You may proceed.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So the intent was not at all to say this is a iron clad process. What I intended to say was this is in addition to the referral process and will be a opportunity for the Council to proactively look ahead.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There are opportunities that come up both through constituents, through funding applications, through lobbying, through changes, unpredictable changes. We need to be flexible enough to be able to respond to that. But at the same time, we need to have a vision for the future and then, you know, one year and try and lead that and be flexible at'",
        "'speaker_5': 'the same time. We're not saying one way or the other is working. They both have to work together. And I so I apologize if that was the impression.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I appreciate that at this point. I want to call the question because we're gonna run out of time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Um.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Motion sick and all this. Remind me. The question is to schedule a priority setting workshop with a facilitator. Okay. Others in favor. I, I suppose. Abstain. One abstention for favor. Motion carries. Thank you. It is now 11:00. We need a motion to continue the meeting.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It requires three votes. We have a.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Motion. I move. We continue.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Second.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All those in favor I. I oppose. Jane. Your post. Okay. So three and favorite to post motion carries. Thank you. All right, I'll just now add that I don't think we do a service to our public when we carry on our business after 11:00 at night.'"
