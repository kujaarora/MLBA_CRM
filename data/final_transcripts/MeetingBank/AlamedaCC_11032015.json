        "'speaker_7': 'And what that means is when we're redeveloping Alameda Point, it's very different from, say, redeveloping a building over at Harvard I'll or building at Marina Village or in other business parks like Bishop Ranch and San Ramon. You know, those places while certainly marina villages built out that are very you know, those places have land on which, you'",
        "'speaker_7': 'know, you can just build and not worry about what's underneath anymore. But that's different in Alameda. So there's there's a certain amount of risk and some might even say incredible risk. But that doesn't mean that city staff or city council members are just going to give away the property.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You know, we're going to do our due diligence. We're going to take a look at comparables when it comes to getting value or if or we're going to use other ways to to understand that we're getting the value that that the taxpayers expect of us.'",

So when you look at it on those terms, I think the city staff have exercised due diligence that everyone expects of them to.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And the fact that a number of the partners are locally based with exciting products and services, I think this is something that we can all be excited about. But I think one of the points that the Mayor has expressed is something to keep in mind that as we move forward with the this and other real estate transactions'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Thanks, Ben. Two quick questions, Massoud, if you. So without repeating everything that my three colleagues said. Everything. I agree with everything they said. But if you can. I think my notes were for for building nine. The developer was going to pour $33 Million into renovations and improvements.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And for building 91, it was 6 million.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'One's three, so $8.5 million, right.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we have someone who's willing to put in, you know, close over $45 million in two buildings that, you know, as my colleague said, were pretty dilapidated and will attract jobs. So I think that's a good thing. One last question, though, on this option to purchase, if they do do an option to purchase, does that come back'",

        "'speaker_4': 'No, it does not.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Staff is working on the creation of the subdivision maps and will be presenting them to the Planning Board and City Council next year. That's going to be happening momentarily. That does not renegotiate the price the prices declared right here.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's what the council is agreeing to. That's all it says is what the total price is. And for building 91, it's exactly the same language, except it's 5.5 million. What I believe needs to be included here is not just what is decided in the back, behind closed doors, a negotiated price, but something more than that that shares'",
        "'speaker_3': 'with the public how this is arrived at to justify that this is in fact a fair market value and long term what the impact is to the city. For instance, on one of these, there's a monthly rent of $18,000.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'However, when it becomes that the purchase at 3 million, there will be a shift in revenue coming to the city instead of having a monthly revenue stream of, for instance, on that piece of property approximately 20,000 per month, the city will will receive the money, the 3 million, and then they're going to receive a property tax.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And there should be my opinion set forth here what the property taxes and a comparison and how we're going to move forward as a city because we have expenses to incur five years down the road, ten years down the road, 20 years down the road.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we are making a choice now to sell off the people's property. And all we are telling them is this one set price. And so as much as there's these questions that go back and forth here, I think it's very important to be put in writing so that the public has the opportunity to review it and that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it truly is transparent. And I don't think we are meeting that and I think it truly has to hold up to scrutiny by the public. I don't think it's appropriate to bring new slides as much as I appreciate that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But in the middle of the meeting, I think our our I know our community is entitled to when we are selling the community's assets to more because we're not putting the this is another difference. We're not saying we're going to be selling this building.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Anyone can come and bid on it. What we are in fact doing is negotiating a lease that happens to have an option to purchase with that one person. That's that one entity that's doing the lease as opposed to having the building for sale at market value.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So there is not going to be the competition, for instance, that occurs when any of us go to try it, try to buy a home or rent a piece of property. And none of that happens here. It's all negotiated.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then there is nothing set forth as part of this. The documents that we have intentionally looked at, the fiscal analysis moving forward and the differences of how a lease impacts versus a purchase. So all of that's what I'm looking for when it comes back to us.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I do appreciate that the heading was changed, that it now includes a purchase and option to purchase. But I really think it should be more than that. And in fact, that's something that we get called out for historically is the deal too negotiated behind closed doors and that the public doesn't really know how we arrive at'",
        "'speaker_3': 'those figures and that needs to happen, in my opinion. So that being said, did you want to respond?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I did want to respond. And what I want to just to offer is that all of last year, Miss Ott did essentially what you're talking about, the analysis regarding the infrastructure, how much was it? Each building's fair share.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That analysis is available. It's on our website and I and I, so I understand that. And it is our fault and I think our our job to make sure that we continue to provide that information for new councilmembers and for the public as these things move forward.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But much of that analysis has been done that was done last year, prior to prior to these things coming coming forward. But I think your point is well taken and will be sure to make sure that those individual items are identified on each of our staff reports moving forward.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Madam Chair.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And let me real quick respond to her and say I appreciate that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And and I say I do agree with you that headings should encompass include all the information. But I also am going to take a little bit of exception about the way at least I'm interpreting you, talking about deals negotiated behind closed doors.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'There are certain topics that by law are discussed in closed session, and real estate transactions are one of those. And the reason for that is that if we were out there in the open bargaining for real estate prices and with negotiating in public, then we would be showing our hand and not getting as good a deal as'",
        "'speaker_8': 'we might. And so we all are aware that in closed session the council met with staff, including Ms. Odd and we gave authorization for parameters within which to carry out these negotiations, and that was done. So I mean, at some point certainly the sales price comes out and the lease prices come out and become public.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That's what's in these items that are before us today. But it's not a matter that we're trying to hide something from the public. We are abiding by the law. And that's that's part of our responsibility as council members.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I appreciate that. However, it's my understanding, and I'm happy to use our counsel here, it's my understanding that even when we negotiate a deal, that when it comes forward that we should be able to be held up to scrutiny by the public in regards to that number.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes, that that is correct.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Once the deal has been has been arrived at with the developer purchasing party. It has to come before the council and it is all public. The terms of the deal are all made public and the analysis and scrutiny then is is available at that point in time before council would actually vote to approve the transaction.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So that's what I'm asking for, is more than just the purchase price, but the analysis be made public. Thank you. All right. So that being said, I'm going to call it a question. All those in favor. I oppose.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I oppose. Motion carries a 4 to 1. Thank you. And now. And I apologize. We have one speaker, said Mr. Ernst. Five. Did you want to come and speak? Apologize for that. We have another item that was pulled 5mm.'"

        "'speaker_4': 'just tear these buildings down and start from scratch. And then it helps correct infrastructure deficiencies that really creates, we believe, major annual long term liabilities to the city, that if we don't start correcting the infrastructure and generate funds to pay for that, to upgrade the infrastructure, we're going to continue to see our annual cost increase and then'",
        "'speaker_4': 'potentially have issues long term in some sort of major issue. So these are I just wanted and we're happy, you know, we wanted to make sure everyone understood that there is a lot of analysis and thought that goes into our recommendation and wanted to present that to you tonight.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Market support for the option price a typical and we're we have a chart here and the you know our our expert here to to help us with this but is the typical average values in the I-80 corridor range from 55 to $65 a square foot for this type of Class C manufacturing space.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The Nortel option price is about $91 a square foot, which exceeds that market value, primarily due to the views and the uniqueness of these types of assets. So we are we do believe we're getting a market value for this for this building.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Here are some recent sales comps. There's four comps that we've had here for industrial manufacturing uses in the I-80 corridor. All of which you can kind of see in this area are in the 53 at the lowest $60 a square foot per square foot.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We're far exceeding those comps in terms of what we're able to obtain with with this particular project. The fiscal impacts of the project. You know, I think this is again, I think, you know, as city manager one madam said, we've done a lot of analysis over the years and we need to continue to remember them to present'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that information to the new council members and to the community. And we will definitely do a better job at doing that. But we have prepared a fiscal impact analysis that was very extensive as part of our zoning amendment at the time.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we understood that we had a picture of what this would mean from a fiscal standpoint when we approve those plans. And then again, we updated that as part of the site development and not just for site but for the whole base, too.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so we've made, you know, as things change, we've tried to update that and all just want as a kind of reminder, all new development and property owners will pay a fair share of their municipal services special tax to offset any long term fiscal impacts to the city.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The natal property will do that as well. They will, we believe, be generating about $67,000 per year in property tax. And I just want to kind of you know, this is something we talked about or, you know, some questions that came up about this today.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We have to be a little careful about comparing that to lease revenues where you because what you really with the lease revenues those are revenues that you get but if you don't invest in infrastructure you kind of have to take into consideration if you're going to be a long term holder of property, then you're going to have'",
        "'speaker_4': 'to essentially kind of amortize, you know, create a capital reserve for infrastructure. And if you were to take a debt service on the infrastructure for this property, it's about $430,000 a year in debt service for a $5.2 million infrastructure burden.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we just have to be I just want to provide all that information. We are we do believe that that you have to kind of quantify that liability essentially if you're going to hold property long term and not sell it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I just want to wanted to present that information, the pro rata share of infrastructure and, you know, the development impact fee, it was recently inflated as part of the last master fee schedule is merely essentially $1,000,000 per acre for commercial uses.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Building 23 is 5.3 acres. That equals about a $5.3 million infrastructure burden with an $8 million purchase price. It exceeds the infrastructure burden by $2.7 million so far exceeding we're making, you know, as a minimum. We know that we're making more than the infrastructure burden that would have to be paid for for this project.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then I know there's some questions about what, you know, losing control. And it's something honestly, like, I wake up in the middle of night to thinking about this, how we've remembered everything. I mean, these are, you know, what?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'What are what do we have in place? So when we let go of this land, we know that, you know, like these parcels kind of go off and become part of the rest of the city like they are other places.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And have we put in place all the restrictions and other things that we want. So once we lose control, we know that this is going to be developed. And because we do lose control, they could sell the property, things could happen, they could get developed in certain ways and do have we put into place all the regulations'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and things. And I believe the answer is yes. And, you know, I talked with the city planner about this. And I mean, his opinion is this is would you look at this long list of things, it's probably much more onerous than any other property in the rest of the city in terms of what they're going to have'",
        "'speaker_4': 'to deal with. And just quickly, you know, the city, there's a zoning ordinance which regulates use and form. What can occur there? There are mitigations for every project. If there is a development proposal or anything that comes before the city has to be reviewed under the California Environmental Quality Act.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And if they want to rely on the city's environmental impact report, then they're going to have to comply with all kinds of biological traffic. Historic mitigations. The Navy, before it transferred the property to us, placed a declaration or restrictions on the entire property, which created very extensive biological restrictions to protect for the the endangered species that nest'",
        "'speaker_4': 'on the property. We have a resolution that the City Council passed for the master infrastructure plan. There's a development impact fee ordinance which sets into place that million dollars an acre. We have design, review, ordinance, zoning and changes to buildings and things that trigger design review will have to come to the planning board just like any other'",
        "'speaker_4': 'project. Historic Preservation Ordinance. The buildings, including this building 23 are contributors, historic district and are considered historic resources under the local law and would have to comply with the historic preservation ordinance and have an extra burden of review potential approval if there are certain things that had to be done.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Sewer lateral ordinances will be coming to you, as was mentioned earlier, with a parcel map to create legal parcels for these adaptive reuse areas. And we will be placing conditions on that parcel map that essentially reiterate all of these things.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But we're trying we're kind of taking this redundancy approach, which is there's no reason why not. We shouldn't have all of these things in our zoning. We shouldn't have them all there. But to make sure we all kind of don't forget about them as we go forward, we're going to additionally place them on the parcel map for'",
        "'speaker_4': 'these properties so that they're an extra reminder to anyone who owns these properties that you're going to have to comply with these different things. That includes a transportation demand management plan as well as city council approved. So even though you're letting go, there's we've worked very hard to create a really robust policy framework for moving forward so'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that once these become private properties, that the city's vision is will continue to be complied with. So I'm going to pass it over to Jim to go ahead and give her presentation. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. Spencer, and council members. I just have a brief presentation to run through a little bit about what we're doing.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We love, show and tell.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And can this also be added to the agenda item? Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But in the interest of show and tell. One of the things that we do quite regularly actually is do a little tours of of our facilities we have. It's always kind of interesting to bring in some of the things that we've done and kind of regularly with books from Berkeley, from UC Berkeley and also I think recently'",
        "'speaker_2': 'from a from an elementary school, we had, you know, it's always fun to help bring young folks in so they can kind of see what we're doing in the clean tech space is a little different is this combination of both high tech and not necessarily low tech, but certainly advanced manufacturing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So more of like building things and in this case, somewhat big things. It was always fun to give tours to help people understand what it is we're actually doing. So should anyone want one? We're happy to do that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So again, just wanted to to walk through what we're doing. A little bit of background on nutshell, why we're here in Alameda and what we're doing and our vision as we go forward and enter a new period of growth for us, why we want to continue to be here and why we're pretty excited if we are able'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to move forward and in the space what we'd like to do. So just to start very quickly and I'll get into a little bit more of this later on, but this is just a rendering to show some of what we envision as we go forward with doing the improvements of the space over time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So a little bit about us. So we are a water and energy innovation company based here in Alameda at Alameda Point. And what we do is distributed utility scale hydropower. And hydropower is a renewable energy source, just like wind and solar.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But the way that we do it is different. If you think about hydro, you probably think Hoover Dam or Grand Coulee or Three Gorges, they're massive projects and they often carry with them pretty significant impacts. And what we said or what inspired us was could we do hydro better?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We do it in a way that was distributed at a much smaller impact footprint, but still kept all the good things about hydro, which is that it is a reliable and just what's called a dispatchable energy source. And if we could do that, it would enable us to actually put more wind and solar on the grid and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'over time, help us really address things like climate change by having cheap, reliable domestic renewable energy. That was the big picture vision for us, and that required an innovation, the blue box that you see up there. And that was in the video earlier, you saw one of our cassettes being inserted into a blue housing in the video'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that was just shown earlier. That's the hydrogen and that's what we make. So we assemble it here in Alameda in our vision as we go forward is that we'd have our initial production facility here. Our entire supply chain is actually based in the U.S. and many of the companies that we work with to do our initial prototyping'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and even some of our initial supply are based here in the Bay Area. So, for example, our control system is made by a local supplier in the Bay Area. In terms of our history here, we we actually started here in 2009, so we moved in to the current location where we are at right now, which is at'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the tower and in 2009. And we've grown here locally. Majority of our employees live here in the East Bay, and the rest of us all commute. We're excited, actually, about things like how we expand transit and have better transit options because many of us, like I myself do and I regularly bike through the tunnel, for example.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so finding ways in which we have better transit options so we can have our employees, you know, live and have good commutes is a really important thing for us going forward. So long history here. We're really excited to contribute and to continue to grow here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In terms of just a quick couple of things on achievements. So we got started in 2009 and we're very fortunate to receive a lot of support from the Department of Energy, also from the U.S. Trade Development Agency, which is part of the Department of Commerce and the Small Business Business Innovation Research Program.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So they were really critical in helping us do some of our early product development. Following that on, we were able to raise private capital, which is really funding a lot of our growth as we go forward now. And that's coming off of the fact that we were able to get a product to market and probably the, you'",
        "'speaker_2': 'know, big name up there in terms of our, you know, highlights from our sales pipeline is we just we closed the sale with Apple for sale with Apple last year and actually just delivered that project to Apple this summer.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So lots of exciting things for us as we go forward and look to scale in terms of our vision here. Where we're headed is that we envision this space becoming our corporate headquarters, our engineering, R&D, primary location and our location for initial production.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that's what we'd like to build here. To do that, we think we forecast over the next five years that will be probably between 150 to 200 plus jobs here as well. And that in addition, given the again, because we have we work with a lot of local machine shops, some local suppliers, obviously, then additional support for'",
        "'speaker_2': 'us as we grow that that supports a number of indirect jobs in the area. In terms of the lease, this was already covered, but just wanted to recap quickly what the basic economics are and in terms of upgrades, to give you a little bit more.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In terms of what we're planning to do. Picture on the left is what it is right now. And, you know, it's it is as it is. And just to give you a feel, again, some of our what we want to do is we take it forward, basically make it green.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We want to add some landscaping and really make it a much more pleasant place to be. And things like easy chargers, again, that's pretty important to our employees. Exterior improvements, interior improvements and a big investment, of course, in our R&D and initial production facility.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Again, the purchase option, this was already recapped, but just to put it up here so that it's clear and again what we plan to invest and I think really just to highlight so this is you know, it is it is this amazing view, right?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's very, very true. And that's we love being here again. You know, for us, when we we got here, when we first moved here, the fact that it is a little rough around the edges was was actually a really inspiring yeah, it was a really inspiring thing for us.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so it kind of challenged us and went along with our ethos, which is we want to create simple, sustainable and beautiful solutions for to solve our water energy challenges here in the state of California. But then also those solutions translate around the world.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This is I've been up there a couple times. This is kind of where we where we want to take it. This is a quick aerial view just to give you a feel of what we're looking at. We want to build some have some nice outside collaborative spaces as well, you know, take to have it be pleasant and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'click click shot of our team. Yeah. And, and I'll just leave it there.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Gigi. I just want to say one thing because I want to make sure this is disclosed. And I had it in my notes and I forgot to say it is that they will have some containers. This came up before and I wanted to make sure this was clearly disclosed.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They will have they're allowed under the lease to have up to 20 containers. They have to be single stacked. They have to be in good condition, esthetically similar. There there's a exhibit. I don't know if you guys can pull that up.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They would take about 4000 at 4800 square feet of land, which about 3%. So out of out of 175,000 square feet of outdoor land space, there would be 1400 square feet at the maximum if they used all of it for the 20 containers.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's about 3% of the outdoor land area. And then there's also in the exhibit really in line with the direction that the council had. And there's an exhibit in the lease which we're just going to pull up to make sure that we discloses and show this is where they have to be pushed back so that they're really'",
        "'speaker_4': 'trying to minimize the views from, you know, monarch and so that and maintain the views. So you'll see the container storage has to be kind of but between those lines are really off of the streets, not here on the southern area, but really contained there.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then you saw the exhibit that they had there or the renderings that they had. But I just wanted to make sure that that was clearly disclosed and the council understood that going forward.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. So I appreciate all these presentations and I, I really appreciate the additional information in regards to the, the ordinance itself. It doesn't have the language of approving a lease and an option to buy. So I'd like the ordinance modified to include the option to purchase in the heading and authorizing the city manager to execute documents necessary'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to implement the terms of ten year lease. So so the heading then is that the same we had in the you had on your the item itself it's missing the whereas that of. Whereas this building, however you're describing at 23, has an option to purchase pending the completion of.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think it's the same language. The language is missing here. So that. Whereas can be added. Yes. All right. And then in regards to section one there also of the ordinance, city manager's designee is hereby authorized to negotiate, executed a lease with that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And wherever you want to add that, it says for ten years and an option to purchase. Yes with the option to purchase and then the additional. Whereas I want to make sure that's all in the before. Thank you, Vice Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This agreement to the additions that the mayor mentioned with the filling out the language to include the option to buy. I'm. I'd like to see this go forward. I'm ready to make a motion because this is green energy supporting company.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's manufacturing. Its growth. And it's taken another difficult building and it's required to stay in repurposing. And it does fulfill the original of Base Reuse and Base Realignment and Closure Act. That said, our main purpose is not to hold this land.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Our main purpose is to replace the jobs that went when the Navy closed. So I make the motion to introduce the ordinance with the additions as outlined by the Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I would like to hasten to second the Vice Mayor's motion and just listening to the presentation at Mr. Schneider's Schneider's presentation and also getting a little sneak preview in the economic development video that we saw. First, I mean, we as Alameda INS are so fortunate that, again, another pioneer pioneering firm was willing to take a chance'",
        "'speaker_8': 'on what has to be the wild, wild west out here and say, no, this is this is cool, it's edgy. We can work with this. And by the way, I think the mayor and I both attended the East Bay Economic Development Awards ceremonies last year, 2014, and Natal Energy was one of the finalists.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And this is competing with cities all around the very innovative Bay Area. So I think that this is the kind of business and we've already seen it happening at Alameda Point that will attract other similar businesses. You network, you have your suppliers, you talked to your colleagues in related fields and you know, bring those smart, innovative folks'",
        "'speaker_8': 'to Alameda Point because we want to be that sort as the vice mayor said that sort of a job center. And I know Ms.. Ott, you know, talks about waking up in the middle of the night. I'm sure that a number of things, you know, losing control, property owners could sell property.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But stop and think about it, everybody. We're talking about a company that's willing to sink millions of dollars into this property that wants to that has started here, is growing here, is bringing us jobs. Let's not do anything to drive them out.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We pay a lot of lip service up here on the dais about being a business friendly community and wanting to attract economic development. Now is the time to put our money where our mouth is and really show that we have what it takes to support these kinds of green, clean, innovative businesses that are.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Not only are we lucky to have them here, they're doing good work that's going to make an impact for our world. So I'm proud to have you here in Alameda and I look forward to welcome you. And I'd love to come out for a tour.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'll be in touch. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Oh, well, thank you very much. Just I think the most important thing is, you know, as council members, we're making a business decision on behalf of the residents in looking at the project before us, I believe on all scores that this is a business decision that the residents should be proud of.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Let me just go over some of the things Mhsaa, for example, had referenced, the fact that when you look at the when you take a look at the $3 million that are being the sales price of $4.9 million over 55,000 square feet, that results in a per square foot sales value of 90, $90, $0.51.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And the comparables that that Mozart and her team came up with, she demonstrated that some typical things are somewhere around 50 to $60 ourselves. So so, you know, when you look at those those that information that was put together, you can say, certainly we're doing right by the residents.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But one of the things I also did was, you know, I want to do my own due diligence, so to speak. And I took a look at how anyone can do this. Just go on the Internet, go on to something called Loop Netcom.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I just wanted to look at what our industrial prices going for. These aren't necessarily comparables. I'm not doing, you know, the level of detail that, say, our our partner, Cushman Wakefield does. But even then, you know, when I take a look at the $4.9 million, but but I add the $10 million because while that $10 million'",
        "'speaker_7': 'doesn't come to us, that is nonetheless an economic incentive. I mean, economic expenditure that that occurs because of the $4.9 million. And when I add the $10 million on top of the $4.9 million, you know, you get around $272 per square foot of what I will call economic value.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So when I compare that to your $72 of economic value against, you know, what I'm seeing from LoopNet, I think we're we're in the ballpark. So this is a deal that that people can be proud of. Now, I think it's important to say $10 million to reference that part because like I said in the other item, if'",
        "'speaker_7': 'we were out at Harbor Bay, I'll if if Alameda point was like Harbor Bay Isle or if it was like Bishop Ranch, instead of Mattel investing that $10 million into the project in addition to then paying us $4 million instead of natal investing that $10 million, they would pay that to us because it would because it would'",
        "'speaker_7': 'be a plan. So that's that's why I take a look at that and include that as part of why I call it the economic value. And from that vantage point, when I look at how we're comparing against places in Emeryville or place or what's on in parts of Oakland, I think we're on track here.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So in terms of the business deal, because I think that's really important in in these kind of transactions that we're doing, I think this is a deal that the residents can be proud of in terms of just, you know, the overall goal of where we're going.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I mean, Natal is a definite fit in terms of the industry cluster that we're trying to grow there, along with Makani, along with I mean, I will argue that right speed is also part of the industry cluster in the sense that they are alternative power, but for specific uses, you know, large trucks and something called sail drone'",
        "'speaker_7': '. So it's good to see kind of this cluster not only occur, you know, existing in Alameda Point, but making incredible substantial investments that says that we're here to stay in the fact that Natal, as you know, delivered services to outstanding corporations like Apple, I think demonstrates that we're getting very good companies.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So you combined the energy cluster that we're growing out there, alternative energy cluster that we're going out there along with the food and beverage cluster. The alley. Spirit's alley. You know, you look at kind of a good combination mix of uses.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So this is something I think to be I'm excited about and I can't wait for groundbreaking. On a final note, in terms of containers and whatever issues I have about them. As many you probably recall. My issues were focused solely on the enterprise district.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We are far outside of the Enterprise District.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And Brody, thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But I'm just real brief because I think my three colleagues have kind of captured most of my thoughts, but not to put too fine a point on it. This year we've. Well, if we approve this one, it'll be four leases with options to purchase and write speed.'",
        "'speaker_6': '$4 million in investment in in the buildings building nine. Correct. I was incorrect at first. 29 million built in 91 9 million. And this 110 million. So $52 million in infrastructure improvements out at the base for these four buildings.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And our community has decided, rightly so, that we want this to be adaptive reuse. We want to keep these historic buildings and and reuse them and regenerate jobs. And I'm just you know, I I'm going to every time we do this, I'm going to keep giving that number.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So right now, it's 52 million. I hope we continue to grow that number and I'm prepared to support this.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. Well, I. Oh.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You could be 30, 30.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I'd like, just speak in regards to I also want to commend you for your presentation. I think that that is very helpful, the type of upgrade your pictures. Now that's full disclosure to our community. But but you're putting into it what it's going to look like.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And in regards to the containers and I. Now remember exactly what word to use this on in regards to maintaining or the esthetics. Obviously, we don't we really I don't think we really want to see containers out there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If they can be painted in a manner that has them blend into the background, that confident, that would be appreciated. And hopefully that's what you meant by that. And and given the addition. Additional information by staff and yourself.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I do plan to support it. And the changes of the ordinance. Yeah. So that being said, all those in favor.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Motion carries unanimously. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Madam Chair, this is coming back. Yes. Yes. And if if we could make sure, because the previous building, 1991, also had the same same criteria that we measured it against. And it was also mentioned in the first reading of both of those ordinances that they met an X.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And this one exceeds the impact fee that was put into place by the previous council, which is the public's insurance policy, that the value the true value of those of those properties is translated into the infrastructure we need.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that I think that has to be repeated because it. You know, it was one of the things that was highlighted here is what is the rationale? And I don't believe in comparables down I-80 because anybody who knows about commercial property in Alameda, it look at Marina Village Business Park.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's fine, it's wonderful, it's safe, it's clean, it's empty and it's empty because people had lots of reasons for not coming to Alameda and a closed Navy base. If we go back and I think Councilmember Desai probably knows this, our real comparables are Hunters Point in Mare Island.'",

    "Public Hearing to Consider Adoption of Resolution Amending Master Fee Resolution 12191 to Add and Revise Recreation and Park Fees. (Recreation 5191)": [
        "'speaker_6': 'in nearby cities and also keeping in consideration the balance between. The Budget and the affordability to families. I also want to point out that we do all that. I also examined all the other programs within Alameda as well so that we can say comparable and affordable and make sure that we're all filling the niches that we need'",
        "'speaker_6': 'to fill. So some of the challenges that we face in this upcoming year are in January 1st, 2016, the California state minimum wage will increase from $9 to $10. That is going to be a big challenge, obviously, for staff.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's a welcome challenge. Obviously, we want to pay our staff accordingly. In fact, I'd pay them a lot more if I could, but the it'll be great to have that increase for staff. Also, some of the other challenges we have are field maintenance with the ongoing rising cost of water and and the drought condition for the last'",
        "'speaker_6': 'four years, costs for field maintenance has gone up and will continue to rise. And unfortunately, we'll have to make considerations for that. We've as you seen in the reports, we did a re fee comparison with San Leandro, Pleasanton in Union City and San Ramon.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And as always, we like I mentioned earlier, we maintain a balance between demand and cost recovery. As you see on the chart. To summarize it, the youth program fees are being asked to be increased between three and 5%, and that's directly to reflect the offset of the minimum wage increase was going in effect.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We have asked for increases in the last two years, but I just want to point out that for year, for the four years prior to that, there were no increases. So we anticipated these increase coming and we waited as long as we could.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so now we're trying to catch up to it. Also, I want to point out the athletic field use fee went up from $3 to $5 for nonresident. That will help offset some of the field maintenance costs for maintenance.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I also want to point out within that that staff did recommend that the athletic field use for residents to be raised to from $2 to $4. But the recurrent Park Commission did not expect did not want that increase.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so we took their recommendation and we brought forward the $2, the current $2. So the resident rate will not change in this current fee structure. Lastly, the major increase is for the multi-use synthetic field or estuary park that's going to be going online and it'll be a brand new facility that will hopefully be ready to go'",
        "'speaker_6': 'in the fall of 20 at the end of 2016. And as typical, we have to put that in our fee structure. Synthetic turf fields generally cost more and are used more for game facilities and used more regularly than natural turf fields.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They don't have the downtime as some natural turf fields. And one of the other things that we decided or the thing is that I want to point out that the Challenger field, which is also going to be part of the estuary park, will not be affected by the the turf field.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The multi-purpose field they will be considered under are nonprofit user fee fees. Also, they will remain at the $2 rate as well. So I just wanted to point that out that we're we're looking forward to having the Challenger field out there.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we want to encourage that as much as possible.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And can you go into a little bit of detail about the significance of the Challenger field for people that don't know?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Sure.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The Challenger field is going to be a field that is a multipurpose field, synthetic turf, that will be designed strictly for people with handicaps and will be able to play sports, whether that's soccer or baseball, on a field that is very applicable for their use.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We have a challenger league in Alameda already. That's through the Army Little League, and they are really looking forward to the new field. I know they play games currently in Alameda, but they also go to games elsewhere and it'd be nice to have a premier field that's dedicated.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And Alameda can be one of the few that has a dedicated field in the in the region. So I think it'll be also a draw for all the other Challenger leagues in around Alameda or around the region. Let's see.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think that one. I also wanted to point out on the athletic field use that currently it costs about this is not including staff time about $110,000 annually to cover the fields. In Alameda, we currently have 18 baseball and softball fields and 20 multi-use fields with currently the user.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That we have collected throughout the years, about 40,000 of that 110. So. And the general fund basically absorbs the remaining 70,000 in staff. And then that's not including staff time, which is about 97,000 a year in staff time.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So therefore, field maintenance costs are relatively are over $200,000 a year. And again, it's something that we are constantly looking at and trying to help benefit all the citizens of Alameda. Lastly, I just want to talk a little bit about the process behind setting fees.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I know no one really wants to see fees increase, but there is a process behind this firm from an LAPD philosophy. You know, the bottom line is that the programs that benefit one group or individuals have to pay more of a premium price for the opportunity to participate in recreation programs.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That can be for private lessons, facility rentals, picnic rentals, adult softball teams. They are paying much more of a premium rate than what we charge other programs. The second layer, the second tier is designed for larger groups or multiple groups that have to pay the opportunity to pay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Participant But to cover some of the costs. Again, that's our day camp programs, our afterschool programs. There's obviously costs involved in all of those. And we want to make sure that we cover at least a good percentage of those cost.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then we have what we all hold near and dear is those high community benefit programs that are free and low cost programs. And I know in the past the council has been very supportive. I want to point out the Parks and Playgrounds program that is continually going on.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I think it's one of the most unique things about our that we continue to support free recreation, that we have parks and playgrounds, programs that are supported by the general fund and the council that anyone can participate in.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so that is just a great benefit for Alameda. I also want to point out that the the free T-shirt summer recreational baseball program that we offer, as well as part of the Parks and Playgrounds program, which we have over, you know, 250 to 300 kids every year that play basically for free and get the benefit of'",
        "'speaker_6': 'recreation in Alameda for free. So we do try to balance all of those things out when we come and ask for the user fees each year. But I just want you to know that the that's the mindset behind the philosophy, behind what we're coming out.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We're not just coming up with numbers. I want to thank the city council and the and the importance it places on recreation and parks in Alameda. Because I know you guys are all very supportive of it. And if you have any questions, I'm your dad.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Uh.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I want to commend you for your presentation. And I also want to take note that you're wearing a green shirt to support our parts of war. It's always good to see you, Amir Ashraf.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I just wanted to also thank you, Mr. City, for that nice presentation. And I was just saying to Ms. Wooldridge that it kind of takes my breath away when I see what it cost to maintain our parks. And she whispered back.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And that's not even staff time. So it's true. But we you know, it's something that we're very fortunate to be able to offer in Alameda is we have great park facilities, we're adding more. And this is one of the draws that bring people to our city, that we're family friendly, where we've got lots of great recreational opportunities'",
        "'speaker_8': 'that serve our population from the youngest to the oldest and everything in between. And so, as you said, while we never like to see fees go up, we have to be realistic about wanting to keep our facilities in good condition.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I appreciate the comparison studies you did with comparably sized cities in the in the East Bay around as well and I guess a little bit through that tunnel. But anyway, I'm I'm prepared to support this. I can't wait until we see our newest parks come online and keep up the good work.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thanks. And with that, I would move. Approval of the resolution amending the master fee resolution 1 to 1 and one to add and revise recreation and park fees.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Of our second.'",
