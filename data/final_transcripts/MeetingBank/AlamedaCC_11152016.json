        "'speaker_0': 'In an amount not to exceed 135,000 for review and analysis of property tax revenues. Nebraska.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Thank you, Madam Mayor. So I just wanted a little more information about this. What? So this is a steady hello, Ms.. Adair, who's our finance director? Um, uh, this is a study looking into. Well, you can probably tell us that we're capturing all of the property tax.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We should, because it's the largest source of the general fund. Is that that correct?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So, hello, council members. Madame Mayor Allen, our dear finance director. This particular contract actually provides us with so hd all corn and corn. And what they provide is they assist us with projections of the property taxes. They review the taxes that are assessed by the county in making sure that the city receives its fair share, whether it's'",
        "'speaker_1': 'for specific properties or things such as equipment and things like that, that is not necessarily secured by, let's say, a single family home. So they look into those and make sure it does come to the city if it's within the city.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'City limits, if you wish. They also provide us with on the annual basis with a report that breaks down things like general fund related properties and revenues, as well as what used to be a redevelopment agency, currently a successor agency, do still provide us all the information that relates to it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It assists us to also figure out how much money is going to come in in order to pay successor agency obligations. They provide updates. They also provide us with things like This is what we expect next year's assessments will be or what they expect.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The CPI increase would be, so they assist cities with that information as well. So it's a variety of services. One of the things that they do is they do sometimes audits. And actually, I guess I would say fortunately for Alameda, within the prior period that they were under the contract, we only had twice that they actually had'",
        "'speaker_1': 'to go in and do certain corrections. So usually it happens at extra charge outside of regular agreements, but we've only got it twice and the dollar amounts were very minimal.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So when you say corrections, does that mean that we. And too much tax.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Usually that we didn't get enough or somebody was paying it to another entity, let's say outside of city of Alameda. Let's say it would have may have been Oakland. So they would make sure and recapture those to make sure that she'll comes to the city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I'm a couple questions. So we've used this firm to do this kind of work in the past.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And is the compensation structure always the same? Because what caught my eye is that this is a five year contract.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Five year.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Five years, and we're paying $18,250 per year, plus 25% of the net revenues recovered by the consultant. Is that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's correct. As and as I mentioned, we only had a twice where they actually had to come in and recover certain property taxes on our behalf within the last five years prior to that. So in I believe the amount was all we received about like $800.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So it was very.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So it's not likely.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's yes, I mean.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's possible. But and that's why we have them, because we cannot look at every single property and that's kind of their job. They actually get County Assessor's maps and everything like that and they look whether it's actually paid correctly, whether the appropriate addresses are applied correctly.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then my one request is, can we get an update, say, on an annual basis of what the results of their their review were?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm sure you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Do. And I think it can probably just be a consent calendar item even. But I would just like to have that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In my city manager just mentioned, we do do it as a part of a budget update. In general, we can incorporate that. But generally when we look at the property taxes for the budget, that's one of the sources that we'll.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Rely on other than what we know internally as well within our own, I would say, economy.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so a lot of the information they provide ends up in the budget, in projections and assessing us. And we can do more in the budget about what the long term strategy is from the consultants point of view.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I was just more interested in on a year yearly basis, what is it that they were able to uncover?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Oh, okay. Like the recovery part? Yeah. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Can you confirm that there's a cap? I understand there's a cap not to exceed 135,000 overall. That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So the expectation is, as you've mentioned, it's about over a little over $18,000 per year and plus any recoveries. So what we were trying to do is figure out $18,000, how much would that be and give a little bit of buffer in case would you have recoveries that we have to make a payment?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I don't necessarily expect it to be that high and it's obviously limited to a five year period. In addition to that, they do have in year three and four and five a CPI increase for their fees. Actually, $18,000 stayed pretty much consistent with the prior.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Five year contract.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It actually has increased. So this would be, I think, reasonable that it's, you know, increased and it's increased by California CPI, not even Bay Area CPI, which normally is lower.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Any other questions.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Dear?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Do we have a motion?'",

        "'speaker_0': 'And I see Rachel in the audience here. But but this is is phase zero a years one and two of what did happen at Alameda Point and what is anticipated to happen in the this coming year. And I think it's important that we share that with our public.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Rachel, did you want to say anything? I'm happy to actually would encourage people to go to the point alameda on Facebook and like that. That's where they do post events and they are very strong using social media. But I really want to make sure the public's aware of what's happening there.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'So a quick recap of some of the events that we hosted. We really try to work hard to appeal to a wide variety of audiences, from families up to adults and teens. So a couple of quick photos because they can tell a better story than I can of some of the events that we've hosted.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This has spanned the gamut from a coastal cleanup on Martin Luther King Day, partnering with the Parks and Rec team on the Clay Herding skateboard tournament, as well as a new street festival that we brought out to Alameda Point, which was called Whimsy Fest.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I also wanted to mention that, you know, we had over 14 different events with 11,000 attendees, and we generated some great new partnerships that have brought in new audiences. And we are hoping to continue to have those partnerships continue on through the next year.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So. One of the things that we learned through the first year is that we really need to have a home for phase zero. We need to have it there a place that our traffic can grow organically. And we also need to maintain flexibility.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So as new programs and new partnerships come up, we can work those into into the Phase zero program. So looking into year two, we're very excited to finally have our home start to come together. This is going to be in front of the Naval Air Museum, some area that we chose very carefully, which has enabled us to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'tap into some existing infrastructure, be in close to the heart of where there are a lot of audiences currently today, and also steer clear of our Phase one construction, which is kicking off very, very soon. So this home for phase zero is going to include a artfully designed container village.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This is designed by the same team that has brought together the yard in San Francisco, which is across the street from Park Bell Park, which has been very, very successful and will bring a new cafe and beer garden and new opportunities for people to enjoy the site's natural attributes of beautiful views of San Francisco, as well as'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the waterfront, which is an underutilized part of the base right now. So we're going to be reusing some of the murals that were part of Whimsy Fest, and those are going to be brought out. And so that Container Project is going to be the home for our Year two activity calendar.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So that includes the return of the pumpkin patch, which brought us 6000 people last year. It will also serve as the home for the American Armed Forces Cup, which is going to come back for a second year. That was a great way to honor our veterans and support the history at Alameda Point.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I want to add, the public is very welcome to attend. That is not just for our military and it's a wonderful event.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Glad that glad that it was well enjoyed. And now that we will have a home, it will make it a lot easier for us to also have smaller recurring events. So a couple of ideas that we have put on the calendar for next year have included things like Yappy Hour, which is an opportunity to bring your dog'",
        "'speaker_1': 'out and enjoy, enjoy the scenery as well as outdoor yoga and things like that. So I'm going to breezed through these really quickly. So as I mentioned, we brought back the pumpkin patch, which did very well this year.'",

So that has already happened. And now we are working on a creative show that will highlight the makers and the creativity out at Alameda Point, which will'",

Then come April will be the grand opening of the The Container Project, as well as a return of the Creative Arts Festival.'",

It's the triangle area from that basically stretches from about where the Hornet field is out to the internal boat launch facility. And when we have that, the scope and the bandwidth to do so, LAPD would Alameda Recreation Park Department would engage the community in a masterplan'",
        "'speaker_1': 'process to determine what the community wants to see out there, whether they want to see tennis courts there, or whether we only have tennis courts at the sports complex. There's a lot of master planning to be done out at Alameda Point in for recreation facilities.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Are there plans to have tennis courts at the sports complex then?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Potentially. But we'll be doing a master plan process for that as well.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you very much. As many of you know, I was coaching a special needs soccer team this fall. Children with severe mental challenges and physical challenges. With 15 children on their team. We templated the program on the Challenger baseball program.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That Little League. And then I assisted a very impressive young man by the name of Easton Woon, who had arranged he's a high school student. He'd arranged with other high school students to provide a similar experience, not competitive, but for younger children.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'On Saturdays, he and his friends had arranged this, and they've grown it to 30 special needs children. So between our two programs, we have 45 children who are participating. What the army, the soccer club is doing is highly valuable and helpful to us for a number of reasons.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'First, in the group that I work with, we have a real issue with children taking off and running. These tennis courts are fenced in. So right now we are limited in the number of children we can serve by our number of volunteers.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We have to go 1 to 1, one body to one player. Being able to get inside of an enclosed area makes it much, much more manageable. Second, it's a somewhat isolated location, and many of our autistic children become very agitated by noise.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So when we're playing on a soccer field where there are other players and other games going on and there's cheering and screaming, so children cover their ears and run off. So being isolated is helpful. Not to mention most of the other fields where we have soccer really don't have many handicapped parking spaces.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There's a lot of parking out here which would solve a problem for us. But most importantly, it's a hard, smooth surface which makes it easier for our non-ambulatory players, the players with Down syndrome, the players who are in wheelchairs or walkers who frankly, we couldn't serve this year.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I implore you to let the soccer club spend some money and do this. Thank you very much. We appreciate all the.'",

I'm a business owner in the city of Alameda, and I also have two boys that attend Alameda schools. For the last ten years, I have been involved with Alameda Soccer Club as both a coach in various volunteer capabilities.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then most recently, for the last two years, I've been the president of the organization. This is for those who aren't aware, this is a club of approximately 1300 kids. We are a community based organization. We are solely volunteer based.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'I thought it was a no brainer at that point. And so I started looking at not just how do we make why would this make sense for the community, but how do we make it work? And when I started when I started looking around, what I found was a little bit to my surprise, it wasn't so much'",

I think there's more people converting tennis courts to football, one of the fastest growing sports in the country. Then there's not. So I reached out to several organizations around the country.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'But really, the kids have to organize themselves. They get to play. It's roughly by skill level. So sometimes there are six year olds playing with 12 year olds actually often. And so part of what they learn is how to self-manage, how to play fairly against opponents of multiple sizes.'",

And I wanted to make sure and I want to thank staff, Ms. Wooldridge for all of your work to make this happen as well as'",

        "'speaker_0': 'But I do think it's very important that this be broadcast so that other people in our community, everyone knows what's going on. And you might think about sharing it on social media and maybe some photo ops for our local papers to make sure we're getting the word out.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That being said, any council comments? Amber Ashcraft I move approval second. All those in favor. I motion carries unanimously. Thank you very much. Last item I pulled five H.

And I pulled the him in because it's 160,000 from the general fund. And I wanted to give staff an opportunity to share why it's important to to fund this at this point instead of having it go'",
        "'speaker_0': 'through our budget process.'",

So what this is what these services are for is for construction management services, for the cross Alameda Trail, the portion through Jean Sweeney, Open Space Park. As you know, that project is grant funding from that active transportation program, which is managed by Caltrans and Metropolitan Transit Commission Transportation Commission.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So because it's grant funded, we need to keep it on a strict schedule and timeline. So we need these construction management services, which really are critical for a project of this size so that we have someone out in the field who really is helping us manage the field conditions that come up and change orders and things like'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that. These types of soft costs are not often included in grants and are not included in this particular grant, so we need to find funding sources for it outside of the grant sources. The other part, funding sources that we currently normally would use like development impact fees are currently not available and so thus we brought it forward'",
        "'speaker_1': 'for to use general fund moneys.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Counsel, do you have any other questions?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Just for clarification, Miss Voltage, this is just for the cross Alameda Trail. Within the park itself, it's not covering what we call the gap between a couple of segments of the park. Thank you. Of the trail, rather.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right. Thank you for that clarification. It is. It's for both to a certain extent, a portion of this grant does include that gap coverage. And there's also we're putting additional public works is putting additional dollars to make sure that gap is is done even above and beyond what was proposed for this grant.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we're melding those two together.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Remind us what's being done for that gap that is more than just green paint on a road or.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It is it's it's intended to be more than green paint on the road. The proposal that's gone before the Transportation Commission is is to take the lane the most terrible directions with the lane closest to the Starbucks in those businesses and make it into a protected two way bike lane.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Found if.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I was like I just want to Jennifer base for use transportation planning director. But we are we're looking at health care. If we had a design that he was talking about that went to the Transportation Commission in January of this year, and it did contemplate taking it and we're trying to avoid taking that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'LANE There were issues with AC transit and needing a bus stop. We're looking at taking actually the center median out and there's kind of an unused landscaped strip in the sidewalk that we're looking at so that we might be able to keep the lane.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so we're looking at some options are our intent is to have a two way cycle track that would connect with the ramp project, the ramp up opposite of Memorial Parkway and Jean Sweeney's you'd have a two way protected bikeway all through that corridor, but it's very tight and it's between two intersections.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's going to take a little work, but we're shooting to try to take the the most recent design to the Transportation Commission January, but definitely a two way protected bikeway.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay, that sounds good. And as long as they've got chipper and that's the area across from the housing authority offices and come with independence the Housing Independence Plaza, is anything being done? I know it's not anything being done about it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Crossing is a part of this. Is that easy looking at that the transportation commission.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yeah, we're looking at it. The it what I think you're referring to is whether or not there's a lot of people that kind of cross. There's not we're looking at a Mid-Block crosswalk there and whether or not we can accommodate it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And the housing authority has actually gone after some grants. And then we are going to be coming through with some of the money from Measure B for dedicated transit lanes. And we're going to some other opportunities if we can't afford to do it as part of this project, because it it's very constrained with those two intersections.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And we would be looking to do it as part of a subsequent phase that once the Housing Authority gets a grant or as part of the larger BRT project, we're looking to see if we can try to accommodate it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But it's a very tricky stretch in trying to figure out all the different pieces of it between those two intersections. It's complicated. And so with a bus stop there, as well as the two way bike lane and then maintaining the lanes and making sure we don't create any issues at the intersections.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So. We're trying, but I'm not going to tell you for sure that we're going to accommodate as part of this initial phase. But it is something we want to try to accommodate as part of a later phase.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. I appreciate those updates. Thank you both.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I want to add, I did meet with staff out there from both the housing authority and our public works. And they are trying to figure out and for those of you that don't aren't following, what we're talking about is directly across from the Starbucks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have housing there at Independence Plaza. And unfortunately, you know, we have a lot of elderly people and it's really hard for them to walk all the way down to the crosswalk. It's a long ways around. And so, unfortunately, they go halfway across to the center median and then go across.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And they also. So so we are looking. So I know housing authority as well as our staff is trying to figure out how to solve the problem. And it's very important because unfortunately, the walk all the way around is just very, very challenging for a lot of our seniors that live there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And everybody, I think you want to.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You know, I just wanted to make a brief comment. Not to lose sight of the fact that this does keep the big chunk of the cross Alameda Trail through the park on schedule and it keeps the park on schedule.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So those are important things to me and I'd like to move approval of the item.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'll second that. I just want to make. I just made a comment that, you know, this is another exciting project that's coming before us tonight. So I'm very elated to see this and the previous soccer field project. And I look forward also to the discussion regarding the ease about which I had some communication with staff.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I certainly support this Cross Alameda Park project.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. All those in favor of my motion carries unanimously six a introduction of ordinance approving a lease and authorizing the city manager to execute documents necessary to implement the terms of a lease with Pacific Pinball Museum for three years.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'With.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No extension options and an early termination right for both the city and tenant in Building 169 Suite 121 located at 1685 King Street at Alameda Point. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening, mayor and city council members. I believe at the last council meeting you guys consider.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That and sent staff back.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To make some edits to the lease. Those edits were made, the tenant agreed upon them and for the public.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The edit that you requested was.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'A mutual termination. The lease currently.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is a three year term and it's in our enterprise district.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And the council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thought that because.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We are getting.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Some very serious inquiries.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In the enterprise district, it was important for us to preserve some flexibility in the lease. And so we we.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Negotiated and provided for that and the lease before you tonight. I really appreciate that. And that rates mutual was the change, correct? Thank you. That being said.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But just to clear clarify, either party can early termination, correct?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's actual party.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's it's it's it's not mutual. It's not mutual either party. That's right. I think that both parties have a benefit now, whereas in the past there's only one side.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. Okay. That was the correct move. The introduction of this first reading of the ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'A second.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Any other questions or comments? I'm ready. All those in favor. I motion carries unanimously. Thank you very much. Six B public hearing to consider adoption of resolution amending master fee resolution number 121912. Add and revise recreation and park fees.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Who's presenting this? This voltage was earlier, but with the wreck and park fees. There she is. See, we are moving right along this evening.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We always miss you when you're not here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They are going to beat my 9 p.m. estimate.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Hmm.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We're going to be sorry.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Talking rotary in the hallway. Thank you again, Mayor and council. So I'm here tonight to talk about the 2017 recreation and park user fee schedule. We always bring this to you in advance. Normally the rest of the user fee.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Citywide occurred during the budget process. LAPD, Alameda Recreation Park Department's a little bit different because of our summer programing for a July one start date of of our users are user fees would be difficult in the middle of our big summer program.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So what we do is we bring it to you annually around this time and then the start date becomes for all of these fees, we become January 1st and then it gets incorporated into our citywide user fee schedule.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So what we do annually is we put this feast schedule together very intentionally. We compare it to other neighboring and comparable recreation and parks departments in nearby cities. We also take into account similar services offered here in Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we also just take into account the unique aspects of Alameda Recreation and parks and then also balance it with our budget needs and affordability for the community. Some of the challenges that have impacted field rentals and registration fees.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'As you probably know, the state passed a minimum wage that is now increasing annually. And so given that we have about. 150 to 200 part time employees. That certainly impacts our budget. And those part time employees are the ones that are the bulk of our staffing costs, not the bulk necessarily, but they are a significant amount of'",
        "'speaker_1': 'staffing costs because they're the ones that are out in the field with the kids and running our programs around Alameda. What we also try and do. What we do with this is we include both direct costs, which are arts and craft supplies and the balls and everything we do out there for the kids.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The facility costs utilities, the lights. We also include indirect costs such as the administrative staff. And we have our front desk staff that handle all the registrations. We have our account tag that manages all the deposits and all of the invoices.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So all of that gets rolled into these fees. So since I've been here, I've always managed our budget on a cost recovery model. And what I do is I use this pyramid. And to me, this is very important in how we look at our programing and our fees for our programing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And really the approach is that on the bottom of the pyramid, you have the most high community benefit. Those programs that affect the most people, the most at risk people, whether it's seniors that are on a very limited income, whether it's children in different areas.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So those for us are programs like those at Mastic Senior Center, like our Free Parks and playgrounds programs. Now we have our Free Park Baseball League as well that we brought back the old T-shirt league. And I'm particularly proud of those because those are completely free.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And in this day and age, that's extremely, extremely rare in the recreation world, to see a program where kids can literally just swing by their local park and play in a supervised activity for absolutely no charge. So those have the most community benefit and those are ones that there's no cost, there's little to no cost recovery.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In the middle, we have the general individual benefit. Those are, you know, I want to take a yoga class or summer camp classes. Those are programs that people can choose to take if they can afford it. Those things generally pay for themselves.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'On the top, we have the very individual benefit, like choosing to play adult softball or to rent a club for an event. Those are things that actually make money and we use that additional money so they make more than it cost for us to put those things on.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But we use those to offset the high community benefit down at the bottom of the pyramid. So with the goal of getting as close to full cost recovery as is feasible. So the fees that we made changes to for 2017.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You see here before you. They're also in the staff report. The main changes are the field use fee for Alameda resident Alameda organizations, which is 75% more of their roster being Alameda residents. It's going from $2 an hour to $3 an hour.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That is already significantly farm in a way below our any neighboring city. Most of them are 10 to $15, some $25 an hour for their residential use. Our non Alameda League fee is going from $4 an hour to $30 an hour.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And while that does seem like a big leap, we actually in reality, first of all, we wanted to create a significant spread. So that's really prioritized in addition to how we allocate our fields by our allocation policy. We also just wanted to make sure it's focused for Alameda residents and the only organization that was using it was'",
        "'speaker_1': 'not paying quite the right fee structure. So they're fine with it because they were already paying close to this amount. All of our youth program fees are going up 3% to 5%. That includes things like our summer camps or after school programs.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And the the driver of that we debt. We historically increase it 3 to 5% every year or two. And this year the drivers, certainly the minimum wage increase behind that. We also this year now have our brand new, wonderful and still high school swim center.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so with that, we have told the swim teams for a very ample water polo. All of the aquatics teams since even before this began, that as soon as we had a new facility, the fees would go up.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The just our fees are extremely low for aquatics in comparison to other comparable cities where $15 an hour for al meter organizations and our neighboring cities generally are about 45 to $50 an hour. Our justification was always that our facilities were so aging and so deteriorated and were not competitive level size.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So now that we have an Arsenal swim center, which is its competition level size for water polo, for diving, for swimming, it's a beautiful new facility. That fee is going up. It's still significantly less. The neighboring cities, as you could see, about half and the swim teams are all aquatics teams have said they're fine with this and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'they they know they've been preparing for it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We share that with the school district.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The school district is aware of the fee increase as well in the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But where does the money go? Oh, do we share the money? I'm sorry. I did somehow with the school district.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'No. In the which you'll see coming before you soon are the joint use agreement with Alameda Unified School District. The City of Alameda schedules all of the use for both facilities and in return we also keep all of the fees.'"
