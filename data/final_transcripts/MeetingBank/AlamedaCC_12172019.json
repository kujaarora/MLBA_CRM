        "'speaker_10': 'A point I want to give you just a little bit of background, a little bit of context for how long we've been working on this. In 2005 15, the council approved the DDA with the with AP for the site, a project which required AP to construct the Seaplane Lagoon Ferry Terminal and contribute $10 million towards the project'",
        "'speaker_10': 'as part of the site infrastructure. In 2016, city and the city and we approved a ferry terminal plan and an IMO you with veto to provide a framework for funding and operations of the sea plane terminal. At the time the IMO was approved, funds for operation to launch the service were not sufficient.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The parties agreed in the IMO to collaborate and seeking other funding sources to fund an operating subsidy. In 2017, Alameda County Transportation Commission awarded the Ferry Terminal Project at $8.2 million grant and county Measure B funds, bringing the total funds to 18.2 million.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'In September 2018, the city approved an updated ferry terminal plan with updated costs of 22 point million, which was a $4 million increase from the previous budget. And but to close the construction gap the city appropriated just last year.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Last fiscal year, $2 million towards the project. And the Wheat Board approved a $2 million contribution to have a fully funded project. On July 19th of this year, the city entered into a funding, construction and dedication agreement with AP to address the expenditures of funds for all the ferry terminal costs for the completion of the design permitting'",
        "'speaker_10': 'and construction of the ferry terminal project and the dedication of the ferry terminals, landside and waterside improvements, landside improvements to the city and waterside improvements to wider following construction of the terminal. So construction began this year in July and anticipated completion is in spring 2020.'",

        "'speaker_10': 'The midday and evening services at Main Street will continue. The service was initially developed for implementation with the new ALM three funds, which we just talked about with Representative Quanta, which are, as we know, currently unavailable due to the ongoing legal challenges.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But we do have the board agreed to use other funds to operate the service over a three year planning period in the meantime. Just last week we had a board approved the operating agreement and license at their December 12th meeting and we are here today to bring forward that operating requirement.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The purpose of the operating agreement is to define the rights and responsibilities of of WETA and the city in connection with the operation of the Seaplane Lagoon Ferry Terminal. Just a brief summary of some of those rights and responsibilities.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The city's rights is to continue to own the landside area and the waterside area, which is the seaplane lagoon, to maintain and to maintain the landside area. The city will execute a 66 year license to enter and to enter on and access city's submerged real property for a license fee of a dollar per year and will cause'",
        "'speaker_10': 'AP to execute a bill of sale to transfer the ownership of the waterside assets from AP to Wheeler. We just rights and responsibilities are to own and maintain and repair and replace all the waterside improvements, including the float, the gangway and the.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I'm missing something. But all of the waterside components of the of the ferry terminal pay for an additional water, any additional waterside equipment, including any dredging it should it be become necessary and maintain and repair the submerged real property of the sea plain lagoon that it will be going over.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And they also pay all long term capital costs associated with associated with the ferry terminal operations and traveling over the marshlands. Also, what we're asking for your approval tonight is a license agreement. The license agreement is needed by we to to access the submerged lands because the waterside improvements owned by Rita, the float, the gangway and other'",
        "'speaker_10': 'waterside improvements are located in the seaplane lagoon. And vessels must transverse over the sea floor to access the terminal, therefore needing a license to do that. And as I said before, the staff is imposing that a license of 66 years with an annual fee of $1 be effective once the ferry commences service.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So tonight, staff is recommending that the city council authorize the city manager to negotiate and execute the Seaplane Lagoon Ferry Terminal Operating Agreement with the Water Emergency Transportation Authority. And to introduce the license, I'd like to acknowledge board member Jeff Obono here tonight, who was instrumental in working with Rita to get this project in the water, the'",
        "'speaker_10': 'operation agreement passed by the Wheeler Board, and also Kevin Connolly, the planning and development manager who is here tonight. And I just want to express our profound appreciation for their work over these last five years and hope that we can keep moving forward with this project.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you and.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Do we have any clarifying questions? Do we have public speakers on this items? Do we have we have agenda? We have the clarifying questions. Councilmember Odie, just one.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You may have said this, but so it was approved last week. Right? Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I have a couple questions on the operating agreement. I think it is, yeah. Exhibit one, the operating agreement. My apologies. Usually I get my questions to staff ahead of time. I'm not not on top of things apparently today, but excuse me, um, so on the, on the operating agreement, this is page two.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sorry. Um, page two, paragraph two, B to it says this has to do with the landside assets. So parking facilities and this is at Seaplane Lagoon Terminal parking facilities for approximately 400 vehicles, vehicles with the city making reasonable efforts to ensure priority for ferry riders during ferry operation hours.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And my question is, how do we do that?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Good question.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They both smell. It was a good question.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Yeah, good question. And I think it's a good answer. You'll have to figure out how to do that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I'm this Maxwell. You can speak to the microphone.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Please think of city council. Lisa maxwell, assistant city attorney.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Got to get a taller microphone.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Let's put that to wear. Now, that provision was certainly important one to Aida and we discussed it a great deal. And I know that parking is of great concern to them. So we didn't really have an opportunity to flesh that out fully.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we sort of agreed to continue to work on that matter and matter that the city would do its best.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'To to more.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Fully. Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We are currently working on parking management, which the Council's fully aware of. This is one of the priority areas that we are working on in connection with that. And if you go on Main Street, you obviously see parking management's a very important thing with the ferries and we're trying to aim to have probably not paid parking there'",
        "'speaker_6': 'by the time we get to August, which we're hoping the end of August, early September is where I'll go take off, but we'll have the parking available there. That that's our aim.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And I do realize that these things take time, but we've also heard AC Transit say over and over again that they the reason we can't get AC Transit Service to the Main Street Ferry terminal is among other things, because we provide all this free parking.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so at some point we've got to bite the bullet and charge for parking. So just and I think I would have some other councilmembers who would agree with me on that. I also wanted to and again, I apologize for not getting these questions to you ahead of time because I don't like to surprise people.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But here, let. Me lob this softball at here. So this is page five of the operating agreement. And it has to do with this reader's rights and responsibilities. And specifically, this is this is paragraph 60 on page five says that we to sole pay for any watershed equipment, blah, blah, blah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And all dredging activity within the water side area again. And as to the extent determined necessary by weight of her seaplane lagoon ferry terminal operations. My question on the dredging is will we to also be responsible for hauling away and disposing of dredging materials?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That would be part and parcel of the dredging and they don't currently think they need to dredge because it is deep.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But we all hope for the best but plan for the worst. Right? So okay, so when that's part of the responsibility for dredging. Okay, that's good to know. And then the second part was paragraph six E that says we shall maintain and repair any submerged real property within the waterside area only to the extent it is damaged'",
        "'speaker_0': 'or contaminated by Wheater and or Wieters operation of the Seaplane Terminal Ferry Service. And to the extent such repairs are necessary to provide the seaplane terminal ferry service. And my question on that one is what happens when the submerged real property, say, a pier outlives its useful life and must be replaced?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Does that responsibility for replacement become the city's responsibility because it wasn't the result of damage or contamination by Rita?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, are we talking about the waterside assets then related to the ferry terminal service?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This is the specific paragraph, Max. All is maintained in repairing these submerged rail properties. So aren't Piers submerged Piers?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's not.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'No, no. Well, I'm a little confused of the question. I apologize.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. It's probably in my ass. He never again visits you. Well, okay. Just because in other areas of the city we've had, Piers, or at least the posts that hold them up.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The piers are part of the waterside asset, though, so they would be what is responsibility them. Correct. They will own them and they'll take them on the water. The the distinction of the submerged land is that we still own it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The city will still own it. Okay. But I wanted to make sure to capture that anything caused as a result of the activity by Rita would be their responsibility. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So. So we still own the assets. So then the city is responsible for when that pier.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'No, it is that city's the city owns the submerged real estate, but we don't own the actual land. Okay, okay. It's on the water site and the city owns the landside assets improvements.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Okay, clear enough. All right. Thank you. Any other clarifying questions or did I muddy the waters?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Bad pun.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, let's end. Did you say we have public TV? No public speakers. Okay. Council decision discussion motion. Where to begin?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm of approval. We can discuss after if we.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Have a second.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. We have a motion. And again, this is for. Is there any reason we need to break this out? Because we have to do that. This is both authorizing an operating agreement and also introduction of an ordinance approving a license to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We need to break this out for a vote or once. Okay, so we have a device be removed and Councilor Odie seconded. Okay, discussion vote all in favor.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Oh, wait.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You know, you threw your arm out or something. I just want you. City Manager.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah, I just want to thank your member, Doug Bono and all the staff leader. Absolutely. You don't realize how much negotiation and how much this partnership means to the city of Alameda. And I think it's a very valuable relationship.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I just want to thank them for everything they've done in making this even a better relationship with the third term.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I am actually I was remiss in not acknowledging that it I'm I've been to a couple of the we had board meetings to speak in Alameda. We are so fortunate to have the backing of the majority, if not the full Ouija board.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But we have a very strong representative in Mr. Barrio. And by the way, but Mr. Roboto and Mr. Connelly are Alameda residents. But we I mean, we're an island and we do water transit extremely well. It's very important to our residents, and we're thrilled to have our third ferry terminal being built as we speak.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so, yeah, we can't thank you enough for the the support and we're going to make really good use of these new ferries in this new service. So thank you for that reminder. You know, somebody.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'll just be real quick and add on to what everyone else has said, a deal of appreciation. We all I think the mayor, the vice mayor, myself, city manager, Miss Potter, I think there were many other elements that came to them last week at a meeting.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We packed a meeting and they were. Gracious enough to let all of us speak early because some people had to go. So I want to give a shout out of thanks for that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. With that, all in favor. Hi.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hi.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. I didn't hear any. I heard also that the motion passes unanimously. Thank you so much. Okay, we're moving on. Item six B.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Recommendation to consider adoption of a City Council Code of Conduct in Councilmember Handbook and Code of Conduct providing guidelines for Council members to follow and conducting city business and fulfilling their responsibilities as city elected officials.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh, you know, the vice mayor just mentioned that we have a number of public speakers in the audience. Could or do we know, madam? Are they all for item six? Okay. So Council, do you suppose that since we have public speakers for six C would be we could swap the order of B and C.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And make that motion.'"

        "'speaker_0': 'Second. Okay. I have a motion to take item six ahead of six p and it's been seconded. All in favor. Hi, Mr. De. You went away? Yeah, sure. Yeah. Okay, let's make that unanimous. Okay. So with that, we will take item six, the.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Adoption of resolution establishing a privacy policy data management policy and prohibiting the use of face recognition technology.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'And then click it down.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'All right. Good evening, Mayor. As the Ashcraft vice mayor knocks white members of council. My name is Jerry Bowden, assistant city manager. And as with a lot of things that come out of the city manager's office, this is a collaborative effort with the city attorney's office, police department, I.T. department.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I just want to send a quick shout out to Prachi Patel, who is our intern in the office. She did a lot of background research on this effort. So I'll start there this evening. We are talking about about privacy, data management this evening.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And it's going to be a really brief presentation. I'm going to try and highlight a lot of the things that are in the draft resolution covering the policies that are related to how this city manages our residents privacy and the data that's collected as part of our ongoing operations.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The purposes of the materials are really to state the city's commitment to maintaining and building trust by commuting how communicating how the city goes about protecting the integrity of the personal data and ensuring that there's transparency in how we collect the data and how it's used.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So to that end, we do have a resolution with three attachments this evening. They're identified as three topic areas. On this slide, there are exhibits A, B and C with the staff report, and I'll go through them in pretty quick, pretty short order here.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This is the lengthiest that are the one I'll spend the most time on. These are the the framework or the overarching privacy principles that have that emerged as part of this effort. So there's a there's a need to protect the privacy of the of the data that we collect and the individuals who are represented in that data'",
        "'speaker_3': '. As we go about our our service delivery in the community, we realize that privacy is key to the health, safety and welfare, as well as the security of those people who are living, working and visiting our community. So there are seven privacy principles that have been assembled for your consideration this evening, and I'll just touch on them'",
        "'speaker_3': 'with a sentence. There's much more to each of these in the attachment, but I just want to give you a sense or a flavor for each of these, so I'll try and do that as efficiently as possible. The first is design and use of sorry design and use of equitable privacy practices.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This is acknowledging that the community safety and access doesn't have to come at the expense of privacy, and we really want to ensure that we're not discriminating when we collect that information. So that's the first. The second is that we're going to limit collection and retention of personal information.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And this means that we're really only going to collect and store personal information as long as it's justified to serve the purpose for which we've collected it. The third is managing personal information with diligence, and we're really trying to take care of the information that we collected keeping our security and management systems current.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The fourth is extending privacy protections to our relationships with third parties. We do have relationships with other agencies and entities, and so when we're sharing data, we want to do it in a way that's consistent with the principles that we're talking about here, but also making sure that we're disclosing that information unless we aren't allowed to do'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that by law with the people that we've collected the information from the fifth item is the fifth principle that we've assembled here is safeguarding individual privacy and public records disclosures, Public Records Act requires. And so to open government needs, we have to make sure that we're in compliance with the law when it comes to these areas.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But we also want to do that while we're maintaining individual privacy interests. The sixth item is being transparent and open. We do want to make sure that the community knows why we're collecting the data, how we're using the information.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And to that end, we want to ensure that we're including easy to understand language on our website and with our forms. And then the last principle that we'll touch on here is to be accountable to Alameda residents. If there's a need for surveillance technology, we want to make sure that we have that conversation publicly and we review'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and discuss those requests so I can move a little a little faster from here. One of the central reasons we're talking about these principles and the data management aspects of this report is because data has become just a key asset for the kind of work that everyone sharing when we're trying to provide good service and when it'",
        "'speaker_3': 'comes to our services, programs and projects, we want to make sure that we're being efficient and convenient, but also transparent. So we are we have assembled a data management policy as well with this resolution. It's intended to really talk about how we're storing, managing and using the data.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm going to just jump down here. So we're talking a little bit about the. Policy, including several examples and types of information that the city collects and how it's collected. We do that through websites, application forms, paper or electronic phone messages.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We like every other organization in this day and age. We're collecting a lot of data over the course of the day. So we really want to make sure that where we're talking to as we're as we're doing this work, we're telling people that the policy doesn't apply to data and information collected for public safety as well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We want to make sure that that's clear in this policy, those individualized and serious nature of the kind of work that happens when you're whether you're responding to an emergency or whether it's part of an investigation. There's really a variety of personal information that may be collected in those instances, and those are covered by separate policies.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we can talk about those this evening as well, but that's not part of what we're discussing this evening. And the final topic this evening is face recognition technology. This is an area that continues to grow. There's growing concern regarding the privacy and equity because individuals who are having their face scanned may not even know that that's'",
        "'speaker_3': 'happening. And so the policy attached as Exhibit C makes it clear that there is a prohibition that we're recommending this evening that no staff shall obtain, retain access or use facial recognition technology or that information that might be obtained from that kind of technology.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And there are a series of exceptions to this. Again, coming back to public safety and criminal investigations, also things like our our cell phones that have face recognition technology that help us just access our our technology easier. Those are those are exempt.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So with that, staff is recommending that council adopt a resolution establishing a privacy policy, a data management policy, and prohibiting the use of face recognition technology. And that concludes staff's presentation this evening. And we're happy to answer any questions you might have.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Burton. Do we have any clarifying questions before we hear from our Public Speakers Council?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So let me.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Desai.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes. So are you saying that the facial recognition policy would allow for police use of facial recognition, or is it precluded?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'No. So what we're saying is that face recognition technology would not be something that the city of Alameda would be would be using ourselves. But if face recognition technology was used as part of a criminal investigation by another agency and it was part of and it came into our investigative process that would that would be a loophole'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that could be explored. It wouldn't be something that we would seek out or in any way pursue. It's just something that because of because of the nature of investigations and the fact that it's not illegal, it might be something that would happen outside of Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So let me ask the question. So suppose there is a video of someone doing some kind of crime at an ATM? We don't know the person, but we have the person's face. Are you saying that we can't then take that face and subject it to some kind of facial recognition system?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The city of Alameda would not do that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. Okay. I'll ask questions later. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Any other clarifying questions? Okay. Let's go to our public speakers. How many are.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There? We have six.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So with six, you can have up to six at 3 minutes. Hello.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The first one is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Also.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'For Salah al-Bakri and then Tim Kingston and then Brian Hoffer.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Good day. Good evening. Thank you for having us here. My name is Talal Bacterium, the executive director of Support Life Foundation, an organization that is focused on social justice and economic justice. We're here in Oakland. I'm also a member of the Northern California Islamic Council, which is an umbrella organization to over 128 Muslim organizations in the bay'",
        "'speaker_6': '. And I'm here to speak in support of a complete facial recognition ban. It's time I remember watching the movie for Tom Cruise and 2003. What was it?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Never report. That was it. I think was Minority Report.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Minority Minority Report. And I had an attorney with me at the time and I, I said, I don't think this is for our future. I really think this is close by. And he said, no, no. I said, I shouldn't worry about it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'He said, No, you should, because privacy in California is a right, but only if you defend it. For me as an activist, this is something that's really terrifying. I am appearing in many different protests around the bay here.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I speak up my mind as publicly. Last thing I want is for somebody to have my profile wherever I go. Not that we're already profiled as as members of my community. I have seen a very large reduction of people accepting posts at mosques as executive committee.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'In other words, this mosque will have, as part of their resolution of the charter that they have to elect their members. Nobody wants to serve on a board because of the extra surveillance that the Muslim community is feeling that they're living as a minority.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'For me, as somebody who really believes strongly in the values of democracy, I think it's very detrimental to democracy when we take away the factor of privacy at large. Who would run for office if he thinks that that thing that he did when he was a teenager is recorded on a server?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'God knows where and when that will and it will be used against him if he runs for a campaign. Imagine how many great candidates we would be losing if this technology is allowed to prevail. The hardware is everywhere.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We have cameras everywhere. We have plate readers everywhere. All we need is to switch on the software. If that happens, imagine the repercussions we have on ourselves as a society. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And our next.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Speaker, Tim Kingston and Brian Hofer, then Matt Cagle.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hello.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Hi. My name is Tim Kingston, and I'm a member of the San Francisco Public Defenders Racial Justice Committee. And I'm here to speak in favor of an ordinance, not a policy, to ban the use of facial recognition technology and regulate the use the acquisition of new surveillance equipment on the island.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I strongly urge the Alameda City Council to cast a vote in favor of privacy, civil rights and the rule of law. Berkeley, Oakland and San Francisco have all banned facial recognition technology without any ill effect. Emeryville is considering it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Meanwhile, a number of other cities, including Davis, Palo Alto, the BART System, Santa Clara County, have all put in place surveillance technology, acquisition ordinances without any problems or any lawsuits. Bans on facial recognition, facial recognition technology and push backs against overly aggressive surveillance technology are almost becoming mainstream.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's been raised in Congress. This should be an ordinance. It's timely and it's necessary, even if there are going to be a challenge to Almeida's ordinance as opposed to a policy, there is not the danger of any financial distrust on the part of the city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'From what I understand, I'm going to speak specifically to facial recognition technology and its constitutional dangers. As a public defender investigator, I'm all too familiar with the problems that can ensue when a few overzealous officers cross the line with the new technology and then have to be reined in by the courts.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Simply put, it's unconstitutional. It's a violation of the first the fourth and Fifth Amendment. It violates the First Amendment because it offers a very real possibility of chilling free speech. All but the most determined people will be think twice about going out on a public demonstration.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'If they know they're going to be surveilled, it will reduce public in public debate. And this is also particularly true of people of color due to the way that Africans, Latinos and other people of color tend to be targeted by law enforcement.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's highlights California's constitutional right to privacy and the Fourth Amendment. Supreme Court Justice Roberts declared, A person does not surrender all Fourth Amendment protection by venturing into the public sphere. To the contrary, one seeks to preserve as private.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Even an area accessible to the public may well be constitutionally protected. This is true of cell phones. It's absolutely true of your face. Finally, facial recognition violates the Fifth Amendment. Probably self-evidently, if facial recognition technology is used to ID someone against a database without a warrant, that's person's very face is the thing that gets them arrested.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'A US district court recently overruled police who forced someone to open their iPhone their iPhone 11 with their face. iPhone 11, lots of people have them. They're open by facial recognition technology.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Kingston. Our next speaker, Brian Hoffert.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Then Matt Cagle, then go ahead. And Mohammad Mohamud.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Good evening, honorable mayor and city council members. My name is Brian Hofer. I'm the executive.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Director of Secure Justice. I'm here in support of the three proposals in.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Item 16 and ask that you support each one in a following manner that you adopt the.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Privacy principles as written. Tonight, resolution is fine with us that you direct the staff to return with an ordinance for the non law enforcement data management practices piece in that you direct the staff to return with an ACLU model ordinance following San Francisco's ground breaking lead, which is a separate exhibit in your agenda pack here that would'",
        "'speaker_5': 'govern surveillance equipment and contain the facial recognition ban. I want to discuss a little bit as chair of the City of Oakland's Privacy Commission, I have a pretty privileged front row seat. Earlier this year, our Commission adopted a set of principles crafted by the UC Berkeley Law Samuelson Clinic.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I believe supervising attorney Megan Graham is back there. I want to recognize her. That's the basis for the language that's in your agenda. Packet We were really appreciative of their work. The mass slaughter during the Holocaust rarely relied on law enforcement.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Data is generated by Census Bureau's here in America. When we put the Japanese in camps, it was census and tax record data. So these other two pieces are absolutely critical as we move into the era of smart cities, more data mining, it's going to be critical.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We all know it's not a matter of if a data breach is going to occur, but when. So we're really excited you're going down this road. I do want to thank Councilmember Vella for helping us start this conversation about a year or so ago and then at the time, Councilmember Ashcraft, for meeting with us, along with Chief'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Law Larry and others to begin discussing. In this ACLU style ordinance, there's now seven in place in the Bay Area. Six have been adopted by unanimous vote. San Francisco has a 10 to 1. Across the country, there's 13 of these that are law and a whole bunch more in the works.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So it's safe to say that this is the new norm. This is the way things should happen at the local level. As I pledged a year ago and just sat down with the chief and basically pledged to my first born son, we're here at your disposal.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We've got.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It. He accepts.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'He did. He said he wasn't his name. We have any policy template you're going to need at this point. Santa Clara County, you know, they're very wealthy, very rich. They have over 77 policies. We have excluded an awful lot of items since them since their ordinance was passed.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I anticipate you'll have maybe 5 to 6 policies. We've worked with similarly sized cities like Davis and Berkeley. They have 4 to 5 policies. The administrative concerns we can get you to a comfort level if you do direct staff to return, you know, February, whatever we're looking at.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We'll start setting up meetings, will work with you guys, work with the staff to get you to that happy spot. If these ideas do mean something that they do need to be an ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Hood, for next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Matt Cagle, then Gordon Mahmoud and then Mark Knapp, Muntari Mohammed.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Good evening. My name is Matt Cagle and I'm an attorney with the ACLU of Northern California. Thanks for having me here tonight. I've met with many of you before and the chief as well. And we're happy to see this policy finally come before the city council.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We urge the city council to stand up for the civil rights and civil liberties of Alameda residents by moving forward with an ordinance that ensures the public and the city council and stakeholders within the city have a voice in decisions about surveillance and are at the table when these technologies are proposed so the community isn't caught off'",
        "'speaker_5': 'guard. So we aren't caught off guard by a vendor who seeks to make money off of residents information. These are controversies that Alameda has seen before and could avoid with this kind of ordinance. Importantly, this ordinance, as Mr. Hofer and others said, also draws a line in the sand when it comes to facial recognition technology and its'",
        "'speaker_5': 'use against the public. This is a technology that threatens not just our right to go down the street, that basic freedom we all enjoy without being tracked or the right to go to a political protest with without having your name logged in a database.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It also implicates your right to not be treated as a suspect by having your face logged in a database of individuals who can be tracked at a later date. This measure, taken together the two parts, the ordinance or excuse me, the oversight measure and the facial recognition ban, really make sure that the democratic process applies to something'",
        "'speaker_5': 'that by definition operates in secret surveillance. And it makes sure that the community won't be caught off guard by profit seeking vendors and that rights won't be violated in this really important era. This ordinance is common sense. It's straight forward.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'As others have said, more than half a dozen Bay Area communities have adopted it. Over a dozen American communities have adopted it, and it's proven workable. The ACLU is happy to be a resource if there are questions about how to draft something like this, since this is based on a concept and a model that the ACLU has'",
        "'speaker_5': 'drafted previously. And finally, we do want to emphasize that it is important that this be adopted as an ordinance. The public stakeholders and the Council are they you deserve and we deserve and they deserve the assurance that this is enforceable law and that it will be complied with by everyone.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And that's, I think, the intent of all the city actors. And so it makes sense to adopt it as an ordinance. Finally, I want to separately put in a plug for the privacy principles, which were drafted by some great students at the Berkeley Law School and that have been adopted as resolution, I believe, in Oakland and versions'",
        "'speaker_5': 'of this have been adopted in other cities in the Bay Area as well. We consulted with the students on that and they are really great set of principles. Please don't hesitate to contact me or the ACLU if you have questions going forward and we urge you to adopt the facial recognition ban and the oversight ordinance and to'",
        "'speaker_5': 'approve these principles.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'We received an additional speaker slip, so now we have seven.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So now that there is more than six, your time goes down to 2 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Want our next speaker yet?'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening. It's a pleasure to see all of you and to thank you for your service. Thank you for serving our community. I know there's a lot of family members that are missing you right now, and you do this on our behalf.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I come here as a father, as a son, as a father, a husband, and just your average community member. My hands are in a lot of things, but I come here for that little girl right there. She has a future to feel enfranchised in this country.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'So I quit my job and I got another job. And the next thing I know, I have the FBI at my door and my mother in law said what you just did. And I said, I did nothing, Mama.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I'm from Ethiopia and I'm an immigrant. I have a large family. And I always tell them, September 11th is a day I had to make a decision. Do I believe in the principles of freedom, fair play values, that to feel that your neighbor is your neighbor and your brother or not?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I had to make a decision. That decision said, no, I will not stand for this. I went straight to that FBI office and I told them who I was and what I am. And when I sat there with them in that white room like a scene out of a television class, I mean, you know, so I'",
        "'speaker_3': 'was like, wow, you have everything. Elementary school, junior high, high school, college, where I live, what I eat. I think we have to draw the line. And I think you guys need to think about we need to think about 50 years from now or 30 years from now.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next, we hear.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mark Monitor Mohammed and then Samina Usman.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Samina here.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Good evening. Thank you so much for the opportunity. I'm here to call for an ordinance to prohibit the use of facial recognition technology because it's unreliable, it's biased, and it's threat to the basic rights and safety. While proponents of this technology might come and tell you that this technology is really good, it helps to discover like genetic'",
        "'speaker_6': 'disorders or improve the consumer are consumers in the banking and retail industry, or they can say that it helped to improve the security check in the airport. However, it's still pose a serious threat to human rights and fundamental freedom.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This type of technology has proven to be performing very poorly in the people with people with darker skins notes and also on women it has. So it's broking, it's unfair and it's it's very biased. So with this type of technology will lose the freedom of expression, freedom of social assembly and association.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we're not calling to regulate this type of technology. We want to ban this type of technology. Thank you so much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And did you say Samina Yasmeen? Yes. Is she here? Oh, she's coming. Okay. I would say I know her and I don't see her in the room. Well, I'm. We're waiting for Mrs. Mind. She's in this parking lot.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Um, does counsel want to say anything? Or we could just sit here. I think you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Have a question.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'A question, Councilmember Desai.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'QUESTION Would does the facial recognition policy cover the use of video data captured by body cams?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'No. We actually have separate public safety related policy related to body cam footage. And our current body cam contract does not use facial recognition. And our chief is here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'At Community for Larry. Madeleine. We'll let Mrs. Mann catch your breath. Speak slowly.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Chief of police. So our body worn cameras do not accent is our vendor. And as a company policy they do not even offer facial recognition technology. So we don't we don't have that. Now, there's some confusion. Sometimes people talk about facial shaping versus matching.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So the cameras that we have, if you think about your cell phones, if you take a picture and it frames up someone's face, it has that technology because now when we do redactions, the cameras say, oh, there's a face that we need to maybe blur or redact, but there's no there's no matching, there's no identification, none of'",
        "'speaker_5': 'that. It's not even offered as part of the technology.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'One more question.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, Counsel, can somebody say for me.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay, when we're talking about facial recognition technology, are we mainly or mostly talking about algorithm based technology that in addition to capturing in real time an abundance of data with regard to facial recognition, but also through an algorithm, are able to match in real time or later on.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So it's really not only facial recognition technology, but an alt with an algorithm component.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah. The policy's not specific to that level of detail, but the definition of facial recognition technology means an automated or semi-automated process that assists in identifying or verifying an individual based on an individual's face. And so whether that's software based or what, and whether it's live or in real time or post or at a future date, it'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it's it's not specific to that. The idea is just that you can recognize faces and identify them through the technology that's available. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I believe that our next speaker is now prepared. If that's the case. Please come up. Greetings.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hello. Apologies for running a little late. Gotta put the get the kids fed.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so I really appreciate your patience and waiting for me. So, again, my name is Timmy and it was one of the government relations coordinator for the Council on American-Islamic Relations. As you may or may not know, the Muslim community is, uh.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Has definitely faced and faced the brunt of surveillance.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Um, you know.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Communities are, have always been concerned about if they go.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'To mosques, you know, are they're being, you know, spied on. Is there, you know, any agent provocateurs? We do have.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Proof of these things now.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Where the city might come into. What we're concerned is now we have like the New York Police Department, we have evidence that they had been spying on the Muslim community.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Obviously, we don't see anything like that in the city of Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We're so happy that the city of Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Has made concerted efforts to embrace the diversity and.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Inclusiveness and making sure that everybody feels safe in this community.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so that being said, to extend that also to ensure that if any surveillance technology is acquired by police.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Departments or by the city, we want to make sure that the community feels safe knowing that this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Surveillance technology is not going to be misused against them, that there is a use policy in place, that we have.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Transparency in the acquisition of such surveillance technology, that we have also accountability, if, you know, it comes out that it has been misused.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I'm.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Really appreciative of the city of Alameda considering.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This type of an ordinance, because we want to make sure that all of our community is safe and that that there is that because we want to.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You know, again, make sure that that communities feel safe with their law enforcement and know that they're not going to be using such technology, misusing it against the community members. So, again, I thank you very much for considering this.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And if you have any questions, feel free to ask. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Okay. Is that our last? Yeah. Okay. So we'll close public comment at this time. Thanks, everyone, for speaking. Okay, come in. We'll start with Councilmember Vella.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So as Mr. Hofer mentioned a couple of years ago, when I was first on council, first elected on to council, I brought a referral specifically asking that we adopt an ordinance relative to our data collection and management. So I'm glad that this is back before us.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Where I'm at is I am beyond just having a policy. I would like it to be a hard and fast ordinance, and that was part of why I did the referral. I'm just going to throw it out there.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I think it's a little bit ironic that we're having a conversation about privacy after there were city staff, and this is obviously in the interim. First, I brought this referral and since then I've been secretly recorded by city by city staff and that recording has been released.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I find it ironic that we're talking about the value of privacy, but nevertheless, we're here. I do believe in the right to privacy. I believe in the Constitution. I think that we have to look at the propensity for the abuse of various types of technology, specifically targeting people, especially with the development of smart cities and the'",
        "'speaker_9': 'development of additional types of technology. You can now digitally record people on your cellular telephones. That's what our former city manager did. You can record people using video on your cellular telephone. All of these sorts of things are available and how we how we communicate with the public.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We have people that email us, text us. We're kind of all starting to become data hoarders. And so I think that having a data management policy is is very important, not policy, but an ordinance. And I think that that needs to be in place as an ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It'll help us kind of go through I don't want to just hold on to data to have it where it can be used against people. And I, you know, coming from a Japanese-American family, I kind of would I completely understand how information has been used.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Information collected by the government that seemed innocuous enough at the time was then literally used to round people up. And I don't want to contribute to the. In terms of the privacy policy principles, I have no problem adopting that in terms of the facial recognition.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I would like that as an ordinance. I really think that it's important. Again, for the same reasons that I feel about the data management. I think that we need to have legally enforceable safeguards. I think that, you know, while there might be things in place now that we're not using them nefariously or that vendors aren't using things'",
        "'speaker_9': 'nefariously, I think we've we've found that sometimes things can evolve, vendor's policies can evolve. I don't want to be caught in a situation where a vendor decides to change their policy and somehow we don't have something in place that would trigger an automatic process.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I think that that's what an ordinance does. And I think that I don't ever want citizens to feel like they can't participate, that they would somehow not be able to engage with or speak with the city, assemble somewhere publicly, because we don't have the protections in place.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I think the time is now and I think that as technology evolves, it just allows us to have a very public conversation that makes our decision making very transparent, but also thoughtful so that we're we're actually taking steps that we intend to take rather than somehow getting sucked into some sort of corporate ploy that's being put out'",
        "'speaker_9': 'there on us.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Vella, for a point of clarification, because I don't want the public confused and I'm a little confused myself. We just heard a reference to a secret recording made on a cell phone by a former city manager.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm not aware of anything in the policies that we're that are before us now, that cover cell phone recording. If it's there, I would ask the city attorney or the assistant city manager to help me find out where it is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And beyond that, and this goes back to a grand jury report that we will be in part discussing in our next agenda item. There was a finding by the district attorney that that wasn't an illegal recording under the circumstances.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So it wasn't the finding. The finding was that there wasn't enough evidence for her to convict.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I think that the grand jury, you know, we can I'm going to ask this.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Raise it because we're talking about privacy. And I my point is, is that technology can be used in a number of different ways.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I just want to make sure that we're discussing things that are actually appropriately before the council and this particular agenda item. But can the city attorney help me out here? Does this policy in any way refer to telephone recordings made on a cell phone and with specificity to the examples that was given?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I'll look to my colleague for some assistance, certainly on facial recognition, there's an exemption on cell phone use. On data retention, the that the data retention policy does contain some information about phone calls, though not specifically referring to cell phone recordings as that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Did I get it right, Mr. Brody?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah. The only thing I would say that Exhibit B relates to data collection, and it does talk about the collection of different kinds of data from the public to assist in conducting city operations. So I it is not it's not related to any kind of taping of meetings per say, but it is the data collection that we'",
        "'speaker_3': 'any data collection that staff would undertake would be covered by that portion of the policy. And it is clear that we want to be transparent in the collection of the information that we're we're bringing in to the Organization for City Business.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But it doesn't refer to a particular penal code section that allows for surreptitious recording under certain circumstances.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There's no mention of. Thank you. Kinds of audio recordings.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Further comments, Councilman Brody.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So have a couple questions, too. So I appreciate everyone coming out and speaking on this issue, and I appreciate Councilmember Vela for putting this referral on our agenda a while back. You know, it was refreshing to hear people refer to the Constitution.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think it's always good to be reminded of what's supposed to be our bedrock principle. So just some hypotheticals, because I'm trying to figure out how this might work in real life. I, I think we are encouraging folks to, like, provide their ring video coverage, if I'm not mistaken.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Right? So, I mean, that that's voluntary, but they're giving it to the city. I mean, what happens to something like that or, you know. That is that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is a question for the police.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'For anyone that should have an answer.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I mean, that would be under the data. But I think the law enforcement is exempt and correct.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's I would I would follow city manager Levitt's lead on that. The police department for investigative purposes are not subject to all of these policies. But that doesn't mean that there aren't policies that are, aren't there? There are policies in place on the public safety side to address surveillance video related to the investigation of a crime.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I think I heard someone say earlier, our police wouldn't be allowed to use facial recognition software. So they are those videos exempt from facial recognition or the fact that they came from a private individual who shared it with the city?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I mean, I don't know what the interplay there is. So I can come back to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Actually, if I might, assistant city manager can. I would like some clarification. I do believe there's a difference between a camera that's taking a photograph or a video and facial recognition software. Do you want to address that or to the ring?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, the question was the use of that video for facial recognition. I mean, I'm not as concerned about the data.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But that I hear you say.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Microphone.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Chief, that. I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Get a taller microphone.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You know, two weeks ago, we had it up on a block. I remember.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That. Yeah. Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Um, I'm just going to kind of hunch forward. There we go. So I just. I just wanted to make sure that I understood. Are you under the impression that we're somehow requiring or have some agreements with people about sharing?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Because we don't.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Know the question? That's what I was asking for the clarification. I think there has been a small amount of encouragement, but my real question is what happens to that? I mean, because I think I heard an answer to Councilmember de Sox question.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We would not use any data that we have like ATM videos, I think was the example and send it out for facial recognition. Would we send out, you know, video that we receive through these ring services?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah. So if if we got a home video, a ring nest, whatever, private company, we would just be using it for the investigation of the crime. So a porch thief or something like that. I hit and run collision, you know, some crime that was committed in public or maybe inside of a residence that was captured on a'",
        "'speaker_5': 'camera to help. But we don't there's no facial recognition component to those videos. Right. And so we're just it's a video of hypothetically, you doing something, you know.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I wouldn't, but. Okay, not you. Someone could if something happened, some other.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Random some other some other random person stealing a package off of a porch. And then we still have to go figure out who that person is. We don't. We don't there's no technology that's telling us. That's John Q Citizen.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I get that. But would we be sending this out to a vendor that offers that service? Because I thought I got the answer of no earlier. Not the way that the policy is set up is that the city would not initiate that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But to follow through on Councilmember Desai's example, if these are bandits robbing banks across the state and the FBI is involved and they use facial recognition technology, then that that could help our investigation. We would leverage that as a resource, but it wouldn't be something that the city of Alameda would be paying for or seeking the assistance'",
        "'speaker_3': 'of directly. Okay. The way the policy is written currently and another hypothetical, I know there was a discussion about speed cameras and I know for the red light cameras, they take a picture of the driver and that's compared.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I mean, would we be using any of that type of data to do that type of work, or is that allowed or prohibited or just we don't have them, but if we were.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So my my understanding of how those cameras are used in the cities that do deploy them, it's it's basically it's the tiebreaker between, you know, the system saying you ran a red light. And then I said, well, I wasn't driving my car.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then they show me a photograph and they say, that's you. And so you get the ticket versus if the mayor was driving my car, then I'd have an argument. I don't mean to keep criminalizing everybody or just if I make eye contact with you, you're a suspect.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm just kidding.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But in that hypothetical, we wouldn't send that picture out and have somebody identify who the real driver was. Right.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'No. I mean, again, because we don't have it. I don't I'm not sure how the other cities do it, but I believe all it is is to establish whether or not you. The person being issued the citation was, in fact, the driver not trying to figure out who it actually was.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Then another hypothetical that I don't think this is a police one, but say, for instance, we have a public transit agency that wants to recognize people when they get on a bus or maybe a ferry or whatever. I mean, would that would they be allowed to do that in Alameda under this policy or.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I know it's kind of a stretch, but we didn't think we'd have this at the airport either. 20 years ago, our policy would not limit outside agencies from implementing these kinds of technologies on their. On their vehicles or within things that they operate.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. And then the last question. Can you tell us practically. Maybe this is for our senior staff the difference between a policy versus an ordinance as far as how it can be changed or discarded or that type of thing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So Councilmember de um Councilmember Judy, I will answer that question with respect to the difference between a policy and an ordinance. An ordinance have the effect of law. What could occur under the Council has a number of choices.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'When you adopt an ordinance, you could, for example, provide for enforcement mechanisms, whether civil or criminal. You could also provide for and in fact, by adopting a law and it's generally provided that there may be opportunities for private enforcement of an ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So in other words, when there is a violation of an ordinance, there is opportunity for private parties to bring litigation, whereas if it is a policy, then you're still adopting a resolution. So staff would not be able to alter it without bringing it back to the council.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But it does not have some of the enforcement mechanisms, both on the law enforcement side and on the litigation side that exists in an ordinance. And there are, you know, benefits and concerns with both that I'm happy to go into further, if you'd like.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You don't think so? Thank you all for answering the questions. I would be inclined to agree with my colleague, Mr. Miller, and push for an ordinance. I'm happy passing this policy today, but I do think the folks who spoke today and many others like them deserve the protection of law and not just policy.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember, decide how to go down the line if you're ready.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Oh, sure.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well, I appreciate the answers to my questions. I believe what we're fundamentally talking about, whether we're talking about automated or semi-automated facial recognition technology or, as I put it, an algorithm based face on tech, a facial recognition technology.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'What we're not talking about are things like body cams or even ATM videos that capture events or activities, and that can be interpreted in a non automated fashion, i.e. in a fashion involving typical police reviewing of the of the of the information that was captured through the body cam or through the through ATMs, if in the event'",
        "'speaker_8': 'that there's some kind of crime that occurs around an ATM. So so I appreciate hearing that, that this policy doesn't preclude our police from using technology in a reasonable manner to to help secure public safety. I think the questions that many here and outside of Alameda have raised about facial recognition technology are are absolutely important for every'",
        "'speaker_8': 'city to deal with, not just because of the events that you see happening in, you know, far away Hong Kong and China, where rioters are being videotaped to see who they are, recognition technology being used. It could happen here in the United States.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But I, I do think that we have a policy in place that is reasonable in its reach in terms of safeguarding the variety of constitutional rights of of Americans and immigrant residents. And so I'm satisfied with the policy.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I mean, I was coming into tonight, I was not sure if I was going to support this or not. But I think that the questioning that have been raised have been very helpful. So with that, I'm willing to support this policy.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think the suggestions that I would make, though, is I think facial recognition technology is very intertwined with questions regarding First Amendment rights, not only our ability to speak, uh, whatever we want to say, but also the part of the First Amendment that has to do with a freedom of assembly.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Um, so somehow I believe that the sentence. On on exhibit C, facial recognition. Facial recognition technology means an automated or semi-automated process that assists in identifying or verifying an individual based on an individual's face. I think that sentence is a good start, but there ought to be, in my opinion, some kind of reference to the storing of'",
        "'speaker_8': 'the information and also the way in which the information is sometimes used to curtail many of our constitutional rights, especially those in the first First Amendment, particularly freedom of assembly. So but I'm fine as it is now, but but I kind of think that this whole conversation is really about the use of technology in rapidly capturing data'",
        "'speaker_8': 'and and kind of connecting that data with through the algorithms or the automated process, connecting that data with other databases that in real time can possibly make mistakes with regard to individuals at certain locations, but not in not in real time, begin to track individuals and their and their whereabouts.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I think that in my opinion that that those two elements, the tracking, the gathering of data and and the use of that data to curtail some amendment first constitutional amendment rights ought to be somehow referenced in that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But but I'm fine with it as it is. But at some point in time, we ought to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor. That's right.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sure. Thank you very much. I also want to thank the speakers, many of whom I've spoken to multiple times over the last many months, some of them even internationally. Thank you for your care and taking the time to to help educate me, but also help support Alameda in moving this forward.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know, for me, I think we have the right policies. I'm 100% supportive of moving this not as a policy, but as an ordinance and asking for it to come back very quickly. You know, we've spent a lot of time talking about the facial recognition ban.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm 100% supportive of that. I also want to I'm hopeful that as we move this forward, we have well, while not a proposed policy right now, we do have for our consideration the acquisition of surveillance technology, which I think Councilmember De Sugg was starting to get too, which is a the way in which we can both inform'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the community about what we are considering to purchase and use and how it will be used and at the same time provide a method of ensuring that our public safety departments have the ability to to access appropriate technology, that that brings that public safety.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I would hope that that would also be a part of any motion that goes forward, is bringing back a surveillance ordinance. You know, I think on the face, facial recognition, the constitutional issues, I just think, yeah, yeah, that's very important.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Also important is the fact that it doesn't work. African-Americans are 5 to 10 times more likely to be misidentified. Whether or not we get into what that means when when some people interact with public safety in some areas and the outcomes of those interactions, you know, people have a right to not be harassed just because somebody, you'",
        "'speaker_2': 'know, a bunch of white coders forgot that there were other non-male white people in this world that they needed to make sure their software worked for. And, you know, we shouldn't even be having it. Luckily, it doesn't sound like it's going to be too much of a stretch here to ban facial recognition.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But but but the technology is not even close to being ready for discussion. And so I would expect or hope very much to have that surveillance ordinance as it comes back, if we approve one, to include the facial recognition ban.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I also just want to acknowledge the city attorney, Shen, and the city manager who I know are still, you know, may have some questions or concerns about the ordinance. And so, you know, and moving forward, I hope we can also provide some direction that would allow them to at least identify areas of concern that they might have'",
        "'speaker_2': 'from the city's perspective that they could bring back alternatives to if there are sections of the ordinance that they might propose this policy or whatever else. I'm not saying that I would like to break it apart, but at least so that we can have that conversation and moving forward to me.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'These principles, these policies, all three of these policies or two policies, the privacy policy and the surveillance policy with the facial recognition ban, basically start creating the trust. Pew Pew just did a study of people's trust of government and people's trust of government as it relates to using information and storing their information, whatever else, and government's faith'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that somewhere around 17% feel good about it. We have lost the trust of folks because they don't know what we're doing with their information, etc.. And I think that these policies are the first step towards rebuilding that trust.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And and why not? So anyway, I'm ready to make a motion, but I know you haven't spoken.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'd like to hear from Councilman Ravello as you finish. You started your comments. Okay. So I will just add that first, I want to thank our assistant city manager, Jerry Bowden, for bringing this very thorough report to us.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. He hasn't even been on board very long, but he took the ball and ran with it on this one. I concur with the vice mayor that if and when this policy, assuming it's approved tonight, I think it's going to be if it comes back to the council to consider as an ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I do want to hear from the police department. I appreciate that, Mr. Hofer. And for as long as I've known him, he's always been amenable to meeting with a public safety. As his missus, mine, we've. We've all met together.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And the ACLU attorney and you all make this a better informed discussion. And of course, we always balance competing interests. And I will just throw in I'm an Arab-American. And so these issues are near and dear to my heart, too, because I you know, I know people from from the countries that my grandparents came from have have'",
        "'speaker_0': 'gone through a lot in the aftermath of 911. And and we don't want that for anyone. I mean, when we say in Alameda, there's a banner behind you that says everyone belongs here, we don't have an asterisk that says, you know, some people belong here more than others.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We mean everyone belongs here. But we also consider a lot of different aspects of what it means to be a safe community. And I know we will have early next year, I think, a discussion on the license plate readers that the police department would like to to have.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And they are not the roving ones that the New York City Police Department misused by surveilling gatherings outside mosques in that city. But but anyway, that's a discussion to to to be had. And certainly this council has gotten lots of emails from residents who are concerned with rising crime rates and would like better abilities to to capture'",
        "'speaker_0': 'some of the folks who have committed some fairly serious crimes and then left the island. But, you know, so we we need to consider all these different interests. I don't think they're mutually exclusive. So with that, I'm happy to entertain a motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We're being asked to consider adopting a resolution and if we want to add some direction to staff. And I think the vice mayor also mentioned that this is probably if we do direction to staff, it's something that we want to hear back from the city attorney and the city manager on.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So you started to make a motion, I think Vice Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I believe Councilmember Bella might have a motion she wants to make.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Please. What's up?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So what I'm hearing that several of us or at least are in agreement with would be to do it. Well, I'll make my motion that we can discuss it. I would like to pass everything listed tonight as policies, because I do want to have something in place in the interim.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But I would also move. So I move approval of the policies as written, but I would also move to direct staff to come back to us with facial recognition ban ordinance and with data manage management and privacy oversight ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so that's my motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, a second. Okay. We've had a motion in a second so we can have discussion.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I would also like to add that there there are examples of both of those ordinances out there. So I would like staff to look at some of the cities and I think my referral a few years ago included what the City of Davis passed.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'San Francisco has a couple examples. So I would like to kind of start there rather than kind of draft something completely novel. And then I think we've heard from a couple of my colleagues who would like to hear back about any city concerns, that sort of thing, and how that would weigh.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And I'm sorry. Tell me again, it was a direct set to come back to us with, um, facial recognition band ordinance and data management policy, data management.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I think data oversight or data management. Privacy oversight or something like that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Um, a discussion. Councilman Brody, thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Just real briefly, I think there was an offer that the ACLU has model ordinances that I think might be helpful. And there's no reason to reinvent the wheel on this. Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Staff can consider all this, I'm sure. Did you ever hear that? Yeah, I do. Vice mayor? That's right.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I wanted I wanted to ask a quick question, and then. And I have a couple comments. Would you with the motion maker and seconder, include adopting the principles tonight, which wasn't a part of the motion, and also.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Policies which I will amend to include the principles. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then also a direct direction to adopt a surveillance ordinance modeled on the San Francisco model to something I'm interested is that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Um.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think I would yeah, I would like to give staff direction to consider those, but I'm not directing them to that. That's the one that uses your model. I mean, I, I think that there may be some differences between Alameda and San Francisco.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I guess my question is, to the person who made the motion, would you be willing to add the surveillance, you know, using it based on I'm not saying like verbatim, just find a find and replace Alameda in San Francisco.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But you used to use as a as it's the one that is out there.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And it is based on the ACLU, if.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It is my character.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'A member of design.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Of of what you're saying. If I said what my interpretation of what you're saying is, strongly consider using San Francisco as a model. Then then I'm fine with that. Doesn't mean that we have to, but we have to strongly consider it.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That sounds good to me.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Second in your motion. Oh, great. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Are we ready to vote?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Can I just want to make one more quick? I believe that. I believe everything that is in here actually has come from the privacy groups as well. So, yeah, there was a comment about about not starting from scratch, but I would actually say that that to my to my understanding, to the comments we've heard, we have the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right policies written as here. We just need to convert them directly to ordinance. So I think we're I just wanted to reflect that that the direction isn't necessarily to go back and read. That was that's not what I heard.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. With that all in favor, I oppose, abstain and the motion passes unanimously. Thank you, everyone. Okay, now we go back to item six B.'",

You could continue with the existing practice, which is simply comply with the Brown Act and do nothing else.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The Council could decide to adopt a policy that only applies either. Or to itself or to boards and commissions or both.

        "'speaker_0': 'And we and I will say that the policy that staff came up with, I mean, it certainly referenced its various citations of where certain policies were found. But I don't know, I just like Sunnyvale is kind of plain spoken, common sense language.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So with that, I'd like to hear from my colleagues. Am I right? Councilmember Odie.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sure. I'll chime in. So I usually look at the agenda with a cursory review and then after I let it percolate, I look at it in more detail. So in between those two days, we received that email from League of Cities and that's where are and I saw at the bottom it was adopting a code of conduct'",
        "'speaker_3': '. So I was like, Sounds interesting. I'll click on it. And sure enough, there was the article that popped up, I think it was from Western Cities magazine and it talked about, you know, how councils should you know, this is basically our rules and how we want to work together.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Work together with the public, work together with the people we serve, work together with our staff, and, you know, talk about how it's good to have a workshop to develop these type of codes of conduct. And, you know, then there was I couldn't find them just now, but there were links.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then Sunnyvale was one of the links and then the others. And I thought it was a very comprehensive code of conduct. I mean, we have a, you know, ignoring how we got here. This is a great opportunity, I think, for us to kind of show people, you know, what we stand for, what our ethics are and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'what our values are. And, you know, I think what you guys put forth was a good start. But, you know, I think with some input from the council and if, you know, I like city mayors a lot, I mean, it covered things that were missing, you know, like boards and commissions and our interactions and the mayor being'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the point of contact for press because, you know, that's what our charter says, that he or she is the is the official head of the city. So I think I mean, I could go into more detail if if we're going to have a more detailed discussion.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I thought there were a lot of things that that covered, you know, like there are some elected officials that weren't covered by the proposed policy. And I think all elected officials should be covered by by this policy.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I don't even know if it's something we could require. As you sign, I guess you you can sign it when you take an oath, but, you know, sign it to file. I don't know if that's something we could add as a as a requirement, but, you know, it would be something that I mean, at the end'",
        "'speaker_3': 'of it, there was that thing you signed about your, you know, what you were going to promise to do. And I. I can't say I have any complaints about this council, but I think in the past those type of rules and somebody was signing it or not signing it would have made my first term a lot more'",
        "'speaker_3': 'comfortable. So not so sure. So, again, if we want to give more direction to go back and draft, I mean, I'm happy to have that discussion. But, you know, at a high level, that's my initial reaction on the social media.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Wow. That was interesting. I mean, the first thing I did was Google and see Brownback's social media and it sounds like it's covered. So I'm just curious, see what everyone else thinks before I chime in on that one, because I could see where, you know, the mayor and I may have a discussion on something and we've picked'",
        "'speaker_3': 'each other, has a Brownback person, and then we read Councilmember de Saag feels that way on social media. And then all of a sudden, you know, we know how three people think and maybe, you know, I don't know.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Do we not read it? Just it's just very interesting. So I want to hear what others have to say. I just use that as a hypothetical.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You weren't driving the chief's car.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Or anyone's package.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, thank you. Can somebody who's next? Councilmember Vela.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Um, so I like Sonny Vaile's code of ethics and conduct. I like that it includes. One change that I would like to have is that it says that it's for the members of the city council and the city's boards and commissions.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We have more than just the city council's elected officials. So I just want to make sure that whatever handbook we pass is for all elected and appointed officials in the city of Alameda, and that would include our city auditor and city treasurer.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I think that we should all be held to the exact same standard when it comes to code of conduct and ethics. And I think just keeping it general to all elected and appointed officials will have us covered in the event that there's any changes in our charter moving forward.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So another thing is, I think that we've had a lot of presentations recently and a lot of laws on kind of safe workplace environments, workplace harassment, that sort of thing. I like that. The Sunnyvale policy includes elected and appointed official interaction with staff.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I think that this is something that we can do to bolster the classes and the training that we've had surrounding safe work environments. I think that our staff are working with not just the council but with all of our boards and commissions.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I think sometimes there can be differing opinions. What I really like about this Sunnyvale handbook is that it's really about providing a safe place for dialog so that people can have an open conversation but done in a respectful manner.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I think that's really the heart of what they're trying to get at, and I want to make sure that that's something that we we strive for and protect, because I think it's very important. I think sometimes in the heat of advocacy, sometimes that can be lost.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I want to make sure that our staff are also understand that and our boards and commission members understand that they're to behave appropriately with staff as well. And those interactions. The other thing that and I don't know if it would belong in the handbook or somewhere else, but I know we lack a fraternization policy as a'",
        "'speaker_9': 'city. I know that we have kind of we generally adhere to sexual harassment in the workplace policies, but I don't think we have a fraternization policy or a policy on a situation where, you know, there could be a previous relationship and how that could impact people that move department to department or up for promotions, that sort of'",
        "'speaker_9': 'thing. And that was something that I think is is lacking. Or also, if there's a Border Commission member that I just I want to make sure that when we're doing this, that would be something that we also look to include perhaps in this.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I did speak with a council member from the city of Sunnyvale, and she informed me that that they adopt this it's on their consent every single year. So it's not just when there's a new council, it's every single year and they do it on their consent calendar.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And they also let all of their board and commission members know that it's on the agenda. And if especially if there's any changes and they do try to update it regularly to comply with law. And so I think those are things that this is a living document.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That we may need to adopt and amend over time. And so, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then I saw the vice spirited.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I want to thank staff for for four for all of their work I think. Yeah I two when you sent the Senate fail example it answered some questions because I think we have two different handbooks and the Senate bill is much more about kind of ethics and behavior in the the, the, the, the original one was'",
        "'speaker_2': 'a little bit more of how we run the city and whatnot. I think that there are a couple of things that I that we might they don't really believe belong in the code of ethics and conduct. But I think that there are some longstanding issues and questions that have come up over and over again related to agenda'",
        "'speaker_2': 'setting and some things like that that were in the Alameda version that may not belong in the Sunnyvale version, but we should find a place to clarify that because since I was on the Transportation Commission in 2001 to that issue of is it the chair of the board and the commission or the staff or is it the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'council? And, you know, who who who is the final decider? I think it just could use that clarification. Other than that, I would be ready to, you know, with staff's input, but adopt something almost word for word in the Sunnyvale one with with Councilmember Vela's expansion to yes all elected officials that we can cover on the social'",
        "'speaker_2': 'media policy. You know I like the idea of having something in the in the in the book that basically reminds everyone of the Brown Act potential violations. It's not a Brown Act violation of you and Councilmember Vela. Do talk and then you read something.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Tony has Tony could write to the paper and talk to all you know and all of us can read it. That's not a Brown Act violation. It's when you're engaging in actual conversation. So if you if all three of you ended up in the same thread, that's where it gets dicey.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Just I just want to clarify. Clarify? Yeah, I.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm sorry. I'm an American.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I may I? Okay. Your Councilor Brody Green ification.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The thing that struck me was reading articles like if three people press like then that's kind of an expression of, of support. So that's where I got. Wow. So I don't know.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No, no, no.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I suppose emerges.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I will say the clicking like one was the one that jumped out at me like you know, because I'm like they just click like to say thank you, right etc.. So I will definitely in the future be more careful about that because I do not look at who's like everything, you know, especially in there, 65 people.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm not going to scroll through that, but I do think that we can trust each other also, or we should start off by trusting each other to look through the comments before we join. There was a conversation the end of last week that I went and I'm like, Oh, I had something I was going to say.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then I quickly went through and there was the mayor commenting and there was Councilmember Vela comedy. And so I stepped back, you know, and I wasn't thinking Brown act at that point. I just thought like, I don't need to add my voice as well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's, it's, it's but, you know, rather than I, I also I talked with staff earlier. I would be a little nervous as a saying. We can't comment on social media because I don't think it should be required. The people comment.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I will tell you that I think if this if everybody on the dais goes silent on social media, what's the impact in the community is going to be? They don't respond. They aren't, you know, because because at some point or another, all of us have commented on something that that was important to them.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And they wanted to know that people were thinking about it and whatever else. And so I think we just need to I think it would be good to have something that reminds us and, you know, adopted every year.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But that that that we should be very mindful of not having three people in the same thread. But I would be a little leery of, of voting to outright say no social media commenting at all. And I think we should also, you know, we're all grown adults, I think is becoming a problem.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We should we should then at our next not tomorrow, but at our next workshop, we can maybe set aside 45 minutes to talk about it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Before I go to Councilmember decided you want to say something else?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Councilmember Vela Yeah, I just on the social media policy, I think sometimes also we click like just to say we hear you like we've we've heard you. Thank you for voicing this. We'll we'll do something about it. I think what we all need to be careful.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I know we all want to be responsive and it's difficult. I, I think my my fear is also that we we censor ourselves too much, which I think is what the vice mayor's fear is, where we are no longer being responsive or engaging in a dialog on something that is not actually a matter coming before the council'",
        "'speaker_9': 'and therefore in Brown Act issue.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you Councilmember so.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well thank you. I think the reason why we're having this discussion about the code of conduct really boils down to the part of the draft that has to do with section policy implementing charter review Section seven dash the.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Which among other things, has to do with inquiries made by council members of the city manager of administrative tasks. But it also has to do in the last sentence of seven das three. It also has to do with prohibitions on council members in in involving themselves.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And this is we have to understand this specific word involving themselves in the appointment of persons to particular jobs within City Hall. So in my opinion, whatever code of conduct that we have, it needs to speak to that particular the last aspect of 7-3, because there really are two or maybe even three elements to seven, dash three'",
        "'speaker_8': 'one, as I had indicated. First has to do with any queries made about, you know, made of administrative duties that are rightfully belonging to the city manager. But the second part has to do with the appointment intervening or involving themselves in the appointment of individuals with regard to the code of conduct and the appointment of individuals by'",
        "'speaker_8': 'the city manager and the possible intervention of city council members in that job appointing process. The one thing that I would recommend is that that council members, in no specific instance, never look at council members, never specifically, uh, inquire about or specifically advocate for particularly particular individuals or sets of individuals or particular who are named.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'They can talk about, inquire about jobs and the type of characteristic the city manager is interested in or the type of characteristics that they are interested in seeing. But as a code of conduct, I believe we need to speak to the prohibition on pursuing, and it can enable even the phrase, the word inquiring can even apply here'",
        "'speaker_8': 'inquiring about particularly named individuals or even sets of individuals for appointments. And remember that 7-3 isn't is when it comes to the job. It's about appointments of individuals to positions. And I think I need to say that because it's altogether possible that council members might be concerned about a current department head and might want to raise some'",
        "'speaker_8': 'questions in their private one on ones with a city manager about the the performance of of department heads. That is not an instance of a council member involving herself or himself in the appointment process. The appointment process, in my mind, refers to when there is a position open and the prohibition when it comes to the conduct should'",
        "'speaker_8': 'simply be a sentence or two that prohibits the inquiring about or any kind of verb about specific named individuals or sets of individuals for appointments to city positions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. So I'm just going back to the executive summary of this staff report that reminds us why we have this item before us to begin with. And it says that the city council agreeing with recommendations from the Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think that's Alameda County civil grand jury directed staff to return with a draft council member code of conduct slash handbook in order to provide additional guidance for Council members in the conduct of the city's business in fulfilling the duties of their public office.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that's what we have before us to consider. I also agree with Councilmember Odie, who said I believe when he started his comments that regardless of how we got here, this is a great opportunity and I happen to agree with that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think that this current council and all future councils are only better equipped, better prepared to do this job by having a clear set of guidelines. And and the clearer and the more readable, the better. I also agree, though, with the vice mayor that the Sunnyvale handbook, I think is great, but it also lacks some of the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'specific references to our charter and things that I think are important. And so I would hope that when we send this back to staff for further work, that we can meld the Sunnyvale Guidelines Handbook with the with some of the pertinent parts of the proposal that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'City our city staff came up with. I also. O The one thing you can omit from the Sunnyvale Handbook are the quotes. I do not know why and who. Maybe the city librarian or something chose those. But no, let's just, you know, stick to the basics.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The social media policy. I do think something needs to be said. I mean, we can't pretend that we aren't here in almost 2020. And there just are some things I don't you know, we we have First Amendment rights, but we also have responsibilities to adhere to the Brown Act.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So good to have those reminders. And I think as as Councilmember Otis said, this is is a great opportunity. And it also just clarifies what we're doing. I mean, this really is a noble endeavor and it should be treated as such.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I also think it's it's exceptionally important in today's world, especially in our country, looking to Washington, D.C., I think we can show that at the local level, we can communicate with civility and respect. We don't all agree all the time, but we can still have a good, productive discussion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so sometimes we need to be reminded of that. And I think, you know, we've got some really good material to work with here. So, Councilor, ready? So your hand up. Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah, I just wanted to add. Whoops, I just flipped over. I mean, if you look at the Sunnyvale, I mean, it devotes like two pages to an analysis of member questions, inquiries to staff. So I think there's a a good base there to address a lot of the concerns my colleague brought up.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And, you know, there's actually a set in a paragraph which I think could be expanded on based on some things that are specific to Alameda, but do not get involved in administrative functions. And it spells out elected and appointed officials must not attempt to influence city staff on the making of appointments, awarding of contracts, seeking of consultants'",
        "'speaker_3': 'or selecting of consultants, processing of development applications, or granting city licenses or permits. And again, that that's probably a good start. I mean, if it needs to be expanded on, you know, I think we should we should expand on it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But, you know, it's a good start. The topic that came out that did concern me when I did read, uh, the original draft is, you know, I think there needs to be some guidance around what is allowed and not allowed as far as people that aren't are our direct reports because I really don't want to get in'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the business of disciplining or evaluating anybody. That's not our director party. So I don't know what the answer is. So I'm counting on on our staff to kind of bring that back. It's a fine line between saying, you know, I wish somebody had done this better versus saying, you know, something that councilmember days have brought up.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I mean, I'm not sure that's appropriate thing for for a council member to get involved in. You know, maybe I'm wrong and maybe people disagree with me. But, you know, to me, it should be limited to boom, boom, boom.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Right. One, two, three.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Referencing our direct.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Reports. Right. Yeah. Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The question.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is my night, deposition, desire.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Nonverbal communication.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So, I mean, so basically that's why I like this because instead of, you know, a sentence in a charter, it's two pages of analysis on what an inquiry is. And if we want to expand on that, I'm sure there are other other charters or other codes that have that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But, you know, that's what I like about it because it was pretty clear and. Okay, yeah, things that I don't know if we thought of. So that that's kind of my comment on that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I would just say that I do think there should be specific reference to Alameda City Charter in and that may be just a melding of two areas. Back to you, Councilman.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then there's.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The last sentence of that said The Sunnyvale charter contains information about prohibition of interference. So, I mean, you can easily just plop our section in there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Councilmember Avella So I was just going to say the Sunnyvale policy includes, I think, what is really lacking, which is an interpretation of our charter. I think it's great that we have a charter, but I think part of the issue that we've been asked, but part of what we've been tasked at doing is is actually interpreting the'",
        "'speaker_9': 'charter in terms of how it's applied. And I think referencing our charter section as Sunnyvale has done would be helpful. But I do think our charter says very specifically and it uses the word I think Councilmember de SAC didn't, I think he maybe interchanged the words, but it says that that neither the council should the council should'",
        "'speaker_9': 'not interfere with the execution by the city manager of his powers or duties, except for the purpose of inquiry. And that's where the the Sunnyvale language defining what an inquiry is is helpful because our our charter lacks that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And then it says an attempt by the council member to influence and I think, again, outlining and defining what we mean by influence would be helpful in the making of an appointment. But part of the city manager's listed duties includes the appointment, discipline and removal of all officers employees of the city under his jurisdiction.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I think, again, there's that fine line. I don't I think that's been pretty clear and pretty clearly drawn. So I think there's an I and I've looked I also looked at the Sunnyvale Charter. Its language is very similar to ours.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I think to the mayor's point of referencing and inciting back should be pretty easy to do, especially if we compare our charter with their charter.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'One thing I really liked about the Sunnyvale Handbook is it had a little glossary section. Not even section was like half of a page, but pertinent phrases.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Were.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Spelled out, okay, are we ready for some?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Do one more quick things. And I also thought that, you know, it had a really well thought out progressive, I guess sanctions is the word they use. So there was actually some guidelines in case there was an issue.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we had an instance before where, you know, somebody had asked for a police officer to be disciplined based on an interaction with that member's family. So I want to make sure that doesn't happen. So, I mean, to me to me, that's a violation of the charter, if anything is so I want to make sure that, you'",
        "'speaker_3': 'know, we make sure that that's especially pointed out.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So is the direction. If I'm understanding council the direction is we like the Sunnyvale language minus the quotes and but we want to incorporate the the specified aspects the areas where the Alameda the draft Alameda handbook went more specifically into charter a reading of meetings some just some things that Sunnyvale didn't I think I think we really'",
        "'speaker_0': 'can combine both of them for the best of all worlds and zation policy. Um you know.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This is a code of conduct for the city council, um, and other electeds, I think an appointed, um, you know, I, I think that one may merit a little further discussion. I don't recall seeing that in the Sunnyvale Handbook.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So at this point, unless someone feels awfully strongly. Barrett. I think maybe we get this done. And I.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Understand. Is there a separate policy? I just.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, it's not before us in anything that was provided council or vice mayor. And that's why I think.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, I guess the first question is, are we going to make a motion to do something or are we just going to send staff off with a general sense of the council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Going back to the the staff report? So. Well, it's and I think the city manager even said this in the beginning that he doesn't necessarily expect us to to come up with a record or that to adopt somebody tonight.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But the recommendation is that we adopted as drafted or adopt a truly proposed social media. And then, you know, we got the Sunnyvale language, I think, after the staff report was drafted. So but the city mayor and city attorney, Mr. Chen, can you tell us, what do you think is preferable?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Should this council make a motion or is staff direction sufficient or something else?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's you know, we're always happy to take your motion, especially if it means that you would give us specificity so that we can go back and do our work better. But my colleague, the city manager, may have a different thought on this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We definitely want to get your feedback one way or another so that when we bring something back to you that's consistent with your thinking.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mr. Levitt, your thoughts?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm good with either. Either way, I've been writing down different elements. It sounds like Sunnyvale is sort of the baseline. And then you have some specifics out of Alameda that you want to do. So if the better direction we get, better, we are.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But I'm I'm good with either.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Vice mayor next.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Page. So I'll just try to make a motion which would be to give direction to staff to return to the council with, with a code of ethics that is very much based on the Sunnyvale document. I did not as I didn't hear a lot of significant changes that needed to be had.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And given that you've made the list, I'll say consider adding or where the appropriate place to provide the additional items, agenda setting, fraternization, etc. that may not belong in the ethics, but that, you know, I think you could come back and talk about how the city is going to address that issue or would propose to address that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'issue if it's not the right place. So then I was trying to figure out where it goes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right. But this is fraternization among council members and board and commission members because that's what this handbook is addressing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And elected and I think we.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Could be staff, etc.. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This. So just so I'm clear, this is a city council code of conduct in council member handbook.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Right. I understand. So I guess I'm saying there's an interest. It does overlay with city of elected officials and appointed officials. The fact I would say we should expand it to the staff for consideration and we're just asking staff to consider it and come back with what the recommendation might be.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I respectfully disagree. I don't think that it is the City Council's place to implement policies for the staff, especially in this item before us. That is a city council handbook, but I'll defer to the city attorney.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so maybe I think we can we heard the council's concerns and the city manager and I will work together to bring back whatever is appropriate. And it may not be an item, it may be some of the format, but we'll we'll come back to you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I'll finish making my motion because I didn't get there. So it would include that direction for that consideration, but it would also include the direction to include social media language that does not prohibit but does highlight the Brown Act considerations.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What did you excuse me just for clarification based where did you say we are directing them to bring back a fraternization policy for a staff sitter?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Whether they should come back with a fraternization policy.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Whether that's appropriate.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And where where it would go. It's not I didn't they were not directing and put it in here. And there might be a fraternization. They may say we already have it covered. They may say that we think that this is a good idea.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We'll bring it back as a policy. But yeah, yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But referring to city staff when we're talking about a city council handbook.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Referring to elected and appointed officials, but also broadening it to include city staff. Yes. I hear you don't like the broad name, but but I haven't heard that that this is an inappropriate, minor amendment to the direction that everybody should play by the same rules.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so if we're considering it for elected and appointed officials, we might as well also just included a B on that. So I think I think, you know, the city manager and I think understand that there's some interest in the council for us to bring in this information back and we'll just bring the information back to you'",
        "'speaker_2': 'at whatever appropriate form that will be excellent.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I could live with that. Okay. We have a motion. Do we have a second?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I mean, I'll second it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. We have a in discussion. Councilmember Daza.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes. I will support the motion. Only because I think it's important for us to have language come back to us where we can make a decision, yay or nay, howsoever we want. The thing that I'm going to look for, though, is language that is specific to the code of conduct regarding interference in the appointment process.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Because if we leave it vague, then the code of conduct is going to be as vague as the charter that were last. So many people are saying is vague, which I do not believe the charter is vague. The vague is quite clear.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The charter is quite clear. So but I think it's more important than just to have the conversation just started so that we can make a decision. One last point. So in terms of department heads, the city council does have a role with department heads in the charter.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So it's the city council that determines the offices of the departments and that the city manager then fills those offices. But it's the city council who determines the offices of the departments. And we can make we can change the composition howsoever we want.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So there is a review process and it's charter item two, dash three, take a look at it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I just want to make sure that whatever we're doing is in the spirit and in keeping with the recommendations of the civil grand jury. That is the reason we're considering this today. So and I understand that the city attorney and city manager are also cognizant of that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And, you know, this civil grand jury was not concerned with fraternization among staff or whatever. But I trust our our city staff to come back to us with an informed product. So we've had a motion, we've had a second all in favor.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Oh, I was going to add one more comment, but.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Think we've had a lot of comments. One last one. And, you know, we are going back into closed session. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Just a drafting request that we don't have to cut and paste like parts of our charter and sunshine urns. We can just incorporate them by reference. That would be a preference of mine.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Are we ready to vote? Let's do it. All in favor. I oppose. Abstain. Motion passes unanimously. Thank you, everyone. Okay. We are moving on to item seven City Manager Communications.'"

    "Consider Adopting a Resolution Supporting the Alameda Unified School Districts (AUSD) Alameda Teacher/Staff Retention Measure or Alternatively, Direct Staff to Agendize a Resolution Supporting the Measure. (Vice Mayor Knox White/Councilmember Oddie)": [
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So then we have a council referral. Matters placed on the agenda by council member. And this one is, uh, I think Councilmember Odie and Vice Mayor Knox White and I would just say don't feel compelled to do a full blown report because I have it on good authority that a lot of us are already.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You can go.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. I was going to say as a member of the campaign committee, I have I have copies of the the list. And I was going to make the argument that to keep it short, our schools are very important not just to the students who go to them, but to the community that we have.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We have known through many, many parcel taxes that almeida's teachers are some of the lowest, almost the lowest paid teachers in the entire county. And every single time we pass a parcel tax, we say once we pass this, we then need to figure that out.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, this is the time. And I would just respectfully ask my council colleagues to adopt a resolution supporting it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'During the meeting.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'll just thank you, Madam Mayor. I will just echo that. And, you know, to save staff time, we will actually John wrote the resolution. I wrote the staff or the staff report. We put together a resolution that we thought you all might be able to be supportive of.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And just to add that, I met the school board president, Mia Bonta, for coffee recently, and I told her that she certainly had my support and endorsement, but I couldn't do so as mayor until the entire council voted on it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Uh.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think this is a no brainer and it is, I think it's well thought out. It's a seven year term and they've got their polling behind it. And yeah, we need to attract and retain new teachers as our long time teachers.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Are.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Retiring.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So you want to make the motion?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sure. I'll make a motion that the city council adopted a resolution supporting Alameda Unified School District's Alameda Teacher Staff Retention Measure period. All in a second and it's been seconded by Councilmember Vela all in favor I oppose have say no and I will note that two of us on the dais sitting next to each other are the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'products of Alameda Public Schools. And we get along even though rejects and hornets but that they were all schools you know we support our schools and they're good. That's great. Okay, let's go quickly through Council Communications. Councilmember Vella, can we start with you.'"
