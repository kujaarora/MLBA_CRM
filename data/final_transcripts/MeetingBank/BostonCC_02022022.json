        "'speaker_0': 'Not to mention that the places that we're buying, all our recycling in China or India are now no longer buying any, any of that. So all the things that we've heard about recycling being, we never really made that much money with it, but it was at least cost neutral.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Now that cost is being on added on top of our of our waste contract. I think the last I think last year not sure we're just throwing it out there. We spend about a 250 million on our contracts for shipping costs, for our for our trash and our recycling.'",

At times, people have been given 24 hours from notification to confirm if they are able to submit an application for an available unit. This is not. There is no centralized mechanism to assess how many prospective tenants are on the waitlist for individual developments subject to the IDP program across the'",

I look forward to continuing the conversation and working to ensure affirmative marketing principles are not only in practice for the initial lease up of new developments, but for the releasing of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'existing units to be accessible, comprehensive, efficient and without barriers to participation. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, counsel. Bright and. Would anyone else like to speak on this matter? The chair recognizes Counsel Bach.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you so much. Mr. President, I just want to thank Counselor Reed in recruiting me in this and her advocacy on this and just say, you know, I think that we we always want to be thinking about folks who are looking for housing are in a very difficult situation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think the more difficult we make it to get over those hurdles and kind of have to look in a million places, the harder it is just in terms of the tax on people's mental energy and time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think as counselor has elucidated, we still don't have the kind of centralization of these opportunities that we'd really like to see. I think that, you know, the BPA and the DMV and now mayor's office of Housing folks have done a lot to improve Metro list and make it more searchable.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And there's a lot of people are supporting this behind the scenes. But at the same time, I still think that a family's experience, especially if you're finding these real estate units that are the ones that are they're listed right at the start can often be quite arduous.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so thinking about, you know, as a council, we want to see every one of these units occupied with the lowest vacancy, both in the initial lease up and later. At least that's possible because this is such a precious valued resource to like for everyone in the city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then another thing that I'm interested in exploring in this hearing is we've heard a little bit about the challenges that when folks like when something positive, they get a promotion and they start to make slightly more than the speed limit.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we have in my district a resident who actually came out of homelessness, out of shelter, got a voucher, got an IDP unit, then got a job, has earned more and more, and now is in a strange situation where if she earns a little bit more, suddenly her rent in this market building jumps up by like $3,000'",
        "'speaker_2': ', which is completely untenable for her family. So making sure that we as a city don't set up these cliff effects in our own programs. This is something that we criticize federal programs for when they have those little backs.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So just looking forward to to lifting the lid and talking about program improvements here, recognizing there's a lot of great people at city who are working on this. So thank you, Counselor Braden, for letting me co-sponsor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, counsel. Would anyone else like to speak on this matter? I do see Councilor make his hand up. Councilman here. Would you like to speak on this matter?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Just add my name as a sponsor. I just want to make sure that I get called on the next.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Please add counsel. His name. Would anyone else like to add their name, please? Councilman Murphy. Please let counsel of Bake of Counsel of Clarity. Counsel of Royal Counsel.

        "'speaker_0': 'Suspend the rules.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah. This is just a simple a tax amendment we have. This is at the request of the administration. And we're just trying to codify an administrative technical language here. So we're hoping that we can it's a simple fix and a change.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I'm just hoping that we can we consider it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I second that motion to reconsider. I think. I think we're out of water here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I mean, in Robert's rules, I think we're out of water. I think it's Berardi. Sorry, Mr. President. Can I speak on this for a bit? The chair. The chair recognizes Councilor Baker. I think we're out of order here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I don't think it's going to hurt us to vote on that next week. Simple changes. Simple changes. We don't know what simple changes are. I don't think there should be a problem with slimness exactly the way we did it and vote on it next week.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, counsel. Just an opinion. Thank you, counsel. Mr.. Mr. Clarke. Yes. Are you able to to weigh in whether we should do a roll call vote or whether this should be held off for next week?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, because the meeting is still active and it's the docket is still in play. It can be reconsidered. A motion can be made to be reconsidered. And it was seconded. So, Counsel Baker, because we're still in the meeting, we can actually do this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Clarke. Mr. Clarke, can we do a roll call vote, please?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, Mr. President. Before you called a vote, can you take further comment?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. Go ahead, counsel. We'll do it briefly. Go ahead, Counselor. To the floor. Just.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah, I would just say briefly. I mean, I. I very much expect to support this change, but I would just say that I think it's it is a material change in the sense that it involves it involves adding paid staff.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So to me, this wouldn't I mean, because obviously that's not a city budget implications, etc.. It's not quite at the level of a technical change like, oh, we put a comma in the wrong place. So my inclination would just be to want communication from the administration about it, which I don't think we've received.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I would tend that Councilor Baker's direction of thinking that while this is something that we could do speedily it, we shouldn't necessarily do it so speedily as to suspend and pass. So I just would say, I think I'm going to be voting against the reconsideration motion.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you, counsel. Mr. Carr, can we take a roll call? Vote, please. Mr. President, the council planning here at my end raises the curious. I just want to have the docket number. And what is the technical change?'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Counselor. President Flynn, I'm having technical difficulties. I'm in two streams. Right now, my internet is down. Give me a quick second. But we did submit this. The changes that that we've made are already submitted. We submitted it through the Council.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So if you can look through your packet. Councilor Flaherty, the details are there. Look, just give me a second because I'm operating two screens here and I have my Internet is a bit.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But Mr. Clark, could we take a five minute recess and just give everybody an opportunity to take a look at it?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And Carrie, if my Internet goes down again, I'm going to be in the waiting room. So if you could look out for me so you can let me back in, please.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'On. Stand by. No problem.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, we'll be in a brief recess for 5 minutes.'",

Yes. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you to counsel me here. Joe, do we have any idea what the fund and executive director is that is that also $50,000 similar to the other'",

        "'speaker_2': 'So I don't know if you can hear me, but this is up to the discretion of the administration council. Clarity.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Very good. So there's. So that's something we're gonna have a hearing about. Is that something we're trying to suspend and pass? I think we need to get some more information in terms of who this executive with the executive director position consist of, how much we're going to pay them, etc..'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's those are important financial responsibilities as this Council has a fiduciary responsibility to the resident and the taxpayer. I'm just not comfortable suspending and passing that or taking steps to language without any more specifics. Again, thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you to the maker for responding. Thank you, Counsel. Clarity. Let let me go back. Councilman here made a motion to reconsider. It is properly before us now, as we were, just as we discussed. Does anybody object to this?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If any? If anyone objects to this, we will refer this matter. So government ops.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I just want to. Excuse me, Mr. President. You know, I. I don't think we've ever decided how much an executive director makes. And when I when we when have we done this, we've never utilized salaries. So I just want to push for a motion, as is presented, and allow my colleagues to vote, as I requested earlier'",
        "'speaker_2': '. And let's see what happens, and we could take it from there. President Flynn That's what I am advocating on behalf of.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And Constable.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I need a point of clarification here. I'm a little confused. Mr. Carr, can you give us for clearance? I'm. I understand that a motion is properly before us in it was second. And if anyone is not in agreement, it would get referred to government or government.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, there is a motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In order to assemble the rules, we need unanimous consent.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, there is a motion in play offered by a council making a motion to reconsider. It was seconded by Councilor Arroyo, so it's probably before the body and there was a motion to reconsider docket 240. So the day, the next step we had discussion.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Then it would be to vote on the motion to reconsider.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But Mr. Clarke, can we just clarify, is the motion to reconsider, does it then trigger another vote to suspend and pass? What I think is Councilor Flynn is alluding to has to be unanimous multi-step vote or is the motion there also the S&P.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There would be another vote to to pass it today? Yes. I don't think it has to be unanimous as long as a majority votes for.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It, if it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Were passed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But Mr. Clarke, it's a newly filed docket, so wouldn't it require suspension and passage to pass in its first meeting and therefore unanimous consent?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I believe that. I believe that. That's correct. If there's no objection to the.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right counsel, I guess because it's a new docket. You.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah, I would just counsel like I'm sorry to disagree on this. I just think that the I don't think the the difference of a week, for instance, will affect us being able to get the commission up and running.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think that the practice of the council voting suspension and passage on something that has financial implications without without any prior conversation about it, where we sort of end up doing the hearing in the meeting like this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's not a great precedent for the council. So I think in that context, I would object procedurally to this. So I just think you come back to that feedback. I just want to note for the record that I have been on this council for the last two years, that I have seen how we have finagled and move'",
        "'speaker_2': 'things around in order of convenience on certain things. But I do appreciate this feedback. I do appreciate the point of order, and I do appreciate your advocacy in regard to this. But I will be making note of how we do business and and take the feedback as as as presented.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank thank you, councilman. Here. Thank you, counsel board for the. For the follow up as.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Life becomes more and more, who has his hand up?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The chair recognizes Counselor Arroyo. Thank you, Mr. President. It does seem very obvious that someone will object to the suspended pass, which will probably send this to committee. But what. What I will just say is that we've done this with grants.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We've done this with grants that number into the millions of dollars in the past. And so there's obviously precedent for this. But obviously, this is a body. This body has rules. And we will follow those rules as they're presented, I think, as a body.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I appreciate everybody's concern. I appreciate the way that this has gone. But I will just say it's not foreign to us to make decisions that have financial implications for the body or for the city with a suspended pass.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In fact, we've done it often. Thank you, Councilor Royall, for that follow up as well, Mr. Clarke. So we have the obviously the motion is properly before us. It was second. The next step would be, is there anyone that objects, I believe, to this?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think we take a vote, don't we?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have to take a vote on the motion.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. So I am calling on an order for a hearing to address changes to the memorandum of agreement, the way that the vaccine mandate has created. Whereas, I understand that the COVID 19 vaccine will not prevent transmission, but it has effectively shown to prevent severe disease for those who contract COVID 19.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I encourage all Boston residents and employees to be vaccinated against COVID 19. And as a former Boston public school teacher and union member for over 24 years and daughter of proud union family, I know how important strong unions are to the quality of life for all Bostonians.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Testing, contact tracing and social distancing have been effective tools to contain the spread of COVID 19. Vaccination and testing is crucial to our safety. The mandate for COVID 19 vaccination is requiring a condition of work that is not in the contract.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All workers, I believe, have the right to a safe workplace and also have a right to have their voices heard through collective bargaining. Any changes that are made to the MLA should have the opportunity to be collectively bargain before any changes to work conditions go into place.'",

That we have representatives from the mayor's office, executive director from the Public Health Commission, and representatives from all of the municipal bargaining units and from the restaurant industry industry come to the hearing to testify.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Okay. Thank you, Miss. Thank you, Mr. President. And thank you, Counsel Murphy, for bringing this to the forefront here. The Be Together initiative. I see two major issues with the be the beach gatherer initiative. I mean, we're working off a two year old emergency declaration.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That was that was an extension in April 2020. I would argue that the city of Boston and the the. The situation with coal, that has drastically changed. We've gone through numerous variants. There's been no discussion with the Public Health Board.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If you look in the minutes of the Public Health Board, there was no discussion about this. These mandates, the vaccine mandate and also the passport mandate is out of the Be Together initiative. Multiple cities and towns that were at the press conference that that showed enthusiastic support of this when they went back to their cities and towns'",
        "'speaker_0': 'and actually brought it into a process meeting in a board of selectmen, city council or health boards. They numerous were voted down. Somerville's Somerville's Board of Health. Brian Green actually said that would not have any effect on decreasing transmission that's that's from Somerville in this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So so process transparency I have a major issue with here this seems like these these major changes are being implemented not only to our workforce but also to our small businesses that that quite frankly, I don't think the city should be in there and telling them what they should do.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And the second major problem is with collective bargaining agreements that that we as Democrats and we as pro-labor and we talked about working and workforce and what people, people of jobs, part of the tenet of of being in Boston and having a workforce that is the best in the country.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that's all about. That's all about work that is best in the country for them to have agreements and to have this administration come in and basically roll that agreement up and throw it in the trash and and totally disrespect it, disregard it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think it's a while. I don't think I know it's a major, major problem. Our whole civilization is based on the contract. Yes. I'm signing this and letting you know that I'm going to do that. Why are we allowing this administration to just take those contracts and throw them out without discussions?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's never come in front of us. Nobody has asked our opinion on where we are on this thing and and not to bring up a sore subject. But but last week that the people that came in to our chamber, they were looking for where where is the transparency?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Where was the vote taken on this? Was this just unilaterally just decided? So those are some of some of my real concerns. And, Erin, thank you very much for this. And I just want to make one other point.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There's a there's a large union that's noticeably absent in this discussion here. It's a teachers union. From what I understand, they have the most people out of compliance is a teachers union. So so I'm wondering what's going on with the teachers union here?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is there a side deal going on? There are there are there are commitments being made to the teachers union to kind of pit unions against each other. Again, no transparency, no conversations. But we had a previous mayor and we were in a real state of emergency.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I don't know if people remember, but we met for 6 to 7 months every single day at eight or 9:00 in the morning, we had the entire mayor's team of team that that could answer our questions available to us every single day when we're in an emergency.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Now, we're still calling it an emergency, and this administration is making decisions without even asking us our opinion. So it concerns me now and it really concerns me moving into the future. We can't just throw away collective bargaining like this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's a bad, bad road to go on and sign sign my name on it. Thank you, Mr. President, for allowing me to speak here today. Thank you. Thank you, Counselor Baker. Any other counsel I like to speak on this matter?'",

        "'speaker_0': 'I work at the Committee for Public Counsel Services. We're actually trying to union organize for SEIU eight, eight, eight. So I'm a big believer in unions and what they deliver for us and for our our families. But I also fully understand that COVID 19 is the leading cause of death in this country right now for first responders'",

        "'speaker_0': 'The vaccine actually reduces the viral load. So folks who are vaccinated actually have less of the disease to share, which creates weaker infections. And so in for the positives. And so there's a lot of very good reasons to take the COVID vaccination.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I fully understand and support why our administration has decided to push forward with this. I will say that collective bargaining is obviously incredibly important. It's something that is the whole basis for why we have unions. But I also think that there are very specific safety issues here for both members and for the public, which these unions'",
        "'speaker_0': 'interface and that these kinds of decisions are not made. I think we're still in an emergency. I understand some people may say we're not, but I think we're still in the midst of a pandemic as we speak right now in which our scenes are always sort of teetering as to whether or not they're going to go into'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Obviously, if you are vaccinated, you can carry the disease. You can catch you can catch COVID 19. And we should constantly be testing folks, whether they're vaccinated or not, to ensure that we're not doing the spread. And so I think we should probably go further than we have.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We should have a mandate and for both testing and vaccination. But I understand that folks on this council may disagree and folks in the city may disagree, but that's simply what I believe to actually bring this. So thank you, Mr. President.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'But anyways, I'm sure Counselor Evans will provide it.
