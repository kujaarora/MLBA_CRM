President Clinton, I just briefly wanted to note on this statue, since we got St Patrick's Day coming up, John Paul O'Reilly was a really amazing figure in Boston. He grew up in Ireland.

        "'speaker_2': 'And but the city council actually appropriated the money for these memorial books to be printed by the City Printing Office.

        "'speaker_2': 'these days, but, you know, just a flag. And so, you know, rather than having this just be like words on a piece of paper on the agenda, I wanted to underscore that he was just a really important person in the cultural life of the city 150 years ago.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And also that I think it shows you that the stories of how immigrants become completely essential and embedded in the fabric of Boston is a story that we can we can and should tell again and again, and that we should memorialize again and again.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So grateful to councilors for supporting Councilor Edwards's motion for suspension of passage today. And the statue is in Fenway. It is.

        "'speaker_2': 'If you know it, it's kind of like some seating around it. Um, and, you know, I have a whole two page poem by O'Reilly, but Lydia said, I go on too long, so you're not going to get it today.'",
