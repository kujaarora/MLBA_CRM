Like Council of Flynn said, this is a quality of life and a public health issue.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And my office gets calls and emails all the time, not just from Austin Brighton, which I know most of the calls do come from, but from neighborhoods across, you know, every neighborhood in the city. So I look forward to the work ahead.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Councilor Murphy. But anyone else likes to speak on this matter. See, Councilor, me here. Councilor, me here. The floor is yours?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yep. Thank you. To the makers. Really excited to. Have this conversation. Just want to point out a few things. One, in terms of accountability, we also need to lean in to developers, right, in terms of how they do business here in the city of Boston.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Because when development happens in our city, we see a high influx of Romans. And I think that that's something that we need to lean into in terms of who needs to be on that target list. And then I also want to uplift landlords, right?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Landlords also have a role to play in this. So I think that it's great that we are including them. And then it's also important for us as a city to look at and management companies. There are a lot of folks, the CDC is that get money to support and be property managers.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I get calls all the time from parents and families who are dodging literally rats every single day and, you know, don't see themselves really being heard. So I think that in terms of accountability, we need to ensure that we're bringing the management companies into these conversations because they also have a role to play in how we'",
        "'speaker_2': 'deal with this situation. And I think, you know, I always think back about during remote learning, there were a lot of young people who were afraid to turn on their cameras because they were afraid that their their classmates would see Bruins cockroaches and mice passing across the screen.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think that that speaks volumes to the social emotional impact that this is also making on our students. So I just wanted to look that up.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Councilman here. Councilor Laura, the floor is yours.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Terry. I just wanted to thank President Flynn and the other co-sponsors. I think that this is a unique opportunity for us to collaborate with other neighboring cities. I think, as Councilor Braeden mentioned, this is an issue that is a regional issue.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'City councilor at large from Somerville, Charlotte Kelley famously ran her campaign with a rat plan for Somerville, and Somerville has a free pest control assistance program that they run that they offer to homeowners. And so there's a lot of there's opportunity for us to innovate.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And there's also a lot of best practices that are really put in place by our counterparts in surrounding cities. And so my hope is that we can invite them to talk about what they've implemented and how we can recreate some of that here in the city of Boston as well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Councilor Chair. And I recognize that Councilor Flaherty can set fire to the floor. Thank you, Mr. Chair.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Please add my name and just through the make or just a suggestion that we bring obviously AC and maybe the fire department, the solution to this issue is dry ice. The problem is apparently someone has patented it and it was called rat ice.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So it now requires our road and control division when they want to administer this, which is the safest and most humane way to address the issue. They have to get in a vehicle, drive up to Goulburn and get what's called a label, which is basically a permit.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They then have to turn around and then go down to Rockland and pick up the dry ice and then come back to the city of Boston. Colossal waste of time. So we need to figure out a way through ESD, maybe our fire department, and maybe the council through ordinance to allow the Inspection Service Department to get dry'",
        "'speaker_5': 'ice right over at the Newmarket area, which is where they used to get it before someone got cute with smart or whatever term you want to put on it. And they've now patented it, which now prevents municipalities like Boston to be able to utilize a very useful tool to combat rodent infestation.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And for those that know anything about the Norwegian rat and how they migrate and how they repopulate all of that stuff, reproduce, you know that the baiting and the traps only go so far. But also when you have experts in which we've had experts in this chamber, they talk about they've almost become immune to some of the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'the the pesticides, the bait that we're using. In fact, they've built up such a tolerance that, you know, in the old days, they would only take a little bait, would work. And now you literally have to put a basically a pound of bait to be able to sort of just to be able to maintain some sense of'",
        "'speaker_5': 'catching up. Dry ice eliminates all that. And so you think about the rats that have burrowed in the common and or all of our parks or around our developments, walk along the developments. When you take tours in your district and see all the rat holes along sides of the building, try to solve that problem almost instantaneously.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So again, through the maker, if you could make sure that we get ESD, maybe the fire department, maybe even state regulators, because this is there's a solution to this problem. It's very simple. It's dry ice. However, our hands are tied because someone has patented his regulations that oversee it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mr..'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Councilor Flaherty, the chair recognizes Councilor Flint yet.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you, Councilor Roy and I certainly agree with my colleague, Councilor Clarity. We will have that discussion here about dry ice. We will have the appropriate city agencies. And that is our plan is to try to come up with a solution where we have easy access city city officials have easy access to dry ice, because'",
        "'speaker_0': 'that's a huge that's a huge asset for us in dealing with dealing with this issue. All of us in the South End, in one of the public galleries two weeks ago, and the amount of rodents and rats in that area, the only way they could kill them is through through dry ice.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But the other aspect I fail to mention that I want to mention now, since I have that opportunity, the city is coming up with the composting citywide. So we also want to make sure that when the city of Boston comes out with the composting plan, that there's a huge educational aspect to it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's not as simple as just just disposing of the of the food. Waste is a there's a process to it that residents need to be educated. The other aspect is we also need to educate our residents that don't speak English.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we have to have a campaign around around the city in various languages so that we can educate people in different languages about this quality of life, this public health. I call it an emergency, really. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. To council clarity. And when I do when we do have this committee hearing, my goal was to keep it and keep it open so that we can meet on it every every month. So what? The various experts continue to learn about it and continue to make progress on it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I had the opportunity to talk to the city of Newton last month. The City of New York has an excellent rodent pest control program, but a lot of good cities are doing great work on this. On this issue, it's about also about working together.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So, again, I want to say thank you to my colleagues for their interest and their work on this issue for for a long period of time. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Councilor Flynn. Chair recognizes Councilor Buck.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. Chair. I just wanted to dovetail on that, to say that as the Chair of City Services, I very much think this is like the it is like the ultimate in like basic city services. And like, what does it mean to have a clean and sanitary city?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so definitely look forward to working with the president and the co-sponsors around both holding that hearing and, as he suggested, keeping it open, making sure that that's an ongoing conversation throughout the term. So looking forward to it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. Chair.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Councilor Buck. But anyone else like to add their name? Please add Mr. Clarke, please add Councilor Bok, please add Councilor Edwards. Please add Councilor Fernandez Anderson. Please add Councilor Flaherty. Please add Councilor Lara. Please add Councilor Lily.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Jan, please and councilor here. Please add Councilor Rowland, please add my name. Seeing no further due at docket 0467 will be assigned to the Committee on City Services and Innovation Technology. Thank you, Ms.. Clare.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Council on Me. He offered the following in order for a hearing on establishing a mental health curriculum in Boston Public Schools.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The chair recognizes. Counsel me here. Counsel me here. You have the floor.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. President. And I would like to add my colleague, Counselor Erin Murphy, as a co-sponsor in this hearing order.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilor Murphy also added.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Since even before the COVID 19 pandemic, we've been dealing with a pandemic in our Boston public schools around mental health and wellness. It's gotten so bad that the American Academy of Pediatrics and Adolescent Psychiatry and Children's Hospital Association have declared a national emergency in children's mental health, citing a serious toll of the COVID 19 pandemic'",
        "'speaker_2': '. On top of existing challenges. Every day, students are being asked to leave their backpacks full of trauma at the door so that they can focus on their studies. And recently, we have seen how that untreated trauma has spilled over in our schools, out into the streets from the shooting outside of Boston Academy to the loaded gun found'",
        "'speaker_2': 'at young achievers of science and math in school, to several tombstones of our lost and loved ones being defaced and even stolen. It is clear that we need to be doing a lot more to address mental health and wellness in our schools.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In school, we teach students how to read, how to write, how to run and even how to eat. But we do not do or we do not do is give them the tools and resources to unpack their trauma in a nonviolent and productive way.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This is why we're following this hearing order in terms of the data. The numbers are pretty clear. According to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, emergency departments, visits for suspected suicide attempts among adolescents jumped 31% in 2020 compared to 2019.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In February and March of this year, emergency department visits for suspected suicide attempts were 51% higher among girls ages 12 to 17. During the same period in 2019. I get choked up because I have a 12 year old daughter.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So this is hard. And I also have in my own experience with this issue. So I'm going up. You already know my story. So this clearly indicates that we need to be moving beyond the conventional plans of providing school psychologists and social workers when needed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They do great work, but we need to be doing more. In California, a bill which recently passed requires each school district, county office of Education, state special school and charter school that offers one or more courses in health education to pupils in middle school or high school to include those courses.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Some form of instructional mental health. And way back in 1999. Massachusetts Commissioner of Education David Driscoll released a comprehensive health curriculum framework which seeks to introduce mental health into the classroom. But it's clear that we're not doing enough or being intentional around mental health education in our schools.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I'm hoping to use this hearing as an opportunity to look at what we what more we can be doing to uplift mental health and wellness in our schools. And before I finish, I also just want to give a shout out to Councilor Murphy, who has made youth mental health a cornerstone of our office's work.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I'm hoping that as the chair and vice chair of the Committee of Education, we will be able to work collaboratively on this issue together. Our success as legislators is measured by the quality of the world we leave behind for the next generation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we need to ensure that we have all the resources they need to be set up for success. And that very much includes mental health and wellness. Thank you. And I just wanted to say really quickly, because you know me, I always got a riff at the top and speak from my heart because that's just the way'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I know how. You know, we have as parents oftentimes passed on our own trauma to our children because we weren't taught how to deal with it. You know, I talk about the fact that when I was a teen, I also attempted suicide.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But my mom was so afraid that I would be taken away from her that she never did anything about it. And I grew up believing that she didn't love me. And I think that if we're tackling mental health, we have an opportunity to destigmatize it in a way that will help our the little ones understand that it's'",
        "'speaker_2': 'okay not to be okay and that they need to be able to seek the support services that they need. And I think that this conversation is not just about a moment of of of political theater. It really is looking at the the violence that's spilling over into our streets.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There is a deep connection here. And we need to center mental health and wellness as part of that conversation. Otherwise, we're not getting to the root. So my hope is, is that as we continue to lean into this conversation, we recognize the responsibility and the opportunity that we have to change doing business as usual.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. So we know our children are suffering with mental health issues and we cannot expect them to properly address their stress and mental health struggles if we don't teach them the tools they need to work through this.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Teaching mental health will lead to better outcomes for our children. I know council here has mentioned some of them, but we know the statistics are scary. Suicide is the third leading cause of death for children ages 10 to 24 in many or most of mental health conditions dark during adolescence.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'And I really appreciate the way you took us through that and. I'm just I'm just humbled to hear you, to be able to have so much courage to be that vulnerable with us, because a lot of us speak about mental health and it's become a political jargon that I think everyone now it's a catch phrase that we'",
        "'speaker_2': 'know that we all must support and we all. It's an issue. It's an issue. It's an issue. So we all talk about it. But the way that I've seen yourself and comes from Murphy can guide us through this, or at least the way I've watched you do it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I really I just really appreciate you for that. In terms of what you file today, I really look forward to the work. I would love to please add my name, Mr. President. I would love to work with you on it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think that one of the issues is not just, you know, the problem. The problem is not adding one social worker per school or, as you say, bringing the homeschool connection or creating that platform. The Child Behavioral CBT.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So Children Behavioral Health Initiative through MassHealth covers only medical necessities. So this means that the service, the clinician, will then go in and have to diagnose in order for the service to be rendered. The issue with that is fee for service then perpetuates this cyclical effect of this prison pipeline because you have to diagnose or sometimes misdiagnose'",
        "'speaker_2': 'or harshly diagnose a child. So I question and I really want us to talk about how are we diagnosing our black and brown children and how many fee, how many fees do you have to take in order to render that service?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sometimes the issues are, as you are putting it in your here in your request for the hearing in the order, is that you sometimes the issue is circumstantial, it's situational. So it deserves a temporary an OS just to get that three months service to figure out why that kid is in the shelter or why that kid's acting'",
        "'speaker_2': 'up. Well, why what's the problem? Circumstantially, we've temporarily for that moment. But what happens is once they get the diagnosis, it follows them throughout their lives and then they end up going, you know, not getting a job or not or whatever, you know, how does that cookie crumbles?'",
