        "'speaker_1': 'and the firefighters credit union. I bought my first house about 30 years ago in 1994, and of course, that was when nobody wanted to be in Boston. I think we had two or three abandoned houses on my street that I grew up on.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I bought an abandoned house with money from the credit union, rehabbed it myself, and lived in there for a while with roommates. But that was that was what basically allowed me to. Subsequently, you know, by the House, I mean, now that I raised my family.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I think there are some some good ideas. The firefighters credit union just did some some creative packaging where they come up with a new product. I don't know if it's a I don't want to speak about it too much, but it may be a 40 year, 40 year term.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But basically what I found the most difficult thing in home ownership is that initial that initial down payment. You really want to get 10%, 20% to avoid EMI, which is which is insurance, which adds to you to your monthly payment.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have to be able to get people to a point where they can get that initial payment and then realize that even though the House may cost five, 50, six, 50, whatever it is, the monthly payment might only be 2500 bucks or something like that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we have to educate, educate people on that. But I think, again, not to keep hammering up some of this up housing money should go towards the unions where we demand that people that are making 30 grand stay in the city.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'How do they do it? How did I buy a house when I was only making 50 grand? And I don't know how I did it, but I did it probably because of sheer stupidity and didn't realize that I could have put myself in the in the in the poor house my whole life, which I kind of did'",
        "'speaker_1': '. But anyways, I've got I've gone on, I've gone on long enough. But this is this is good legislation. But I think it has to happen with real money that goes for the unions to be able to give to their rent and to give to their membership.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'He has his 25,000 for a down payment. 50,000 for a down payment. Those are the that's the type of money that we're going to need to give to down payments. And that's not even talking about the supply. That's a whole nother conversation.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'It's a it's a residential program for for for people. With substance use challenges. And one of the one of the men that was living there said to me, Counselor Flynn, you you proposed that the office of returning citizens should be able to get a fair shot at working in the city that public works.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The city should be more career friendly. And I said, yes, I, I did say that I think would be a great idea. He said, Well, that would mean that we would have to live in the city of Boston for ten years making a salary of I don't know what they start out at 30, $35,000.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So, you know, we can say that we want to help returning citizens. We can help them with courtroom Corey reform. But then we're going to make them live in Boston on a salary of 30 or $40,000 a year.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It the math just doesn't add up. So just wanted to highlight that maybe that's an issue we can also focus on. But again, I want to say thank you to my colleagues, the makers for their their important work on this.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'And so we're here today to talk about and I was also appointed to the Yellow Task Force when I was doing advocacy in the education space. So when we talk about English language learner students, we tend to view it as from the lens of education.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But today I want to look at how we as a city are providing care for our students from the lens of government accountability and transparency. Because we're in this budget season and we're seeing all of these numbers come in about how much we're spending to support English language learner students or students with disabilities.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But how that money really impacts our students is often a lot harder to impact, especially when we have so much talk about this in our budget hearings. Let's talk about some facts. A December report and 2021 report it report submitted to the Department of Justice from Boston Public Schools, found that more than 11,000 English language learners in'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Boston Public Schools, 30%, are not receiving enough of the right instruction with a certified teacher surrounded by the right group of students.

And it's clear that we need to be doing more to support our English language students from an accountability and accessibility perspective.'",

On February 3rd. In 1962, President John F Kennedy imposed the U.S. embargo on Cuba, the 60th anniversary of the embargo as a stark reminder of the United States policy'",

Today, more than half a century since the embargo was put in place, the Biden administration continues to uphold what is ultimately a symbol of hostility between the U.S. and Cuba amid the most challenging humanitarian crisis on the island since the 1980s.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In 2009, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce estimated that the embargo cost the United States economy 1.2 billion per year in lost sales and exports. The Cuban government estimates that the embargo has cost the island 144 billion as of 2021.'",

It licenses a range of trade opportunities for US companies and beyond these specific policies. The shift in discourse by US presidential by U.S. president excuse me, really signaled what we consider to be the most significant change in U.S. Cuba policy in 60'",

The complex licensing requirements effectively prevent food, medicine and medical equipment from reaching Cubans, and it discourages medical equipment sales to the islands. One particularly egregious example of this is that Cuba had a cancelation of ventilator sales by a Swiss company during the pandemic'",
