        "'speaker_8': 'But just getting this at 1230 and now looking at it, I just have a question because I've asked this in the working sessions.

        "'speaker_8': 'many minority promotions in the fire department that we're all aching for. Right. We really want to see that. So I don't think that coming out of the fire it's counter and I feel like they're getting hit twice today.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'They're not given the opportunity for us as a body to vote on whether or not we want to pass Car five and lot of 13. In the conversations I have is that Ladder 13 could be placed right behind the Boston fire headquarters, which is right in the heart of Mass and Cass.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And they would do really good work to support the work already going down there for the crisis we're seeing there and also be able to support the South residents at the same time.

        "'speaker_7': 'And for getting us.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Here. And so I anticipate voting yes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'On this partial amendment one presented to us by chair.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Finalist Anderson and support her in that endeavor. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Counselor. Clara. The chair recognizes Counselor Bach. Counsel Bach, you have the file.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you so much, Mr. President. And thank you to the chair for putting together this collective override proposal and recognizing that this is the first time this has ever happened. And it's a challenge. And also recognizing that we, as the Council only gave the chair to work with what we proposed in original decreases.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And, you know, I think we've all talked about ways in which we day we might learn from this process going forward. And I think that one of the things that we've all learned is that we would like to talk more with the departments in advance about the cuts and increases that we are proposing now that we have'",
        "'speaker_7': 'this power. And I think also that departments and I think that through always like that, this was this was sort of a different system. But I do just want to stress that, you know, and I and I'm rising as somebody who proposed a few of these decreases that that the chair is is using here to balance the'",
        "'speaker_7': 'amendment that they are based on information that the department's provided to us. So, for example, for one of these $400,000 lines that that fire fire had already internally within their department budget, move that 400,000 to other things because they weren't using it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'They hadn't even left it in that line to be not spent, but then continued to re-up that in the following year's budget, and several of the other lines were considerably underspent, I think. Councilor Murphy, to your point, my understanding is that departments don't actually have the authority under OBM to take non personnel extra money and turn it'",
        "'speaker_7': 'into personnel extra money because of the dynamic that we discussed at a previous meeting where personnel actually come with the pension and other costs associated. And so while people can turn unspent personnel money into equipment, they can't do vice versa.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I would just say that I think that these proposals came from the information that the department's provided to us about their April budget spending. I also would say to Councilor Flaherty's concern, and I guess he's not here, but that was he just behind me.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. That you know, obviously this is the beginning of the fiscal year. And so if we were to find that, you know, there is a piece of information that the council doesn't have is very concerning. I think there are opportunities to fix that through supplemental appropriation.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But I do think that that it is important going forward for departments to realize that the financial information that they provide to the Council is information on which the council is going to act and depend. And so it can't be that only when the council decides to try to pay for critical goals that then we hear, oh'",
        "'speaker_7': 'no, that unspent money isn't really unspent, etc. Because I think like if that's the argument, we're always going to be having that argument. So I say that saying I think we all are, you know, and I've heard the chair say it loud and clear that we need to to structure a process for next year that anticipates this'",
        "'speaker_7': 'sort of level of detail that the council needs from departments sooner. But I do think that the proposals for the decreases which were in the proposed like budget that day that the Council passed on June eight, are reasonable and based on information, and I'll be voting for the override.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you, Counsel. The Chair recognizes Counselor Fernandez Anderson. Counsel Fernandez Anderson. You have the floor.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So. Just just to keep it brief and simple for me. The departments, including fire department, submitted their budget and they or their requests, and they told us that there were certain some funds that were unused and they were not going to use it in how they moved funds, moneys around.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Right. So once they tell us that they are not using that money, they told us that we didn't tell them that. Then we worked with the administration as well to look at to look at the whole proposal that you see here or the old partial overrides here.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And to the best of our abilities, we discussed what funds we had already recommended and voted for. Everyone here voted to decrease these amounts. I, as a chair can only recommend to use decreases that were already voted for by everyone.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So that is what you have here. Those and I understand that the concern is if we're not doing CR five, then why I do that? Will the department, the fire department told us they're not using that money that is unspent funds.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm not telling you that. And so then this body voted to not to to to use it to take it away, to decrease it and use it on something else. So I took BFD equipment. BFD equipment. Of the amounts that we had already.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Voted on.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In law contractor and OPM and do it and BFD contractors, all that we already voted on. And I added them up and I said, okay, do we get just car fire or can we get programs to save black men's lives or do we do programs to save black children, poor children, white poor children in the projects, too'",
        "'speaker_5': '? Do we talk about do we improve VHA? Do we clean our streets? Do we do youth programs? Do we do clean up our crew, not trees? Do we save our environment? I looked at all of those things and I said, these small amounts add up together.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We could take out from the decreases that we had already voted to decrease. Anyway, that is the only money that I we had to work with. So Car five saved black men and babies and poor children in the streets.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'What do we do? And that is how I came to this logic. The recommendations based on our collective work sessions, the expressions from everyone, it's not me by myself is recommending this, right? It's all of us. What we voted to decrease, what we voted that we express, that we care about what we said in our campaigns.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Here we are. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Madam Chair. The chair recognizes councils and councilors.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And you? Thank you, Mr. President. I just want to second what Councilor Backing Councilor Fernando Anderson stated. A lot of this, the package may look different because I think originally I'll speak for the Office of Returning Citizens. You know, that money was coming from police over time.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But deferring to the chair's wisdom here and deciding how to package what we've already approved, I think is really important, especially when we think about the overall sentiment of this council to support a lot of these offices and initiatives when it comes to offers of returning citizens, black male advancement, when it comes to supporting the city based'",
        "'speaker_4': 'vouchers. So these are all things that we have collectively as a body decided that we wanted to support. The only thing that looks different is, you know, the line to line packaging here. But a lot of these initiatives, we have already come together and said we support them.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so I am just urging my council colleagues to to support. I know originally it was over time and a lot of us continue to want to see decreases there. And these were also areas where we collectively as a body said these are decreases that we can withstand to fund the officers that have been disinvested in and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the programs that have been disinvested in. And so I just urge my council colleagues, we all care about our city departments. Some of them are really, really well funded and others are not. And we have work to do to make this a better city for all of us.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think Councilor Bok did an incredible job of breaking down projections based on past expenditures for some of our departments, and we pulled accordingly. The chair has done has spent a lot of time thinking about where to pull money and how do we make it work for all of us here on the city council.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I think that we should trust her judgment here in supporting this. All right. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Council agenda chair recognizes councilman here. Councilman here. You have the floor.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. President. And I just want to thank the chair for her incredible grace and patience that she's had with all of us, including me, because I know I could be a little Chihuahua barking all day, every day.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so just wanted to just thank you, because I know it has not been easy for you to carry all of this and the pressure, but you have risen to the occasion under very hard circumstances, working with half, not having all of the information oftentimes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I obviously there are things that I've been fighting for here. So I am raising not only to just support this, but for us to recognize what this moment means, because it's not just about this vote, it's about a bigger conversation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's about the power that we've been given to be able to flex that little muscle that we have here and how we set the stage for how we're going to continue to do business in collaboration with community, with the administration and the council.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And this is what it looks like, right? So I think that if we look at this as a learning opportunity, which is what this is, that there are lessons to that we can all agree with and there are things that we might take and fight and scream all the way towards the end.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But at the end of the day, it's about how we seize this moment and set the stage for round two and how we come back into this chamber and do it all over again with what we know. So I am highly encouraged that my colleagues will look at this as an asset and not a deficit and move'",
        "'speaker_4': 'with that lens. So thank you Chair, for your hard work and I look forward to my colleagues voting to pass this. All right. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman. Here, the chair recognizes Council Brayton. But before I recognize Constable President, I would like to remind everyone that when you speak on a docket, yes, you're able to speak one time. I'm not going to call on you a second time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I just don't want us to go back and forth, maybe with the exception of of the chair of Ways and Means, but for everyone else, if you if you have the opportunity to speak, take the opportunity because you're not going to get a second bite of the apple that she had calls on.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilor Brady.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I do rise to support this this portion partial right. Number one. I also wanted to thank Constance Fernandez Anderson for incredible leadership in this complicated new thing that we're doing this year. You've done it with Grace, and.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I really appreciate.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Your leadership and your guidance in this process. It is a body. As a body, it's really important for us to work together, to come up with solutions that address the. The challenges that we communities and our folks face all across our city.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'One thing that we struggled with in the budget process and we have done for for many years, is the fact that sometimes we're dealing with not all the information. And when we look back at custom and practice and years gone by, the council has has struggled for over 70 years to access information in department or annual reports'",
        "'speaker_4': '. And the practice of producing annual reports from different departments fell into abeyance in the 1980s. And it's no longer a thing that we'd get an annual report from the different departments to tell us what's where they're at and what their what the money spent on and what their goals and objectives are and what they've achieved in the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'past year and what they're, you know, what are we going to spend the money on in the future? So as this is something that our office is working on to try and improve accountability and transparency, and I do urge that in the context of budget deliberations going forward, next year, ongoing, we would love to see a modernization'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and standardization of the process of producing an annual report so that as we all sit down in this, as this body sits down next year, that we will be will we will be more equipped and have better information about what how the different departments are operating, what their goals and objectives are, and what the money is actually'",
        "'speaker_4': 'being spent on. I think that would help the process greatly. Thank you, Madam Chairman. Thank you, Madam Chair. And thank you, Mr. President.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'And. Youth development and city in housing, everything that we talked about on the campaign trail, we had that opportunity to use our power to make sure that the communities that we're fighting for get to see it. So this is simple for me and I'll be voting yes.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'It's my belief that the City Council has a responsibility to be responsive to the needs of the people of the community.

Yet of the 6000 jobs offered, which is 1000 more than we had last year, only 2800 have been filled and people already started working this week.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So less than half of the youth jobs through y e are presently filled and work has started. Yet we're asking for thousands of more jobs. These jobs, I believe, will continue to be vacant. And I also believe there's a much better way to utilize our taxpayers money.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'those resources are off where they would have been without the pandemic. And so related to that provision, the city the mayor proposed this $40 million docket, which is actually there to balance on the revenue side, the budget that we were just discussing and voting on.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'recover in a more equitable way and that the need is urgent. So throughout this ARPA process, we've really been balancing the fact that this the need is urgent. And now and all of these things are things that we should have spent money on yesterday.'",

And at the same time, because it's a once in a generation kind of amount of money, we want to make sure that we're spending it well and that the that ten years from now we'll be talking'",
        "'speaker_7': 'about the things that we achieved because of ARPA. And so. Basically the administration ultimately said that they were willing to put most of that money that the 19.7 that they had saved for next year's revenue support in to collaboration with the council.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so there's a $17.7 million docket, which I'm not formally speaking to yet because the late file. So it will come. But I think folks have it on their desks already, which is which demonstrates their willingness to be collaborative with the council and include a huge number of council priorities in the city's ARPA proposal.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'already highlighted. And so the description of those changes for this docket is in the summary of legislation and amendments is on page two if people look at the committee report. But I'm just going to read them aloud so that people are aware it will be within this docket, dedicating at least $8 million in category affordable housing to'",

        "'speaker_7': 'So that's another exciting new pilot, 100,000 for the to expand the Peace Institute's work and sort of emergency housing for families for families victims of violence. A million. And here is for a study to figure out if there's somewhere to be land in south Boston to say veterans housing $1,000,000 within the category of behavioral health to support'",
        "'speaker_7': 'further behavioral health, capacity building and training for CBOs and city departments. $1,000,000 for supporting the recovery of restaurants and bars in disadvantaged neighborhoods. The city particularly focused on sort of folks who kind of missed the opportunities in a number of the programs that were available at the height of the pandemic.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And then another million split between 350 in economic opportunity and inclusion. And 650 in arts and culture to support investment in and activation of an arts corridor in Roxbury. Those things collectively add up to the 12.3. That is within this three $49.5 million docket for council priorities.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There's then, as I just mentioned, another 17.7 million folks have on their desk. And I'll speak to that when it's formally the right time, when it's the late file. But those two things collectively, obviously add up to $30 million that that reflect council priorities and integrating those into the proposal of how to use the remainder of ARPA'",
        "'speaker_7': '. I just also want to draw folks quick attention to at the last page, the committee report. It says. Additionally, the amended version of the order adds language to specify the shared intention to support both worker cooperatives and sustainable pay increases in the childcare sector.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Those are some of the kind of qualitative things that have come up in the discussion about this transformative $15 million investment in child care. And then and then just raising, you know, worker standards and making sure that we've got good, good standards across the board and in the areas that are being funded by that order.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So that is the document for us. I know as Chair that it's a hard thing to figure out how to take action on something that feels as momentous as this does. And I have definitely felt acutely the fact that it is both too ambitious to do wrong and also too much to do slowly.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Because the reality is that the lion's share of the funding is proposed for housing. People know that I come out of the affordable housing world working for the VHA. Unfortunately, housing development and especially building units as for example, 45 million of the 60 million in the homeownership will be doing takes time and has extended timelines.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And this money all needs to be under contract by December 2024, which may seem soon, but is not on that type of timeline. And one of the things we heard was that the the annual kind of RFP process that kicks out our our housing resources and helps us let people know what's available.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Usually hits in July. And so for for me as chair, it's been a fine balance of trying to figure out how to make sure that councilors have real fingerprints on this, which I think in this $30 million we do, recognizing also a lot of alignment with the other things of the administration have proposed and also making sure'",
        "'speaker_7': 'that we get these dollars out to our our communities and to all. The urgent needs in our communities because we hear about those every day. I want to acknowledge before you, the Florida colleagues, that, you know, the administration ended up taking a firm position that they did not want to use ARPA dollars to fund nonprofit infrastructure projects'",
        "'speaker_7': '. So infrastructure that's going to be owned by private, nonprofit entities. And certainly as chair, that was not something that I'd heard from them early in this process. And I think a number of councilors and organizations brought really meritorious proposals forward to us.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And those are not ultimately included in this, unlike the process that the public just was watching, the appropriation accept and expand orders cannot be overridden by the council. So this is a place where we and the mayor have to reach a point of agreement and collaboration.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I think with these two dockets, not completely, but in large part we're doing that today. And so I ask my colleagues to support passage of this. I'm grateful to the administration for filing the the late supplemental order.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I'll also be moving passage of that later in the meeting. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Council balked that she recognizes. Councilman here. Councilman, here. You have the floor.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Chair. I just need some clarity before I vote on anything. If you're saying that you're going to talk about something else later, I just. I'm just curious about. I know we spent a lot of time talking about very specific things.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And and for the record, I'd like to make sure that the things that we have agreed upon are read into the record and that there is some sort of agreement on some of the things that we've been pushing for, because there tends to be this, you know, we didn't know that this was going to be the way'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it was when we were dealing with the interdepartmental conversation that the administration. So we you know, now it's like the administration switched it up, but we can't support nonprofits or like all of these, you know, changes, you know, give people a sense of kind of pause.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I just need some clarity and to get on the record that the things that I'm going to be voting on include the things that we talked about and we fought for. And I just need some assurance around that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And where where does that fall in this?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you, Councilman. Here. There's a question on the floor from council here. Council block, would you like to respond to this?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I guess the question I have for you and the clerk is that if if it were acceptable to take out of order, the first lady file matter and have it formally read into the record, I would be delighted to do that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The only reason that I wasn't able to do that is because of the.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Was. I went to the hospital. 420. We'll do it after.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Sorry. Mr. President, can I also clarify? I received from the messenger city messenger the committee report of the late file. Or do other people not have that on their table? You don't have your. Yeah. The $17.7 million docket.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's in the triple packet of late files.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I haven't. Say that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We'll take a brief recess.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr..'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That she recognizes. Counsel Bork. Counsel Bork, you have the floor and then I'll go back to counsel here.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mr. President, just now that I think everybody has both items. I just want to clarify one more time, because we I know we discussed in the working session yesterday when we were talking about those two columns.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Right. There's some so maybe it's procedurally helpful to know we're not allowed to amend the mayor's appropriation orders to be higher than the original number that was proposed. So the way that the 30 million is split is 12.3 of it is out of the 349.5 order that stock at 503 and 17.7 is out of this new late'",
        "'speaker_7': 'filed supplemental order. So the various council priorities are split between those two things. So if you're looking for something, you may find it in the list that I just read into the record from 503, or you may find it stipulated in the 17.7 order.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I just wanted to specify that for councilors, just to be clear that that's where everything is. So thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, counsel. Look, the chair recognizes Councilor Baker was next. Counsel Baker, you have the floor.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Still some more than somewhat uncomfortable voting on this here today, after the day we've had still not totally square clear where a lot of things are going. I believe we could split this up into smaller buckets.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Whatever, whatever has a priority, if it's a housing for our priority. We could be passed in 50 or 100 million today without a problem and be able to have this be a working sort of relationship here. With all that being said, I would like to offer an amendment to an amendment to trademark at 503 by reducing on'",
        "'speaker_1': 'what the only way that I could identify was on the Google document that came to me, which was line 20, massing cars, temporary low threshold shelter sites by 5 million, and adding 5 million in for the Georgia Tech field house.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Just to be clear, that low threshold housing, that 16 million, we've already given them at least 5 million. Now for the low threshold housing, I think the number is is much higher than that. But what they've what they agree to is 5 million.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And also the temporary low threshold housing is something that that community down there doesn't want. When we talk about we talk about decentralization and this this low threshold housing en masse. And Cass, make sure that that that issue that's going on down there is centralized down there for our entire lives.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And in just for clarity, 5 million coming off the 206 million in housing brings that down to 201 million. A little bit of math. We just we just approved 70 million earlier in this mail, in this meeting, 70 million in grants from the feds for housing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So the 70 million plus the 201 million minus my 5 million, we're talking about $271 million here that that can potentially go through here today. So I'm going to and you all have the amendment in front of you pretty straightforward.'",
        "'speaker_1': '5 million from the low threshold that housing down on en masse and gas and replace that with 5 million for the Dorchester Field House, which we all had a hearing on. I know the administration says they don't want to build infrastructure for nonprofits but will just pound money into them.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That'll be that'll be gone. And we'll say we're talking about in ten years, it's all going to be a distant memory. The only thing we're going to be able to look at is going to be this. I was so I'm looking for a second on that as the president.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank thank you. Counsel Baker. Um. Mr. Clarke, do you want to read it into the record first or should we? Yeah, we're going to read it into the record. Yeah. Mr. Clarke, please read that into the record of.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'President, based on the people that are in the room here, I mean, we're going to should we wait till people come back in the room for this photo? Because one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Us. We'll take we'll take a brief recess. Back in session. Please take your seat, everybody. Please take your seats, everybody. The the motion is properly before the body. And it has been second in at this time. Would anyone like to speak on this matter?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. The chair recognizes Councilor Borg Council book you of the floor.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, President Flynn. If I could. Get city funding. Through the proper process to council Bakersfield house. I would I chaired the hearing that many folks attended. I thought it was compelling. I think despite the disagreement between people about the history of how the field house land was transferred or whatever, that there a really incredible vision there'",
        "'speaker_7': '. And personally, as a private citizen, I hope to find opportunities to support it. I have received the clearest communication, including an informal letter which I read to the Council on Monday, that the mayor is not willing to support nonprofit infrastructure, including the field house.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'If this amendment goes on the three 49.5 docket, then that docket will be vetoed by the mayor. And also the mayor will not be signing the 17.7 supplemental. I if I sound tired, it's not actually because of the length of this meeting.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's because I've only slept between one and five in the morning the last two nights trying to get everybody stuff into these combined dockets. If people want to go back to the drawing board, and I understand that from Councilor Baker's perspective, it makes sense both because this item is not in it and because he doesn't think we'",
        "'speaker_7': 'should be moving on this money all at once. Anyways, if folks agree, fine. But I think people need to be aware of what that amendment vote is. And I also think and I say this with with due respect and affection for my colleague here, that there is a difference between supporting the field House and backing an amendment'",
        "'speaker_7': 'for the field House that is effectively a poison pill to the effort to try to achieve council and mayoral collaboration on ARPA. So that's where I am as the chair and I'll be voting in opposition to the amendment.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'You know, I've been disrespected through this thing here. In my opinion, a letter. A letter is. Is is read into the record, an informal record, because they say we can't build stuff.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Without the money.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You can't build stuff, put up the money. It's all going to be contracts. Not right. Not fair. I don't see us doing enough for our kids, for our teens, for people to get healthy after this after this pandemic.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I just think it's important for those who are watching for us to get some clarity in terms of my kind of what does that play here? Because I keep hearing if we do this, then this will happen.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And if we don't do this, this will happen. So I need to have it really clearly laid out about what is at play and what is the impact of what is at play. Just so that we can all be clear, because there's a lot of fear tactics, there's a lot of uncertainty.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There's a lot of ways you can do this and you can't do that. I need it all laid out and I need the truth. On the floor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you. Councilman here. There's a question on the floor from councilman here on if we can explain the process a little. A little bit. Can I call on the chair council block? If you're able to give us a little bit of background information that might might be helpful to our colleagues.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Sure. Well, I would just say I'm not a lawyer. And, you know, I think that the the question on the table, like in terms of what that's what's at stake. Council over here depends a little bit on how you read Section 17 of the charter, it appears.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So if Section 17 of the charter applies, then it's possible for the mayor to to receive this and to disapprove in part of the appropriation and approve the rest of it. So that that would sort of that would allow the council to indicate support for Councilor Baker's idea and then send it across the fifth floor and see'",
        "'speaker_7': 'what happens. If you don't read 17 DE as applying to this and the reason that there's a question is because it's. It's a question of whether it discounts enough of that appropriation or if it's going to accept and expand because it's federal money.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I just don't I'm not legally able to answer that question. I think I think lawyers on both sides have been looking at that in the last 20 minutes. If it if 17 days doesn't apply, then we're in the situation that I described a minute ago, which is that there's no way except to do in like a'",
        "'speaker_7': 'rejection at whole. So I think that's like there's just genuine uncertainty. But I think that our council and the council is taking the position that that we could make this amendment from Councilor Baker and then the mayor's office would be able to the mayor would be able to to make, you know, any selected vetoes.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I will say. It's I don't think. I yeah. I'm pretty confident that we haven't had any selective like vetoing of appropriations in the time that I've been on the council. I don't know Councilor Flaherty, who would have a considerably longer record.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So so I would just say that this is not been a general practice. And to be honest, it isn't it's not really something that I love the idea of just bringing into practice, because I think as a council we like the idea that when we vote for an appropriation, sort of we're voting for the whole package and'",
        "'speaker_7': 'that the mayor that signs or doesn't sign the whole package. But I can't answer the question and I don't think anyone on the floor is going to be able to definitively answer the legal question of the interpretation of 17 D, but it's certainly possible the 17 D applies here and that therefore we could pass Councilor Baker's amendment'",
        "'speaker_7': 'and then the mayor could make a decision on that and the rest of the appropriation could go through. But I can't give you certainty. I'm not equipped to. Thank you, Mr. President.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'So what was said to me, councilman here sounded like a threat, was it? If my 5 million get in there, the mayor across the hall was going to veto the 350. That doesn't seem like leadership to me. You're going to because I get something in this 350 million.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And to speak to this point over here, we're never going to have this opportunity ever again. So we're never going to have 350 million in front of us ever again. This is our only time right here. We're looking to pass it like as quick as we possibly can.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There's no rush to pass this here today. We could have cut this up into 100 million and housing 50 million in this. And we're dumping money into into into nonprofits all over the place. So I was threatened with this mayor going to veto 350 million because I got 5 million in there.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And now the discussion is, Oh yeah, well, she'll be able to just veto it anyway. Should I feel happy today? Should I feel like I've been uplifted today? Should I feel like I'm part of this body or part of this city today?'",

        "'speaker_1': 'On the board to make sure that they had what they wanted in the fieldhouse sway. It cost $55 million. That's why we should be building this sort of infrastructure all around the city. Build this one here, and then you'll see what we need to build for infrastructure.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Let's stop giving away contracts. 350 million basically in contracts all out the door. We're not building any city infrastructure. We're not we're not doing anything with it. That's a strong statement. We're not doing anything. We're doing plenty with it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But we're not going to be able to, like we say, look, back in ten years and look at the good we did. Nobody's going to remember anything. They don't pay attention to legislation. Don't pay attention where money goes.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, President Flynn. I would just. I just rise to chair in both the chair and Councilor Baker's frustration about the process. I think that Councilor Baker did an incredible amount of work, held hearings where young people came and spoke to the council, gave similarly impassioned speeches about the impact that this feedback was going to have in'",
        "'speaker_4': 'his neighborhood and effectively moved a lot of the council that wasn't supportive of getting the field house to be supportive of the field house because of the incredible amount of work that he did to get last minute word that the mayor wasn't going to be supporting.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That is incredibly is incredibly frustrating. And so I share in that frustration in terms of the process. With that said, I do think that it's disingenuous to say that this is for the young people after we. Councilor Baker effectively just took a vote to help kill an amendment that was supposed to be for youth jobs.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so, although I admire his spirit and I share his frustration with the process, we have had plenty of opportunities here to make sure that we're giving investing in young people. And Councilor Baker has not taken them. And so I think that that stance is a little bit disingenuous.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'However, that is not the reason why I won't be supporting this amendment. I won't be supporting this amendment because as the Chair of Housing and Community Development, I cannot make a case for removing $5 million from housing or the ARPA funds.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We're in the middle of a housing crisis. We need all of this money. Low threshold housing is a proven evidence based practice that's going to help people move through addiction and into permanent housing. And so I just want to I just want to say that I'm not going to be supporting this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you. Counsel to the chair recognizes counsel royal counsel of Royal U of the for you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'President Flynn, I have a question which is mostly around the timing of. I know why we have a deadline for the city budget because at a certain point it goes into a 112. I have a question about whether or not there's an urgency to pass this today when we still don't have that, at least what I'm hearing'",
        "'speaker_1': 'concrete sort of legal analysis as to what this will do or if this can get sort of put off until the next meeting, when we can have a further analysis on this from corporation counsel, from our own counsel and do that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I don't know if there's an urgency that I'm not aware of, which I'm happy to hear sort of the details, too, as to why this has to go through today when I think a lot of folks here are trying to figure out exactly what is happening from a legal standpoint.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I think that's for the chair that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, counsel. Very fair question, but I don't have the answer to that. COUNSEL Royal, if any of my colleagues have any information on that, that might be helpful to the body. The chair recognizes a block.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Sure. Thank you, Mr. President. So on that, I mean, one of the reasons that. One of the reasons that we're moving this today is because of the fact that the. That Council. Sorry, guys, I really am very tired.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We're doing this today in part because, as I mentioned, a huge amount of the housing. Money. Money is housing. And there is a. Mayor's Office of Housing Annual RFP that goes out in July. And it's the way that they start the process of making housing funds available.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And one of the reasons why the timeline of that is important, as opposed to just like, oh, it's up to August, etc., is because of the way that for affordable housing projects like local funds line up with state funds and federal funds and there's like a whole kind of cycle process.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And if you miss a level, then you often have to wait a year because of how the timing is done. And so again, because the money has to be spent by 2024, like all the contracts have to be signed by then, has to be totally spent by 2026, but you have to have obligated every dollar by 24'",
        "'speaker_7': '. It's that that was one of the things that precipitated the ask. I know there are also some specific things because councilors have reached out to me about particular council priorities where the urgent need is now. I do just also want to say I like.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I, I totally feel the impassioned, like sense for Councilor Baker about the field house. What I reject is the idea that the field house is the only real thing that we are talking about with the three, with the 349.5 and then the 17.7.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I mean, we're talking about everything from the extension of the green jobs program that has just launched for us to, as I mentioned before, the creation of $45 million worth of home ownership units. The building of housing on public land actually adds a whole nother level from a time perspective to acquiring.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think you have to go through the whole process, right, of RFP and public process, etc. and then you try to spend the money to build housing. I just think like the child care, I mean, to me, child care is one of those things where there's of course something left at the end because every kid who gets'",
        "'speaker_7': 'touched by an investment in child care and every family where someone's able to hold a job because they're able to put their kid in affordable child care or off hours. Child care like council over here, champion is package like.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That's all real. So I don't buy the idea that the field house is real and everything else is imaginary. And I just want to be really clear that the reason that we had to go to.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Mayor's office and and ask them to reconsider making the harbor funds that are being held for next year's budget available to the council was because, frankly, there were so many real things in the original proposal that there wasn't sufficient appetite to get rid of them.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so what we've added are more real priorities, which again, I've just spent the last week hearing from all of you colleagues about the importance of and so I just it's I just want to say there are an enormous number of things that when we talk about a Green New Deal and we talk about, you know, transforming'",
        "'speaker_7': 'the city of Boston for the better after COVID, like the things that people get excited about, they want to see them become real. And what it's going to take is the money to actually be appropriated and start getting spent.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And, you know, so I feel very strongly as well about the reality of the things in the appropriation today. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you, counsel Buck. Councilman here. Did you have your chair?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Because those on.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The chair recognize this council. I'm here. And let me just say, before councilman here speaks, I can only have one person speaking at a time. And if you want to speak, raise your hand or hit the button and I will call on you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The chair recognizes. Councilman here. Councilman, here. You have the floor.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. He realized my light was still on. But since you called on me, I'll use the time to just say something really quick. I think there's a lesson for us to learn in this entire process that I have come to see a reoccurring pattern.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And for me, oftentimes I move on principle and process. And I think these two things. What I continue to see is we have a lot to grow from and learn from. As it relates to not just this conversation just overall.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I'm just going to consider this as fits and starts. Like we're all figuring things out and assuming the best intentions, right? Because it is what it is. But to what is the most frustrating for me and I'll just speak for myself is the the last minute switch ups and information that comes trickle down.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And it seems like. It just makes it really hard for us to make informed decisions when we don't have all of the facts in front of us. And I hope that we can all learn from from this journey.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I still say that while I do appreciate the explanation, it doesn't. I'm still stuck on how we got here to begin with. But I you don't have to go belabor the point. I just want to say for the record that I it still feels to me that this whole entire journey since we've entered this budgeting process'",
        "'speaker_4': ', whether it be through the operating or whether it be through this, it just feels like the administration and the council. We've done our due diligence to find common ground. And it feels like sometimes when we get there the.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Things switch up at the last minute, and that's frustrating and that's hard to build trust when you never know what you're walking into. So I just think as we continue to move forward in our journey here that, you know, either I ask better questions so I can be better informed, so I'll take ownership for that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But then I think that there's some work that everybody needs to do, including the administration, so that we can be set up for success in the next go round. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman. Somebody here, the chair recognizes counsel. Clarity. Counsel, clarity. You have the floor.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. President. And obviously, through the through the chair to the original question, there's no time since sensitivity on it with respect to other than the the fees that go out. And we do have up until I think the 24th but through the chair, I just want to state has done tremendous work on it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I've served in that capacity the last two years and just to try to herd and pull things together and deal with the different priorities and personalities and also dealing with the administration. It's it's tough stuff. So she's done tremendous work, I believe, obviously, in in the field house and the generations of of young people and families that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that will serve. And I do believe that that that that should be, I guess, serviced and funded and supported by ARPA funds. I think that's exactly what they're for and getting to a position of having things be shovel ready and to get those services, those support and wraparound services around kids and families is, is really what makes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'this job an exciting thing to do when you can transform lives, children, families, neighborhoods and so this field how speaks to that and I think that that was sort of the spirit the intense behind ARPA that said through the chair to the original question is I guess was the question is it possible to table this I guess'",
        "'speaker_1': 'is the question. And I think that that is true. And but I would also, as a courtesy through the chair to the to and through the President to the chair, given the time and effort that has gone into her work here.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Just want to make sure that we sort of we're not disrespecting her in that process. But it is a fair ask. We meet again back here on July the 13th. There seems to be some concerns about this issue and some tension and uneasiness about whether they're supporting or not supporting and what does it mean and what does'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it mean? And then the lawyers, I don't want to see Adam stop doing the shifty swerving again. And clearly, I want Christine, our attorney, in the room, frankly, just so that we're getting a sort of a full focus on it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But if this is a situation where we need to maybe get the legal interpretation, that's a good purpose potentially for a table. Or if there's a push and pull of this, where as a legislative branch of city government, we do believe that the field house should be included in ARPA funding and we need some additional time to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'convince folks that that's appropriate. Or if folks just because we've been here now since noon and folks just want to kind of, you know, vote your conscience for all that. But I think the initial question was, is it time sensitive?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The question is no, but there are some RFP dates that through the through the presence of the chair need to be need to be adhered to. But also the other question I thought I heard was, can we table this?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Which was not sort of answered, but I don't want to speak for you, Mr. President, or the chair or the maker of the amendment. It's kind of not my space. We've got a measure of an amendment that's been seconded.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You as the president, obviously as the chief parliamentarian here. And then we also have the chair of the committee, and then we actually have a legitimate ask from one of our colleagues. And so within that sort of happy to just offer advice on it, but I want to defer it to the folks that have spent the time'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and have put the effort into this process yet.'",

        "'speaker_0': ', we get more information from our central staff, also from legal counsel, probably at the at the mayor's office. That was the question I believe you asked, counsel, clarity and counsel Arroyo asked.

        "'speaker_0': ', because I think you might have some information that might be helpful to the body.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So that is.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mr. President. What I would say is, in terms of order of operations, I think that Counselor Baker has an active and seconded amendment on the docket that I've been speaking to. I think we need to take a vote on that docket.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think that is depending on whether the amendment fails or passes. I could address the question of tabling, but I can't I don't feel like I can address the question of tabling a docket where. The. Where where it's not clear yet what docket we're talking about.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's either the one that was originally proposed or the one modified as by Councilor Baker.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you, Counsel. BLOCK I know I'm going to call on counsel. Baker Then I'm going to call on counsel. Arroyo After counsel. Baker You were next.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Counsel and Counsel Arroyo.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That sort of answers the question. I was going to say if it was withdrawn to the table, but it sounds like that's been answered.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So thank you, counsel. No further comments. No further questions. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. The chair recognizes counsel to counsel. You have the floor.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I withdraw my question. It was answered.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. The chair recognizes Counsel Fernandez Anderson. Counsel Fernandez. Innocent. You have the floor.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Give counsel back.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chair. So if Councilor Baker's amendment were to fail, then the docket would not face this legal question. So obviously, I would not be looking to table it if Counselor Baker's amendment were to succeed.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Then the legal question would be on the table and then, like, you know, like consider tabling it. You might want to have further conversation the body. But but yes, that's why that's why I said it matters, because if the amendment fails, then there wouldn't be a legal reason to table it for two weeks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, counsel. It's it's my understanding in talking to the clerk that the only way it could be tabled is if Counsel Baker agreed to table it.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Better if this goes longer. This is my time right here. I want to see a vote on this. I've asked, you know, we should have had some sort of expression of of support on this. I had the hearing we had the hearing back in April.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Four people have known this for four months. So this if this goes two weeks or whatever, it doesn't get any better from me. 5 million doesn't get in there. 2 million doesn't get in there. Nothing gets in there for me.'",
