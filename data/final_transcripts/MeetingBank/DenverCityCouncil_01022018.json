        "'speaker_6': 'And especially I want to commend the outreach to young people that it does from not just from the Denver area, but I think all over the country, but mostly the Western states. It's a very forward looking organization and a very forward looking show.'",

    "A bill for an ordinance approving a proposed Purchase and Sale Agreement between the City and County of Denver and the State of Colorado, by and through its Department of Transportation, to purchase property located at 4201 E. Arkansas Avenue. Approves a purchase and sale agreement with the State of Colorado for $651,250 to purchase property located at 4201 East Arkansas Avenue, and work with an identified buyer to ensure ensuing development is consistent with existing neighborhood, area plans, and economic and job development in Council District 6.  The last regularly scheduled Council meeting within the 30-day review period is on 1-22-18.  The Committee approved filing this bill at its meeting on 12-12-17.": [
        "'speaker_3': 'The right councilman Cashman All right. Under bills for final consideration, no items have been called out and under pending. No items have been caught out. Madam Secretary, let's just look at all those, I think, within a block. You can bring them up on the screen.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Councilman Cashman, you can make a comment.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you, Mr. President. For those who are not informed, the Colorado Department of Transportation is moving out of a couple of properties in the Virginia Village neighborhood and District six. They're building new facilities down by Mile High Stadium, and they've placed these two properties for sale.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'See that headquarters site? Most people have familiarity with at Arkansas, East Arkansas Avenue and South Birch Street. It's about 12 acres. The see that also has occupied the region one headquarters site at 2000 South Harley Street, a little bit smaller at 11 acres.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'See that was required by ordinance to offer these properties to other governmental entities first. And Denver entered into a competitive bidding situation. We felt I agreed with the administration. It's in Denver's best interests to try to control the disposition of these properties as much as possible.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And a lot of hard work by our real estate department and Office of Economic Development. And we did secure the rights to negotiate on these properties. These four contracts that we have before us tonight have Denver facilitating the transfer of ownership of both locations from SEED out to an organization known as the Control Group.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I see Jimmy Beloff us over here with his cards. You want to wave your hands at Mr. Belov so people can send you gifts and thank you cards along the way? The cost of the 11 acres on South Holly Street is 5.25 million.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The property? The 12 acres on Arkansas in Birch. A bit more expensive coming in at 14 million. As I've stated since first hearing about the sale of these properties, I am very excited at the opportunity to help guide redevelopment of these sites, but I'm also very aware of the substantial challenges that these projects present.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And in order for something to occur here that benefits the community rather than stifles it. It's going to take a real partnership between the developer and the city and the affected neighborhoods. The initial proposal over on South Holley Street involves construction of some 200 for sale three story townhomes, possibly 50 to 60 assisted senior housing units.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The developer does not need a rezoning here. The existing IMX three zoning allows for this use, and while a public process is not required since the zoning is in hand, Castro has agreed to engage in a dialog with the community in an effort to arrive at a project that addresses as many of their needs and concerns as'",
        "'speaker_9': 'possible. It is in cointreau's best interests to to establish that dialog on Holley, because the project that will eventually be proposed over at Arkansas and Birch is a much more expensive project and therefore is likely to have a much more intense use on the property and potential impacts.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And being so much more complex to meet the developer's bottom line and the community's needs and desires is going to take a real effort. The contract between the city and Castro requires them to apply for a rezoning on Arkansas and a full, full public process.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I would expect that information on the basic frame. Work of that public process in the next couple of weeks. The developer has talked early on about 150. Affordable housing units on the southeast portion of that property in the 60% AMI range.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Perhaps a health club on the northern part of the property and possibility of other residential retail office uses. It is very early in the structure of that project and as a lot of moving parts that will come out as we get involved in the public process.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I want to emphasize that the current contract talks about for Arkansas a five month due diligence time period. In other words, the developer looks at the project, talks to the community about a rezoning. The city looks at what the developer is proposing, and either side can decide to move ahead or are call quits on the deal'",
        "'speaker_9': '. There's an opportunity for the developer to purchase three additional 30 day due diligence periods, I think for $100,000 each. So which gives you eight months, which sounds like a lot of time. And in a project of this complexity, it's not a lot of time at all.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It's actually a rather compressed time period. And I'm concerned that it's not enough time and that it may require for added development, added flexibility on the part of the developer, and see that for whatever additional time is needed for a full discussion to get this deal done.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I mentioned earlier that I believe the city plays a critical role in seeing this project to a successful fruition. And by that I referred to the need for traffic mitigation measures that will address whatever increases in density come with the projects, as well as regulation of the construction process so that neighbors are protected from unnecessary noise, pollutants'",
        "'speaker_9': 'and traffic along the way. My experience on council thus far is that our agencies frequently show a greater understanding of the needs of the developer than the residents in these situations, and that's not going to work moving forward.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I look forward to working with the community and the developer to do what's right for Virginia Village and for Denver. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'All right. Thank you, Councilman Cashman. We Councilman Cashman does not want to take action on these. So this concludes all the items that need to be called out. All other bills for interdiction are ordered published. We are now ready for the block votes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Council members. This is. This is a consent or block vote. And you will need to vote. Otherwise, it's your last chance to call it an item for a separate vote. Councilwoman, can you please put the resolutions for adoption in the bills for final consideration for final passage on the floor?'",

I move that resolutions be adopted and bills and final consideration be placed upon final consideration and do pass in a block for the following items all 2017 unless otherwise noted. 14, 11, 14, 12, 14, 13, 14, 14, 14, 15, 14, 31, 1436, 1437, 1438, 1439, 1440 1441, 1442 1443 1328 1372 1408 1445 1302 1303'",

There's been a significant amount of redevelopment in the area, an increase in population. That's increased demand for commercial uses, such as what is on the property and residential uses.'",

And as we rush toward getting these projects completed, let's see if we can get some plumbers out of this deal for poor people trained and some painters trained.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And not just people who stand on the corner holding the sign for traffic. We're actually skilled labor so that that labor can be transformed into a permanent position. So that basically we evolved from being poor and we advance ourselves up the scale.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So the history of the city has been a top down organization in terms of how they go about doing things, and the trickle down process just doesn't work. And so by the time it trickles down, there's nothing left for us to do or that we're in training programs that last longer than the project.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So then we're trained to be unemployed. And so we must bridge the gap on this thing. And in the time, lies have to be organized. And I salute you, Councilman Brooks, for being on top of this kind of thing, because I know you've been doing a lot of work in the community to get the laborers skills and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'whatnot being boosted up through community organizations like the Urban League and whatnot. So as we continue on this process of. I just want to again say. Thank you for taking on the task and to stay consistent with the process.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that's about all I got to say. So I'm gonna cut this short because I know you all really want to go to the big show. Everybody here for the big show. So I'm through. Thank you very much.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I just wanted to ask the applicants, Representative. I don't see anybody here from the honey neighborhood. If there is, maybe they could raise their hand and come forward. What I'm trying to find out is the letter from the neighborhood association, which looks more like a resolution than a letter, speaks to a number of'",
        "'speaker_8': 'conditions. And I'm trying to find out if there is if there were covenants filed or is this just, you know, a gentlemen's agreement between the neighborhood and the applicant who is proposing the rezoning?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So yeah, with the the meeting with honey, one of their conditions is that when you file a deed restriction for any future development of the property to not exceed the building or any kind of characteristics of the building that's already there.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'To my knowledge, it was a negotiation that I'm assuming has been recorded already or is going to be recorded shortly. I was not a part of that process. Okay. Yeah, I was just speaking to the characteristics of any future redevelopment, which we don't have any plan right now.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. So the conditions that speak to noise hours of operation are related to the existing operation that's there or any proposal.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That they talked about. The good the good neighbor agreement or the deed restriction.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The good neighbor agreement.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. So in the U.S., the good neighbor agreement is a couple of years ago for the existing business. They were there, Kobe and the restaurant.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. But what, if any, of that changes? That's where the deed restriction comes in related to a potential re-use on the site and whatnot.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Correct? Yeah. Okay. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think that answers all my questions. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'All right. Thank you, Councilman Ortega. Okay, we have Councilman Flynn. You're up.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I wanted to follow on because Councilwoman Ortega actually asked almost answer both of my questions. But the condition, the conditional support Scott or the applicant could answer from honey was basically predicated on the filing of this deed restriction.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Is that correct? Were there any other conditions on Honey's support of this?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'No, that's my knowledge. It was the conditions outlined in the letter in the packet to be recorded in a deed restriction. Again, I'm not 100% sure where it is in the process, whether it's already been filed.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Or will be done. But that was the condition and there were no others. That is what I was doing. Okay. And in the staff report, it said that is it. I'm sorry. Maybe you could answer was the owner does not intend to redevelop the property.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Does the owner intend to rehabilitate the building? He already has. Okay. I haven't been up there since it was little Pilipinas broke my heart. I really did. If you bring back a little bit Pinas, I go to every day.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But so the intent is to keep the building as it is. And this deed restriction would require preservation or would it require, if it were to be replaced or what?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm going to ask you to come to the mike, because we're kind of having this side conversation here.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So which one?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So the deed restriction would require that if the building somehow were damaged, were were destroyed, had to be replaced, it would have to be replicated or the same character or the exterior.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Same character, the setbacks, the height restrictions, the amount of residential units that would be allowed the, I guess, greenspace in there, the parking access, everything that is existing now would have to be replicated with any new building. The only reason right now that we're trying to get this rezoning is actually from another building of ours that had'",
        "'speaker_10': 'the same issue where it was used and was not the zoning did not match use. Right. And the building actually fell in on itself. And so that's when we realized we should probably go ahead and look at everything else.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Because that up in the same neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It is.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah, I remember that.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Yeah. So that's when we started evaluating all the other properties that would kind of fit this criteria and this was kind of the best fit. Thank you for any of your sound.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. I want to thank you for for doing that. For going that extra measure. Excellent. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'All right. Thank you. Councilman Flynn. Councilman Espinosa.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So I'm personally in sort of distress right now. So what is your role again with the project?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I work for the property owner.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But the property owner doesn't give you didn't give you any authority to speak on their behalf or you do.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'All I do. And they told me to be here. They're both out of the country right now.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Never mind. Just got the confirmation. I was like, Yeah, yeah, yeah. Because there was some tense moments in the community conversation with the property owner leading up to this. And it's and I'm talking about things that aren't actually technically part of what we're supposed to be considering among our criteria.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But it is fundamentally frustrating. And this sort of sounds like comment.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Never mind. Okay. We'll we'll get you a comment. Thank you, sir. All right. Seeing no other questions public here for council Bill 26 is closed. Comments by members of council councilmen as one of them.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So. So you you start to sort of started to see me sort of speaking to my sort of process or what have you. One of my frustrations in the zoning code, if you've been watching for any number of times over the last two and a half years since we adopted this new zoning code in 2010, it has'",
        "'speaker_11': 'had the provisions, just like the prior zoning code, to use incorporate waivers and conditions, which is customized zoning. You can modify any base zone district to accommodate certain things, but then we have these policies that are not law ordinances, laws, zoning code is law policies, not law.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Those are rules. We can change them. We can deviate. But, you know, then all hell breaks loose if we don't follow our policy so we can amend our policy regardless of the thing I'm rambling about is when we rezoning the entire city, we re zoned it one size fits all.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'You know, we try to do the best we can, but we recognize that it is a huge area and it's got a lot of different things in our zoning code. Sort of tries to capture everything, but we recognize that there are differences.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'There are differences between Southeast Denver differences and Green Valley Ranch and Highland between South Broadway and Walsh Park or, you know, there's there's just a lot of variety, which is what's probably what's really great about the fabric of Denver.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And in order to address concerns from one neighborhood to another, you could use waivers and conditions, or you can use any number of tools. But because of the impact, the lack of us willing to use our legal tools based on policy, yes, we've had to work with other tools that are essentially tacitly supported by our director of'",
        "'speaker_11': 'community planning development. I mean, Brad Buchanan has come to me and said, look, I, I prefer private party, third party agreements, developer agreements over codifying in zoning.

        "'speaker_11': 'signs it versus the developer or whoever owns it. And so. But regardless. One thing that we we've seen repeatedly in northwest Denver, where we're experiencing sort of a rash of redevelopment pressures, gentrification and other issues, and some character altering new projects is when we have a rezoning that allows something that is very, very, very, very much by'",

And there is no constraint in or or or nothing in our zoning code that necessarily dictates esthetics or orientation to the degree that it, you know, should fenestration and what have you. So I'm rambling, but my point is, is that there is a a serious disconnect that we have as a community, work together on time'",
        "'speaker_11': 'and time again to bring forward tools, work with developers, because the reality is, is where the community is and the where the developer is are typically not as far apart as we might think. The developer, you know, but the the problem is, is the zoning code that one size fits all tool allows a whole bunch of other'",
        "'speaker_11': 'things that may not capture the community's desires or the developers desires. And so we have successfully used these third party agreements, these developer agreements to address those outliers and to bring both parties closer together and to an area where what would might be a contentious situation, not be a contentious situation.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And so I've actually talked more than all of those presentations just in this thing, because what I was stressing about was all that the fact that we have all these balls that we have to juggle just to get everybody who's actually all rowing in the same direction in community, to sort of work around the fact that our'",
        "'speaker_11': 'zoning code actually would in fact allow something that was community disruptive and and potentially detrimental if we just went in a straight use by right situation.

        "'speaker_11': 'planning board hearing. So that's to hearing two public meetings before this one that where that had been discussed, but it had never been executed. And so that was what was concerning is that, you know, did we get to this point where everyone was in agreement, but we didn't have any written documents?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And the problem is, again, that is not. Substantive to our decision making because our criteria remains the same, whether that third party agreement exists or not. But I can tell you that there are tools in the zoning code that could address these very same things.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We just choose as a city, as a matter of policy that comes from the administration. To not do this. At that level where the city can enforce that. And so that is something that I wish would change. It could change.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It should change. But until then, we have this thing. And so all that said, I want to thank you for and, your Honor, the person that you work for. I thank the city for sort of recognizing that it's there, but not and my my constituents and honey who aren't here because they actually support this measure for all'",

And the good faith, I didn't have any acknowledgment up until right now that the good faith of all that communication had had come to fruition.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So I do feel relieved to know that development is going to exist in the way that it. It's already been moving forward. The community has assurances that things in the future would also be consistent with with the owners wishes and the community's wishes.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And with that I will with all that rambling, I will be supporting this measure but having nothing to do with that and purely do with the criteria because it does in fact meet its criteria. And I should acknowledge that that this is our least intense.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'This is to X, right? This is our least intensive zone district designed specifically for incorporation in area, in neighborhoods, existing single family to unit fabric. So it is consistent with our adopted plans and all the criteria that we would normally meet with.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'I'm a board member of the Rock Drill Lofts. And pending everything this more I just said. And that the design of the 39th channel happens per the design that's been shown thus far that we approve the park and think it would be a great amenity for Cole.'",

I'm a resident of the Overlook at Park Hill and I currently sit on our board. My wife and I have led the mass migration to Denver some five years ago in search of greater opportunity.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We are blessed to call Denver our home and couldn't be happier with their choice to buy our first house in the north end of Dexter Court overlooking the Port Hill Golf Course. While it's clear we will be directly affected by any development of the park golf course, including the water detention plan on the northeast end of the'",

        "'speaker_10': 'Like many before me, due to the awful traffic conditions that already sit there. I'm here, though, to address a bigger issue that affects not just my neighborhood, but the community and the nation that surrounds it. And that is the issue of our physical and our mental health and the lack of spaces that allow adults to play.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We already know that exercise is scientifically proven to reduce anxiety, stress and depression. We also know that being in nature leads to many physical and mental benefits. I don't need to throw those statistics out, but what you don't hear often is how adults, especially those living in big cities, lack access to spaces that provide opportunity for play'",
        "'speaker_10': '. With City Park Golf Course. Closing Denver is slowly eliminating spaces for play. Not everyone can afford skiing and biking in the mountain. This amazing city, known for its outdoor beauty and active lifestyle, is the valuing how significant spaces that provide joy, energy and competition for adults really are.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Play is more than about having fun. The state of social play brings us sanity. Play allows us to problem, solve, decompress and unplug from the screens and the stresses of our daily lives. It leads to higher productivity, lower anxiety, and simply are having a happier life.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It enhances creative thinking and innovation. The Denver metro area has plenty of space for development, but not for open space. The Park Hill golf course is a direct reflection of the wonderful, diverse community that is Park Hill. While the golf course and banquet centers certainly need a major facelift and to be pulling in more money each year'",
        "'speaker_10': ', the potential to make it a thriving community space is huge. It is a priceless sanctuary where people come to relax, vent, celebrate, practice, compete with themselves and strive to be better. Take away that space and you're taking away something sacred.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We're quickly losing our connection with the Earth, the community, and the importance of play spaces to calm or busy minds and to let go in the warm sun to enjoy stunning snow, peak mountain views, crisp, fresh air, year round spaces that teach vision, confidence, action and follow through and consistency.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Currently, I have a signed petitions circulating along with a nonscientific survey gathering all nearby residents that are simply against the development of this space. I'm proud to say that we've already already nearing about a thousand people against the development, and this is just after a month of circulation.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The people want to be heard and they don't feel they are. This is my small way of providing a platform for them to voice their opinion without opening a can of worms with 100 different ideas of what to turn that land into.'",

The nonprofit that I lead helps ensure quality and effective early learning and care experience for some of the most vulnerable children in Denver.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We are also the trustee of the George W Clayton Trust. Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you tonight about the L.A. Four, a portion of the property currently occupied by the Park Hill Golf Course. As you are aware, this this land has been an asset of the Clayton Trust since Mr. Clayton's death in 1899, and'",
        "'speaker_0': 'its use was changed from agriculture to golf. The city as then trustee of the trust in about 1930. At that time, golf play was seen as the best use of the land to generate revenue in support of the young children who are the beneficiaries of Mr. Clayton's trust.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have partnered with the city for many years, both in providing services to vulnerable children through the Head Start program and in managing this property to ensure it contributes to to ensure it continues to be leveraged in support of the beneficiaries of the trust, as Mr. Clayton envisioned.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'His assets would be used after his death. For several years, we have been aware of the city's need for land to solve the flooding that occurs in the Park Hill Basin. We and some of the families we serve have witnessed this flooding firsthand.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In addition, we are aware that the northeast corner of the property is a natural low spot and water pools there every time the summer rains come. Therefore, we support this land acquisition ordinance. As the city moves forward with design of the stormwater facility.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We ask that you keep in mind that the purpose of this property is to support the beneficiaries of Mr. Clayton's trust. As you know, we have been and will continue to be engaged in a community visioning process for potential future uses of this property.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'While the exact timing of any potential future alternative uses of the property is not presently known, we hope that the stormwater planning process will be such that future considerations of the highest and best use of the property as a trust asset will be kept in mind.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We'd also like to ask that you continue that we continue to be involved in the input process for the stormwater planning. Thank you very much and I'd be happy to answer any questions.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Ms.. Brindley. Janet Feder.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Good evening. My name is Janet. I am speaking on Bill 1396. I live on Gilman Street, about two feet away from the proposed 39th Avenue Open Channel. Since I last spoke to you two weeks ago, I discovered that old maps of my neighborhood at the Denver Public Library reveal the empty paved lot paved over a lot.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Next to my home there once stood a duplex built sometime around the year of construction of my own home in the 1890s when digging for the 39th Avenue Greenway begins and the pavement comes up. The Stone Foundation to that duplex and whatever else was paved over will need to be excavated one block to the east of me'",
        "'speaker_0': '. The lot at the end of Williams there stood as my neighbor, Mr. Ed Armijo has repeatedly said, a gasoline filling station. Absent any evidence of its removal, the pavement comes up there. We expect to find a leaky leaded holding tank.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Please hear me. It's not the presence of these things that trouble me. It's the absence of curiosity, investigation and transparency on the part of the EPA and the attendant unwillingness to advocate for the well-being of the coal community.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That has me so concerned. What would that advocacy look like? It would look like the EPA reclassifying these lots as part of the new one or creating a new force specifically for these parcels along 39th Avenue that previously went unclassified and need to be treated as the paved over industrial and residential lots.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They are they need to be tested for contaminants. Now their designation has changed and that land is going to become the 39th Avenue Greenway. The EPA needs to treat them with the same care they showed to residential yards and parks, quite simply because, as we're told, 39th Avenue is going to become a park.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There is a shell game happening here. We can see it and we're trying to stop it because we all know who wins at Shell games. So who are we? We are citizens with careers in a broad variety of fields.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We are parents and retired folk. We are the self-employed and people who work for other people. We have both growing and aging families who need us first. It took us a while to get up to speed with the reams of data pertaining to soil and water and chemical contamination and the processes of city and federal government.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We made our discoveries in fits and starts. We forged our acquaintances with each other as we shared and pondered the information spooned out to us at monthly meetings. We stayed in touch. We grew stronger and smarter. Many of us now communicate several times a day.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The people in my community are being treated disrespectfully. We are not a sleepy, impoverished community, happy for handouts. We are a coalesced group of concerned citizens who have found each other. We found experts themselves concerned and also experienced to advise us.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All of us spend hours upon hours to understand what is happening around us, not paying a penny while we face off against omnipotent acting planners and powerbrokers, representatives of government and a Goliath sized project. We've concluded that absent a full environmental risk analysis of this project as required by federal law, neither US nor SEMA nor anyone else'",

        "'speaker_7': 'childhood education. As much as I am in support of that, that venue, I have even a greater ideal that concerns me even about the conversation that's taking place today. Which leads to my second point, and that's the argument regarding open space versus residential space, very easy for people who have a home to make a decision for people'",
        "'speaker_7': 'who don't have homes, to not have the opportunity to find residents in that particular part of our community, to be able to talk about open space versus residential space, I think is a a great overlook of one of the greatest challenges we have in the Denver community, and that's providing housing for people who need it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We don't need more open space. We need residential space so that those who are having to live in open space because they don't have a home can potentially find residences. So I think that's important for the council to consider.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'One of the opportunities engaging with the project with Clayton gives us at least the possibility of creating residential affordable housing for people in that community. Which leads to my last point. There have been conversations or even concerns about whether or not Clayton should be engaged with the city and trying to create this kind of partnership, which would'",

        "'speaker_1': 'should be paid attention to. And so while we really appreciate the process that's happened so far, I definitely agree that we need more data and more evidence and a better analysis to say that what's about to happen in coal is safe for the families and for the children who live in that neighborhood.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Morse. I live in the coal neighborhood, and I have a question for you. Has there been a misuse of taxpayer dollars or possibly an environmental cover up? And what might this mean for other environmentally compromised areas of Denver?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There are pre excavation testing at global reported. 1% of one sample contained asbestos. The project budget allocated $255,000 for an asbestos inspector to be on site and $2 million for the removal of regulated asbestos contaminated soil, a much more costly disposal designation than ordinary soil.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Through October, more than 80,000 cubic yards of asbestos contaminated soil has been removed. So our taxpayer dollars being misused for the soil removal, whereas the asbestos label being used as a pretext for other nasty debris and contamination at the Globeville site.'",

Although designated a highly contaminated Superfund site in 1999, has yet to be fully studied nor cleaned up.'",

But Denver City Council, you should not accept this as our legacy or our heritage. And what about that Swansea smelter on the map I just gave to you?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I found it on an 1880s map of Denver, but I haven't seen any environmental documentation on the impacts the smelter may have had on Swansea, a coal or other close by neighborhoods. So before you sign that $78 million contract to authorize work in an area full of unknowns, I urge you to exercise your fiscal responsibility for ensuring'",
        "'speaker_1': 'taxpayer dollars are wisely spent. Cost overruns are avoided, and that you ensure environmental protections for your constituents by requiring a full environmental study of the 39th Avenue Channel with only. I have something important. So there are three borings done.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's the extent of the testing that was done by your contractors in the coal segment. Three borings in coal. That's it. And as we learned, Janet's fence is going to be taken down. That's how close is going to be.'",

We're an owner occupied neighborhood, so we don't have a deed restriction. But we do have a covenant put in place by Clayton, by the city of Denver and by Coffman of Road Homes.'",

        "'speaker_13': 'I'm not sure Clayton should be involved. I'm not sure any development should happen whatsoever. And I'm not in favor of the land acquisition ordinance at all. I'm not in favor of our conservation easement going away. I just learned last month that our conservation easement is in serious jeopardy.'",

So I would like you to know that the the family members and the children of Clayton would like to support you as you move forward with the purchase'",
        "'speaker_6': 'of your land acquisition at Park Hill for storm water planning. As long as you know that the area as long as special interests. Want to keep it. 100% open space. That type of development is probably not going to be able to support the true mission of Clayton, the trust of Clayton, and also the children of Clayton.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If it's left open space and we have no, no, no resources to to to to raise funds to support Clayton, that mission that was that was created by Mr. Clayton in 1899, who will die. So I just wanted to let you know that is what's on our mind and what is our greatest concern.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'All right. Thank you, sir. Okay. Editorial.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Good evening, Councilman. Councilwoman. My name's it. Ami Ho, 3647 High Street. Instead of me ranting and raving and I put my thoughts together because evidently the majority of you do not listen, please pay attention. It is all hand in hand.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Good evening. I am very concerned about the 39th Avenue project. Both bills. There has been many poisonous chemicals released in the area for more than a century. I was poisoned in Vietnam with Agent Orange. Poisoned. Poisoned. I did not find out until 2006.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'I have a miserable lifestyle now in Danang, Vietnam. To this day, there are thousands of children that are so many from their families abandoned because they were poisoned. The air base in Danang has been covered with concrete to stop the spread of Agent Orange.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'It was in the water and it still is. And the food supply chain, it was too late to poison. Most of the Vietnam veterans were exposed. They carry the poison in their DNA. It is passed on to our children.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'My sons have DNA. I carry. My eldest son has a child that is affected. He is mentally slow. And his brain his brain is bigger than his skull to fit in. I have nothing. I have a non-biological grandson I raised since birth.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'He is 25 now. He's got the mentality of a seven year old and he's got medical issues. His real grandfather died of cancer due to Agent Orange poisoning. Pay attention. Poisoning. His grandson is also affected. That's the grandson I am raising.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Think about the earth you are going to disturb. No telling what is going to be released. You have kids. You have grandkids. Some of you have probably have great grandkids. Put yourself in our shoes that are fighting this.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Think. How would you feel if you knew your kids were exposed to poison and you knew you could have you knew you should have stopped it. Think with your heart, not with your pocket, not hanging around with all these developers, because I have seen a number of you after some of these meetings wouldn't talk to me.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'But George, buddy, buddy with the developers. Here is one resolution.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Mr. Armijo. Thank you for your time.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Let me read my resolution because this is very important to the audience or I'll just pass it on.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm sorry. We got more folks right behind you. Thank you, sir. All right. The next five, Debi James, Jason Janz, Jay Morse, and Maria Flora. Lastly, Brad Cameron. Jason. Oh, Debbie Chance, you're up first. Deborah James. Ms.. James, you're first.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hi, I'm Debbie James. I live on the Sixth Avenue Parkway in Mayfair Park neighborhood, which is adjacent to Lowry. A few years ago, I looked out my front window and saw a man standing in my yard. I went outside and asked what they were doing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They said they were from Denver Wastewater Management, and they were looking at my property as a place to run through with a concrete ditch which would drain all of Mayfair parks. Large storm events. These large storms have been flooding my neighbors, my three neighbors homes to the south for years.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Alarmed, I mentioned that Mayfair Park had never had a comprehensive stormwater plan. And why didn't we deserve storm drains, pipes and the rest of the infrastructure that most of the rest of the neighborhoods in Denver enjoyed? I was told that the concrete ditch was what wastewater was going to do to solve the problem of flooding in Mayfair'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Park. I told them to budget extra money to cover the lawsuit I intended to file. This is what I learned to do after working for nine years on the redevelopment of the Lowry Air Force Base. When the wealthy and developers colluded with the city to make lives of citizens in the adjacent affected neighborhoods miserable.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We citizens of Mayfair Park fought back. And as a result, I was told by Jim Meadows, director of our Redevelopment Authority, that the LRA board thought you people in Mayfair Park were too poor and then educated to give us any trouble.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'A short time after the wastewater man's visit, my husband and our neighbors to the west and I were invited to a meeting where advisor the project was going forward. It would entail a ten foot wide, three foot deep, concrete ditch running window.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, two window well between our two homes. My neighbor demanded to know what would happen when the ditch overflowed. He was rebuffed. My husband and I were advised that we would have to, at our own expense, cut down 50 year old trees and shrubs, tear at our redwood privacy fence, and demolish an art studio which all stood'",
        "'speaker_0': 'in the way of where the city would put its concrete ditch. Since we had dared place these amenities on our own property over an easement, despite improvements being done following Denver City Code, we were given site maps and later I noticed that the easement was for sanitary sewer, not waste water.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'My neighbor, who's an attorney, drafted a letter and so did my husband and I. The end of the story is that all of the sudden the city found money to install comprehensive wastewater infrastructure in Mayfair Park, which includes immense underground cisterns that hold big flood events until they can disperse onward.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'How this happened is still a mystery, but now an even worse plan for a ditch is being forced on other neighborhoods because we citizens are left in the dark until unwanted projects are about to unfold in our communities.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then we are traded for being too late to respond and further on told that our responses are inadequate. But tonight, members of City Council, you have a chance to set things right. We are the oppressed and trampled on.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Citizens of Denver appealed to your hearts and compassion to do the right thing by calling a halt to the travesty of the 39th Avenue ditch. We citizens are being treated, can speak contemptuous of judges who handsome salaries we pay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I urge you to vote.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'No. Thank you, Miss James. Jason Janse.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'My name is Jason Jantz. I am a resident at 2938 Humboldt Street. I've lived in Northeast Denver for the past ten years and I'm the CEO of Cross Purpose, which is a career and community development program that helps 100 families, mainly in northeast Denver, move out of poverty and get a middle class income within 12 months.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We also are one of the largest tenants on the current Clayton campus and I'm a member of the Peacock Park Advisory Council.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Regarding 1396.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'My request is simply that the decision that is made in the land be used to further the mission of Clayton. For these children, Clayton must thrive. They educate hundreds of children. And early childhood, we know, is essential to the children in our city, especially those who are most vulnerable to get a great education.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I believe Clayton, after working with been on the campus for the last six years, that they invest serious effort and finances to do whatever it takes to get kids especially from vulnerable backgrounds, kindergarten ready. And so I my heart goes out to them and I just want to make sure that that mission goes forward.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We are currently working with them to pilot a two generation approach to poverty, whereas even some of our adults that we are working with dropped their kids off at their learning center, and then the parents walk across the yard and they join a career development program.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And we're seeing generational poverty being changed on that campus. Many. If not all of us in the neighborhood would like to preserve a good portion of the property for parks and open space. The extent of how much is probably the rub, and we look forward to a continued strong collaborative process to figure that out.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And this is a complicated issue that many of us have a hard time keeping up with, as many of my neighbors have testified here to tonight. But I would just ask that in the decision you make that you really are at the forefront of the mission of Clayton as a serve the kids in the forefront of your'",
        "'speaker_7': 'mind. And by protecting their mission, you protect and provide for families that are vulnerable in our neighborhood.'",

And I just want to express my support for the Cole neighbors in requesting the council hold back its vote on the $78 million CMA contract until a thorough environmental study has been conducted.'",

        "'speaker_11': 'Looking at these contracts.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Three borings. As Kimberly said, that's it. Only three borings. There's a lot of poison out there.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So I ask that you take that in consideration.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And put a pause.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'On this vote until a full environmental impact study can be done.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Morse. Maria Flora.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Good evening. My name's Mario Flora. I live at 26 Albion Street. I'm here just to oppose 17, 13, 96. I'm an open space advocate. I'm opposed because of my concern for the effect of this ordinance on that open space conservation easement that the city acquired in 1997 for $2 million.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I don't believe that council has been adequately informed. As to the effect that this ordinance is going to potentially have on that conservation easement and the resulting loss of open space. Now, each of you council members received an email from Woody Guernsey on December 16 of this year or last year, rather, about the legal issues surrounding the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'conservation easement and the condemnation clause in the conservation easement itself. Mr. Guernsey warned of the Council's inadvertent termination of that conservation easement by exercising the right of eminent domain on that property and the concomitant loss of the $2 million investment that the city has made in that conservation easement and the loss of any opportunity potentially to preserve'",
        "'speaker_0': 'that as open space. By starting this condemnation process. I ask council to be advocates for the citizens of Denver in preserving this conservation easement, at least for the present time. Now, in the conservation easement itself, there is what we call a condemnation clause.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I don't know if you all have read the agency agreement, the conservation easement.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'All of these documents over the years that have come forward in this mess over the Park Hill golf course and the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Relationship with Clayton College in the city of Denver, it's an embarrassing mess, but there is a condemnation clause in the easement and it says that if there is a taking to the exercise of the power of eminent domain by the city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So that the golf course is no longer physically capable of being operated as a Regulation 18 hole golf course and driving range on that land. Then Clayton College has the right to terminate the conservation easement period. Now, this clause doesn't say, Well, it's okay if it's only for two years, it's okay if it's only a temporary easement'",
        "'speaker_0': 'on this part and a permanent easement on the rest. That's all left to interpretation. I was. Unsettled when I watched.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Thank you. All right. Brad Cameron.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm here to talk about Park Hill golf course, and I thank you for that opportunity. My name is Brad Cameron. I reside at 1200 Humboldt Street, which is immediately adjacent to Cheesman Park. I've lived there for over 20 years and during that time I have seen the public's use of Cheesman Park increased dramatically.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And Cheesman Park is not the is is not alone in that regard. All of Denver's large regional parks have seen similar increases. I'm not complaining. It's wonderful to see so many people using and enjoying Denver's park system, and especially so many young people.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But Denver continues to grow in population. We are on track to add 100,000 new residents this decade, with downtown alone expected to have 20,000 housing units added between 2010 and 2020. And this is an exaggeration, but sometimes it does feel like on a summer weekend they're all in Cheesman Park.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Now, that's why preservation of open space, such as Park Hill golf course is so important to continue to be an attractive city for existing residents. It's imperative that Denver maintain and protect the open space that we already have.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That certainly was the vision of Mayor Wellington Webb, who, with the help of city council back in 1997, led the city in its purchase of a conservation easement to protect in perpetuity the open space of park old golf course from development.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That conservation easement cost the citizens of Denver 2 million, which at that time was its fair market value, and that was an arm's length transaction that Clayton knowingly entered into. Now, today, the benefits of that conservation easement are more important than ever.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The Land Acquisition Ordinance before you today, most likely, in my opinion, will not in and of itself threaten the open space of the golf course. But there are few who think that this will be the final chapter of the story.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'A return to talk of developing Park Hill golf course is clearly in the wind. Now, finally, I want to echo the comments made by Councilwoman Kennish back in early December, when this matter was before the Finance and Governance Committee.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Her request was that in the future, there be more transparency on the part of the Hancock administration when dealing with Park Hill golf course matters. Obviously, that is not entirely within the power of city council. But hopefully all of you will join Councilwoman Canete in requesting that from Mayor Hancock.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you, Mr. Cameron.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'All right. We're going to call the next. Let's see here. Next five. All right. We'll call the next five people up. Kathleen Wells. Eris Shiner Shiner. Woody Guernsey. Georgia. Guernsey. Chairman say. And the last person I'm going to call up is Lois Dahl.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'These are our last six here. Ms.. Wells, you are first.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Good evening. My name is Kathleen Wells. Thank you for the opportunity to speak. I'm speaking tonight about the golf course. The Denver mayor is among the 388 U.S. mayors who have pledged to adopt the Paris climate accord. These mayors agreed in June of this past year they would refuse to endorse any executive order that rolled back policies'",
        "'speaker_0': 'to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, because to enforce such policies would threaten every American community's health and safety. Now the city of Denver recognizes climate change as a defining issue of the 21st century. And the city is committed to facing the challenges of a changing climate through preparedness.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'These facts have everything to do with tonight's discussion of the preservation or demolition of the 155 acre Park Hill golf course. Why? Because trees, grass and natural vegetation absorb carbon dioxide and therefore reduce the amount of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere that contributes to global warming.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The more open green space we have, the better able we are to mitigate and to adapt to climate change. Why should we care? Colorado will warm four degrees by 2050, causing loss of vegetation, reduced water quality, enhance ground level ozone concentrations and human health problems.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If you think climate change is real but will occur some time in the very distant future. Talk to me after this hearing and I'll tell you about my sister who's moving from rural southern Arizona, a place she loathes due to the threat that increasingly severe heat, wildfire, smoke and dust pose not only to her way of life'",
        "'speaker_0': ', but also to her ability to breathe. We have to meet the climate change challenge challenges seems simply incredible. A city that is landlocked would waste a golden opportunity to maintain a golf course or to create a regional park in light of the serious climate problems we face.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'A decision to develop rather than to preserve or expand greenspace would be an example of a seemingly innocuous or even positive public policy decision that in the end is at odds with our community's best interest in the most fundamental sense.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Our growing population of young people, most of whom want more open greenspace, love the outdoors or committed to environmental, including climate related causes. Understand this issue better than any other demographic. Perhaps it's not there for us as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you so much.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Next up, artist Shiner.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Uh, good evening.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'I've lived in central Denver for my entire life, and although I am a new resident of Cole.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'My wife Charlotte and I now own and live at 3846 Gilpin the house on the southeast corner of 39th and Gilpin directly.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Adjacent to the planned Greenway. I believe that the Greenway and Open Channel is an excellent use of the land along 39th Avenue. While I do share some of the current concerns here expressed by some of my neighbors, especially concerning environmental hazards occurring during.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And after the construction of what will eventually become the park space where people and families will gather. That said, especially having seen the planned steps presented earlier, I have full confidence in the city of Denver to proceed responsibly, knowing that it is accountable to its citizens.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In the oversight of the project.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And to mitigate any hazards as they may arise. I look forward to the construction of this. I look forward to the start of the construction and to a beautiful new greenway along the stretch of 39th Avenue in desperate need of renewal.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. Next up, Woody Guernsey.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you for the opportunity to speak.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Mary Guernsey and 46 year Park Hill resident and a retired attorney. And I've had the pleasure of meeting with many of you over the past several months and I've sent emails to all of you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'In November and December regarding.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The issues that are in front of council tonight. Tonight I urge you to vote no, or at least to table the proposed Parkhill Golf Course Condemnation Ordinance until the city administration.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Guarantees you.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That a condemnation action will not jeopardize the open space conservation easement that was purchased by the city in 1997 for $2 million. Under the agency agreement between the Clayton Trust and the City, the Trust now holds title and.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Legal right to.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Terminate the agency agreement and thereby reacquire full title to the property. But at that time, the termination of that would result in the conservation easement coming back into place immediately. It's critical to the council's decision tonight that it knows that the trust has the legal right to terminate the conservation easement in the event the land is taken'",
        "'speaker_11': 'through exercise of eminent domain. The Clayton Trust could arguably terminate the easement in connection with this.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Proposed.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Condemnation action by the city. The golf course operator AQIS has until June 30th to exercise its five year lease extension option. In the meantime, number one, the city Clayton and Arcus can hopefully resolve critical issues related to the city's plan to install the stormwater detention facility on this land and thereby eliminate the need for filing any condemnation'",
        "'speaker_11': 'action. And number two, there's no present need for the city to initiate a condemnation action that could jeopardize the conservation easement. Having never practiced condemnation. I recently consulted with a very experienced condemnation lawyer in Denver. She advised me that the city can easily secure an immediate.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Possession.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Order in no more, in no more than, and likely fewer than 120 days from the filing of an action. Therefore, the city can easily wait until after June 30th to file a condemnation action if necessary, and still begin construction of the stormwater detention facility after December 31st.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The city created this problem when it decided to install the stormwater detention in the Park Hill Golf Course under the Park Hill, the Platt to Park Hill Project. Now it must do whatever is necessary to guarantee that that conservation easement does not go away as a result of that action.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. Garcia. Georgia Guernsey.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hello. My name is Stuart to Guernsey. I'm a Park Hill resident. I am a member of City Park Friends and Neighbors, a park advocacy group, and I am also serving on the park. I'm here to support the conservation of the Park Hill Golf Course as open land.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I love the way this meeting started because you addressed what I love so much about Denver. It's history. When I came here 40 years ago, I fell in love with the light. First off, I'd never seen anything like it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I knew I'd found my place. And I loved the sheer guts and vitality of this place. It's such a young city. It was founded in 1856. The history and the people that work so hard to shape it and lead it are so vivid and accessible to me.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The city's early commitment to open space particularly has astonished me as I've studied Denver history. And you have to wonder when all of these traders and cowboys and farmers and whatnot came here, it was empty. It was sand and tumbleweed and jackrabbits and cottonwoods and not much of anything.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And they came and invest their hopes and their dreams and their love of this area and to make something to shape something wonderful, which is what we're experiencing today. In 1882, May or so for us, this is 25 years after the founding of the city, led an effort to purchase 320 acres of land in a square city'",
        "'speaker_0': 'park. Besides today. And it was out in the boondocks. There was nothing out there. What inspired them? They they knew that they wanted Denver to be something special. The 320 acres was not incidental. It's half what Central Park is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that was intentional. They saw Denver as being competing with New York City and San Francisco. It was to be the Paris of the of the plains in. 18. At the turn of the 20th century, Mayor Robert Speer came forward and he'd been inspired by the City Beautiful Movement.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And he implemented, again, another vision for open space of parklands connected by beautiful boulevards and parkways.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Currency. I hate to interrupt you because you're on a roll, but.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, I hope I've inspired you as the next leaders of shaping this this beautiful city to think about the open space.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Thing that was very.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Disturbing. The people don't trust government. They don't trust. Now for some of you that are new, that's a. Serious caveat that.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Previous decisions and experiences that people have had with previous administrations, the city council. And. I was talking to a former. Council member. And Paul, you know who I'm talking about. She said one of the issues that she had by serving 12 years on council was that she was very naive.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that she accepted things on face value. That was not true. And in the process, as she reviews her term, she made a decision to come down and lobby.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'City council members who were known to share with them. You need to do your homework. You need to see the context.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And you need to pay attention as to what is being said within the historical context. Now we have a strong mayor position and a not so strong city council. In terms of how decisions are made. So many times decisions are weighed down and they're convoluted because people actually in city council and we've all seen it, both are'",
        "'speaker_2': 'things that they're not necessarily for. Just on the strength of. They want to get some stuff done. But now we've got a serious situation here. All right. And that is city council. And I beseech you, must restore the confidence that the everyday people have in this body.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And in the process of doing that, you're going to have to vote for some things. That you don't care for. And yet, at the same time, I'm suggesting to you, if you don't build it, don't vote for it, don't vote for it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Don't vote for this. Don't do that. Because in the process, you will continue on the legacy of destroying the people's confidence in this very institution. And this institution means more to the people than the people who come and go as elected officials.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I've seen many come and go.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'But the people are always still here.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They still.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Come. And I've never in my life or 65 years of living in this city, and I've lived all of my life on the east side from five points to park, you must say, never seen an administration that would pit neighborhoods against one another and have people arguing about stuff.'",

        "'speaker_12': 'I am not going to try to speed, speed, torque or read or anything. I have some.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Information that I could say, but everybody else has said it already. I'm talking about the 39th Avenue Ditch. I live four blocks from there. And so I'm here as a selfish person, but selfish for my whole community. My daughter and her husband and my two grandchildren live a block from the ditch proposal.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I am very concerned that or not enough testing has been done, not enough EPA backing and interest in the situation of digging up a Superfund site and letting the stuff fly all over the place while is being done.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We are told I started helping work on this in 2015. We're told I've been to many, many meetings, were told that, well, we're going to wet it down when we dig it up. I don't feel like that's going to be the solution.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That might help. I just saw them wedding down the tram building as they were tearing it down on one end of it. The dust was flying everywhere, including in my house. My grandsons are six years old and almost four.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I have an interest in keeping their lungs pink and healthy. And as I said, you don't know what's going to happen 20 years down the road when.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Your.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Children, your grandchildren and so forth are exposed to this kind of thing flying in the air when it's dug up and scattered around. You don't know 20 years from now if they're going to have lung cancer or what else.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think it's really important for people who have the opportunity to safeguard our neighborhood to do it. You can put a hold on this until this testing is really done. Right. And so that we know that when it's dug up, if it's dug up, I hope it isn't.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But if it is, if it's going to be done right so that it is not polluting our neighborhood people have been living there for a lot longer than I have. They have children and grandchildren and stuff living in the neighborhood also.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we're very worried about this. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. All right. I want to thank everyone who stayed the entire time and spoke. We have we got to all of our speakers and thanks for paying for parking, coming through security, sitting on those hard benches. You did a great job.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'All right. We are now going into questions for 1396. And first up, we have Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Now, these are questions just on 1396. Yes, sir. Let me ask. Charlotte Brantley is still here. Correct. Thank you. And maybe Jeff also. Do we know if the forced shut down of golf for the 2019 season will trigger the right of Clayton to terminate the agency agreement?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The way I've read it is similar to the way Woody Garnsey read it, which is that if golf cannot be conducted, that and I know the intention is to restore it at some point, I guess for the 2020 season perhaps.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But if it's not played for that season. Hi, John. You're also going to backstop this. Would that trigger Charlotte? Would that trigger Clayton's right to terminate the agency agreement, in your view?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So, Councilman, if I may. I also have my attorney here today. Yes. I believe James and I would really prefer that he answer that question, if that's all right with you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Oh, okay. That means we're really in trouble. Good evening, Bruce James, attorney for Clayton Trust. I think Brad Cameron really said it correctly. Okay. Which is it defers the question. It is a factual question whether or not following the condemnation, the course can be restored to an 18 hole regulation, golf course and driving range.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The city staff today believes it can be. Clayton is neither agreed or disagreed with that assessment in part because what we recognize is if arcus, the operator, renews its lease. Clayton is perfectly happy. This whole process started was because Clayton was concerned about losing its income in at the end of the lease in 2019.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And if in fact Arcus doesn't renew the lease, we will have a future community discussion around the future of the golf course, much like Clayton has already initiated in cooperation with the city. So it defers the question to a later day.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And of course, if ultimately there was a decision by the community with many of these same people in the room to move forward, this council again would have the chance to look at it. So the council's not waiving any rights tonight if it proceeds with 96.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Nor is Clayton. But we will defer it to a future community conversation if the golf course operator does not renew the lease. Thank you. And that leases that options for five years? Correct. They have two five year options to five year.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And it was correct. It stated they have to July one to decide whether or not to renew. Right. And one more question, Mr. President, on 96, and that is remind me, and I guess any one of you out there might know the answer.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'How will the Clayton Trust replace the income from ARX from the golf concessionaire for the 2019 season? I ask. The golf concessionaire certainly isn't obligated to make payments if it's not permitted to conduct golf. No, that would be part of the compensation.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It would be paid as part of the reason. Yeah, exactly. The easement and part of the relocation, which is the restoration during the restoration, they would be compensated for loss of income. Great. All right. Thank you. That's all, Mr. President, on this one.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'All right. Thank you, Councilman Flynn, Councilman Canete.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Sitting next to Councilman Flynn has clearly had an impact on the two of us. So I want to follow up on his same question. I'm going to ask it a little more narrowly, Bruce or Charlotte, which is not so much deferring the question of can the golf course be replaced?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But the fear that's being communicated by the public is that even a temporary disruption in golf. You all could or might pursue action then. And so I'm asking if today you can clearly state that you would not. Proceed with any action, triggering that clause of the contract about condemnation based on a temporary loss of golf access.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think this is less of a legal question and more of where is Clayton at morally? You've come forward today in support of this ordinance. You've taken a position and you've said this ordinance should pass. I would consider it incredible, bad faith that if you then said, oh, and by the way, now that you've passed it'",
        "'speaker_1': ', I'm going to use this temporary disruption to trigger this clause. I mean, that would be extraordinary. So I think you've probably contemplated this question already. So I'm asking you just about your intentions with regard to temporary disruption of the golf course, if you can please answer on that and that point.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm going to start until he pulls my coat and says, wait. So you've asked a really interesting question, and particularly when you you talk about morally and sort of where are we and what are we thinking? I guess the best answer I can give you to that at the moment is that we as the trustees of the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'trust, are legally bound to ensure that we are leveraging the assets of that trust on behalf of the beneficiaries of Mr. Clinton's trust. What he envisioned was that his assets upon his death would be used to ensure that vulnerable children in Denver primarily was what he was thinking at that time, that vulnerable children would be given a'",
        "'speaker_0': 'great start in life and would become his will, even speaks to becoming, you know, wonderful citizens based on the services that they were given. And so when you talk about where are we sort of morally speaking on this, I have to say that's where we are as the Clayton Trust in as the operator of the programing that'",
        "'speaker_0': 'we do. You know, what happens down the road here. We are intending to be a partner with the city in this transaction. That's been clear for a long time. We have been talking for, I would say six years now maybe about the fact that storm water naturally flows to that northeast corner.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We've been talking about some way of using that as a as a way to mitigate storm water damage, flooding. So our you know, our position is that we intend to be a partner with the city in this transaction.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that's why we're here to support this this ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm going to ask you may want to confer with Mr. James and I'll ask a different question, but you didn't really answer my question. So I and this is really important. My vote may depend on it. You have come forward supporting this ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Would you possibly use this ordinance to trigger the condemnation clause that you're you're supporting this ordinance? Would you use that clause based on this ordinance, based on temporary disruption of golf? And if you if you know the answer to that question and again, if you guys want to confer, that's fair.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But it's a really important question.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Councilman if councilwoman, if I understand the question to make sure I get it correctly because I know how important it is to you is if the question is solely whether the temporary taking. The answer is I do not believe under the temporary taking that we would have the right to terminate the lease.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Excuse me? Terminate the conservation easement.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If, on the other hand.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We determine at Clayton if the golf course leases were not was not renewed, I actually believe we'll end up in the same collaborative process we started a long time ago. As Charlotte said, we've had these conversations for five, six years.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But certainly Clayton's not waiving any rights regarding the permanent taking and whether or not it interferes with the ability to operate an 18 hole regulation golf course and driving range. And certainly we can't waive those rights, as Charlotte explained.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We are here on behalf of the kids that Clayton represents and we can't give up those rights. But in terms of the temporary, the temporary itself know that that would not lead to the termination you've asked.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. I appreciate you putting that on the record. And I think the more we can separate out questions and to really distinct parts, it's going to be helpful for our debate here on the floor. So that's why I'm asking such narrow questions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we heard a community concern. Could it be, you know, triggered based on the temporary loss we're hearing? No. And then the question about the permanent loss is one we can debate based on the many golf courses. So I would just like to pull up someone from the team.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Can you confirm for me the number of golf courses you have researched that have included detention as part of a golf course design? Give me some sense of, you know, regionally what you've looked at just and really, you know, 2 minutes, don't give me don't give me 10 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But just really quickly, there is a precedent for using a golf course for drainage.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Yeah. Jason wrote with the PDP project team, you know, we're doing this in City Park Golf course right now. So there's one just adjacent to it where we've been able to do this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So it's not done yet though. So let's choose one that's done.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'One that's done. I mean, let me do this. There's there's a number in Arizona that we've researched. There's actually this is something that is done outside of Colorado quite a bit. Arizona is a place that has a climate, much like Denver, where they get large rainstorms and they use public assets like golf courses for detention.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So this is something that we've seen in a number of locations and we've done research. We currently are in the process of looking at how that golf course would lay out with that detention, and there's ways to shape the detention to make the golf course work.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Thank you for that. And this is my last question.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thanks, Mr.. I think.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Oh, yes, happy, happy.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Happy Haines, executive director of Denver Parks and Recreation. We did some research on this topic, and I don't have the paper in front of me, but we have seven golf courses in. At least five of those golf courses contain some amount of storm drainage.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you so much. I appreciate it. So one more question, if I may, and this one's for John, the attorney. The other question I heard from members of the the testimony was about development. And I think I understand where their confusion comes from because this conversation changed so quickly in the course of a month.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We were talking about the potential development. I want to take us back to the ordinance that we're on tonight, which is about the purchase. And so I want to just ask you if you can read. Do you have that agreement in front of you?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Which agreement is.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The land acquisition ordinance?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I don't have the ordinance. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, can you refer to the limitations in the land acquisition ordinance? For what purposes are we authorizing, if this past May, for what purposes would we be authorizing any acquisition of any land on this golf course?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Right. It's storm drainage, detention and conveyance.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And when asked the question, I usually don't ask an open forum, but I'm going to ask you to answer it anyway. If the city acquired land under this ordinance and then used it for development, sold it to developer, did something, what were the potential consequences the city could face?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I'd have to research what the consequences would be. But the purposes for the acquisition would need to be tied to the detention and conveyance of storm water.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Let's just say this if we acquired the land and conveyed it to a developer or conducted development on the land, would it be legal under the way this ordinance is drafted?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think not. It is not uncommon for an acquisition under a land.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Acquisition ordinance to allow.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'For certain remnants of property to be conveyed to third parties. But by and large, that could not be done. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So there would be legal risk to the city? Yes. If we were to proceed with this ordinance and then somehow sneakily give the land away at some point based on how it's written. Okay. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'All right. Thank you, Councilwoman. Can each. Councilman Espinosa.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Councilwoman. I can appreciate the questions, but they sort of don't they sort of miss some intrinsic facts, but sort of they touch on them. And I think it's worth getting those facts out. Currently, the the agreement with Clayton and the golf course provider provides how much money per year to Clayton.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So the legal lease contract between us and Orcas Gulf is as it pardon me, it's a flat 700,000 a year.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And then if they do exercise their extension, does that amount change or remain the same?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They have the right to re-up that lease under the exact same terms that are in it now.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So we're looking at 700,000 times six is the sort of maximum amount of money that Clayton could have coming to it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They have they actually have the option to re up for two, five year periods so that we ten years.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So a total of 11 years this year, the last remaining year plus the two five year extension. So 11 years. So $7.7 million is what is essentially. You know, already agreed to if they re-upped.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Twice, only if they re-up. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The question your attorney seemed to imply that, you know, you would defer that question of development to a later date. I believe that the question of development is already deferred to a very date specific in the future. When does the agency agreement, the conservation needs of the agency agreement and the conservation easement and that that would be'",
        "'speaker_11': 'in place if the agency agreement were in place. When does that terminate?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There is no termination. It's a contract between the two parties that could be amended or changed.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'No, there's a date of October of 2099 is a 99 year conservation. He's not a 99 year conservation, but it goes until 2099. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That is correct, yes.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So if if all the terms of the agreement that you have with us and Clayton entered into for the $2 million that was paid in 20 in 1994, were met and honored. We would not be having a discussion about development on there until 2099.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm sorry. I need to confer with my attorney. I don't quite even understand the question, so.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I mean, there's an agreement in place if we honor all the terms of the agreement and we don't do anything to disrupt the actual resulting in any sort of termination or cancelation of the easement, that that easement would be I mean, the land would be subject to either golf use or open space.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Until the year 2099?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Not necessarily.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. So what are the other options?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'In part, the the term conservation easement is a little misleading to folks because normally they think of conservation easements, they think of agricultural conservation easements that have certain IRS tax benefits and those truly run in perpetuity and extremely difficult to unwind a conservation easement for which all parties obtain tax benefits.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'When people ask me what this agreement really is, I explain to them it's a use restriction. It's a use restriction between two parties, the city and Clayton. And so at any time between now and 2099, even if we didn't have the condemnation action, Clayton could come forward to the city and ask permission to have that easement released'",
        "'speaker_6': 'in order to sustain the goals of serving the children that it protects. And so it is a contract between the city and Clayton. Like any other contract that the city has that can be amended. It can only be amended, though.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Importantly, assuming taking for your question, moving the condemnation question to the side, absent a condemnation, it can only be amended by an action by this city council. So that's why I was suggesting you are deferring this decision to another day, because not only would if there was never a condemnation action, it would take an action by this'",
        "'speaker_6': 'city council to to release it, and further another action by the City Council to approve whatever development plan might be proposed by Clayton. And so to me, no, the question would likely always come up because I think what people tend to forget is when this was put in place in 1999, the golf industry was far different.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I don't think anyone on the sitting on the council at that time realized that the possibility that for the last ten years our golf course operator has lost money. This is not a sustainable economic operation. And so if this ordinance 1396 never came forward, we would still be coming to this council at some point to explain that'",
        "'speaker_6': 'the golf course, you know, the golf course operators always told us they don't intend to renew. And we've been told in the marketplace that that 700,000 will dwindle if we have to go out and find a new golf course operator.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'In 2019.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That conservation easement came in consideration of $2 million for the city and county of Denver. Do you then intend, if you ever were to really, you know, to to negotiate terms to remove the conservation easement, would that come with money back to the city and county of Denver?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And in exchange for the the read of the development rights that you're trying to reacquire.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think what you're talking about is a sliver of what a Kintyre community conversation would be. And we've started that community conversation and we have engaged the community. Have you and so have.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'You have you engaged the community in earnest because the land is currently zoned for West, is it not? Yes. And what development rights exist on OSA today?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'No. Present development rights exist on the property.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So if you've been clear that there is conservation easement and protections that actually that are reflected in that current zone district, that so that you're limited in development rights today due to an agreement that you made with the city and county in Denver in consideration for money from the city and county of Denver.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We have been very open with the community. We have shared copies of the agency agreement on the conservation easement. We've explained the right of the golf course operator to renew. We've explained their right of first refusal to match an offer we've given through all that with the community and the Peacock is the acronym they use has been'",
        "'speaker_6': 'very engaged in the process. And so to ask the question with the money come back from the conservation easement, I think is just the start of the question. The question really is what does this community want? What would a future development do to serve the needs of Clayton and the community?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And that's a conversation that will come back before this council many times with.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The real struggle I have with that answer is that it's not to the Councilwoman Canisius point, we're in a very different place than where this came to us back in September, where we were not talking at all in these terms.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Well, we were talking about as a quitclaim transaction that basically granted the the development, the ability to remove this conservation easement and then buyback this land for considerably higher value without any discussion about the fact that there were all these other encumbrances and things that we were jumping over, we were doing all these things to sort of'",
        "'speaker_11': 'circumvent a lot of things. And so the concern that you hear here is legitimate, which is did we just find another way to get the same outcome? But using sort of legal parlance and nuance of rules in a way to sort of get the same outcome.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And what I'm struggling with is that one document that I shouldn't have had, that appraisal that shows that the value of that land as golf course land is $3 million in that value of that land, his development rate is $24 million.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And somewhere in there in the 7.7 that this developer might me and golf course operator might pay you over the course of 11 years is probably a number that makes them comfortable with leaving that operation. And then you having the excuse to basically say our our operator left.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It is no longer functional as a as an 18 hole golf course. And now we want to exercise this right, because we lost the land. And so we will then by by voting this as is without the guarantees that were simply asked and we could ask it of the city, we could ask of Clayton right now, will'",
        "'speaker_11': 'you guarantee that this we will not alter and do anything that alters the conservation easement that we have in place until this project is done and we have a much more public negotiation and dialog about the future of that land and the real value of Clayton to this community and what we're going to invest in it as'",
        "'speaker_11': 'a community and that land is open space. Councilman, is that a question? So I or you guys are willing to make that commitment, the guarantee that was asked for by Mr. Guernsey.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, we answered councilman conditions answer a question by saying that we would not assert that the temporary taking triggers a termination of the conservation easement on behalf of the kids that Clayton represents. No, it cannot stand here today and say that the permanent condemnation does not create that right, because to do that would really put in jeopardy'",
        "'speaker_6': 'everything that Mrs. Brantley described to you about the purpose of the trust, what they do in the community. We've heard lots of conversation about that tonight and that would be really a breach of the fiduciary duty of the board if they agreed to that tonight.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'To be honest, I actually wonder if I'm even concerned if I if I share these concerns. And the reason being is this, that the conservation easement actually isn't in place today. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's correct. It's only triggered if Clayton comes forward and asked to reacquire the property.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Right. And so that step has to happen first. Right. I mean, so so is the even any concern about a conservation easement not being enforced? I mean, there's other actions that have to occur because of the conservation easement that we're talking about.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Doesn't even apply to the land today as we know it. So I mean, correct Hitler.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Is that. Are you done counseling?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Um, I do have some questions for our own staff about contamination, but I'll wait.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's for third 39th Avenue. Yeah. Okay. That's at the next bill. This is 1396. I got Councilwoman Ortega up.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I want to shift the discussion a little bit and kind of hone in on the budget. And I'm looking at an old notification that I was cleaning out some boxes and dumping out files, and this was in my water bill.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And, you know, sometimes you get your wastewater bill with your water bill. And this was in 2011. There was it went into effect in July. So the council that departed before some of us came on in 2011 made the decisions about a rate increase to the wastewater fees.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So in 2011, it went up 20%. In 2012, it went up 2%. And in 2013, it went up 2%. And one of the projects on here was Park Hill. This project was initiated following the August 17, 2000 Drowning of Fireman Bob Crumb.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Some of you may remember that he went through a culvert trying to save someone, a woman who had slipped into that culvert. And so, you know, it was important for the city to begin to address this. But what is not clear to me is exactly how much money was spent and what exactly did that cover.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'With this, as is today and this is again going back to 2011, 17 million of storm drainage improvements and retention pond have been installed in this area. And this was around 50th and Colorado generally. But there were some other improvements in that, that sort of quadrant of the city.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I'm not sure who's the right person that can answer my question about what did the 2011 rate increase that followed with the next three consecutive years, which was before the wastewater increase that was approved by some of the folks on this on this dais when we did the rate increase to the tune of $300 million.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Bruce Janek with Denver Public Works Long Range Storm Planning. I'll try to answer your question first. Happy New Year. I don't think anyone said that yet. So you're right, Councilwoman. The Park Hill project has been on our radar since about 2000.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'With the tragedy at 50th.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'In Colorado. We build build these systems from downstream. Upstream. So we started with the Park Hill Pond, which is at the.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Northernmost.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Point. I don't have the numbers in front of me, but I think it was around 2 to $3 million back in the day. And then we started to build the pipe system upstream.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think there.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Has been.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Three or.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Four phases. The third phase got us.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'To.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'About 40 and.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Colorado.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And now then the fourth phase was along.'",
        "'speaker_11': '40th from Colorado to Dahlia and that's where we are today. And the fifth phase, which we want to start.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Construction now is going to take us in dollar.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'From 48. So the RTD tracks.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So all.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Told, between the Park Hill Pond and the pipes.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That have got.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Us up to about 48 then dollar, it's been about $20 million.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So that was funds.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Were even predated the 2011 rate increase.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But the 2011 rate increase allowed us to do, I believe, the phase four construction.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. So as we look at the budget now for Park Hill golf course, it's it's a $78 million. That's what we have in our contract to make sure I'm not confusing the two bills here. Okay. So 95 has the $78 million, but that includes acquisition for both the 39th Avenue Channel as well as the Park Hill Golf'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Course. Correct that at least that's what I understood from a meeting I had today with city staff.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The $78 million, which would be 1395. And we'll talk about that later in detail. But that's for the construction of the channel and the budget that we're talking about for the Park Hill golf course is contained within the real estate budget, which would cover the cost of the permanent easement, temporary easement, and reconstructing it back to a'",
        "'speaker_6': 'playable golf course.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. That's that's not consistent with what I thought I heard today. So, yes, I was told 60,500,000 was part of real estate. But I was also told that the. $78 million budget included part of the acquisition for Park Hill.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And then I later asked tried to get clarification on separating out the acquisition for Park Hill versus what we were acquiring for the 39th Avenue Channel. And you shared with me that 21 million is what we're looking at for the construction for Park Hill.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Correct. And then we're looking at 10.7 million for the real estate for Park Hill.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Yeah. So so what we are talking about today is we have the 78 million, which is for the SEMA contract. Right. And that is purely for the construction and implementation of 39th Avenue Greenway as well as Park Hill Golf Course.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So you remember the document that we were looking at. We had one on line, the one line item, and then at the bottom we had the the line item for the real estate. And that's what Jeff was referring to.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So so the real estate budget is separate from that CMA contract, and that's been used for the acquisition and relocation of the properties along the 39th Avenue as well as Park Hill.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So the total cost that's going to be spent on the golf course improvements, which is construction and then re restoration.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Is in excess of the 21 million because part of that is built into the 78 million. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So the 21 million covers the portion of Park Hill, which isn't just the golf course. It's also the pipes that are connecting to the outfall and connecting the Holly Pond to the golf course detention. So there's that portion.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So that's all included in the 21.6 million. So that's all. What Seymour will be constructing and with Jeff was saying is he has that separate budget, which is the 10.7 million, which covers the acquisition costs for the temporary easement, the permanent easement, as well as the restoration costs for the golf course.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So we're acquiring both a temporary and permanent easement for the golf course.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'If that's correct.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. So so one of the things I'm looking at and the reason I wanted to look at the the entirety of the budget of the plot to Park Hill, which originally we were told was the Twin Basin Drainage Project with the name changed later, was to really just kind of do a comparison.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So when you look at the total cost of what we're going to spend on City Park Golf course, that is basically $45 million.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I know that's a complete redo. What's not clear to me is how how much of a. Complete renovation we're doing of Park Hill golf course to return it back to Clayton in a usable format that continues to make it marketable to the current vendor or anybody else in the future.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So so the intent would be it's much different than City Park Golf Course because you're correct, City Park Golf Course, we are redoing the entire golf course. So this would be the holes that would be impacted by the detention.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And there may be some relocation of those holes, but it's not covering the entire golf course. It's really just in that detention area.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Which is primarily that far northeast corner of the golf course. Okay. And so we have been told over and over, we're looking at anywhere from 20 to 25 acres, the language that is in the contract. And I'm not finding the page number that speaks to 90 acres.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I just want to be clear that that is specific to the golf course and that doesn't include the 39th Avenue Channel as well.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah, that's correct. The amount that is proposed for the golf course is between 25 and 35 acres of permitted easement between 55 and 65 acres of temporary easement. And that comprises the 90 acres that you're referring to.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. I have one other question that I want to ask of the folks from Clayton and either one of you can come up. So in let me just find my note here for a minute. So in at the time that the easement was placed on that property, the conservation easement, that was a $2 million revenue to the'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Clayton Trust. Right. And was the land that was developed on where there's new housing at that far north end of the golf course. Was that done before or after that easement was put into place? Was that sold after?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There's actually two areas of land that used to all be part of the golf course. You just spoke to the north. And if you're talking about what's at 40th in Colorado on up to Smith Road. Yes, that area was actually sold off by the city of Denver when the city was the trustee of the Clayton Trust.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Before Clayton Early Learning was even incorporated as a501 C3 that we are today. The other area that was sold off by Clayton Early Learning after it was incorporated we were incorporated in the mid-eighties, became an institution in the mid-eighties in the nineties, the area that is now the overlook at Park Hill that was sold off to KB'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Homes by the institution that I currently run today as President. CEO okay. Does that answer your question?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yeah, it does. That's helpful. And at that time, are you are you able to share what that was was sold for at that point in time?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I do not know. I would have to find that out for you. It was long before my time there, but I am sure we could find that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Was done in the nineties. Okay. At this point, I have no further questions. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilman Ortega. Councilman Espinosa, you back up two questions.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'One for Maria Flora and one for Mr. Armijo. Is Maria Flora still here?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes, she is coming in the back here.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Maria, what were your observations of 1218? That you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm sorry. Who's talking about?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'What were you thinking of on 1218.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Observations or your observations of think of the committee meeting of December 18th.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, I was concerned. Let me take that out, because. Councilman Flynn. Asked. Uh, let's see, Mr. Feinberg, by saying that, Rick Steinberg, what the effect of the permanent easement part of this is a permanent easement, which is why I'm still concerned.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Part of it's a temporary easing, as I understand the permanent easement is the part that the detention is going to be on. So that. So he was asked what effect that had on the conservation easement and the city said there's a provision in the conservation easement that says if there's something that's done that precludes us from being'",
        "'speaker_0': 'a regulation golf course, that the conservation easement can be terminated. As a result, we looked at it and said, okay, we need to bring this back to a playable golf course. So from the onset, we worked with public works and let them know that we have to do that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that was what desire and intent is. And by virtue of bringing it back to being a playable golf course, the conservation easement. Councilman Flynn said stays in effect and the answer was yet yes. My concern remains that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I don't think we've nailed down Clayton College. And if it's a permanent easement, does what they said tonight still apply?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And if you look at the letter of.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The conservation easement, it can be terminated.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And is at the committee meeting. Did you see even a schematic diagram of what was being proposed as far as the detention location? I can't remember if it was one presented.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I don't know that it was a specific schematic. I think that there was the general area that was identified as the northeast portion where one already detains.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And just as a reminder for for everyone. I don't I don't think it's confidential. I saw a schematic design layout. Very. Not even preliminary. Right. Because there's no design yet. That is part of the transaction that would have to occur in the contracts.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But one thing that I can say comfortably is between the current depression in the golf course and the planned. I mean, where there's already a low spot. I am convinced that that, you know, the detention could be captured in an 18 hole golf course.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And you confirmed that last at the last hearing. But could you confirm again that the the amount of storm water that that needs to be detained on on site can still be captured in an 18 hole golf course regulation golf course can still be maintained.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm a real estate guy. I think that an engineer needs to answer that.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Is there somebody. Yeah, we have an engineer. He's in the back or he's over there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If I can answer the part of your question, maybe what was said is that there would be 25 to 35 acres for the permanent construction easement.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You might use.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Your mike right here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm sorry. What was said was there would be 25 to 35 acres for the permanent construction easement for the detention, and then a 55 to 65 acres for the temporary construction easement.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'For the rest of the golf course. And this is this is. Maybe you can answer both of these, because I think the first question is, can you guys confirm that we can, in fact, design the required stormwater detention, capture the amount of acreage, I mean, water that we want to capture and still maintain an 18 hole regulation'",
        "'speaker_11': 'golf course. And then can you address the fact that I believe that even if there's a permanent easement, we can still make it so that it's playable? Correct.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Yeah. So the so the first question on on the golf course being restored with the detention incorporated. Obviously, we're not to a point where we have 100% design, but we're confident that we can get to that point just based on what we were talking about earlier, that there's a lot of precedents around the country where where that's'",
        "'speaker_10': 'incorporated. And we're working with our partners at SEMA to make sure that the detention gets designed and incorporated into that golf course. The permanent easement. And just interrupt me if I'm wrong, but from the permanent easement standpoint, it would not interfere interfere with the golf course play now.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And so I want people to sort of separate the project from this transaction because there there are to me, legitimate concerns about the sort of viability in this whole deal about the viability of the conservation easement. But what I am fairly certain been convinced of, and I think you guys have proven capable, is delivering an 18 hole'",
        "'speaker_11': 'golf course. Now, whether that's viable for the operator to sustain months or years without full play abilities. And you know, but that gets to my last question for Jeff is how do you determine the amount of compensation that is needed to sort of lost revenue?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It'll be a combination of negotiations. I mean, what we first have to do is bring in an appraiser to come up with the valuation of what the value of of the permitted easement is on the 25 to 35 acres.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then the same thing on the temporary construction easement and then as we get to design. So there's a couple of aspects there. It'll be June or July 1st when when design of the detention in and of itself is, is put on the table and finalized.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So there'll be a construction timeline associated with that. And at the same time, we'll be working with the golf course architect that will look at how we bring the golf course back to a playable golf course. So between the two, I think what we had in the presentation was from January of 19 until March of 20 would'",
        "'speaker_6': 'be the period of time that the golf course would be out of operation. I would imagine that with seeding and bringing it back to use, it would probably take it into a junior of 20 before it could be operated as a golf course.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So that would be the period that would be looked at for replacement income.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So then again, for my own understanding of the timeline. If you now know the approximate window that the course would be down and the duration, what is preventing you from doing an appraisal and coming up with that number so that we knew that going into it to sort of find out where the where the, you know, why'",
        "'speaker_11': 'why do we have to actually execute all this now? Is this because of some deliverable to see DOT on detention and the idea or not? No. I mean.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'As we sit today, we don't have the right to go negotiate or to do an appraisal on somebody else's property in the properties owned by the Clayton Trust. And what we would need to do, and that's what we're seeking for in the land acquisition ordinance, is the right to send a notice of intent letter saying that we'",
        "'speaker_6': 'plan on acquiring the easements.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That we need to understand how we can be in negotiations with Clayton for six years under the pretense that they they might lose their operator and not be, you know, in such a collegial environment that we couldn't actually sort of work together on that and.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we haven't been in negotiations with them for six years. We've been in discussions with them because this has been a topic where we've looked at and again, as we had back in September, there was the potential where we could potentially have looked at buying a portion of the golf course.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But we have to respect the contracts that are in place. And the contract that's in place is with the golf course operator. That goes to the end of this year, but it also goes until the end of June 30th or until June 30th, when they have to come up with the decision of whether or not they're going'",
        "'speaker_6': 'to extend their option. So we have to have all those things in place and can't take them out of order.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. Thank you. Mr. Mayor, what was your proclamation?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Thank you. I'm hard of hearing. So could you please kind of speak up? And the hearing aids they gave me.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'What was your proclamation?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'DNA test, two citizens living within two miles radius of the 39th project. If any citizen tests positive for levels of benzo, a brain lead or spinsters, arsenic or eccentric because we know what's in that property 1/10 of a percent above normal EPA standards.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'The project will come to a complete halt and full EPA testing of the soil and clean up will begin and the 39th Avenue Project area every three months. After the clean up has been done, or if they said they were fine every three months or six months, don't eat or do a DNA test for the next ten'",
        "'speaker_13': 'years if they would have done DNA tests on us. I wouldn't be in the situation I am today. There would are number two. I'm concerned about all the kids because a majority of people have moved into that neighborhood that I've talked to.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Even the ones living there, they moved there because they got tired of New York City. Live in San Francisco. They found their sweet little bungalows. Now they are barely finding out they're going to destroy all of northeast Denver in the name of the almighty dollar.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Now, the reason I know about DNA testing, cause I was on a top secret island in the South Pacific. They didn't tell us what was on there, but I got everything from Vietnam to Johnson Atoll. These kids in their study said the Mexicans, which are Mexicanos from Mexico, were not intelligent enough to know English.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'At the same time, their kids were slower learners because of lead paint and whatever else the highway produces. If you do a DNA test based on the existing Campos, we as resident have either read about or know about.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'You would be able to have a chart for these families and have the families a to have the city of Denver. All the contractors like they did with Rocky Flats to pay for any medical issues. I've lived in that neighborhood since 1960.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'I lived in East Denver since the day I was born. Every time the city wants to do something, I help him clean it up in the nineties and 2000 and they promised hours. They're going to clean up the area.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'They're going to put us apart. None of that ever happened. But now all of a sudden they're saying, Oh, we need the land. And I've worked hard for the city for free as a volunteer from cleaning up the drugs, prostitution.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'I bought my mother's house for $18,000 with no intentions of ever moving out of there or having a monetary value on it all alone. Neighbors know me as either Grandpa Ed or the Mayor of coal where I live because I know so much about that neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'I know. I've been on the Internet. I've been federal government, the EPA. Nobody can produce a physical record of Gardner Denver, which is the rock drill we take. Gardner Denver. Each one of them are parking facilities that all belong to Gardner.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Denver. I used to work for Gardner Denver in the eighties. We use petroleum products to. Call the metal. That's poison now. I could not find documentation on 39th Avenue where Roman Church told me there's gas tanks buried there, etc..'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So not to be rude, but you you are in fact opening up Pandora's box.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'My point is, and this box from my experiment with government, that I'm just anybody but you and you on that city council. Could you reason with people? Albert She's always trying to cut me off.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But. But I'll just be. Be honest. There are we have verifiable, documented, all different.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'I don't believe that I worked at the refinery for 26 years because of my illness. I had to take a medical retirement. But they said the refinery was cleaned up, but we had a big old benzene taper in.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Some of the guys already died.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Exposures can happen so many different ways, and I don't deny that that is in fact, there is a definite history in certain parts of North Denver and East Denver, and populations long, prolonged, with long, prolonged exposures had definitely had health impacts and and generational health impacts over there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But Councilman, I got Ortega, okay.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So I just wanted you to know.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They offered the Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Park heal that that it's not. You know, I'd be happy to talk to you.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'After we've shared if you talk to me, because I could tell you stuff. If you listen to reason. You would put this project on a screeching halt. I'm not dumb. I know a lot about chemicals in the refining naval nuclear industry with all my work.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'I work for Gardner, Denver in the Machine Shop, working at the refinery as an industrial mechanic. They even found this third.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I mean.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Nobody was there.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We're going to Mr. Mrs. Councilwoman Ortega. This is my neighbor, by the way. So I have heard all these stories, but. Councilwoman Ortega, thank you.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I just have two more quick questions. So the first one is for is Happy Haines to hear. Have you would you mind coming forward? My question is, I know we went through this whole process when shortly after the first.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I can't even think of the name of the Park Inn in far southeastern, but that drew attention to the fact that we had a number of on dedicated parks, and then we learned that there were certain parks we couldn't dedicate because we had conservation easement on there.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So do you have a ballpark idea of how many parks or park land that we own that have conservation easements on them?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'No, I don't. Councilwoman Ortega not off the top of my head. And those those would be owned by someone else other than the city with a conservation easement but for for public access. So. Trying to think of.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I know we have one up at it's next to Harry Potter and that little purchased with natural resource damage.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So that's a great example. That's a state owned facility and there's a conservation easement on.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So we're required to keep that as open space. It's part of our master planning. That's right.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And it's not owned by it's owned by another government inside the city.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yeah. Okay. So it would be helpful at some point to just know that because we.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Would be we do have that. I just don't have it in.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Front of me. And I didn't expect you to answer that exact number tonight, but the fact that there are other easements on their owned by other entities means that we, the city, cannot turn around and try to dispose of that land that has an easement that we have no control of.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think every easement is different. So would yeah, I mean, generally that would be true, but every easement is different. So we would have to look at each one to determine what the conditions are.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I know you've been in northeast Denver for as long as you and I have known each other.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But don't say please.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Do you recall? And I'm going to ask Clayton to answer this question why the easement was put on the Park Hill golf course. It's my recollection I could be wrong about this, that it was because of the revenue that they were generating that they would have been taxed on.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But by putting the conservation easement on there, it precluded them from being taxed for that revenue that was coming in from the private operators then.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'No, I, I, I don't recall. I mean, there were obviously I don't know if it was the conservation easement, the, uh, address, the tax issues or not. And, um, I, um. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. Let me ask Clayton to just address that. Yeah. Because it's it's it's an easement that the city acquired, but it's not clear what that easement currently does. What? But access that gives.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Us, if I may, council and that I'll start and then if I get in trouble, I'm going to have Bruce come back up here. So they're actually two different things at work here. One was the contract between the city and Clayton Moore.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The $2 million was was exchanged. And at that point in time, as as Bruce had mentioned earlier, golf was a a good economic use of that property. And so it made a lot of sense to have it remain golf.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That was 20 some odd years ago. Now that that was was looked at in that way. The agency agreement which is a separate it's a it's a contract between us and the city that came along a few years later.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The agency agreement is what addresses the tax issue, the property tax issue. Okay. Thank you for that clarification.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay, Councilman. Council president. I have no further questions. All right. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Thank you, Councilwoman Ortega. See no other questions on 1396. We're now going to move into the comment portion and closed 1396. So comments by members accounts. So, Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. President. You're going to do comments before questions on 95, correct? Thank you. The two weeks ago, when we had this on first reading, I offered an amendment to clarify the authority of this of the administration to go ahead and and acquire permanent and temporary easements and as necessary for random parcels around those easements to'",
        "'speaker_6': 'acquire by fiat. Simple because fee simple acquisition was included in there. And we understood that that's not the intent. But I was very concerned that by including the authority to acquire up to 90 acres for stormwater drainage, detention, etc. in fee simple that we were putting a foot in the door.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Camel's nose in the tent. Whatever you want to call, whatever you want to call it without having to come back to the city council. If in fact the decision was to acquire by a fee simple rather than easement.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And because of that, Mr. President, I can't vote. I can't vote yes on on. The Syrians have to vote now. The other reason is that I believe 90 acres is is much more than we talked about in the beginning.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We were talking initially about a 25 acre detention area and whatever might be needed for temporary construction easements. 90 acres is just much, much too much for me to approve. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'All right. Thank you. Councilman Flynn. Councilman Herndon, would you like to go at the end or.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'No, Mr. President, I'm. I'm no comment.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay, Councilwoman Canete.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I referenced in my my common question. We have good at mushing them together here. The fact that this has been a messy process. And I think I just think the city does actually have to take responsibility for, you know, entering into a legal negotiation without adequate information about the operator as well as Clayton'",
        "'speaker_1': '. We should not have had an agreement on the verge of council adoption without that clarified much more definitively, and it has created so much confusion and fear. This would have been a totally different conversation had we not ended up there.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I think both parties bear responsibility for that. And I think part of what we all need to do in public service or in community service is take that responsibility. So that is unfortunate. And I really do understand why the community has the concerns it has, because that is the conversation we were having just a couple of'",
        "'speaker_1': 'months ago. And if that agreement were before me, I'm not sure that I would have been able to support it. But I am trying hard in spite of that mess and in spite of our failure to do our proper due diligence to really separate out just this particular proposal before me.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And, you know, based on really a very clear ordinance that really limits the use of this land for the drainage purpose, that is the only thing we can acquire for. And and I respect in some way is Councilman Flynn's, you know, desire to not have this simple versus an easement.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But the effect is the same, really, whether the city, for some legal quirk, has to acquire it in fee simple or for legal quirk has to do it as an easement. If in the end it's only for drainage and if the end it has to be put back as a golf course, that it's just a distinction without'",
        "'speaker_1': 'a difference. It's not something I hear from the community that you all care about. So. So I think I've tried to zero my questions in on the things that I have heard that people care about, because I think those things are really important.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I appreciate Clayton being very firm about the fact that they are not using this agreement or I'm sorry, this ordinance as a as an excuse to to trigger, you know, a condemnation clause for a temporary loss of the golf course.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm sure there will be all kinds of interesting and heated debates about how to protect the kids's interest in revenue and the value of land. But that's you know, that's all governed by a really strict process. So so I feel like I've done the due diligence that the community has asked me to do, that this land will'",
        "'speaker_1': 'be used for open space and only for open space. And so or I'm sorry, actions that we use for drainage. I'm sorry we use for drainage. It's late. I'm sorry. I'm getting a little muddled and so and that and that we have the protections in place for the next phase.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It is incumbent upon the city to deliver land that can be used as a golf course. Right. And so and I feel like I have gotten enough, you know, and this is where, you know, Councilman Espinosa and I seem to be in agreement that there is ample evidence that this can be done.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so because of that ample evidence, there should never, ever be a triggering of the condemnation clause. If it can be built as a golf course, the condemnation clause never gets triggered. So the two are linked. And because there is ample evidence that it can.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Be restored to a golf course. I feel confident moving this forward. And, you know, I appreciate the speaker who, you know. Echoed my words from committee, but I'll just do it in my own words tonight. Which is that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Let's not do this again with bad process. So if and when you hear from Argus or who you're if I'm saying the name properly of your of your golf course operator, we need really good communication with the community and with this council about how design is proceeding and how it's impacting decisions that you're making and things like'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that. I would ask that council get briefings on the confidential negotiations that are occurring. We seriously underuse executive sessions as this body. We should get a committee executive session to understand how negotiations are going on this discussion about this acquisition as it proceeds.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's highly public interest oriented and we it's just not appropriate for you to negotiate an entire agreement and then tell us about it at the end when there is so much confusion and challenge. So I would ask that you give us briefings.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So with all of those, you know, kind of due diligence is and all of those requests to make sure that we stay a part of this conversation in an ongoing way. I appreciate that my questions have been answered and I will be voting to move this forward.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'All right. Thank you. Councilwoman. Can each. Councilman Espinosa, you're up?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yeah, I. I wish I could go there because it's a good stormwater project and a good way to incorporate this at relatively minimal impact. The problem is, is that we have this history of sort of protracted discussion about developing land that is not developable by design.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It is a fallacy to sort of sit here and opine that that, you know, we chose a golf course because that was a good sort of revenue generator back then, and no longer is it. And now we need to change because that decision to make a golf course was in part because of the outcry for the open'",
        "'speaker_11': 'space. And so that was the sort of compromise that we were going to. We will we will do this in exchange. We will use this open space like a revenue generator in exchange for not losing a complete development opportunity here.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'You know, it was sort of I mean, it wasn't that it was, but it was a negotiation with the community at that time that basically said, look, here's a good compromise, a way you guys can have open space or at least that that that natural element, and we could generate revenue.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And to sort of say that we're going to use whatever mechanism now to sort of to to throw away those ideas, those agreements of the past. And no one's sort of saying that. But what we are doing is creating a clear, clear path for that because of what we talked about.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'There is no easement in place today. But what there is, is an agency agreement, and that agency agreement allows them to terminate that agreement in writing at any point in time, at any time. They could have done it two years ago.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'They could have done it five years ago. They could do it tomorrow. But they'll probably if they're smart, they'll wait. They'll wait until it's clear that there's going to be some sort of agreement with their operator. And so when you do, they'll file the termination.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And then the next action is they have to put the conservation easement in place. That is a requirement of their agency agreement. So when they terminate, they have to put it in the agency agreement. I mean, the conservation easement.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And now because their golf course operator says that we can't use it and the amount of money that the city not going to give us isn't enough for us to endure two years and go on. They have the conditions to, to, to, to get rid of the conservation easement.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And now, lo and behold, the development rights are there. Well, the cities already they had made very clear by virtue of the action back in September that we've got a deal, we've got a way to sort of promise upwards of $24 million to purchase that land with development rights.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It's not good for us to buy open space for the cheap. We want to buy land that is developable open space that city of Denver residents fought for, earned and got this agreement and paid for. His, you know, 20 years ago, 20 plus years ago.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And so what I've always maintained, and I'll be transparent with you all, is I might be okay with that if we could sort of create a win win for Clayton and a win for open space and a win for community, because there's definite needs and desires for certain uses there.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It's definite infrastructure investment that we've made as a as as people in the city and state over there. And so there might be opportunity, but if you're going to have that much open space and capture that much value, I want a commitment that that money that goes to redevelopment of open space goes back into purchase and acquisition'",
        "'speaker_11': 'of even more open space in the city. You know, this is in why that and that might disturb some people going well wait a sec you're going to sell Park Hill. That's at a time when we're going to build the 39th Avenue Channel next to our biggest park in the city.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'You know, we have a equity issue on open space. And I think there's a way to sort of to do it more thoughtfully. But that's not what's happening here. All to to to Councilwoman Canisius Point. This happens so opaquely.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That Council does not know until it's time to go. Six years of negotiation. I don't know how many members of council knew that this was going on for six years. You know, this council is asked for real estate updates in an executive session, a master plan, some sort of knowledge about what it is that we have as'",
        "'speaker_11': 'assets, what we're playing with, what we're exploring, and why. But we don't. The only way to know that is is is is in a stronger government to have that seat on the third floor. And we the best we can do is is what you're seeing here.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And fortunately, this is a situation where the community knew better. I, Nancy, came out with facts and people came out in droves and so took two German speakers comments. I've been on that site just two and a half years ago.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Right. And I have been right on that side. And this is a situation where, once again, you guys know better than we do. And so I'm mindful of that. We have oversight authority. That is our job as our lone, strong power as counsel is to prove or deny these sorts of deals.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'There's stronger provisions that we could be making for the health and safety environment. And I'm sort of spilling into my 39th Avenue channel, things that they apply here because we're talking about open space and that is so critical to well-being and that is so much why we live in Denver is the quality of life.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And to that community that that that low income in the affordable community that is restricted next to this asset. I mean, that is an incredible asset. Not many low income communities next to a golf course, you know. And so we did that.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Clayton did that willfully, and now we're doing this sort of deal to get out of it, sort of, you know, leveraging people, getting people riled up for what the potential is when that potential doesn't exist unless we do a whole bunch of other machinations to make it happen.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And so let's be transparent about that and say here's what it's going to take. Here's what we're asking you. City of Denver. Do you guys want your assets, your money, your fees in storm water, your tax dollars in general revenue funds to go to this level of investment to support one organization, which is very worthwhile.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And if so, to what degree? And then what do you want to do with your open space? You know, that is that is that the city's doing that. But we're not doing that. That's Clayton doing that. And that's that's just disingenuous.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And that is not how we should be operating. As far as I'm concerned. So because that is in fact the narrative that I'm throwing out and I could be totally wrong in three years time. Four years time. I'm willing to be that.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But if I'm totally right, you've got this point to remember. I thanks. I'll be voting no.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'All right, Councilwoman Black.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I will be voting yes. This bill is not going to. And in the development of the golf course, it's actually a practical solution with an environmental benefit. One of the speakers talked about the importance of green space while the park, how a golf course will still be a green space.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And under this bill.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The green space will also be a green.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Solution for a major flooding problem. And we've been talking about this for a year. And I know the common ground golf course is an example of drainage. The Lake World Golf Course is an example of drainage. We've asked about that in committee meetings is a green way to deal with drainage issues.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So as Councilwoman Kennish brought up this bill is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Not going to result in all of the.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Things that a lot of people are worried about. It's really.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Just going to allow.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'For this drainage to be built and it will remain open space in the future. I'm confident that Charlotte Brantley and the Clinton Trust in partnership with the city and the community, will then work toward a community vision. I have the utmost confidence in Charlotte Brantley.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I know she cares passionately about her community so I will be supporting this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'All right. Thank you, Councilman Black, Councilman Cashman.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Now, you can include me on the. A team that feels this is it's a little bit too muddled for my taste. Starting back with is, as Councilwoman Kenny pointed out, how how in the name of all that is holy and sacred, we get a contract that we're getting ready to vote on and nobody's'",
        "'speaker_9': 'talked to the golf course operator. It just feels like there's too much. I don't believe everything's on the table. I don't think council has been given the entire truth about what the plans are either by Clayton and I have great respect for the work that Clayton does for the kids in the community and the families.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I have no problem with that, but I just don't believe either the administration or Clayton has presented the plans that already exist on their tables for our consideration. Another thing that that concerns me greatly well, I heard the most definite from all the speakers tonight was was from the attorney for Clayton, and that their responsibility is to'",
        "'speaker_9': 'their fiduciary responsibility to the Clayton trust and that that's fine. I understand that. But that's what I hear a lot more firmly than any commitment to preservation of open space. The another thing that bothers me is. I believe that the timeline for all of this is not driven by.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Concerns for the community, but by the need to build this drainage project in agreement with dates that we've committed to, with, with the Department of Transportation to not hold up the I-70 project. And I think. I think that's affecting issues relating to both of the projects that we're considering tonight, that both could do with being cooked a'",
        "'speaker_9': 'little bit longer. So I will not be supporting this this evening. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilman Cashman. Councilman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Mr. President. You know, we know that we have some drainage problems in this area of town. And you've heard people, you know, in the audience talk about them. I've heard Councilman Brooks talk about, you know, his very neighborhood being flooded.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But this has been a very messy process going back to when this body was asked to approve a proclamation. In support of the preferred alternative for I-70 way before the supplemental draft was even released. And I caution my colleagues to not vote for a preferred alternative before the actual supplemental draft of the EIC had been released, because'",
        "'speaker_8': 'we didn't know all the details of what was in that document. It was then later followed up with an idea that directly tied all the drainage in this area to the I-70 project. So much so that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We're.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Responsible for maintaining the lid over the Hyde Highway, which is supposed to be the mitigation for the project. So I challenge why we we the city of Denver, number one, should have ever agreed to be on the hook for the maintenance of that lid.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But then, number two, that you know, it it ended up in the idea. And then you look at the funny math that happened. We ended up swap swapping land that's underneath I-70. With see dot that became part of the budget of how we then fund part of the drainage they put their 40 million in and if it'",
        "'speaker_8': 'exceeded a certain threshold, which it already has, then they're on the hook for more money. But. The public process on the 39th Avenue Channel happened way after all of that approval processes had come before this body of city council.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So when the neighborhood started coming to public meetings and learning about this 39th Avenue channel, and I remember being told we're either going to do City Park golf course or we're going to do 39th Avenue channel. But at no point was there a discussion that we would do both.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But here we are. We're doing both, and we're doing the Park Hill Golf Course. So all of this and that's why I wanted to see the big picture budget of what was brought to us as one project, the Twin Basin Drainage Project, again now called the Platte to Park Hill.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Project. And I guess one of my concerns is we're going to have a city park golf course, overland golf course, and now Park Hill Golf Course all down at the same time. Yes, we don't own Park Hill, but for people who golf and like to keep their revenue in our city and not go play in in neighboring'",
        "'speaker_8': 'jurisdictions. We're going to lose that revenue. Yes, will be compensated by the music festival for the lack of use, the lack of play, you know, at Oberlin. But we're going to have these three golf courses down at the same time.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And, you know, that's on top of all the rest of the other construction that's going to be happening because of the geo on that past. We're going to have lots of projects underway at the same time all over the city.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But I guess my just to get back to this particular bill here tonight, I want to first say that for those people who have raised concerns about the environmental impact, we just learned today that the materials management plan has been received by the city.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'They've got to review it. It'll probably be about three weeks before that document is public for everybody to see what the material management plan will be as they identify various materials or products that are in the soils that require action levels.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You know, based on what what. What they have identified. And in the information that I received today, I was told that there were about 70 borings that took place on the 39th Avenue Channel. Somebody mentioned there were only three.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So, Councilwoman, that's on the next bill.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. Yeah, sorry. We're still on part of alluding it all because in my mind I see it all as one project because that's how it was brought forward to us. Okay, so I'm sorry and I'll make my comments now and not make them on the next bill, but I'm just a little frustrated at how, unless we're asking'",
        "'speaker_8': 'the right questions and demanding information, that helps us understand the big picture of what we're dealing with. We see these things piecemeal and it's it's hard. It's hard enough for us to be able to keep it together. I can imagine how challenging and difficult it is for the community who's seen piecemeal as well.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And and this is not to. Say anything disparaging against our folks in the city who have worked really hard to bring these projects forward, knowing full well we do have some challenges and issues that we're trying to address in this city.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm just I'm just frustrated at our process in how we have roll this out to the community. And, you know, we've we've got a. A need that we're trying to address. But at the same time, it's not the what we're doing, it's how we've done it that hasn't felt so transparent and and upfront in in the information'",
        "'speaker_8': 'sharing that is is not only being shared with the public, but but oftentimes with us. And so I'm not sure how I'm going to vote tonight, but I'm just sharing some of my some of my concerns and frustrations with kind of where we've been with this.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And, you know, some have had more history than others with this project from the very beginning, but I'm probably leaning more towards not supporting it in in in large part because, you know, we were told we only needed 20 acres initially.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Now it's 25, but we're now up to 90 acres in Park Hill Golf Course. And and I'm not convinced that that is not in itself going to throw this budget completely on its head. So again, we went from $40 million with see not spending money to do drainage to the IGA that was later in excess of 150'",
        "'speaker_8': '. Then we were at 300 million when we did the wastewater rate increase. And I'm hoping that if we can. Do this without having to do 90 acres. We stay within that budget, but if we end up needing up to 90 acres, I'm concerned that there's going to be another ask to put more money into covering all of'",
        "'speaker_8': 'these costs for these four projects that make up this flat to Park Hill drainage project. Thank you, Mr. President.'",

The last regularly scheduled Council meeting within the 30-day review period is on 1-8-18.  The Committee approved filing this resolution by consent on 12-5-17. Pursuant to Council Rule 3.7, Councilman Espinoza called out this resolution at the Monday, December 18, 2017 Council meeting for a postponement to Tuesday, January 2, 2018.": [
        "'speaker_3': 'Seven ice, four days, 1396 has passed. All right, Councilwoman, can you please put 1395 on the floor?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes, Mr. President, I move that council resolution 1395 be adopted.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'All right. It has been moved and second it. All right. Questions for 1395. And I'll go first on this and we'll need the whole team working on 1395 to the to the dies here. So there's a lot of discrepancy on the number of bores.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, let me just start back. When did the EPA come through? Coal Clayton Global area Swansea and do soil samples. What year was that. Was that 2013. Do.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I'm Andrew Ross with Denver Department of Environment, Public Health and Environment. Yeah. So EPA came through and did the soil testing of residential soils between about 2000 and 2007, sort of a staggered approach.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But they did it again in 2012 and 13. Correct.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And they did do some follow up sampling in 2012. 2013, correct.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. And what was that for?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That was just confirmation sampling of properties that hadn't been remediated. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'My understanding and for those properties that were refused, what what was the what did the EPA do?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Oh, I don't have the numbers in front of me. How many people refused? But EPA went through their Superfund process recently. They called it a finding of significant differences, is the terminology. And they've decided that those properties will just not be cleaned up because those homeowners have refused to clean up.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. We'll leave it in the neighborhood of 10 to 12 residences.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. So it's gone down quite a bit. So we had a number of residents talk about the testing. Talk about the soil. And I wanted to hone in on the three borings along the 39th Avenue Channel that Kim Morse, Jennifer Eder kind of talked about.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I know that there's been a discrepancy from the administration. So can you talk about the number of borings that you have tested along the 39th Avenue Channel?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Sure. So keep in mind, we can only test properties that we have legal access to. So starting in 2016, we took 33 samples along the entire project through city owned right away. And we followed that up last summer.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Same right away with 38 more samples. So we've taken 71 total in city owned right away properties. In terms of the private parcels that the city is now acquiring. We're doing environmental due diligence sampling on all those properties.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The city didn't start acquiring those properties until November. Mm hmm. And so we've been working through those properties as the city acquires them, and we haven't gotten any of that data back yet.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Of the 71 samples. Can you tell us your analysis of those 71 samples which were hot, which, you know, did not meet the EPA standard?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Sure. So we did find in terms of two lead, arsenic and then other things. So for lead, we did find a lead detection above the EPA action level at 39th and high. In one boring. And that was it for the for the entire project.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Let me just correct you real quick. How many borings did you do along 39th Avenue?'",
        "'speaker_6': '39 from Franklin to High. The whole the whole thing is 71. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Just wanted to make sure.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. So we did have to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I did hear you. Right. I just wanted to. Just for the record. Okay. So you found one.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I need to correct myself. So out of the 71 samples, there was a lead detect above the EPA levels at 39th and high and one near still street behind the Coca-Cola building. The rest were all below the action, but just one.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'To 39th and high and behind the Coca-Cola bill.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So, too. So. When you found this information, how quickly did you release it to the community?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I don't know. I was with Citi at the time, so it's been up on our website since last summer. So it's been on our website for about a year.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. I can. Can. Can we get confirmation of that? I think. Sure. Didn't help Gin. Hillhouse was on the team. Gin. When these samples were taken, were they immediately released to the community?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We're thinking, you know, Celia was really involved in. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is she not here?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'She's not.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Here. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So those were taken in the summer of 2016. And I believe that they were up on our website, the fall of 2016.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Let's try to get it up as soon as we possibly can.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Speaking to the mic with.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Me, we try we work hard to get it up as soon as we can. And being transparent, we'll continue to do that and and report out to the community. We can. I can look back.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There was an email there was an email that I received that was requesting that the sample soils be made public because they were not public.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And now they are public. They are on our website.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. So they were never. There was always been transparency with those 71 samples.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So, yes, I believe they've all been on our website for a long time now. Granted, it's not the easiest place to navigate to on our website. Okay. I've tried to share the link with folks that have asked me.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. I'll come back. We have several others in the queue. Councilman, New.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'York. Thank you, Mr. President. From the last comments we had about the soil contamination issues. I was waiting for the consultant reports and I finally received those reports this morning after I asked for them. And I can understand after reading and looking at it in the recommendations, I can understand some of the community concerns about what's going'",
        "'speaker_7': 'on here. And the thing that concerns me is something that Councilwoman Ortega started to talk about is the materials management plan. It's you know and if you look in the this in the first report, which is 2016, it just starts off by saying it is recommended that a space project specific materials management plan be developed for the'",
        "'speaker_7': 'entire project corridor. The MMP or the plan can be used to assist field operations is particularly construction. In preparing for the identification and management of impact of soil and allow for informed decisions with regard to re-use options of excavated soil that results from construction very clear as in the the report last year says the same thing about'",
        "'speaker_7': 'the May materials management plan. And I can't imagine why we wouldn't have that all of a sudden. All of a sudden, when I questioned about this plan, all of a sudden this draft sort of mysteriously was appearing today and saying it wouldn't be ready for three weeks now.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Can you explain to me what's going on with this material management plan? Because I look at this is is almost like a hazardous waste plan. The city or a hospital that I'm familiar with would have and is much public concern there is about the the soil and what's going to happen with the soil.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Why would we not have this material management plan in this ordinance tonight?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we try to get the materials management plan done prior to actual any dirt moving activities. And we try not to do it too far out in advance in case we find more information in the meantime. Excuse me.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we're on track with what we thought, where we'd be with the materials management plan. Purely coincidental that we got a draft from our contractor today and we'll have a final in about three weeks and we'll get it up on our website.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Why is it not in the ordinance? I cannot find it. Mentioned a single word in the ordinance itself. I've looked through there and I don't see it anything at all. I don't see where SEMA is held responsible for this materials management plan at all.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Why is it not in the ordinance?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'll defer to my attorney on that. But the materials management plan is a significant part of the contract with SEMA.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's not listed in the contract. I looked in the contract and it's not mentioned whatsoever.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yes. Good evening, Steve Coggins with the P2P team for the Materials Management Plan. There's actually two versions of that. There is one that is required per the contract. But given the unknowns associated with the environmental and to control the cost more properly, we made the decision to hold the materials management plans and the environmental risk is retained'",
        "'speaker_11': 'by the city. So the city is doing the material management plan to for whatever may be found as the construction is taking place during the project.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Well, that's just not acceptable. How is it going to be held legally liable for the work it does with this soil? If if the materials major plant is not in their contract.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It is in their contract. They do have.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It in the contract we have in front of us tonight that we're actually being asked to approve the.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Are the RFP, which is the the request for proposal has a deliverable in Section five of the environmental, which is the part of the contract.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That's what we have here. It does not mention that whatsoever. I look through all those documents. It's not.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It's in the RFP and it's a reference document to the contracts of the requirements of the contract are in the RFP, technical requirements of which the materials management plan is included in Section five.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Environmental.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Well, it's not in the contract with SEMA.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It's part of the contract is a reference document.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But is but.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is there is there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Jessica Brody, Assistant City Attorney. So I think Steve's representation is accurate. Also, keep in mind that the materials management plan is is really focused on work practices that the contractor and its subcontractors are going to implement to comply with environmental laws and requirements, which are also part of the contract.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The materials management plan, which is something we do on any soil disturbing project is is the how and you know the work practices to accomplish the compliance with environmental laws. But irrespective, the contractor still holds a compliance with all laws, including environmental laws.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I understand what you're saying, but it's just not you know, the consulting report just says real clearly. We need to have that plan in place. And and, you know, and who's going to monitor the plan? Who when the construction goes along, who is is somebody being hired to monitor what's going to be happening with the soil and'",
        "'speaker_7': 'and the testing this required in their actual specific things being required in the consulting report.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Excuse me. Yes. So we will have a materials management plan supervisor on site every day. That person will be hired by the city and county. And on top of that, we'll have city staff out there on a frequent basis.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I plan to walk the site myself at least once a week.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'How often? When the soil be tested.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So. There's two answers to that. So we'll both test the soil prior to the to the soil disturbing activities. That's what we're doing right now as we acquire the properties. If through that process, the soil is considered to be below EPA action levels, then we'll test the soil every 500 cubic yards of material that's removed.'",
        "'speaker_6': '500 cubic yards is about 20 dump trucks, roughly? Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. And then if something is found, who has the authority to stop construction?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The materials management plans supervisor has the authority to stop.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So that's in the plan that will will begin. Will council be getting a copy of this plan to review three weeks?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We generally don't provide a copy for review because it's a sort of a standard document that we do on all sorts of projects.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But well, I'd request that we do get a copy of this plan, appreciate it. And also think that this plan needs to be posted for the public to see. This is a very important document, so I think it needs to have some public comment.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We'll get it posted to the website as soon as we have it finalized.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I don't I'm still uncomfortable with how can we proceed with this ordinance tonight without some kind of assurance that that management materials management plan is actually in place is going to be in place? I have seen nothing in the documents we have here that even mention this materials management plan.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We're just going to take your word for it. Is this there? Right.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yes, sir. Councilman Nu. I mean, it's clearly in the in the requirements of the project. So it is a requirement of the contract that both SEMA creates, the materials management plan that they it's part of their contract. They have to produce that.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It's a technical requirement of their contract. Again, the RFP is a reference documents and maybe review in the contract. It's a little bit layered in the back of the contract, if you will. And then also the city is doing a materials management plan as well for this particular project.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So there'll be one that will be citywide materials management for these scopes of work, and they'll also be responsibilities of the contractor. And they do it is an approval document of the contract that the city has to approve the same materials management plan.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'What what hardship would it cause if we delayed this for two months until we got the materials management plan developed and written and approved and looked at and and then we pass on this SEMA contract.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'What typically the materials management plan is like a health and safety plan and it's a public information plan and it's a project management plan. All these plans and a design build type of delivery method are typically produced by the engineer of record design builder who is hired.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So a lot of these plans are produced as part of the design phase of the contract. So that's that's where.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think we're going round and around. What car shape would it cause if we delay this contract tonight for two months until we got this plan written and.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The main thing would be cost because we have a current price and contractual schedule from our SEMA design build team. So if we continue to delay the contract and so potential solutions could go up.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Let me get our attorney in on this one, because I don't I don't think as we read it in, council secretary just said that if we delay, we'll be past the 30 day shot clock. Correct.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Kirsten Crawford Legislative Council. You know what? Let me let me look. We can't until you pass the 30 days, Kelly. Missiles. Do you know if we.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'My understanding. Okay. Otherwise, it passes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But what is the 30 day date?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The date is January 8th next week.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Yeah. So we would be past the 30 day delay next week?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah. I think you're on the right line of questioning, though. And can I just can you provide the wording in the contract that you're talking about? Because we we can access it. And I think I think what Councilman New is saying is I'm voting on something tonight and I'm taking your word for it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I don't have I don't have clarity in front of me.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yes, sir. We can't provide it. And it is in the again, in the RFP, which is a public document. So it is available and has been the RFP. So but we can absolutely provide it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You have a you have a signed document from CMA that they can apply to this plan.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Well, the contract that they've signed, is there is there a compliance with it?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes. Two copies of all. I'm sorry. Give us copies of that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Councilman and I just had one more question before I jump to Councilman Flynn. I asked if you can come back. What's your name?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm sorry. Andrew.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Andrew. You're new, so I just. Sorry about that. I've been working with Celia Vandersloot, and she is. She is now a consultant. Okay, so quick question, the boring question again along 39th. So you mentioned 71 and but you also mentioned every five cubic feet.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You will be doing testing.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Sorry, every 500 cubic feet. This is when we're moving soil. So we're gonna bring soil. Got it tested as we go along.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, some of the some of the fear, as I'm looking at the map here in coal, which I'm very familiar with, is that some of these, you know. Between Franklin. And. And see, man.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I. Hi.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Between Franklin and High is where we have the most residential properties, where we've. We've not dug up this kind of soil near residential properties. So I'm really concerned about those. How many borings have we tested in those streets?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So, again, we're we're still acquiring the properties. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And as of today.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'As of today, as of today, I think we've done about seven. But we're we're actually doing trenches because we've learned that we find we get better information out of a trench.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So four of those seven, how many are contaminated?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We don't have any of the data back yet. We did find building debris and quite a few of them. So when Janet Feder was talking about old houses on on Gilpin Street. That's correct. There was houses there at one point in time.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The common construction technique back in the day when you removed a house was to collapse it into the basement or the crawl space.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'When you have.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The contamination record back.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Hopefully in the next couple of weeks. Okay. Labs are kind of slow right now with all the construction going on in Denver. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I don't know who in the team might want to take these questions. Jason or Steve or Jen, have we potholed 39th Avenue? What have we found, Andrew? What have we found? Yes, those. Those 71 samples are right.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And what do you know? But what have we found? Well, we found lead, arsenic and poly aromatic hydrocarbons. In what quantities? So arsenic is ubiquitous in the environment in Denver. So pretty much every sample has arsenic. None of them were above the EPA action level, except for one.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I believe I'd have to check my notes. But the vast majority of them were below EPA action levels. Same with lead. We we found lead in a few places, but only had it above those action levels in a couple of places.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then the aromatic hydrocarbons, which was which is a byproduct of combustion. We found that throughout the the site, which is typical in Denver because people used to burn trash in their backyards. So we find that sort of everywhere we look.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Do you would you find if you went to if you went to Eastman Avenue in southeast Denver and Councilwoman Black's district, just let me pick on her for a second. If you potholed Eastman Avenue, would you find arsenic?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Most likely, yes. There's arsenic in native soils, uncontaminated soils. And. Okay, I've heard that before, Jen, maybe you're the best person to answer this, but if you're not, dish it off. What are just broadly speaking, what measures? What measures are in place in this contract and in our practices to ensure the safety of the neighborhoods?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'What steps will we follow to ensure the safety? I've heard about the eight foot fence. I've heard about dust control, etc.. Can you outline if there are any more? What do we.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Need to do? There are several and steve as the contract admin would probably be best.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'For.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Me out here, Steve. But you know, to start off is you have a lot of permits someplace, right? So they have to maintain and achieve all those permits and there are requirements within the contract such as this MMP.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And they also have the noise and dust, fencing, erosion control. So the list of regulations that we have that they must meet is fairly long. And Steve, maybe you can I'm.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Sure that's very accurate. Jan, there's a multiple of requirements that is required by the SEMA team per the contract. So there's air quality plans, fugitive dust plans, depending on the scope. First and foremost, I'd like to say that they have to comply with all codes, regulatory requirements and laws.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But in addition to that, we require them to submit various plans for all these types of environmental concerns. And each one of those plans are approval documents.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'For the city to approve.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Before they become part of the contract. The deliverable is currently part of the contract. The finalized plan will be as part of the design phase evolves to turn that into a final deliverable. So air quality dust, all kinds of environmental plans.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Again, things dealing with endangered species.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Where there's.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Raptors or prairie dogs and all those types of things are all covered in the environmental requirements. Section five of the RFP that I was speaking of earlier has a complete list of all the different deliverables just from the environmental standpoint that is required.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'By the contract. Just for the record, there's no prairie dogs out there either. I hope not really. Okay. Yeah. We saved a prairie dog colony when I worked at RTD. So it's a quite it takes a lot of work, quite an ordeal.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Those plans are a little thicker than you might think.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes. And they're very tasty at the gym. Maybe you could explain, because we've heard a lot about global landing outfall and how the testing beforehand showed one thing. But then we took out a lot more. And Jason, actually, you were talking today earlier about what that actually represented, so maybe you could explain that or Andrew.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'He's the expert.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So glows a little bit. Interesting story. So we did do a lot of environmental testing before the excavation started. Most of that was done with boring. And what we've learned through that is boring. We don't get good information on asbestos in soils and that's why we're doing the trenching instead of borings along 39th Avenue.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So in Globeville landing as the excavation went along, we uncovered a lot more asbestos in soils than we expected. We made the decision to treat all of the excavation as contaminated with asbestos, which we've done in other projects in the city.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So the numbers look like there's a lot of asbestos, but it's the numbers are a little bit elevated because we decided to treat it all as asbestos contaminated. So you're saying that any soil you took out of global landing outfall was treated as though it had asbestos?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Whether you verified that or not, did you not bother it? We did verify it. We did okay. Yes. Okay. And so you're doing trenching at 39th rather than pothole ing? Yes. For on the new properties that the city is acquiring so that we get better information on asbestos as we go along.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Have you done any of that yet or is that part of this contract? We don't have any of that data back yet. We did find building materials in some of the lots that the city has acquired our experiences.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'When you find building material, it's you know, it's about 5050, whether there's asbestos there or not. So we'll get that analytical data back in the next few weeks and let folks know as soon as we get it. All right.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilman Flynn. Councilwoman Black, I'm going to pop to Councilwoman Kimmich to enter into this discourse between councilman knew in his line of questioning.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilman Cohen Yeah, I'm not quite sure why no one from the team has a copy of the contract and found these pages, but I went through to try to find them. So here are the references for your question, Councilman, to the first reference incorporating the RFP requirements is on page five.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Then if you go to Exhibit A, it once again requires the contractor to follow all of the technical specifications from the RFP. The third reference is exhibit one, and that's actually where the proposer signs a document that says they will comply with everything that was in the RFP as well as within their RFP response.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So that's exhibit one and then Exhibit J makes a similar reference. And then there's a special. Anthrax conditions. And if you go to the it's towards the end and in that section, it's all the there's no page numbers in our system.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I can't give you the PDF page number, but in the special contract provisions, it has specific paragraphs about regulations related to hazardous materials. So that's on page six, I believe, of that particular attachment. And it talks about all the hazardous materials, including all the things we've been talking about, asbestos, petroleum, etc..'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so, so anyway, so.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'These are these are the documents.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This is right in front of us. Yes. And again.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I looked through it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. Well, it's because they don't use the word materials management, but it is just when you said it incorporates the RFP, but you can't provide us with a page reference or a section. It's very difficult. So going through and then finding where all of those requirements are actually in.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So so there are six references that I've counted that incorporate the RFP. Plus there is this paragraph specifically about handling of hazardous waste and following all environmental regulations, including asbestos and all these chemicals. So so the contractor clearly has, in what I'm reading, signed all this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And if I'm getting any of this wrong again, this is your job, not mine. But this is what I found.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'If it's at all helpful, we do have the vice president, senior construction.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Larry Walsh in the room.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And if it's helpful, he can come up and also reinforce the fact that this is a contractual deliverable that he is required to produce. Is that helpful?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think I think we have got what you need. I think we got what we need. All right. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm going to go. Mr. President, I would like to hear it because the reference to the RFP is in the contract. Correct. But they are we don't have the RFP in front of us. So I would like to know that the RFP does require and I know that it does, but it would be nice if we had'",
        "'speaker_6': 'a link to it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. It's reference and he signed it. But come on up here, Mr. Vice President. Sorry, Councilwoman Blackwell, your right to you.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Well, thank you, President Brooks.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Everything you heard from staff tonight is true. This will be our third design build contract with the city and county of Denver. We did your first to the Central Park Boulevard Project and I-70 and the Peoria Crossing Project.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They were both design build. They both had material management plans that we will submit for approval. And yes, everything that was cited that is in the RFP and referenced in the contract we're accountable for. That's part of our contract.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We understand that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You tell us your name.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm Larry Walsh. Thank you. I'm with SEMA Construction.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So you will be you will send us copies of the RFP, which that shows there shows there's a signed documents you've you've signed off on, right?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes, we've signed the contract. We don't have an executed contract that is pending City Council's approval.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You signed the RFP?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes. What? We signed the contract for issued the RFP. And that's how we prepared our proposal and what it's based on.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yeah, it was. The city should have that.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Yes, but but there is. Yes, absolutely. We will look at that. And it's referenced in all the the work that Councilman Kenny did. Thank you. To recite those references. We can highlight where the sections are in section five now.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You'll be helpful. We've since we can't see that so be nice to.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Yes, thank you. Absolutely. We will send that your way.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Black. Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Most of my questions were answered, but I just had one. So I think the real issue for neighbors is they need some reassurance that it's going to be cleaned up properly and safely. So I just was thinking of other.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'CITES as a Denver native that I know are now developed that once were industrial, like Lowry, Air Force Base Stapleton, the South Platte River used to really be a terrible place, right, John and Brighton Boulevard. So it seems to me that you all probably have standard operating procedures and I know we now know about amps, but whatever'",
        "'speaker_1': 'kind of assurances you can give to the people who live near there that they are going to be safe. And I understand their concerns. I also have confidence in all of you and in SEMA, but I think that's what everyone is mostly concerned about.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Yeah, no, I think is really good comment and we've heard it through our process. And so, you know, safety to our community is the number one priority. We're going to do everything we can to ensure that they are safe.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We've showed how we've gone over and beyond in our contract language to to make sure that that's the case. And every detail that we have, we're going to be transparent. We're going to share it. It's not our standard practice to do that, and we understand the concerns and we're willing to do that.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So, I mean, I hope that's enough to just say it is our priority. We will do everything we can to ensure safety. And as you mentioned, we have lots of experience. We we work in an urban environment every day.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We have a lot of experience and public works working on things like this as is not anything new. The fuel tanks you learned about the the landfills, arsenic lead, these are all things we run into on every one of our projects.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So we're confident that we'll be all handle in a safe way. I don't know if you have other things.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'd just like to add that the Globeville Landing Outfall Project, we've had air monitoring the entire time and not had a single detection of contaminants from the site. And so we feel we can do this project similarly without having any air deposition or anything that's going to cause harm to the residency.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If we felt that we were going to cause harm to the residents, we wouldn't be doing this project.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'How often are you at Globeville?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'For air monitoring you yourself. I'm not there very often, to tell you the truth. This project will be different. I'll be out there quite a bit. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Councilman Espinosa.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'What is the LED action level that you're using in the soils?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We're using the the EPA, Vasquez Boulevard, a 70 Superfund site number, which is 400 milligrams per kg.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So. In the soils. The summary that we got mentions borings. But you said that you did pothole. So is it pothole or is boring?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, we use those terms interchangeably. So they were borings done in the right of way.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So to me, a boring involves a, you know, a soil sample a drill that you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Know, they were done that group that way.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So not partly correct. He's just really literally digging up some dirt.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes. They were done with a physical, boring machine, a drill.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. At what depths were the soils taken, the samples taken from?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'd have to check to be accurate because we did two rounds and they were done differently. But we were trying to characterize sort of the top 12 inches and then below 12 inches. So I don't have the exact numbers.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I just I get frustrated when we ask for soil samples and we get a summary that just says we took 70 borings and we found two hot spots. And that I much would rather just you hear, give me give me the executive summary.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But also I'm sure you get that too.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Because that sort of matters because at 400 a 400 is is, is, is, you know, you couldn't use that soil to put on top of the lid that we're going to build. You couldn't stockpile 400, microgram soil, stockpile it, and then put it on the lid.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That is going to be the playground for the elementary school. That is that is an action level. Correct. Is it not?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes, that's correct.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So and then this. Area. It gets keeps getting marketed as a park sort of space. Is that play area or not?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So those soils that have elevated lead will be removed and taken to a landfill and replaced with clean fill.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But so what happens with the soils that don't have elevated lead? And are we talking what is elevated lead story? This is sort of the problem with not having an MP and sort of moving forward without knowing what it is that we're dealing with and how we're going to deal with it is and which is why I'",
        "'speaker_11': 'actually don't see any problem with saying, let's kill this thing and wait two months while you guys wrap it up, at least an MP, because now I'm confused that we have to amend piece, you know, one that the city is doing and we're going to somehow manage and one that the contractor is going to do and they're'",
        "'speaker_11': 'going to manage. You know. So I will ask more questions on that. Sure. What is what is the real danger to our community and constituents with with completing your testing, completing your MP before proceeding with a contract? So what is the danger in doing that to.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Continue what we're doing right now? There's no danger from my perspective.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I didn't think so. So it now comes down to just dollars, right? Is that the concern from public works that it's going to cost more money or might cost more money? We've got the SEMA guy here. How much more can it cost for you guys to wait two months?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'You'd be surprised, though, those delays do add up. And it's also a risk that he's going.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'To eat a whole bunch of unknowns.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'But a risk on our contract, right. Delays in those costs. And really, this is just the standard way that we do business. We do an maybe we will make sure that that's in place before we move any dirt.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And MMP is a process that's not going to give you the levels of the lead. And an arsenic is what we do is the process in place. It's very a standard document that comes along with any project.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I'm talking about the sort of standard operating procedure of, of, of, of, of. So one of my problems in prior government work that I had done was the lack of due diligence on things that we could know before we entered into any agreement, not saying that we couldn't mitigate anything that we found because we certainly have enough'",
        "'speaker_11': 'resources and technology and skills to do that. But we could know the problem in the right away and land and we're acquiring and all this thing we could be testing, testing, testing and come up with a full report and say this is to the best of our knowledge, the totality of what we might find.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And even this tells us, I mean, has huge question marks on it because we never truly know what we find until we find until we start digging. And what you're simply saying is, well, we're we're just comfortable starting that now, even though we have people that live in immediate proximity to this operation going, we want to know'",
        "'speaker_11': 'more. So what is the real danger if it's just simply some some dollars to simmer for us doing that extra due diligence and getting people, you know, familiar with this is the level of of of of of lead we have in the soil.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Arsenic is is consistent with other samplings that we've taken at other projects that we've completed with no health hazards or what. You know, in doing that.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'You know, I think it's a great concern. We want to do as much due diligence as we can to minimize our risk as an owner. I think an Andrew can come up here, but I think he would agree that we feel like we have done the due diligence that we need to understand what the risk is and'",
        "'speaker_12': 'we will continue as we acquire these properties. So we've done everything we can. We've made Swiss cheese of our right away those 71 warnings. Now as we obtain and acquire additional.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Say that when the samples haven't even been.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Know we.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Have we've gotten results on a right away. What he was mentioning is we don't have the results from the private property.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So that's what will be coming in in a week's time. Right. So we'll continue to get better and better data. But again, it's just our this is the normal process. And in our normal procedures of when an MP comes into place, you need to move in and understand your procedures a little bit better and move in.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'What I'm trying to articulate to you isn't, is I get it that that's your normal procedure, but it's not every day. Well, it is sort of every day that we go into sort of toxic, hazardous conditions. But it is not every day that we go in at this magnitude, this scale.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And and what is the real danger in fully completing our takedown of land, doing all the, you know, testing that we would normally want to do to sort of ascertain the scope, the level of the best of you know, I know that you're comfortable because that's what you do for a living.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But what about the layperson that is like, hey, you're digging up, you're kicking up dust. Some guys are going to go maybe have a hose on it, might be working on a weekend and might not have a hose on it, might be doing it on a holiday.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'What should I be concerned about and when? Who am I going to report to and why? You know, what in what should I do with my kids during this period of time, you know, is because I can tell you that 400 micrograms of lead is an action level in a play area.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And even though it's the limit for the rest of the soil is three times that amount, somewhere between 412 hundred is a lot of lead to be kicking around. And so that's what doing all this testing, knowing the totality of where it's at.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Getting it into the cities MP would be beneficial to the public and I don't see what the danger is in that. If it's dollars, I mean we're talking about health and environment and health concerns and stress.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So. All right. So if I may, I just wanted to chime in because it is every day that the city does projects in contaminated areas. Carl in Madison Rec Center, which is opening this week, we acquired a gas station.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We found a leaking underground storage tank as part of that acquisition. We manage that contamination as part of the Project Lavillenie outfall. We're doing a massive excavation through a Superfund site, through landfill material. This is what Public Works does.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah, I'm going to.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Tell you the problem with that charge ahead attitude, which is, what, just a few months ago.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Questions. Questions. All right.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Well, okay. How much did the Shoemaker Plaza was it supposed to cost initially?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think the original budget was around $4 million.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It was only 1 to $2 million, actually.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. I mean.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'All right. So how much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Did it vary from the Budget Office? I think the amount was somewhere north of 3.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Million on topic, though.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Close to 4 million. Well.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Well, she's the one that brought up this everyday problem. And here's what we need to fundamentally understand about that. Go at it, go rogue and hope for the best. And we have unlimited funds to do what it is that we're setting out to do because we don't.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'How much does Shoemaker Plaza end up costing it?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It ended up costing close to it, I think was an additional $4 million because of the culture we found.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Exactly. That is something we could have tested for. That is something we could have set up a drill rig on top of that plasma that existed there that day and drilled down and found coal tar and got off.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I don't know that we have enough money to do this right now because there's a contamination problem. Let's find out the extent of this. Is it everywhere underneath here?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, first of all, we did test and you didn't find it in the Shoemaker Plaza project. But as is often the case, when you're dealing with old industrial areas or non homogenous areas like low sampling gives you an idea, but it's never going to give you the full picture.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But again, sampling is one of the ways we mitigate risk. We also have contingency to address environmental concerns and environmental risks that are not anticipated at the time that we do the testing and develop the plans. But now we're holding contingency.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'As a city council and approving these things and fiduciary oversight and whatnot. The when we do that and we allow you to sort of take your best guess and march on things that we could actually learn. Just because we want to save a few million dollars and it is costing us more millions of dollars that comes from'",
        "'speaker_11': 'other projects that we're trying to get funded. And that doesn't help our case when we continue to go down that road, which is, well, our standard operating procedures sort of act with some degree of blindness, and we know that we're blind.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'You know, when all I'm saying is, what's two more months waiting for these soils tests in developing a better picture?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Even with those additional soil tests, we will not have perfect knowledge of what we're going to find when we go out there. We're never going to have perfect knowledge until you actually do the excavation. But we think we have enough information at this point to move forward with a contract.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have budget to deal with the environmental issues that we're anticipating and we have contingency to deal with those conditions that we haven't yet discovered in the event that we run into. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So then that's the difference between where you are as an attorney and where I am as a counselor, because I don't feel like I have enough information. And I think Wayne clearly doesn't even know me. He hasn't seen the map that because it's attached to some I mean, that requirement is attached to an RFP that was issued'",
        "'speaker_11': 'only to the contractors and never shared with counsel.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Well, and it is on your website. We just sent a link to everybody and so it has been on the website and now you have a link that will direct you exactly there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Councilman, can I go to Cashman and you can come back. Okay. You still got some more questions?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'No, I will look for that. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Councilman Cashman.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Andrew Please remember, his name is new to me. I remember.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'His name.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Andrew So it is 71 borings. I think you got results from half of those. Is that about right?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I know we have results from all those, but it was added to the boards. So no, we have data from all 71 samples.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'What's the data you said you're waiting for?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's that's information or data that we collected on private parcels that the city has acquired since November 2017.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And those are coming up in the near future. You said.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes. So we started those as soon as the we acquired those in late November. And generally speaking, it takes about six weeks to get analytical results back. And with the holiday and.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'About, how many borings, approximately, are we waiting for?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I believe it's around seven trenches that we did. The trenches is a little bit bigger than a boring.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I understand. And so I'm sorry. I just sure if I can add to the question. So we've begun to explore private properties, correct, that we're acquiring. How much more of that are we looking at? Another ten bore trenches, another hundred trenches as we go down the corridor?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Where about are we at?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we will do trenches on every parcel we acquire and. And it's about 30, approximately 30 parcels total. And so we're just at the very beginning stages.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. Thank you. That's all, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Councilman Castro. Councilman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Mr. President. So we all received the pinion report information today. So this tells us exactly where certain properties were tested. And these were these were public properties, correct?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes. Those were properties that were owned by the city and county in 2016.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. And who is it that is doing the materials management plan? Is that being done by SEMA? Is that a separate contract? Are we environmental health doing that?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So it gets a little confusing because there's two different elements in this.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'One, the one that was referenced earlier that we just got it today will see the.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Be released in three weeks.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes, that is one that we had Pinon as our contractor. Right, for us. And so it will actually be Department of Public Health and Environment document and that will be for the environmental work that will happen before SEMA comes in to do the excavation.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. So just to be clear, though. The. The borings that were done that were part of this report is is what the materials management plan is based off of knowing what contaminants we've found in the soil, sort of generally where we've found them.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We know we need to do more borings on the private property that we're acquiring because we haven't had access to that, correct?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's correct. But we also did sort of desktop evaluations of the private properties so that we have ideas where there's potentially building debris, potentially underground storage tanks. So those are things that we we think we know from looking at old maps are important.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So based on that data, that helps you determine where on the properties to do those borings.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Correct?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. And typically, how many borings on each property would I assume that that's based on how much land each parcel entails?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah, it depends upon that.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Tabletop exercise of.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Looking at older documents in older, older city documents of what was the land use, you know, going back to the founding of the city. So if if we think that there's only one house, it might have been on a parcel and it's now gone.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We might just do one trench. But if we think that there was multiple things going on that property, we might do multiple trenches.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So just to kind of put this into perspective, Andrew, the work that's been happening on GLOW and that's what this this document is all about. Because of what was on that site. Is it safe to say that we knew that?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well, first of all, it was a it's an EPA operable unit. So the minute you get in there and start tinkering around with the soils, it it throws you into that EPA oversight, which is different from the 39th Avenue Channel because we're talking about.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Parcels that were not residential unless they were some of those where property owners chose not to have work done on them. But so is it safe to say that? That site was far more contaminated. Not to discount the concerns that community folks have raised along the 39th Avenue Channel, but having it been a former operating lead smelter'",
        "'speaker_8': 'and a landfill that we anticipated finding a lot more nasty stuff in those soils than we think we might over here.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I was definitely in the big difference is the landfill. So we knew that we'd be opening up the landfill global and we just didn't know what we'd find. When you open up a landfill, you never know what you're going to find, even no matter how many borings you do prior to that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So. Have we encountered any methane at all?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Surprisingly, no. So methane has not been a problem at global landing.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. So just the last thing. The federal law, the Resource Conservation Recovery Act really is what ensures that we have some of these various procedures in our contracts to ensure that we're not just making the contractor follow what we tell them, but it's what the feds mandate that we do under and to recruit.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Correct?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Correct. Okay. And the materials management plan is really a reflection of environmental law and regulations. So all of that is built into the MMP.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. Thank you. I have no further questions.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Ortega, I'm going to ask a question. To my engineer fled. What, Bruce? Yes. In the back. Thank you, sir. So. So. I have a question for you around. You know, we're talking about this issue came up to me in 2018 when the EPA came and said that we had hundreds of homes who they hadn't'",
        "'speaker_3': 'tested yet. And so the fear came up to me is what's happening on our current environment when flooding occurs in the dirt like. Can some of these arson addicts lead and issues get you know on a flood traveled through our neighborhood in our houses with our kids.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'How at risk are we in this neighborhood of coal?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Council President Honestly, I'm not the right person to answer that question. I deal with the stormwater that kind of can't get into the pipes and runs on the streets and gets pretty deep and goes in across spaces. So I have.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'To defer.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'To the EPA and the people on.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That. Okay. Can anybody answer that question? My question is, are we at risk? I had this question come from a community member of if nothing is dug up, are we at risk anyway in our own yards and things like that, especially during in May when it's it's the rainy season and it's flooding and things like that?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, there's always a potential that there could be a problem if there was enough rainfall to wash that dirt into a receiving water and go on downstream. But you have to have an exposure for for there to be a problem in your body.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So you have to. Drink that water, which I wouldn't advise him really to be drinking out of the gutters. So, you know, as long as it's, you know, normal processes, it is going to end up in the South Platte and go downstream.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But that's going to take a really extreme storm event for that to happen.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. And then quick question before I go to Councilman Espinosa and then you can probably answer this. The number of you know, I did get a chance to talk to some of the folks who were a part of the the group that you had of of neighbors, what you call group design work group.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'How many times did you guys meet?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'In the past we met. You know, it really was topic driven, but it was basically about every three months.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. And how many times monthly?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'You know, as information came in, if we had that amount of information. But consistently we met about every three months.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'How many people were in the design work group?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'It varied. I think what we have on our list is about 17 people and that would vary in attendance anywhere from, you know, seven to the full amount of people.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And those were all folks who were in the impact zone, which I call right on 39th, between 39th and 38th, where they all folks who lived in. Right in that area or all around Cole.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Yes. I mean, really, you also had R.A. President. We have the pride representative. So it was broader than just the residents. But there were probably, you know, Debra montoya and folks that you heard from tonight were on our design work group.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So a lot of them were residents, right, between Franklin and High.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Or was there anybody in the design work group? And I don't know, because I know a lot of folks have left because it's late at night. But who spoke in opposition? Do we know anybody from?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'No, not that. SAT on our design work group. He you know, and would come as a guest and he would speak. And so we had opportunity for that and they could listen. But that was actually on the design work group.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Mr.. Romney. Okay. Uh. Councilman Espinosa.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yeah. So I followed the link. There are eight attachments there. There is not a single RFP. The closest we get is a reference in the contract exhibit I, the RFP response, which says incorporated herein by reference as amended and supplemented by exhibit, I mean a one sorry which is not attached.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'There's simply exhibit I, so I don't have a copy of the RFP.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You never get them.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Okay, well, we thought Angela said that she sent you a link. Did you click on the link that Angela has sent?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And so I immediately had responded back to her and said that we what we are looking for is the RFP submitted to the company and issued to the contractors. She sent me a link to the.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hold on real quick. Councilman. Councilman knew that you. Did you see it?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I looked through the same. I didn't see the RFP at all. I looked through every one of the documents to see, like a thousand pages, but I didn't see anything. The RFP.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah, we just. John McGrath City Attorney's Office. The RFP is a reference document that's incorporated.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'By reference.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And is a part of, of the contract documents.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And is binding on the.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Contractor.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we can point you to the Met.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'To the exhibit or to the reference.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The RFP is a lengthy document, including the technical.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Specifications and technical.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Requirements is.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Probably over.'",
        "'speaker_3': '300 pages. So physically attaching it to the document that you see in front of you hasn't been done, but it's incorporated by reference in various places.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In the contract.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And unfortunately I didn't come with.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'A hard copy of the contract with me.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But we're happy to get you the references to the various places.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And this is not you didn't do anything wrong, trust me. You didn't do anything wrong. This is sort of normal, right? The RFP is something that gets issued very early in the process and the contract sort of as a result of that.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But we're talking about about these hazardous materials and how we're going to treat them. And to Wayne's point, when it brought up this question and then we ended up in this cross talk where it sort of revolved, you know, it also has its genesis in the RFP.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And all I'm saying is, at this point in time, we do not have that and we didn't have that. And so we wouldn't have been able to even connect that, Don, until this very conversation, which is, again, why I'm sitting here sort of going, well, what is the danger in us taking a little more time and trying'",
        "'speaker_11': 'to understand? Because now we now we learn that there is not one but two management plans in place, one that is going to be managed in within the contractors purview, and one that is going to be in the city's purview.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And and I don't understand that division of work, to be honest. And so there's there's a lot there that is and that is the crux of the concern that we've heard is about hazardous materials and the impacts that it has.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And so what it's done is it's raised more questions and it's answered for for for somebody like myself. And so I'm looking for the source documents and the follow up sort of drafts. If we don't have the one we have today, at least a sort of example of what we might do on a similar project, maybe the'",
        "'speaker_11': 'gold landing for an example, to sort of see how we merge these two overlapping seemingly management requirement. I mean, management plans, you know, well, I think as has been described.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This is a design build project. That's the delivery.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Method we've chosen. And in a.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Design build project, it's really an evolving process. You you start from where we are today and we're at a limited level of design right now. And I think, as Jessica mentioned, that as the process evolves, you get more and more information and then you act on that information.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So material management plans will evolve as more information is revealed.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'During the course of the of the project, of the project. And so what we have in the.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Contract is the requirements. The requirement is for the contractor to deliver a material management plan. The city then has the right to review it and approve it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And it's a again, it's an evolving.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Give and take process, so to say, well, let's wait until we get two weeks or two months or some number of days further. We won't get any further in design during that period of time or we.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Won't get any further with our.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Onsite work. And so we'll be pretty much in the same place two months from now as we are today, because that information.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Will not.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Be evolving and we will not be learning more about what it is.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We need to deal with. We know a certain level. We have done due diligence that tells us what's on our radar. And then as the process evolves, both.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In design and on site, work.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Will continue to.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Fine tune that. So maybe my confusion is actually maybe it's the wrong term. Maybe it's the fact that we've been sort of treating this as to my piece is the way it was discussed. So what is based on what you were just saying, I get a different understanding, which is as we take down land, we are performing'",
        "'speaker_11': ', sampling and testing and providing environmental reports that the contractor is then required to do the management plan. We're and then we will review it. We don't actually have or we don't produce our own.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, in this case, on the land that we take down, we are doing our own analysis.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And that will be.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'As a city, responsibility.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'For those.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Properties. Then as the project evolves and we're disturbing soils.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There'll be a.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Contractor generated materials management plan that we will then review, approve.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And administer.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Through separate testing or through. And you doing your further testing. Okay. Thank you. Real quick if if it's helpful councilman new in Espinosa that mishap. Haynes did email the technical requirements to all you guys and it's about 200 pages and on page 45 is the beginning of section number 5.0 of an environmental and on page 52 shows'",
        "'speaker_11': 'a deliverable in the Contract for Materials Management Plan as well as the other environmental deliverables required per the contract. And one of the things that that may help to clarify just a little bit in typical business that we do a lot of design bid build right in typically the materials management plan is a function of the design'",
        "'speaker_11': '. Under the design build. We can't do those types of plans until we've hired the engineer of record and that's who Sema now is. So as they develop the design under the design build delivery method, the materials management plans and all the things you typically would.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'See in a design bid build will be produced.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And approved by the city as part of the design phase.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. I think that got to some of my questions. Just some some simple. Yes. In those materials management plan is not a document that tells us what's in the ground. It tells us how we're going to handle what we find in the ground.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Correct?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes or no? That's that's correct. Thank you. So Sema can't develop the map until it has a contract, is that correct? Yes, Mr. Walsh. And not going to do that for free? I suppose that is correct. That's okay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's an unusual concept. People didn't wanting to be paid for their work. So so the map will be developed by SEMA after they have the contract and there will be a plan review by the city and they won't move a shovel full of dirt until you approve that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Is that correct? That is 100% correct, sir. All right. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Councilman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay not to beat this dead horse. So we also have our own material management plan that's been done. My opinion, based on the borings that we've had them do for us on the properties that we've already tested and we're starting to do that on properties were acquiring, which is per the contract that we just approved, right?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Correct. And so that that's our own guide for what we know is in the soils. Our management plan tells us how we believe they should be handled and then the contractor will go do that as well. And hopefully they're not going in the same boreholes.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'They're looking at other locations on the on the parcels that they're going to be doing, any of the sampling?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Correct. So the MLP that we're developing will be for any remediation work that we do prior to SEMA taking over a property. So if we find something.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We're doing that cleanup.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We'll do the cleanup under the under the city's MMP.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. So where is that covered in the costs? If we're doing that clean up initially. I mean, I, I just assume that was part of the work the contractor would be doing.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Yeah. So within the contract we just have what, what's already been in the RFP documents and that's what SEMA has agreed to as part of the RFP. We do have an environmental bucket where we will budget a bucket budget, a budget where that additional cleanup will come out of.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So we do have some things set aside outside of seeing this contract for that cleanup for those private properties.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So just to be clear, getting back to the big picture budget, do we have a contingency in each of the budgets and then an overall contingency left in the total?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We do.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So the way we developed all the projects is every project has its own contingency. So City Park Golf Course has one below 39th Avenue and Park Hill all have their own contingencies. And then we have an overall what we're calling a program contingency.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So the program contingency is kind of for those unknown unknowns, and we would expand our project contingency before we would go into that program contingency.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. And not to convoluted this, but we have a separate budgetary appropriation that will come to us next week to committee. Right. That will come out of wastewater that will actually cover these costs. So this is the contract with the contractor, but we will be seeing a separate bill come to council that will transfer monies from wastewater'",
        "'speaker_8': 'into the project that will cover part of these costs.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So there will be a another action that we'll ask you to take for issuance of bond money. Right. So as part of the rate increase, there was a bond issuance in 2016. Right. And that was for about 130 million and more is coming up.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So I don't say around numbers. And then this will be for the additional amount to get us up to the 206, which made the 206 for the bond part of the 298.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. I just thought it was important to mention that. So it doesn't come as a surprise to you when that part of this project moves forward. So, Laura, is there anything else you wanted to add?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I just want to clarify.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There were two actions that was introduced by the floor Perry Capital Program Manager in the Department of Finance. When we brought for the rate increase to City Council in July of 2016, as part of that six year program, there were two revenue bond issuances that were attributed to the Part two Park Hill project.'",
        "'speaker_0': '115 million were fully.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Brought forward to council late last year. The second issuance is planned for to come forward to council in the next couple of weeks, and that is planned to be $77 million.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Great. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'All right. Thank you. Just want to take. It tells me. Cashman. No. Okay. I think we finished our questions. See no other questions. 1395 hearing. 439 five is not close. Comments by members of Council. I'll go first. This being District nine in my neighborhood and in a long, long, long conversation with the community and the city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So in Denver. Correct. 2015 or 2016? 2015. January. I'll never forget it. We're in Jake's and there are over a hundred neighbors in there because they're being told that many homes are going to be taken out because of a drainage project.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And, you know, and Jennifer and I and the team have gone over this that downtime is probably one of the worst starts to a process that I've seen when folks who were super supportive of what the city had done prior to were all of a sudden skeptical, did not believe, did not believe in the process and all'",
        "'speaker_3': 'of those things. I will say that the process really improved and it really improved. Getting that group together, that was around the 39th Avenue Channel. The steering committee is what I really call them, 17 members that you heard here.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think that really was really helpful for the community to really walk with the city to see what was going on around this project. This is this has been a tough one because for whatever it whatever reason at the city, we can never get our process right.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We struggle with our outreach. But here I would say that we improved our outreach of the 17 members of the committee. One my neighbor here, Mr. Eddie Armijo, is in opposition and a lot of those neighbors live right there on 39th.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And you heard from one of them earlier tonight. Let me let me tell you something. In 2013. And people have always asked me in the community, you know, we feel like this is tied to I-70. We feel like there are all these other issues going on.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Why can you why do you see yourself supportive of this? How do you support a drainage project like this? 20 1300 year flood in Boulder. I don't know if you guys remember that 100 year storm, if that same storm would have happened, not just in my neighborhood, Councilwoman Ortega, but in the Mark Moncler Basin, which has proven'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to be the worst basin in the city of Denver before I-70 was an issue. Everything else that was the worst basin. You know why? Because everybody was calling me and emailed me in 2011 to fix that. Way before.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'CityLab. I don't know if many people have heard CityLab. With our recent climate change issues going on globally, CityLab just came out with two articles. And CityLab is for folks who are urbanist and folks who are city dwellers to think about best practices across the country.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'CityLab came out with an article saying. If cities do not start investing in drainage now, they will pay for it in the future. They came up with another article after everything that happened in Houston, after everything that happened in and in Florida, saying that make the proper investments now.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This is this is best practices. This is why I am supportive of this project. I'm not supportive of bad processes. I'm not supportive of individuals in my community not having a clear understanding about contaminants. And we must get much better at that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You guys, this description that I've heard tonight has been a good description. But for whatever reason, there are people in my community who do not feel like it's transparent. They do not feel like they have a good understanding of it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so we've got to improve our process. And that's why you have folks sitting here in opposition. Some of the major issues that I needed to solve tonight for me to be in favor was I've heard from three individuals in my community that we only had testing of three borings.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think you made that very clear. We had over 71 testing and two contaminants. And so that was incredibly important. Another another important factor for me was that entire steering committee that was around the 39th Avenue Channel.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And the specific comments that they made to me of saying why they were supportive when they weren't supportive originally and what got them there. So tonight, you know, I'm going to be supporting this this whole and Councilwoman Ortega said we have to look at the entire the macro program of all of this, the macro of the plans'",
        "'speaker_3': 'of Parkview for folks in my district. 3500 households have greater flood protection than they would have if we did not do this. 3500 households. So. For folks to understand my reasoning. That's it. At the end of the day.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, Councilman Espinosa said, how are you going to look back three years from now for for him? He wanted to look back three years from now, three years from now, if anything happened. And I can't look at those constituents and say I voted no because I was scared.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That this wasn't the right move. 3500 households. You don't have to be proud of me, I'm telling you. I've looked at the data and that data I have in front of me today, I feel confident in that. And so that's why I'll be supporting.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. Counsel Mark Taylor.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Mr. President. So as I said earlier, you know, this project started looking at how we would address the problem in the neighborhood. And I actually advocated with Diane Barrett that we go to see that and say instead of spent spending the $40 million on I-70, let's address this problem in the cool neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That's what we started out addressing. It became a much bigger problem than that or project, I should say. So I am supportive of this tonight in working forward to address the problem. I only wish that when all of this came forward, we would have solved the problem for the Globeville neighborhood, because the Globeville neighborhood is still going'",
        "'speaker_8': 'to see flooding happen on the west side of the riverbank. And, you know, I challenged our our manager of public works at the time that we needed to include money in this budget to solve that problem concurrently with solving the problems that we're doing for this area.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I also wish we would have been as focused and concerned about the health impacts to the Globeville, Swansea and neighborhoods with the I-70 project. That is also going to upset what we know are heavy metals in those soils because that's where all the Asarco contamination spread to.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And as they were getting to the end of the cleanup in the Globeville neighborhood, part of the settlement was they had to keep testing beyond Globeville. They went to Elyria, they went to Swansea and they went into coal, went into Clayton.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That's why this is now the Vasquez I-70 Superfund site. And again, many of those properties were cleaned up. I have a map right here showing which ones had which contaminants. We also know that arsenic was something that was found in neighborhoods all around the city and in the Globeville neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'They used to have a yellow front store that sold fertilizer. That's one of the things that that has arsenic. And so there was argument back and forth between Asarco and CDB at the time as to whether or not that contamination came from yellow for it or whether it actually came from Asarco.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so, you know, that's kind of irrelevant to this conversation right now, but I think it's important to to know some of that history of how it was argued that we saw arsenic throughout these neighborhoods and then they compared these neighborhoods to neighborhoods across the city and found similar contaminants of arsenic.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I think this is a project that needs to happen in terms of solving the flooding problem for this area of the city. And I will be supporting this tonight. I also want to just say thank you to all of the city folks who have met with me on multiple occasions regarding this drainage issue, because I've had'",
        "'speaker_8': 'many questions and many concerns and just appreciate the time you all have taken to to sit down with me and answer my questions.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes, Councilman Ortega, it's been a labor of love for the city team. Well done, Councilwoman and Councilman Cashman. I apologize.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I don't even go there. Thank you, Mr. President. So I'll be thrilled when 3500 homes get get added flood protection. But I just don't believe in the staff knows this. I don't believe this program's cooked long enough. I truly don't it I don't believe we're worried about delaying for two months because of costs.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Other than that, we've got to get this going again because we have an intergovernmental agreement that the previous council signed that has dates where we need to get this done so it doesn't hold up the I-70 project or we pay at least $5,000 a day.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And this is this is part of that, with all deference to to this being stock show celebration night, this is not my first rodeo when it comes to Superfund style hazards. I have familiarity with agencies who are charged with protecting the public health but failed to carry out their charge.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I cut my teeth environmentally. As a journalist covering the remediation remediation of hazardous waste created by decades of radium process at Shattuck Chemical Company on South Bannock Street, also known as operable unit number eight, and in that case, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment spent a few years telling the neighborhood'",
        "'speaker_9': ', this is safe, we're not going to dig this garbage up and carted out of town. We're going to mix it with cement and bury it on site. And they did that. They created this huge monolith in the overland neighborhood until Senator Wayne Allard arranged for Senate hearings that were held at the Washington Park Community Center and John'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Collins Church. And evidence finally came up after years of looking out at city staff that was frustrated and wondering why the neighborhood neighbors kept complaining. And they dug it all up and they finally carted away in the case of the 39th Avenue Channel.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'There is no distance from from the homes to the project. That's. That's. A painful truth. And we're looking at the beginnings of getting the information that we need that would make me more comfortable supporting this. We've got part of the borings trenches done.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We've got this materials management plan that's going to get done. And I understand that it's going to cook along with the project. It's a dynamic document, but I haven't seen it yet. And like I say, I mean, I've had good people, good, honest people think they had the right, right deal here.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'If I'm living next to that that channel, I'm not dealing with promises. I want all the information possible before I'm going to say that this is something that I'm going to declare safe. Because like I said, I've heard it before.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I've heard it before. So I definitely am not going to support this tonight. And like I say it, it's moving too fast for the wrong reasons. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'All right. Thank you. Councilman Castro comes to this one was first happy.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And Angela, thank you for working to get this document. I love this RFP. This is this is all the data. I mean, all the information. I, I, I wish we were getting. I get why we don't, but don't be surprised if I ask for these in the future because it's all here.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And I could have known it back in April of this year or last year. Actually, the the the so something I don't know that, you know, I sort of wish the whole room were still here. So something that I think staff may know or maybe may not, but I don't know that the general public knows is that'",
        "'speaker_11': 'of all of these two basic drainage projects, this is the only one that I actually genuinely love. I like this project. I don't like that. It's a it's a you know, it's a stormwater project for CDOT. I do like the project is a stormwater project for North Denver and East Denver and everything north of 39th Avenue.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I do wish we were piping from.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The city park.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And more from Park Hill golf course over to this because it certainly has the capacity, given those ginormous conduits that we put over at Globeville. But then I don't like what we're doing to Globeville and the Platte River there, because I do think.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But I mean, this is. This has got the potential to be a better version of our Lakewood Gulch. You know something? If it were if we were to take better advantage of the development opportunities along the north edge of this, something akin to Speer Boulevard, you know, the Cherry Creek thing.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And so you're sort of accommodating multiple. You're creating a good public amenity. You're creating a, you know, a healthy environment. You're cleaning up toxins in the process. And you're you're.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You're you're you're.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Far exceeding any sort of stormwater needs that we had established in our 2014 master plan buy, buy, buy, buy huge amounts of acre feet. So if it were B and C, that wasn't part of this damn picture. This is the one project, the opportunity we should be taking and we should be funneling everything into this.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And but we should also be doing it right. This is our AP lays out an acquisition timetable that goes all the way until mid mid next year or this year. So June of this year. And so to me, there's nothing.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It's prudent. It's. Yeah, it's dollars. But hell, this. The market might change and Trump might do something stupid and everything. Like all the things that we do we love and hope and dream for are are, you know, something?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The market is is vulnerable. It always has been and always will be. And it's our decisions that sort of help support good things and bad things. And and so what's tough is at a time when we have record high prices in construction and we just leveraged multiple hundreds of millions of dollars in the National Lessner Center and'",
        "'speaker_11': 'the FAA, the airport and the storm water thing, and now bonds. There's no shortage of work here. There's shortage of workers. There's no shortage of housing. There's a shortage of affordable housing. And this level of investment can be captured, whether it's now or six months from now.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That's a job that Semur would be glad to take whenever Denver offers it. And if the only reason is, is again, you know, we have an IGA, we have a commitment and you know, you, the councilmen have a fiduciary responsibility to to rubber stamp this stuff, even with a bunch of unknowns.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And that could be knowable and a bunch of information that we could provide the public, but we just don't have it yet is that's not my idea. I'm sorry. Yeah, I adopted it, but I you know, the people of Northwest Denver put me here.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'You guys timed it such that I didn't have a say in that idea. And and but I do now. And there is if see that's a real partner with us in is concerned about people the way we are they should be willing to amend that ACA if this is somehow a deal breaker because guess what, their own'",
        "'speaker_11': 'timetable, their own commitments to their parties have not been met. They're missing their deadlines. They're you know, their promises are not on the timetable that they've been throwing out. There might be for a whole host of reasons. Some of them we all know about because I'm going to talk about them right now.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Because that's what it boils down to. If we learned anything from the city park decision, is that the lack there, the lack the decision or lack thereof? Because it really wasn't a decision. It was just a ceding of that responsibility to us.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Is that the power and responsibility to look after the health and safety concerns of citizens and the environment of Denver lies here in the legislative branch. It's using our charter authority to exercise oversight over the executive branch. The judge basically said that.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'You know, it's like, you know, I see problems in what we're doing, what's being proposed here, but it's not the judicial job to do this. That's what you have a legislative body for. And that legislative body paved the way through that IGA.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And that legislative body needs to sort of correct course. This is a good project. I like this project, don't get me wrong, but I don't like the way we we steamroll and force it down our public's throat. We've done it too many times to too much this recently.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And even though this is probably the best of these projects, this is also the one that's going through the most toxic soil in the whole adventure. And it's the one that we can we're requiring all this land that we can know more about, what it is that we're about to undertake, and we can be more transparent and'",
        "'speaker_11': 'let people know. And make it make a clear case that there's nothing better for for North Denver, even though it does have this seed component. You know, in a perfect world, that sucker would go away and we'd have all this great development and opportunity.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And this would dry up the boulevard for for redevelopment and it would be riverfront on steroids. Except for if we do that. I want tools. And I've been fighting them for over for two and a half years here.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Tools to address displacement and gentrification. When you bring it, when you put that much opportunity in an area, people are going to get pushed. And that's no different, actually, with this amenity. To be honest with you, people like and who've been there for 60 years.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'You know, once they start, if you've been there for 60 years, he probably went from a sort of a a life of sort of expanding income to now a point in his life where he's probably on a fixed income.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And when we do this sort of level of investment and we his property values continue to go through the roof and his fixed is a fixed income, but it means cost of living in life. Expenses. Expenses go up.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That's who gets pushed out. We still don't have tools for that. But it's been stated time and time again that we care about the citizens. You know, it's going to be in the home plan. So I'm going in a whole bunch of areas.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But these decision, these investments in infrastructure matter and we're we're blindly going into the dirt here and readily chalking up to the fact that, yeah, we know that there's millions of dollars worth of unknowns there, and that's okay.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But that's millions of dollars that could be doing other things for this city. And why not look at this? Because I was just told three weeks ago. That. Yes, that that that that water that is being detained in City Park could actually be put into this 39th Avenue channel.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And all the capacity that she needs is it would be maintained. That's a first it's the first time I was hearing that after being essentially acknowledged that that was not the case, that these two components were needed in order to preserve 100 year storm water mitigation for for the highway.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So if that's the case, we just squandered another $100 million in in in that effort. And and that is money that could have been done for affordable housing by, you know, granted, this is a completely different thing. But it's an ask of our citizens for a long period of time.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And so rather than helping people citywide, we're helping we're doing this one thing for what? So I'm rambling my point. I mean, it's just you can see that I'm frustrated because I want if we if plan support if this 39th Avenue channel is the only project to come forward.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I would be working hard to try and make sure that the public was comfortable with what we were doing and making sure that it happened. And but but we're doing this. There's this the thing that, you know, everyone's going to laugh because I'm referencing Chairman Sekou that the thing about he and him talking about the trust issue'",
        "'speaker_11': 'is because of what happened on that sales job. You know, oh, these things have nothing to do with the highway when they had everything to do with the highway. Had nothing to do with the highway. Had everything to do with the IGA.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The only reason we fast tracked those things versus this. You know, and so. So I'm just it's a message to everybody. It is our responsibility on council. We can't rely on people raising their voice, putting their own money and time into suing the city to try and get us to do the right thing when it's just a'",
        "'speaker_11': 'matter of us going, you know what? What is too much? What is what is going till June 30th when we have them almost the entirety of the soil testing done? We have a very good understanding of what's what's to come, what's wrong?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The cost of borings. The cost of these tests are cheap. To get a better profile of what's there. But I can, you know, so it's just, you know, I. So, again, I don't I'm not opposing this because I don't like the project.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I am opposing this because I don't think it has to happen right now today. I think it can happen in the first two quarters of this year and we would be better for it and the community would be better for it.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And I think if we just started to acknowledge what it is that we're doing and why and we're more transparent and honest with people, they wouldn't they wouldn't feel like we were hiding something. You know, the reference to shell games.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And so. Just trust. Trust people that they get it. They support and love this city the way you do. And yeah, there'll still be disagreement. Like, I'm a freaking counselor. I get it. You're not going to please everybody all the time.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But I found that, you know, meeting them in a place where they need to be met and being honest with your responses goes a really long way and not trying to sort of obfuscate and obscure what the real motives are in certain situations.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yeah, or in all situations, actually. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay, Councilwoman Black.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. I just wanted to say that I will be supporting this for three reasons.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'One.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's helping solve a drainage problem, too. It's cleaning up contaminated part of town. And three, it's creating an incredible 12 acre park, which is a huge amenity for the community. I've said it at every meeting. I regularly.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Like run ride my.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Bike on the Goldsmith Gulch trail, which is a drainage ditch that is I don't even know.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'How many.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Miles it is. It goes all the way to Douglas County through beautiful parks in my district.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The Harvard Gulch Trail, which is.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In Councilman Cashman's district, but close to my house. I use it regularly. Beautiful opportunity to create a recreation space when we're solving a drainage issue. Also, the Highline Canal, which is not a drainage ditch, it's a different kind of ditch, but it was for a water conveyance and was turned into a recreational trail.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I'm telling you, that 12 acre park is going to be a great thing for that community.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think you can say in black and white New Year.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Real quick. I guess I'm against this tonight because just the the situation, the way it was handled, you know, I got so little information today all at the last second, I had to find out what was going on.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And then all of a sudden tonight, we get so much different information. And I don't know how serious how the public thinks that what you've said tonight helps them understand the situation. I don't think it does. I don't think a 200 page RFP is going to tell our citizens anything about what's going to go up.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But those contaminated souls, I don't know what would seem is going to do to develop this this materials management plan that's going to help them. Is just seems to me is so different than the first ordinance that we did where, you know, I can understand that because city council will have another shot coming at it if something'",
        "'speaker_7': 'goes wrong here. We don't we approve this. And it's going to go ahead and and we'll hope for the best, especially when something is so sensitive. It's so much concern to our residents like this project compared to the the golf course project.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I mean, it's just it's like night and day to me and to be treated so insensitively like this and and it to me, it's just sort of rude to the public. I just I just sort of agree with my colleagues about process.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's just it's not that I don't believe in storm drainage. I've voted for storm drains all the way along for the last two years, you know, but this is different to what way this was handled. And it's just sort of arrogant.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I just I just can't stand that kind of attitude that our city would have with our citizens. So all of I said, enough, and thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'All right. Thank you, Councilman. I did want to say one other piece about green drainage that I'm excited that we're headed in that direction. And it's not just pipes that we're focusing on. In one of the city labs, they talked about drainage.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They talked about learning from the Dutch. And I feel like in certain ways, we have especially with this with this project here, the other piece I want to say is I've had cancer and I have two kids who live two blocks away from this, and I'm very supportive of this project.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Madam Secretary, roll call.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Black eye.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Clark Espinosa. No.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Flynn, i.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Herndon, i. Cashin. Can each new or. Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Susman.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I have three kids.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm tired.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I was going to ask you about that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'My wife just reminded me very hard.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Please close the.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Voting. Announce the results at almost midnight.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Eight days. Three days.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Eight, eight, three nays. 1395 has passed. Thank you, everyone, for spending time. We stand adjourned.'"
