Some of the issues that we heard in testimony earlier prior to this comment about environmental issues are are also issues that will have to be addressed as part of the clean up of the soils'",
        "'speaker_8': 'of the national western complex. And that was part of the $800 million that was approved by the taxpayers. That includes the build out of this complex. The opportunities that this presents for young people in our community is really important.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'As a couple of my colleagues have stated, you know, if if it weren't for this event, most inner city kids would never have the opportunity to actually pet some of these animals. And they have a small petting zoo as part of the stock show where you can go up to the top floor and actually have pictures taken'",
        "'speaker_8': 'with your kids, petting some of the various animals that are in that section. It's an opportunity for farmers and ranchers to be able to purchase some of the equipment that they need for their facilities, for their their ranches and farms, and for people like me that like to go look at the apparel, boots, skirts, shirts, jackets, you'",
        "'speaker_8': 'know, those kinds of things. It's an opportunity. And that's where part of that sales tax revenue comes back to the city of Denver. So for families who have not had a chance to get out there, I would encourage them to take their children.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We do have the opportunity where a number of kids get to go with their schools. The schools take tours not just from Denver, but from throughout the metro area. And so it's not unusual to see busses lined up with small kids, you know, going to enjoy this annual event.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So to the folks at National Western, thanks for your ongoing work and all of the additional work that's yet to be done that looks at building this out. That brings CSU to be one of the partners in this.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I know at some point in 2017, we'll be having a conversation on what that government structure is going to look like. So there's there's still additional conversations yet to be had about, you know, kind of what this is going to look like, not just physically, but how it will will function and interface with the city approval processes'",
        "'speaker_8': ', etc., etc.. I know that as contracts were being let out, compliance with our cities and BWB goals is another important element that I understand is being complied with as well. So lots of fun and exciting things happening with this overall complex and the things that are yet to come in the future.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'I would just like to say that that it's a wonderful occasion to have the stock show here in January. But I'm a little dumbfounded having always associated the stock show weather with below zero temperatures that we're not going to see the parade this year.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. Chair.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilman Flynn. When I when I was. Yeah, just as a tween in Wyoming, I just dreaded wearing snaps, shirts with snaps. But I do want to thank the stock show, because now in my elderly years, it's kind of fun.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So you guys give me that opportunity to own this fancy hat. And the other one I bought this summer and these duds and and it's in, in really just wanted to take this opportunity to say it's a wonderful thing and I'm glad it's been here for a long time and it will be here for a long time'",
        "'speaker_0': '. And I want everybody to know that it is a lot of fun and you will find something to do there. So, you know, if you find yourself with.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Any time in these next. 22 days or.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Whatever it is, get out there and just spend it there and you're going to have a good time. So thank you. Thank you. Councilman Espinosa. Councilman Lopez.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. Council President Brooks, I thank you for bringing this proclamation forward again and again. I love being able to see the stock show in town. But also it's one of those things that's almost like a Grateful Dead concert where you can actually smell it before it comes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right. Councilman Castro.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'He's never bought it. No, I used to take the tickets at McNichols and you can hear the you can almost smell the dead heads come in before they walked in the place. The same thing with the stock show the other day.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We were outside and my daughter, what's that smell up. Up on as a stock show. And that's how, you know, in Denver, the stock shows in town. And, you know, the good thing is that this year, the second year, we actually get to celebrate the passage of two C and our reinvestment in the stock showing not necessarily'",
        "'speaker_5': 'keep. It was always going to be in Denver. You know the 100 year lease kept it here. But you know for us as making sure we had the the facilities that that rightfully the stock show deserve. This is the Super Bowl of rodeos.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This is the Super Bowl of the stock shows and in the in the U.S. And it deserves that that infrastructure that that was starting to age. And the good thing is that we're keeping it's like an old Chevy.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We're keeping the good parts, the nice chrome or polishing, but we're just restoring and taking it to another level. I just want to remind folks that, you know, as as much as we, you know, in the campaign and in this effort, as much as we really, really concentrated on those those facilities and upgrading that stock show and'",
        "'speaker_5': 'modernizing it, let's remind ourselves that we also are restoring a mile of the Platte River and making a park space out of a connecting to the grid into Elyria in Swansea and Globeville. And it's infrastructure for the community and yes, jobs.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But it's also an opportunity if we're going to talk about agriculture, I think we should talk about making sure that that community has a grocery store. Finally, this is a neighborhood that has been dying for a grocery store.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's the one thing that we've always wanted to see happen. And this is the opportunity, if we really wanted to create that that that that tie to agriculture and teach folks, especially our children, that the food doesn't just magically appear at the store, that it's it's it's harvested.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There's a science behind it. There's it's grown, it's picked, there's labor, there's hands, hands like mine. My grandfathers grew up in all in love that picked these beets, right? That put these on the store shelves. And so there's that whole history there.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And that's our opportunity to teach it, but also our opportunity to actually fill in the blanks in some of these areas. And I think the stock show presents that opportunity, and I would love to be able to see that happen sometime soon.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And, you know, the stock show, it is it's our culture, it's our history. And it's nothing of the past. And it's much more than just just a style of dress. It's it's it's who we are in Colorado. And you know what, Councilman Clark, like, you grew up here, but.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In Westwood and in Barnum. We had chickens all the time, and they were delicious, man.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The goats are delicious. So.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah, it doesn't you know, it's not a a rare occurrence to hear roosters in the morning in the West Side or, you know, smell the delicious goat that used to be chewing on your grass at a barbecue not too long.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm talking about things that we don't permit. Anyway, having said that, I'm really I'm really proud to see the 111th in Denver again.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilman Lopez, I think County Councilman Cashman, you're up.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you for bringing this proclamation forward. It is really exciting to be on Denver City Council in 2017 and and have a role at helping to shape this bright, shiny ever becoming more and new city that we're building for the 21st century and beyond.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And where it's probably never been more important that we reach back to our roots that actually define us. There are other cities around the country and around the world that have these bright, shiny new buildings and new infrastructure.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But there's not another city in the country that has a celebration of Western culture as the National Western Stock Show. So it's it's institutions like the National Western that truly do that have separated us as a city since our our founding, and we'll continue to as we move forward.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I'm just proud that my name to this proclamation. Thanks, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hey, thank you. Councilman Cashman, Calhoun, Ortega. You back up?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yeah. Just very briefly, I just wanted to ask that when you invite general manager Paul Andrews to come up, if maybe Paul, you wouldn't mind giving us an idea of the size of the purses for the winning cowboys that will be competing in the rodeo.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Bull riding and bronc riding. Thanks. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Great. This concludes our comments. Madam Secretary, roll call.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Black.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Hi.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Clark. Hi, Espinosa. Flynn. Hi, Gilmore. Herndon. Hi. Cashman. I can eat by Lopez. All right. New Ortega?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sussman Hi. Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'G r.'",
        "'speaker_3': '12 ice.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'T 39.'",
        "'speaker_3': '1313.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I. Yeah, I got a I got a deal right here. I can see it is 13 eyes and proclamation, 11 passes. There is an individual I'd like to bring up. He got here just in the nick of time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We didn't think he was going to make it. He is the CEO of the National Western Stock Show and he has been an incredible partner. As we develop the National Western Center, please put your hands together for Mr. Paul Andrews.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You guys, you're too kind. Thank you. As a hand. So excuse me for being tardy with the cancelation of the parade. You know, I'm going to go down in history as one of two presidents that have canceled the parade.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I'll explain that to you all here in a moment. But thank you. Before I do, thank you so much for all your great comments. It's humbling to hear all of you speak about the nation of Western, an institution that started in 1906, founded on education and agriculture and celebrating our Western heritage.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You all take it very seriously. I can I can clearly see that. And we're very thankful to have all of you representing this fine city. And I also want to thank Mr. President here, who also is our representative in District nine.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We're very lucky, Elvis, to have you. In all seriousness, and look forward to working with you closely in the future as well. The smell that you smell when the stock show is in town actually is the smell of money.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And it's the smell of money because we are being visited by almost 600,000 people that are staying in our hotels, that are eating in our restaurants, that are showing their animals at our show. There will be almost all 50 states represented at the National Western Stock Show this year.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Last year we had 42 states. We're growing by leaps and bounds. The enthusiasm for the Super Bowl of livestock shows is here and it's here to stay. And Denver is the place that it's going to continue forever. And that's what we're excited about.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Rodeos we have, as you know, we start this weekend with our rodeos, three rodeos on opening day, Colorado versus the world champions of Colorado rodeos will face off against the world champions. It has become a spectacle to see.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In fact, the Cowboys at the NFR in Las Vegas this year were texting us as the competition was going to confirm that they were going to be here for Colorado versus the world. That is a huge testament to this state, huge testament to this city and the enthusiasm the Cowboys have.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So the question was asked by Council Woman Ortega, what is the rodeo purse? We will give out this year? Almost $700,000 in rodeo prize money. That will make us one of the top five rodeos in the world that will be performing this year.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And you really can't count the NFR in Vegas and they are occupying the top few spots. But if you took them out, we'd be in the top three spots. And that is something to be said. And I can assure you as we enter the phases of the National Western Center, we will be able to increase that pot'",
        "'speaker_0': ', making it even more lucrative for the Cowboys to come enjoy their 16 days in January right here with us. So enthusiasm is high and the parade usually is our kickoff. And boy, it became very, very crystal clear to me this morning from about 8 to 1030 in the morning with various representatives of Denver law enforcement, as well'",
        "'speaker_0': 'as meteorologists from all over this city. In consultation with me about the snow event that will occur Wednesday evening into Thursday, coupled with frigid low temperatures, it is just too risky to put animals out in that. Thus, it will cause potential injury both for the animal as well as any spectator.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If you can imagine a horse that has shoes on, walking on ice, potentially, if that horse goes down, we would have a cataclysmic event and me as president and CEO will not allow that to happen. So unfortunately, we're going to usher in stock show this Saturday with the start of Colorado versus the world 800.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Both spaces will be open and our trade show that was mentioned, we will have horse shows. We will have a ranch rodeo that day. And we will celebrate on Sunday, the Mexican rodeo extravaganza for two nights on Hispanic Heritage Day.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we will celebrate Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, three nights a PBR bull riding for those of you that just want to watch the Bulls. So again, thank you all for your tremendous support and thank all those voters that might be watching this that have continued to support the National Western Stock Show.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Every district in this city voted yes for to see. And that really is a testament to the leadership of all of you and the testament to the deep roots that the Nation of Western Stock Show has here in Denver, Colorado.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Yeah, thank you, Paul. And thanks for your leadership. Really appreciate it. I just thought that the National Western Stock Show will be alone because there's no Bronco playoffs. So I think you're going to get a lot more attention and probably some more dollars as well.'"

        "'speaker_6': 'years that have already concluded. The first time gifts will be reported under the new rules will be in the reports due in July of 2017 for officers and in January of 2018 for employees.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Great. Councilwoman, can you please put the bill on the floor?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes, I move that council bill 19 place be placed upon final consideration and do pass.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. It has been moved and seconded. Counsel, can each your motion to amend.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. I move that council bill 919 be amended in the following particulars on page one, delete lines 37 and 38, and on page two, delete lines one through five, striking in its entirety the definition of gift and remembering subsections as appropriate on page two Line 28.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'After the word required, ADD officers shall file their annual financial report for calendar year 2016, no later than January 31st, 2017. Under the reporting requirements in effect during 2016, beginning in 2018, comma on page two, line 35 after the word required.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Add the following beginning in 2018. Comma online to line I'm sorry on page two, lines 39 and 40. Delete the words in excess of $50 comma, either individually or in the aggregate period. And then on page two, line 40, delete the word only on page four, line 24, add the following before the first word.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Every employee shall file their annual gift report for gifts received in calendar year 2016, no later than January 31st, 2017. Under the reporting requirements in effect during 2016, beginning in 2018, comma on page four, lines 27 and 28.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Delete the words in excess of $50, either individually or in the aggregate.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. It has been moved. I'm looking for a second. All right. It has been moved. And second, it comments from members of council.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I'm going to take the simplest change first, which is just making sure that we aren't trying to re collect data that has already occurred in 2016 under new rules that we didn't know were coming or in effect, when you create a new rule, it's generally easiest to apply it going forward.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So that's what this the timing changes involve. The other change regarding the $50 threshold, this has been a really long conversation in committee for those who've been following the committee conversation. And I want to commend, first of all, Claire Johnson and her staff and the city attorney's office for really bringing this issue to the council and really'",
        "'speaker_6': 'causing us to have this conversation. We thought that it was most important to report to the public things that were coming from folks who may have an interest in the city. And so we did that narrowing. We also thought, oh, you know, we have these other, you know, types of categories.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so we had a discussion about raising the threshold to 50 to keep up with the cost of living having changed, not really realizing that with the new reporting, it's very difficult to talk about value in the aggregate when you have two reporting periods in the year.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So is it the aggregate within one six month period? Is it the aggregate within the two six month periods? Even though they cross different reports, it would be very difficult for the public to monitor whether or not we were keeping up now that we're going to do multiple reports each year.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So, you know, our city attorney made the point, you know, if you're going to limit the gifts that be accepted, it's impossible to monitor whether you're exceeding the limit or not if you are not reporting all of the gifts.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So that was the simple kind of logic behind just eliminating the $50 threshold. Many of us, you know, receive, you know, gifts of small value that we'd struggle to value anyway. We don't know the value of the flowers that show up or the, you know, the tickets to to the zoo lights that may show up.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so rather than, you know, trying to guess, is it below or above $25 or $50 in this case, you just report them all. So one of the things I wanted to clarify for both the public and my colleagues is that the amendments that I'm suggesting for tonight are really necessary for the bill in front of us'",
        "'speaker_6': '. And I think to make the law that is in place clearer. Should Councilman Flynn bring forward a bill later? We have drafted these amendments to be consistent with his bill, but they are necessary. Even if his bill doesn't come forward or doesn't pass, they really are for the bills before us.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But we did try to anticipate and make as much consistency as possible. With that, I'm happy to take questions, but I hope that my colleagues will approve these amendments tonight for a simpler, clearer, more transparent reporting process going forward.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Sussman. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You know, I've I have appreciated very much all the discussion we've had in committee, and it's very serendipitous and very fitting that we are doing this on this day. The City Council of Denver is strengthening its ethics rules, ethics rules and its transparency.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Right as some members of the U.S. Congress were trying to make their is less transparent and less strong. And so I couldn't think of a better night to bring one of, I think, several bills that Councilman Flynn has worked on and Councilwoman Kennish to bring it on this night to show that it's just another example of cities'",
        "'speaker_6': 'leading the way in many policy decisions and in many innovations. And I am very proud of what we are doing, although I know I argued a lot in committee about various detail things. I am very proud that we are strengthening our ethics rules and strengthening the transparency of those and appreciate the work that my colleagues have done'",
        "'speaker_6': 'on this. And I'll be voting for this tonight.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Sussman. Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I just wanted to amplify just briefly. Councilwoman finishes remarks. When the committee adopted the initial amendments to the clerk's disclosure bill, I think it inadvertently had created less transparency by raising the threshold to $50 and then also narrowing the field of people for whom we would report going to lunch, etc..'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If, you know, heaven forbid my church choir would ever give me a $50 gift certificate to a restaurant for my birthday, I would under the old rules, I would have to report that. But the public's not really interested in that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They're interested in the lobbyist lunch or the contractor lunch. And so I think the Councilwoman Canisius amendment rightly removes any threshold. The threshold is now zero. So that means every time. And every six months the public will get to see online our financial disclosures.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I think this amendment is a necessary step to to clean up some of the the some of the opaqueness that may have inadvertently been put into this bill in committee. So I urge every one of my colleagues to vote yes and support this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilman Flint. Councilman, can you back up?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes, thank you, Mr. President. My apologies for chiming in a second time. First, I just want to thank all the members of the committee, enormous amounts of time spent thinking about these topics. And secondly, before we vote to make sure folks understand that because this amendment does affect the title of the bill, it's going to require republishing'",
        "'speaker_6': 'afterwards. I just want to make sure folks knew that before we voted that that will be the result and we will then have this bill would be back for final reading next week. So I just wanted that to be on the record.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Amendment is on the floor. 919. Madam Secretary, roll call.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Can each.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Otherwise, this is your last chance to call it an item for a separate vote. Someone can each where you please put the resolutions for adoption and the bills for final consideration on final passage on the floor, please.'",
