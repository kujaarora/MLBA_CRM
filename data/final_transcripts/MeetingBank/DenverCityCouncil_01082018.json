To do that, they formed the Hispanic contractors of Colorado. I asked our board if they would just let me give space to the HCC to give off a space for as long as it took to get them'",

They didn't have membership lists, for example. Helga stepped in as founder there, never got a tax return filed for the Hispanic contract with Colorado.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'They didn't have a membership list. They didn't know organization. So they finally said, we're going to go out, hire a pro. And they hired Helga. She and I were office. 50 feet down the hall from each other for many, many years.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And. She was in that office. You talk about her being at every meeting, night and day, all by herself. No assistance, just alcohol. She pulled this organization kicking and screaming into the 20th century, then got them all current with federal tax laws and everything else.'",

I've heard all of you comment about how helpful she's been to the small minority business communities in the state of Colorado, basically, but primarily Denver.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I want to give you some perspective on who else she helped. You mentioned it. Our general contractors and the Associated General Contractors were the ones that were subject to compliance with the minority ordinance. And we couldn't have done it without Helga because we we don't know.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We put someone out for bid and however many build better 20, 30, 40. And when the ordinance was finalized, it required affirmative action, which required the big general contractors, the non minority contractors to meet certain goals, meet certain outreach efforts.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And because of Helga's organization, which had a membership list and everything, we had a ready made Kadri of.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hispanic contractors primarily. But Helga and I had several.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'African-American contractors as well, and many women contractors. So we had a Kadri in the general contracting community of firms we could go to to solicit is in order to comply with the then new ordinance and. To the extent that Helga organized this so well.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Our members, the general contractors suddenly had a source. To reach out to them, which would never have been possible. I hope that helped the national contractors as well, because now their compliance with the ordinance was made a lot easier and a lot more possible, and we owe it pretty much all to help them.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'Mr. President, I move the Council 1421 be placed on final consideration and do pass.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It has been moved and seconded. The public hearing for Council Bill 1421 is open. May we have the staff report?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, good evening, Mr. President. Members of the council. This is a I'm Andrew Webb from Community Planning and Development. And this is a request for a rezoning of a parcel at 14 2038 street from its current R.M. you 30 with waivers.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Former Chapter 59 zoning to see Annex eight. This request is in Council District nine. It's right at the kind of the northern edge of the Five Points neighborhood. This is a property of just under and under an acre.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's right near the intersection of Blake and Downing, directly across the street from the 38th and Blake RTD Station. The property is currently vacant with some building footings remaining. The surrounding zoning is a mix of of similar zoning to the request CMC's eight on some neighboring properties and then also I.A and IP zoning.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I should note that much of the IEA and IP zoning is proposed to change as part of the larger 38th and Blake Project base rezoning, which you'll be considering next month. The existing land use on the subject site is vacant.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Nearby is industrial uses to the north and to the south and then along walnut. Some shopfront type uses, including a brewery. And then from there, the industrial and commercial uses transition into residential as you get further to the south.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The purpose of this request is to to deal with a a challenge of sort of a zoning technicality. The project or the property is currently, as I mentioned, zoned with former Chapter 30 or 59 zoning. The request is to allow the relocation to the site of the tiny home village which currently exists on a on a property'",
        "'speaker_2': 'on Walnut, just over the alley from the subject site here. The tiny home village is operating under a six month temporary unlisted use permit, which is an allowance in the current zoning code. The 2010 zoning code for uses that were not had not been considered in the zoning code.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That particular allowance does not apply to former Chapter 59 zoning. So the request here is to rezone this property to a former Chapter 59 zoned district so that a new temporary use permit can be issued. This current temporary use permit expires later this month.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This property was actually originally part of the larger 38th and Blake Base rezoning. This proposed zoned district is the same zoned district that was proposed as part of that base rezoning. This aerial kind of gives you a feel for the the scale of development in the area, as you can see along along Walnut.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'More of a shopfront style of development. And then as you get further to the north and west, there are larger scale industrial uses. And you can see here the proximity to the rail station and also the the current site of the tiny home village.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The here are a couple of photographs of the subject site. One looking generally to the northwest and the other looking to the to the southwest. This is a development occurring directly across downing from the subject site. It's going to be an eight storey office development.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So this request is for CMC's eight. That's urban center neighborhood context mixed use with a maximum height of eight stories. This is a zone district that promotes dense, mixed use centers with moderate to high building heights, prioritizes a high quality pedestrian realm, and is appropriate for, you know, transit oriented development in compact, mixed use areas near rail'",
        "'speaker_2': 'stations, near transit stations. In terms of the process to date, this has had this particular project because of its connection to the 38th and Blake larger rezoning has had a role, an extraordinary amount of public outreach and multiple meetings and workshops.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We've done two rounds of mailings to property owners in the area to make people aware of what's planned for this area. I did have a planning board hearing on December six, and the planning board unanimously recommended approval of this rezoning.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There are quite a few registered neighborhood organizations that consider this property to be within their boundaries. All have been notified of this request. We haven't received any comments specific to this particular rezoning at this property, but we have received several written indications of support from R.A. as for the larger 38th and Blake rezoning proposal.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'As you're aware, to adopt a zone change, the council must find that the proposal does meet these five criteria from the Denver zoning code. There are several plans in this area that impact this property, including a comprehensive plan, of course, and blueprint the River North Plan Northeast Downtown Neighborhoods Plan, Elyria and Swansea, a neighborhood plan and the'",
        "'speaker_2': '38th and Blake stationary height amendments in terms of the comprehensive plan. This proposal does further many of the strategies and goals of the comprehensive plan to promote walkable, mixed use development near near transit that allow for people to live in places where they can have all of their needs met in one place with a minimal driving.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Blueprint calls this area out for a future land use of transit oriented development and does identify it as an area of change. The area is well-served by residential and mixed use arterials and transit services appropriate for a mixed use district.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The River North plan for proposed concept land use of transit oriented development. Mixed use at the site, as does the 38th and Blake Station area plan called the site out as a kind of a mixed use transit oriented development core for the 30th and Blake Station area.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The Northeast Downtown Neighborhoods Plan recommended future land use of transit oriented development at the site, and the Elyria and Swansea neighborhood plan also recommends a mixed use for this for this property. Then finally, the 318 and Blake Station area height amendments, which is the guiding document for the larger incentive and design overlay, is currently in progress.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I know many of you are familiar with recommended base heights of eight storeys at this height at the site with an incentive height of 16 stories. So this request is consistent with the recommendations of the height amendments adopted in 2016.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'GA To the other criteria, this request will further the public health, safety and welfare by implementing adopted plans for walkable development. In terms of justifying circumstances, CPD agrees with the property owners propose circumstance that the River North area in general has seen considerable new mixed use development and redevelopment, especially since the opening in 2016 of the Align'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Station. And finally, this request is consistent with the urban center neighborhood context, which is appropriate for dense mixed use centers and near transit stations. So with that, CPD does recommend approval based on the finding that these review criteria have been met, and I'd be happy to answer any questions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much. We have five people signed up to speak on this tonight. I'll ask all five if you could come sit in this front row so that we can get through everybody as quickly as possible. And first up, we have Marc Marshall.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The microphone is yours. Well.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Let's see something happen.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening, council members. I'm Mark Marshall. I work with Urban Land Conservancy. We are the owners of the 30th and Blake site. Initially when we purchased the site, we were looking at it fully as affordable housing. As the Hyde Amendment came through.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We started looking at different options to be able to take full advantage of the rezoning going from eight up to 16 storey. So this is the first step in the process to take us beyond the RMU 30 current zoning to CMCs eight.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We have two partners on the site. We parcel at the site out. One part is the site that the Tiny Homes Village is moving from 38th and Walnut. We partner with Medici Development Corporation to develop 65 units of affordable housing on that site.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'On the Blake Street side, we are partnering with Mcwhinney. Mcwhinney proposes to build 325 market rate apartments on this site. I like to thank the staff, Andrew and Abe, for expediting this process for us, getting the application process aligned, for us to be able to move quickly to allow Tiny Homes Village to meet their time schedule of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'being off the site in 180 days, which is the 12th of January. We've had overwhelming support for the Tiny Homes Village and we are very much in support of seeing it continue and moving and moving over to our Blake Street side as well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we appreciate your support and thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Next up, Lauren Dibble.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Oh, Laura. We're together.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Oh. All right. Amanda. Amanda? Lyle.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Hello. I'm Amanda Lyle and my beloved grandma. I live at the village and I'm with the Colorado Village Collaborative. I just wanted to say, first of all, thank y'all for I know this has gone through probably a little faster than most stuff like this usually does, and I appreciate that.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Just to speak on why it's important to us, the villagers, we we really love living in five points. We love where we live and we love our area. We know our community really well and we know our community members really well.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We love the whole neighborhood. We love the rhino. Jamie Lego has been awesome with us. We just we really love living there. And it's been, it's, it's, it's been really cool seeing how much the community likes having us there and how much they like to come visit us and do things for us and stuff.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And it's just it's really crucial to us that, that we get to stay there. It's it's hard enough having to be displaced again after already having been displaced many times. Most of us. But but being able to stay in our area is really, really awesome.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So I just really appreciate all yeah is on the phone. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Cole Chandler.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Good evening, counsel. My name is Cole Chandler and I'm also with the Colorado Village Collaborative and I'm also a resident of Council District nine. I'm one of many organizers on this project. And of course, the specific reason that I'm here is to advocate for this proposed rezoning ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'But the broader context which brings this issue to the floor tonight is the reality that we are in an affordable housing crisis. This is not news to you all, but this is the context that brings this ordinance before us.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'This is the context that makes this vote matter. This evening, in the midst of this crisis, people on the streets have worked diligently to find a new way to create safe, dignified housing, where they would not merely be able to survive the elements, but find themselves able to thrive in the shelter of community.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And so I have come to report to you all that this model has been exceptionally successful. So here are some facts and figures that I'd like to share with you about this model. The beloved Community Village features 11 tiny homes, one community space, one shared bathhouse and currently houses 16 residents.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'This village was built for a total cost of $250,000, which comes out to about $22,000 per unit. This compares to a traditional affordable housing unit, which costs nearly $285,000 to build thanks to in-kind contributions from a number of sources.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Our actual costs on this only came out to $140,000 and that was financed upfront. By raising money. We were able to pay for it upfront. The village was built in two months time, utilizing over 5000 hours of volunteer service compared to a traditional development project that might take two years to plan and construct and permit.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So that's some of the development side of things. In terms of operations, this village prioritizes those with fewer options in the shelter system, including couples, LGBTQ people, people with pets, people with jobs and people with disabilities. And 180 days of operation the village has provided nearly 2700 nights of safe, dignified housing to people who would otherwise be'",
        "'speaker_12': 'on the streets. In that time, there have been zero police calls to the village and zero people have returned to the streets. 80% of the residents are employed and one resident has transitioned with tears on her face and the permanent housing.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Every resident has connected with a resource navigator from Bayard Enterprises, who works with the villagers to establish sustainability and employment and housing. Even with all of those successful outcomes, the village has operated at the extremely low cost of $5.80 per person per night.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'In the midst of our affordable housing crisis, people on the streets have dreamed of, worked for, created and now for six months successfully operated a new and better model of housing that has been exceptionally successful. At present. The least sustainable aspect of our model is the mandate that these villages must move every 180 days.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'This move disturbs community, it disrupts the villagers progress, it creates trauma and wastes valuable time and resources. We need a long term home for this village and we need permanent zoning to do so. But in the meantime, we need to pass this ordinance so that the villagers can get back to doing what they do best, which is'",
        "'speaker_12': 'build a beloved community. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Last up, we have Chairman Scoop.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Good evening. My name is Chairman Sekou. I represent the Black Star Action Movement for Self-defense. Advocacy for poor working, poor homeless. And senior citizens. We stand enthusiastically in support of this ordinance. And we stand here for a couple of reasons and not to be redundant in terms of what it's already been shared about.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The Tiny Homes Village and some of the complications regarding their struggle against constantly being relocated. We see this as a step in the right direction. And so I want to applaud council for making these moves and making these ordinance changes so that there is less trauma to interrupt the process of success and also to enhance the process'",
        "'speaker_11': 'even further as we continue to employ poor people to solve the problem who live it every day and who are experts at making this thing work. Now, the track record is is already impeccable. So there's no conversation on that.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So that's what has to be done. And so my expectations this evening on this ordinance is to have a unanimous vote on this thing. Secondly, of all, there is something that has to be included that we need to consider as we continue to go forward with this process.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And that is public safety and police protection as you go 16 floors up. There has to be issues around parking and protection. That's a lot of people for that corner and that particular area. So we're talking about really packing folks in jacked 16 floors up.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That's serious. That's serious. And that's new for the city. That's new for the city. So there has to be constant oversight on this thing to make sure that all the aspects are done in a planned way so that we don't have a mess on top of a mess.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Now, the other issue that we have to deal with is resident parking 16 storeys up. Where are you going to put the cars? Now we all we've got traffic issue going on. And can you imagine all of these folks 16 floors up trying to come through that little viaduct and that little 38th Avenue Street trying to get'",
        "'speaker_11': 'home? Are you serious? There's some serious work that has to be done in terms of consideration of how do you make that move. Now, as this process is built so that we don't have the current traffic mess that we got going on, and with the new influx of more people coming in and the shortage of housing, we'",
        "'speaker_11': 'have to consider the traffic. This place, Colorado, starting to look like New York City, Jack. And to preserve the character of who we are. We are not New York. We are not L.A.. We plan and learn from the mistakes of other cities and move forward now planning what we build now, including all the aspects that we can'",
        "'speaker_11': 'consider. So there's a lot of work to be done. So this is a simple process and yet it has a lot of detail and complexity. So the community has to be engaged in all levels of this, and we demand a place where decisions and policies are being made as we organize this thing.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And community folks are not just a piece to be listened to, but we actually participate in the development of the policy because we're the ones who are going to have to live there. And so it's only fair. So as we go about empowering communities.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Which is a responsibility of each and every city council person is too much work for 13 people. Y'all need help for real. And we are willing and able to do that and do our service willingly. Cheerfully. And engage in a democratic process so that we are now practicing democracy in terms of what we preach.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So thank you very much for participating in that process. And then last but not least, oh, man, look, jobs, economic opportunities to build this. And then also poor people be empowered with the economic resources to actually move into the units in which they participated in developing policy and build and then occupy it.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So now we're talking about housing. That's not affordable housing that we can afford to pay for. And there's a big difference between affordable housing and you're talking about hundreds and thousands of dollars versus folks who don't have money to come with that.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And so we have to go 60%, whatever that little thing is. Doo doo doo doo doo doo, BMI, whatever that is on the income level. And make sure that happens. You had to explain that point to exactly what that means in terms of that ordinance or that requirement that allows poor people to come in below market and'",
        "'speaker_11': 'see as we can get as many below market houses that poor people can afford to occupy that. So we're moving on down the road to a permanent solution to this homelessness thing, to this homelessness thing. So congratulations, the city council people outstanding is very rare and is getting more to be accustomed that I'm getting real proud of'",
        "'speaker_11': 'you guys through because you're actually doing some stuff, man. That. I really, really love to see happen. Right. So congratulations and keep on working and I'll learn how to be like godmother. But take and push gently, you know, and diplomatically.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We keep this thing smooth and we keep you smiling. Everybody can have a great time because the name of this game is It Takes Teamwork.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I'm sorry your time is up. Thank you very much. All right. That concludes our speakers questions for members of Council Councilman Cashman.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Pro Tem Andrew. I'm just wondering, is there a discussion underway about a zoning that would allow for tiny homes to have a reasonable stay in the community?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, absolutely. You know, this this is sort of a stopgap measure at this point, but CPD and partner agencies and community members are in the early stages right now of a project to look at the zoning codes, regulations on group living in general.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And among the the hoped for outcomes of that project is a building forum, an appropriate zoned district for a development like a tiny home village.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I, I know that the, the tiny home element is been put together in that group home discussion. But have you gotten around to tiny homes yet?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We're actually just getting started with that project. So we're, you know, just in the process of getting consultants on board and kind of laying out the work program. So we haven't gotten quite that specific, but certainly are aware that that is one of the one of the emerging types of land uses that we need to consider as'",
        "'speaker_2': 'part of that project.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yeah. At a time where we're not allowing people to sleep outside and we have a project that successful at bringing people inside. I would hope we could accelerate that discussion. There's been a lot of talk about it for about a year now, and I would hope that there would be something brought forward in the near future.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman. Councilman Espinosa.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Question for Mr. Marshall. When did you when did you lc acquire the land that is being free zone?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Oh, we purchased it in 2011, 2011.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So in the seven years that you have owned it, was it occupied?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's not been occupied.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So the current proposed temporary use of would that have been a burden if it had been there for six years?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Not under the plans that we had just we got our tax credit. We submitted three tax that tax credit applications were awarded on the third. We have not had any type of activity on the site up until this point of getting the award of tax credits in this past June round.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you very much. Question for Mr. Chandler as well. You, sir. Have you ever asked CPD for a text amendment for to make this one exception, this one temporary use renewable.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Yes, we have. And we've been told that we would not have the ability to renew.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But with a simple text amendment, we could make a carve out. We could use essentially all the same language that we're creating this temporary use and say that this is one exception, that if we have a landowner because these tax credit projects, they go for round after round after round and they he life fellow the entire time'",
        "'speaker_6': 'that you could actually get in a situation where it's still temporary but it's prolonged temporary you know, with a simple text amendment. And so did they. Have they ever entertain them?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We asked if we would be able to reapply as we got into the process and started looking at New Land and we're told that there would not be able to be a reapplication or a renewal. One of the reasons was that these tiny homes were built to meet temporary building code, which and that's one of the areas'",
        "'speaker_12': 'where the 180 days came in. And so that was one of the answers that we were given in that regard. But I certainly agree with your line of questioning.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I'm glad. And to stay tuned because my next question is to CPD, what is the difference between six months on one site and six months on another site versus 12 months on one site?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I'd be more than happy to try to bring folks together for a larger discussion of this. But the currently because the tiny home village as a use or is not actually contemplated in the zoning code in any way.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The temporary nonrenewable unlisted use permit is something that does exist in the zoning code. So that was the one tool that was in the toolbox basically when when they came and asked for, for the permit. So it's essentially the only option that that CPD had to allow a use like this.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So thank you for that. You know, I didn't necessarily mean to put you on the spot, but just know that I'm going to follow up in my comments basically and ask that CPD recognize that, you know, you might be able I mean, I know we can legally and technically make this 1 to 1 exception to these nonrenewable'",
        "'speaker_6': 'temporary use and carve it out so long as the property owner, if it's acceptable for six months, we should be able to sort of renew that, you know, and sort of preserve, I mean, you know, activate the ground that would otherwise be inactive, you know, and I think that's sort of low hanging fruit.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I be looking for CPD's leadership on on that front. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman. Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Pro Tem. I appreciate this line of questioning that has come up because. We changed the code to do the things we want it to do when we want to do things. My question is for Mr. Marshall, if you wouldn't mind coming forward.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So in total, what you all will be seeing put on the property that's been resumed is 65 units of affordable. And that's where you just got your recent low income tax credits. Correct.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We are moving from the site. The Walnut and 38th site is where we will be developing 35 units of affordable housing on the site that we propose to move. The tiny home village on. The Blake and 38th site is a partnership with Mcwhinney and they propose to build 325 units by market rate.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. So the 65 units that you talked about that would be affordable? Yes. Those would be at 38th and Walnut, correct. Okay. Is that the total number of units that's going in there? So all of them will be affordable?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's correct. And will be 100% affordable.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And at what range of the area median income.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Of initially the tax credit allows for up to 60%. And what we're working with is the incentive, height, incentive. There is a pay in lieu of and what we would really like to do is work with the affordable and the market rate developer Mcwhinney to have their payment in lieu of go toward subsidizing the 65 units to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'allow us to get down to 30 and 40% ami levels.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. So to do the 65 is that reliant on McQueeney being able to build the full 325 other location?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I know we will be building the 65 units regardless with the tax credits. It's just a matter of that payment in lieu of would allow us to reach a lower level of affordability.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. And has there been a commitment made that the payment in lieu dollars would be earmarked for the 38th and walnut site?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We've been in conversations with both zoning and OSD about that arrangement, and McQueeney is very supportive of that as well.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So that didn't answer my question about whether OED has made a commitment to the in lieu payments that would be made to be earmarked to that because those have to be approved by. Oh, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We yeah. First we have to go through the entire process of the overlay and getting that approved before the, the commitment for commitment can be made.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. So stay tuned. Is the answer?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. I have no further questions at this point. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The councilwoman. Councilwoman Cannick.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you very much, Mr. Tem. I wanted to just follow up on a question that Councilman Espinosa asked, and I guess I wanted to ask it to Nate Lucero. I have the code sections up. I don't see the word nonrenewable in the code.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So can you just explain to me why the permit is nonrenewable? Because I just. I can't find that word.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. Councilman Nathan Lucero, Assistant City Attorney. The reason that the permit was limited to six months is there's a number of different reasons. One is the temporary nature of it. As Andrew explained, this use is not recognized in the Denver zoning code.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And there were discussions early on in the process about trying to make this work as a pilot project. But you're right, I don't recall myself seeing the word non nonrenewable in the zoning code. So to answer that piece the question.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But there's more to it. With respect to the temporary nature of the of the buildings themselves and the fact that the building department is only able or willing to issue building permits for temporary structures for up to six months or 180 days.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So there was a lot that went into the analysis and the reasoning why the zoning administrator was only able to issue this use determination for a period of six months.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. I'll reserve for comments. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman. Mr. Marshall. On the 38th and Blake side, you know where you belong, the 300 plus market rate units, are you going to be using that entire site? I mean, if the Tony Homes goes to that site there for six months, is that fit into the development of that entire site?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I mean, when you start your 300 unit development, is that going to take play time with a ton of homes have to be moved again.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That is the plan. Right now. It's projected that both the market rate of units and the affordable units will be breaking ground toward the latter part of the year fourth quarter 2018.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So you'd really need that space where the tiny homes is going to for the the market rate development.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is there a plan for the tiny homes to move somewhere else?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There would have to be. I know a couple can speak to that a little bit more. But at the time that we selected to go across to our Blake Street site there, there are a couple of more sites under consideration.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think there were a couple talk on that when he can talk a little bit more exactly on that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Great color. Color. There have been some other sites determined.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Yes. So we met with several landowners and three different landowners, gave us the opportunity to pursue moving to their site. All of them had a similar development timeline to the one which Mr. Marshall has mentioned. And so the villagers decided that rather than moving across town on a similar kind of timeline, they would prefer to stay in'",
        "'speaker_12': 'their neighborhood. That being said, it is our plan to move in July and it's our goal and intention over the next very short amount of time to find a piece of land that could be a long term home for this village.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And so we request the the assistance of this council in that process to find a piece of land that could be a long term home for this village so that we don't have to move every 180 days.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you, Councilman. Councilman Espinosa, something else?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah. One more question for Mr. Marshall. Do you know what the payment in lieu amount would be for the 335 unit project?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's in the range of 1.7 to 1.9 million.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And do you know how many units would satisfy their requirement?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The number that we're looking for in that 30 to 40% range would be a roughly 2022 units of 32 six or 30 to 40%. Amy.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'No, I meant mcwhinney for them to build their 335 units. How many would they.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Have if they had to build 10% of the units? Roughly. Roughly 18 units.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Great. Thank you. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And and can I just talk real quickly about the neighborhood? This is really important and critical development in this neighborhood, the tiny Homes Village, as well as the upcoming affordable units, the Five Points Coal Gas neighborhood. It's right at the intersection of three neighborhoods and part of this larger rhino district.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And there have been significant changes in that neighborhood over the last five years. And we've seen a lot of displacement happening in the neighborhood. And we would like to see as much as affordability remain, we're we're adding some units and we're looking at other development opportunities to do the same on other properties.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I don't know if there is a land, it'd be great to be able to have tiny homes village remain in this neighborhood. There's been a lot of support and a lot of favorable comments made about the the community and how much it adds to the richness of this particular neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we would really support see in the neighborhood, the village, stay in this neighborhood, or very much in support of finding a permanent home for them after they leave the 38th and Blake site.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilman Espinosa, are you all done with your questions? Yes, thank you, Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I have one last question for Mr. Marshall. Did the city assist Urban Land Conservancy at all with any dollars towards the acquisition of this site, either the 38 mile or 30th and Blake site?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There was some city money that was that assisted us on the initial payment and we also use the TOD Fund to purchase it. And we paid off the TOD loan in 2015, early 16.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So when you're purchasing properties, particularly with city assistance, is there an obligation to ensure affordability on the sites that you all are managing and then either reselling or assisting in the building of housing on those sites?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, there is a there is a requirement. And specifically, the city was involved through the TOD Fund, and there is a specific requirement of providing affordability through the TOD program, the total fund program. Okay. And we have met and exceeded those numbers for the number of units required.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And in 65 units, the max that could be built on the 38th and walnut site.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'On the 38th and walnut site is it's a it's a matter more of the development cost economics on it that limit us to five storeys and the building as the size as is the footprint now is that it's max size based on the construction type that would allow us to support the the affordable units we were really'",
        "'speaker_2': 'considering. How could we get a higher density early on before the Hyde Amendment came through? How could we reach a higher density? But just the economics that go to type one steel, concrete, construction. The cost to those that construction type would not allow us with the rents that we're receiving through the tax credits to support that construction'",
        "'speaker_2': 'type.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Seeing no other questions. The public hearing for Council Bill 1421 is now closed. Comments by members of Council Councilwoman Cannick.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you, Mr. Pro Tem. I do want to first state that the staff report and the presentation seem very clear that the criteria are met and that all of the appropriate pieces of our zoning code really do point to this as the right zoning for this site in the long term, regardless of any current or temporary uses'",
        "'speaker_10': '. So I'm satisfied and I'll be voting for this zoning tonight, but because I think we are having a little bit of a conversation about this temporary use as the impetus. So I guess I first just want to say thank you to you all for being willing to put the land forward for this use.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And thank you to the staff and all those who worked on the application to make this happen. I am a little bit concerned because Councilwoman Ortega and I are going to be the council representatives on the the working group for, you know, a whole bunch of zone zoning code categories that are involving group living.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So shelters are in their group homes, correctional facilities, things like that. And it's, you know, it's going to take some time. It's a pretty big project. And, you know, there's a dance about do you bring each little piece forward or do you bring forward a whole package?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And so there's no way in the timeline I've seen this will come back before the next six months expires. So I actually do think the city does have to deal with the question of renew ability. Now, we can't just kick the can down the road and say that process is going to bring an answer because it's not'",
        "'speaker_10': 'going to bring it before another six month expiration. So and I guess I as I read the zoning code, I just want to read the the phrase that I think jumps out at me here, which is that the zoning administrator may allow and impose limitations on unlisted temporary uses.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It doesn't say must impose limitations. And so I guess I hear the analysis, but the building code doesn't fly with me because the buildings are moving across the street. So the buildings aren't going out of use in six months.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And also, if making the structures more permanent was something you wanted, I imagine they would be willing to do that if they knew the building could stay. So, too. You know, it's kind of to say the building code is what's causing the zoning to have to be unreviewable.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'To me, I'm not sure I'm there and understanding that legal analysis. And so I think that those are good justifications for a policy decision the city made to say that you weren't going to renew. This was also, frankly, unproven.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We didn't know how smoothly it would go. And, you know, so I would really ask and I you know, I don't serve on duty, but it seems to me that Rudy should ask for a fuller discussion of the city revisiting this question of renew ability.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Nothing in the code is dictating it. There may be some analysis that it was a good, prudent way to go forward, but to say that it has to be nonrenewable, I guess I don't see that yet. And so so I think that we I think the city does need to have that conversation because we aren't going to'",
        "'speaker_10': 'get a replacement zoning code amendment, you know, through a community process and then through a council process. And so anyway, so, so I think there's some work to do. But again, the criteria are met here. This is a very straightforward zoning decision and so I'll be supporting it.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Councilman Espinosa.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I just wanted to second those thoughts. You know, the maybe maybe it falls down to make sure there's a private party agreement between the the tiny home community that's temporarily occupying versus with a property owner and the zoning inspector essentially putting a condition on there that there's a six month structural integrity check to make sure that'",
        "'speaker_6': 'the building hasn't been altered in a way that represents a sort of potential threat, a danger to the occupant. But, you know, these things are very well-built, sound structures. I think they'll pass every single time. And so long as there's cooperation between the people living there and the property owner, I think I think we have all the'",
        "'speaker_6': 'conditions we need to sort of allow that use to sort of persist in its prolonged temporary state. It's not what you're getting at, but I think that's part of a much longer, more robust discussion that the city is already prepared to undertake.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So but I do think I look forward to supporting some sort of temporary some text amendment or not. It's a matter of policy. Like like the councilwoman said, you know, I only I'm ready to welcome that. So. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'With that. So you don't see any any issues at all with the recommended zoning that's before us tonight. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman. Councilman Cashman.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, President Pro tem. I will second the appropriateness of the zoning that's being requested. Look forward to approving that. Earlier this year, a number of us went out to to Portland to talk to the people out in Portland about how they go about solving their problems.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And the first morning session was a discussion of homelessness with Mayor Hancock and Mayor Ted Wheeler of Portland. And the first Mayor Wheeler spoke first, and the first words out of his mouth have stuck with me ever since.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And he started his comments by saying, we have a humanitarian crisis on our streets. And I don't think I'd ever heard it put so simply and so directly what homelessness means to a community. And those same words obviously can apply to Denver and any other city around the country.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We have a humanitarian crisis on our streets, housing 16, 18 people. I'm sorry, I forget the number doesn't solve that, but it is an important step and another option in solving that crisis. And I'm not feeling any urgency from the administration.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Zero urgency. And I don't think that's appropriate. A year later to be hearing we haven't gotten started on that yet is not good enough. So I would ask the administration to please move this a little bit closer to the front burner so we can have some sort of an answer to this conundrum before these folks get ready'",
        "'speaker_8': 'to move again. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman. Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you, Mr. Putin. Mr.. So when we have city money in any of our properties or projects, that's the hook that gives us the the right to ask for greater affordability. That's why I asked my question about whether or not there was city money in the original acquisition of either of these two properties.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I'm not sure we needed to wait for this zoning change to happen to be able to ask for more affordability on the tiny home issue as long as we keep talking about temporary. We're going to keep talking about continuing to see this move.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I would love to see us find some land where we can see some permanency to the existence of the tiny home village. So that I mean, it's already been proven that it works. There haven't been problems at the site.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We've got responsible people living there who are working and committed to being, you know, responsible neighbors. And I'd hate to see this continue to be moved all around the city because there's development proposed on every site that they're moved to.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You know, you travel all around the world and you see tiny home villages in different communities. And there is no reason why Denver, Colorado, couldn't have a tiny home community that is permanent, like other communities across the country have done so.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I share the concern that, Councilwoman, you mentioned about the fact that the committee that she and I will serve on are probably not going to have recommendations for all the different sections of the group home ordinance for probably close to a year.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That is way too long to deal with this next round of when the tiny home village would have to be relocated again. So I agree with the the sort of urgency to look at some. I think the renew ability is a good short term solution to addressing that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But I would like to see a long term commitment to us being able to have a permanent tiny home village in the city and not necessarily limit it to just one because this is creating truly affordable housing where people today cannot afford to live in.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You know, and I've said this before, it's so ironic that we have never seen more housing development happen in this city at the same time all over the place. Very, very limited of those units are actually affordable. So the fact that we've got units that can be built at a truly affordable rate and provide quality living, you'",
        "'speaker_9': 'know, with some of the amenities is is pretty awesome. And so I'd like to see us do more of that. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman Lopez.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And thank you, Mr. President. I. You know, I. I don't want to repeat everything that my colleagues have said. I think this is a good temporary fix for right now. But I all I just want to underscore the fact that, you know, it's it's January.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's it's it's not typically this warm. It's usually very cold. And this winter is a cold one. And there are human beings that are out in the cold. And although I'm I'm a fan of the tiny home village, I have seen it and seen other examples of it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I agree with my colleague, Councilor Taylor. We can't just be in the village everywhere as soon as development pops up. I think this is one of the many different parts of the solution to to end homelessness. A human being deserves a home, plain and simple.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Right. And in this. And this thriving economy that we have, we've see in development pop up everywhere in cranes all over Denver. It's sad to think that that we just don't have enough units and that we're not building enough units.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And, you know, next, I think. I just keep thinking in my head, you know, there are cities that are whose sidewalks are lined with tents and they're lined with just cars. And the fact that you have some of these tiny home villages where, you know, folks have a little bit of privacy, you get ready for work, they'",
        "'speaker_3': 'can sleep under under a roof. It's better than a tent, but it's it's only second to a real unit. And so until we until we have those units and until we make a real good progress made great progress in having those units, this is what I would rather see happen.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In the interim instead of folks on sidewalks instead of folks in crowded shelters. Right. This is one of those solutions. You all did a tremendous job in bringing this forward and saying, hey, let's give this a shot. I don't want to see this move everywhere.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Every time we see that, we have some kind of development. And I think this is a good temporary fix. But I think we've it's proven to be something that absolutely is a working tool. For human beings. So. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_11': 'Is atomistic self determination. And we're ready to go. On any given.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Your time is up. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. All right. That concludes our speakers. Are there any questions for members of council? Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Pro tem. I have a couple of questions. The first is for Andrew Johnson. Andrew When we are looking at the creation of special districts, do we at all look at them in the same way that, for example, Dora looks at TIFF?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Because this is this is using a city finance tool, if you will, to assist development in being able to offset the cost of their infrastructure. So do we look at them in a way of how we address issues like affordable housing?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And tell me how we do that.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Sure. And so metropolitan districts are a state authorized entity. And so once created the they come to the local municipality here is for city council to authorize their service plan. It is a financing tool and so it is a tool for financing infrastructure, public infrastructure and maintaining said infrastructure in the public right away.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'It also is here to support additional services as set out by state statute within the the state statutes. And one of those is include additional security. It does not call out in specific affordable housing, though, if that was where you were trying to go with this line of questioning.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So under the creation by the state does not address affordability of housing in any way, shape or form, is what you're saying.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'That is a true statement.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. I would like to ask Dan Cohen, if you wouldn't mind coming to the microphone. So I was looking at one of the documents you have here, and it looks like the the phasing and the build out. And let me let me make sure I understand the geography.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So it's basically from Alameda to the I-25, right? It's actually Broadway to Santa Fe.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's actually starts closer to Center Avenue and then move South Side 25, bounded by Broadway on the east side and the RTD light rail on the west side. Okay. So it's it's really the southern half of about the southern half of the Denver Design District General Development Plan area.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. And when Andrew first started talking, he talked about the RTD bus barn. So does this also include the old RTD bus barn property?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It does not. It does not. And council took an action to basically allow one of these districts to move from the RTD bus barn site to the the area that they're currently covering, which is the southern portion of it.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So your full buildout looks like it goes to roughly 2040. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'At this point in time, that's our best estimation of of when the build out will occur. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I want to ask you a question, because you and I had a conversation quite some time ago encouraging you to look at a development called REO in Montgomery County, Maryland. I don't know if you remember this, but this is a development that is very unique, which is pretty much at the end of the red line.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Those of you who are familiar with Montgomery County, where, you know, a manmade lake was built and all the rest of the development kind of surrounds that. And it is a magnet for communities that live all around there.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'They go there on weekends for, you know, entertainment, meals, work out. There's a movie complex there. There's big box retail, tons of housing, some hotels. And I know you all have big visions for high density with this site, which is, as I've heard, the scale of lower downtown or Cherry Creek.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Roughly in terms of geographic area. Yes. Right.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I'm just curious, did you ever look at that?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, I did.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Have you ever been there?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I have not personally been there, but I did look at it and and, you know, looking at the Broadway station area plan and other small area plans that govern this area as well as the GDP, this is likely to be higher density in nature.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And specifically.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The uses within these districts are contemplated as primarily being commercial, being located at at Broadway and 25.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yeah, I guess we have unique opportunities to do placemaking where we have large parcels of land within the city. You know, as we've known, we've been a landlocked city for a long time and few opportunities like this to be able to look at placemaking, that becomes a magnet not just for Denver but for the metropolitan area also'",
        "'speaker_9': '. And so I was just curious to know how how much you really explored that potential model?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, we have and we absolutely have a plethora of placemaking ideas that will be part of this development. The metro district will be involved in that as well. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you, Mr. Chair.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. See no other questions. The public hearing for Accountable 1449 is closed. Are there any comments by members of council? Councilman Espinosa.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I don't know if this is. I'm sorry. I don't know if this is where that line of questioning was going, but I've seen the presentation in and. And quite frankly, the 2040 build out is is a lot underwhelming.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And, you know, it's just recreation of city blocks. It's doing some things. And it's sort of not. It's to me, sort of one of the missed opportunities we did as long as Lake Right. Is we just took down in a big, huge hospital.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We created a street grid and started selling off the parcels to sort of generic developers to build blocks. And, you know, nothing wrong with the grid because it's a very effective tool for managing the city and warehousing people and jobs and things like that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But yeah, I this is coming this is coming from somebody who's just now concluding the Central Platte Valley vision plan and potential rezonings and placemaking and capturing, you know, you know, doing something, being thoughtful about what it is that we're sort of and what we're initiating when we're doing this is very much integrated in all of that'",
        "'speaker_6': 'conversation. And hopefully it carries on with a master developer. And that that is that is completely apparent as things move forward. And I'm saying all this because when I first got into office, I had the 2015 and 17 Denver Post property owner coming to me with something is, is, is, you know, something that I said essentially the'",
        "'speaker_6': 'same thing, which is, you know, you've been sitting on this property for a really long period of time and the best you can do is this. And and this is too valuable of, you know, in that case, their views of downtown and of the mountains and everything.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There's just too many assets there and too much potential to overlook. And I was glad that they actually took that to heart, came back with a complete revisioning of their proposal, reusing of the repurposing of the Denver Post site as opposed to actually tearing it down.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This site is not unlike that. I mean, there has been some visioning that has gone on south from the in the master development, I mean, planning of the area south of this this area. And they're cognizant that they have incredible mountain views to the west and incredible downtown views to the north.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And, you know, I hope that we don't just recognize that, you know, one era allowed us to do big box retail and wear and masses of parking. And that era has now gone. And now we're capitalizing on the next sort of movement in, you know, generic retail development.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And that's what I because that's what it looks like. And so Denver is a place that, you know, where all the great places are, are, are largely desired and being capitalized on, whether it's Northwest Denver or Cherry Creek.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And we're building new ones like Reno. And this is an area that, you know, has enough land area and and access and proximity to amenities and proximity to all the things that make Denver great, that it could actually build off of that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I hope that's part of it. That's obviously and just opining it because I can it's not going to affect the fact that, yes, this is the right tool for the job. But, you know, when I just have higher expectations as we move forward on these sorts of scale of projects, things.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman. I just want to clarify, I may have said I was closing the public hearing on 1449, which is next. I meant 1448 to clarify which one we're closing and moving on, I just want to thank all of you for all of your work on this with all the moving pieces and the former bus Barton'",
        "'speaker_1': 'site, this is an exciting piece of property that has already seen one era of redevelopment and is now looking towards the long term future. It's exciting to start seeing things happening sooner than anticipated because of the long term leases that are on the property.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I want to thank the city team for all the work in getting this put together. I'm excited about the opportunity for infrastructure and these metropolitan districts and I think Dan and your team, for all of your engagement with the community over multiple years and I'm sure more years to continue as this really exciting site starts to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'take shape and continue to take shape. Very happy to support this today and hope all of my colleagues will as well. So with that, Madam Secretary, please roll call.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Black. Hi, Espinosa. Hi. Gilmore I Herndon High.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Cashman High.'",

    "A bill for an ordinance approving three metropolitan district Service Plans: Broadway Park Metropolitan District No. 2, Broadway Park Metropolitan District No. 3 and Broadway Park Metropolitan District No. 4. Approves three metropolitan district service plans: Broadway Park Metropolitan District No. 2, Broadway Park Metropolitan District No. 3, and Broadway Park Metropolitan District No. 4 located west of Broadway and Center Avenue in Council District 7.  The Committee approved filing this bill at its meeting on 12-19-17.": [
        "'speaker_13': 'Approval of the service plans establishes the following There is sufficient and existing projected need for the Organizing for the Organization of Service in the area. The existing service in the area is adequate for present and projected needs. The district is capable of economically providing a sufficient service to the area within the proposed boundaries.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'The land and proposed development to be included does and will have the financial ability to discharge the proposed indebtedness on a reasonable basis. And the facility and service standards will be compatible with the facility and service standards of the city.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'City staff does recommend approval of the service plan. The applicant, their representatives and city staff are here tonight to answer any questions that you might have.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much. We have the same three speakers for this one as the last one. So we'll go through again Paul Williams.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Good evening. Paula Williams. I'm with the law firm of McGinty Becker. Our office represents the applicant in the formation of the three metropolitan districts. I'm here to answer any questions, if you have any otherwise. Thank you for your consideration.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much. Dan Cohen.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hello. Dan Cohen, president of the Metro Districts and representing the underlying land ownerships. Thank you. Here to answer any questions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And last up, Chairman Sekou.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Chairman say coup. Black Star Action Movement. Self-defense. Representing poor working. Poor senior citizens. Okay. So let's try one more time. My question was never answered. The diversity of the Metropolitan Board. Who's on it and does it represent a diverse neighborhood from which they're operating?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And under what circumstances are poor people going to be included in making sure they're in the back room, in the seat, making decisions along with this thing? We need to be in it. Demand in the spot. So there are voices are clearly heard during the process of policy and vision of what you're doing and how that's going'",
        "'speaker_11': 'to impact us. Being able to advocate for housing that we can afford and services that are within that area because poor people are not just in a specific area in this town. We're all over this town all over and strategically dispersed.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So that is very difficult for us to become organized. And yet on the other side, the flip side, because we're everywhere. We know everything that's going on. So it's just a question that's coming together and organizing that and needing a vehicle in an operational, structural way to do that, to be of service and not adversarial.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So as we go about this process. I'm looking for the diversity. I don't see it. Now. Maybe you got it and it's not here, but I don't see it. And as long as I've been down to city council, this thing, this has always been in the metropolitan districts.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We're not in the policymaking positions. By design. By design. So it's very easy to look the other way when we're talking about including subcontractors and minority, who's going to be there to enforce it, who's going to be the voice.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So we've got to get real authentic about this and transparent about this and just actually say what we're willing to do and start talking about it and do it or stop talking about it because you're more consistent because you're not doing it.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And that's authentic and that's transparent, and that's not much to ask. At all. Because that's why we're here to service everyone, every citizen in this city. It's not an easy task to do because old habits. And cultural traits and characters are not easily transformed overnight.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Especially when you're pursuing the evolutionary process. Well, we're a revolutionary organization. And yes, Paul, there's an urgency. Yeah. And not just in one level of government, but in all levels of government because we have lots of work to do and very little time to do it.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And so there has to be a futuristic vision for the city council in terms of how we're going to transfer all of this work over to the incoming city council people that are coming, because this project is going to go beyond a lot of people's time here.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And so as you had to reconstitute a new team to carry this forward, we have to make sure that that teamwork has the same chemistry, that the existing body who's going to be left with finishing this thing off in addition to transfer of power in a organized way that we don't have.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Because all of this is getting ready to be replaced and changed fundamentally, starting with the mayor's office, in addition to the six seats that are open now. So he got to start thinking about that. Especially you, because you're going to be stuck with this thing to the end and it's going to be completed during your term.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So because you're going to do it again, I know it. You got to. You can't quit, Pat. Now, not now, now, not zero. You got to do this one more time or so we can complete this thing to the end.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So we have total success, see? And that'll be your stamp and your legacy, why you was here. And I can look in your face in determination and see that you ready for it. So to not labor any further with this, those are the concerns.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Looking forward to working with each and every one of you in this matter and very excited about. Given a push toward this thing in a way that. Works for all of us. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. That concludes our speakers. Are there any questions from members of council? Councilman Espinosa.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'One quick question for you, Paula. There's the, you know, the huge art piece that is there at the Denver Design Center and it's called a district. Was there public dollars that went into the design center previously?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So the Denver Design Center is. That's not part of Broadway market.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It was not.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It is not. There's three existing metropolitan districts on the north side of the property that are the BNP metropolitan districts. Number one, two and three. Those districts. In connection with the city of Denver, put together a major regional drainage project.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And so those districts did receive some moneys from the city and county of Denver in order to effectuate that drainage property. The Denver design districts are actually not part of those right now.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So so they're sort of carved out of them right now.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Maybe.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There's the the Denver Design District is is just a moniker, a name. It's there's there's not technically a governing authority. It's it's a name that was created when the general development plan was brought forward. So there's there's a set of metropolitan districts on the northern end of that general development plan that have been in service for ten'",
        "'speaker_2': 'years now. And the new districts are being formed. They're going to cover that that are up for resolution right now, are going to cover the southern half of that general development plan.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Um. All right. Thank you. Yep.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilman. Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Dan, will you remind us? It's my recollection that it was in 2011 that city council had to approve an extension of the tiff to cover the cost of that storm drainage that came from West Wash Park through the Design Center property.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I think it goes under 25 and over to the river. It's my understanding that's all done. But do you remember what that amount was?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The the total project cost was about $21 million. The city contributed about $16 million and the Bbmp metro districts covered the rest.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. And do you remember how far that extended the tiff out to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah. Basically the bonds were were being close to paid off at the time. And so essentially, rather than extinguishing the tiff with the bonds being paid off, it was extended another six and a half years basically to the end of its 25 year life term.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And that can't do the math in my head. Right?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I believe it expired towards the end of 2017. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The end of.'",
        "'speaker_2': '2027, 2017, October 26. So the tiff has expired.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'All right. So that all that debt than has been paid off.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. All right. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman Ortega. And and Dan, if you at the microphone quickly, since our friend, Chairman, you did ask the first time and I apologize if I forgot to reiterate the question, could you just buzz through for us or you can kick to Andrew?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'However, I take it with these metropolitan districts, how are the boards formed? You guys are the only landowner in all of these districts, is that correct? And just buzz through the one minute version of the of the boards first.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Correct. The basically the the the metro district will be taxing the underlying property that is within its boundaries and we are the only landowner within those boundaries for now. So in order to control the amount of tax that is going to be levied on that property, state statute actually requires in order to to essentially be eligible to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'be on a board, you have to either be a resident within the district or a landowner within the district, as well as a resident of Colorado. Right now, I'm actually the only person that is eligible as a landowner within the the district and a resident of Colorado.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But eventually, there will probably be other landowners within the district or residents within the district that would have the ability to join the board as well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Great. Thank you very much. All right. Seeing no other comments, Madam Secretary, roll call.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Blackie Espinosa actually did have comments. But anyway, we that was still questioning.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I thought, oh, are we still in questions? I thought we'd move to comments. I'm sorry. It's getting late. I haven't even closed the thing. I'm sorry, Madam Secretary. I have to close the hearing first. So seeing no other questions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Public hearing for counsel Bill 1449 is closed. Comments by members of Council Councilman Espinosa. Did you have a comment?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah, I just wanted to to the chairman his comments. I didn't want it. I am not going to use this as an excuse, but I didn't want to go on and recognize that. That, you know, development in this area.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We have a whole host of other ordinances and policies and programs in place to sort of try to make inroads on affordable housing and homeless needs and things like that. And and the reason why they're all sort of structurally in place and we're doing quote unquote, the best we can is as these new developments come online, they're'",
        "'speaker_6': 'going to pay linkage fee and they're subject to a whole bunch of other expenses that hopefully feed into those other things that the city is trying to do to sort of address other social concerns and other needs of our citizens.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'As we all know over the last ten years, it's clear that, you know, the things that we're doing today still are painfully inadequate. That's not lost on me. And it's also one of these things that if I were in, you know, more of a bargaining position at the mayor's end or something like that, we might be asking'",
        "'speaker_6': 'more of these of these developers, because what's not lost on me is I have a I have a street in my district called River Drive. There's approximately 30 residences on that on that street. It's been that street. Most of them have been there, some of them dating back into the early 18 I mean, late 1800s.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The street and what's underneath it largely has not been changed. The infrastructure that serves those houses yet, they're paying right now $180,000 a year in taxes. They're not using $180,000 a year in taxes. So if we said, hey, that's $5.6 million that you're going to amass over the next 25 years, what would you like to do with'",
        "'speaker_6': 'that? And then we'll just self tax you guys and pay for it. I'm sure they'd be all sorts of ideas on and that's what we're doing. What we're doing metro districts right is we're, we're taking money that would otherwise go into the general fund and.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Oh, no, okay, wrong kind of district.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Metropolitan districts.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Come to us.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You have to come to the mike for an additional fee.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This is on top of the tax.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Yeah. So just to be clear, Andrew Johnston with the Department of Finance, when we create these special taxing districts, it's actually a tax in addition to the DPS mill levies in the city mill levies. So this would be a brand new tax in a specific general, a specific area.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So that's even better. I love that. That helps me. Right, which is then the city still is getting its portion, DPS is still getting its portion, city still getting this portion to to to share the workload that stable neighborhoods like I was talking about are already contributing to on an annual basis that's not forgone.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So what they're using they're doing is putting an additional burden on themselves to pay for that infrastructure. So that goes to that other point. The previous point, which is we're still doing what the best we can with what we've got.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We're still collecting it in this regard, just like everybody else in my block included. And trust me, I would love to, to, to, you know, we don't get our, you know, the $100,000 would more than pay for the paving of that road every year.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But we just we can't do that. We're not doing that. And that's where we're all in this in the collective good. The that's the good news. So I'm I'm glad once again to be reminded of the difference between this versus other buckets.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That way I don't get to rail on developers for for for taking they're only taking what they're adding on to their on to their vertical and or actually everybody that participates. And and so this is this is back to my previous comments.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This is the right mechanism to do this sort of development. I still wish there was more more sort of clearer vision about what we're doing. But with this sort of latitude, the developers and the horizontal and vertical developers will have a lot more say and we'll probably be more comprehensive and cohesive and what they do provide.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So that's me rambling. They did it again. But I just wanted to, you know, you heard and this council very, very much very is is is in tune with and has a place in their hearts to try and and lift all boats.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And, and we're very limited and in the portion of the budget that is still available after we pay everybody in the city. But we're trying things.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman Espinosa, and thanks for catching that. I had skipped completely over the comment section. I think you also make a great point. We have an area here that has big box stores and a sea of parking and a lot of public infrastructure that's being built on a private landowner choosing to tax themselves above and beyond'",
        "'speaker_1': 'what feeds the general fund and schools to help build that public infrastructure so that this can redevelop into transit oriented development. So I will say again. Thank you. I'm excited to support this. I hope my colleagues will, too.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And now, Madam Secretary, Roll Call.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Black Eye, Espinosa Gilmore, Herndon. I Cashman can eat Lopez. I knew Ortega. I Susman. Hi, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hi, Madam Secretary. Please close the voting. Announce the results.'"
