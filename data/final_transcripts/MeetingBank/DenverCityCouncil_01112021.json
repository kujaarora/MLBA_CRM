And that uncovered the story of the stall, how the stall family, which is a really fascinating story of two generations of Denver'",

This area, this family that you have brought all this praise and galore on, they were racist white supremacists. They didn't do anything to help so-called people of color in the city.'",

I don't know if you know, but I grew up the minute that was ten inches taxes and there was actually evidence of human remains or human activity as far back as 10,000 years.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So as far as, you know, American history, that's a long time. And and so growing up in a town, the oldest town in Texas, where there were a lot of recognition of history as well as, you know, obviously business people conducting business today.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It helped give me a respect for for for balancing both and with 1272 Columbine, I am I am really excited to support this historic designation. I want to thank CPD staff for all their research and and a great presentation.'",
