        "'speaker_0': 'Robin Ortega Make sure I did not miss any. I look up and down. Got them right. Madam Secretary, can we get the first one? 1097 Councilwoman Shepherd, what would you like for us to do with this?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes, I have some questions regarding this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Go right ahead.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. So just as a short way of a preamble, when we were contemplating the I'm talking about this body was contemplating the urban renewal area for this site. You know, there was some questions asked about the future of a sort of affordable housing on the site, knowing that tax increment financing would probably be used to help redevelop'",
        "'speaker_7': 'the site. And I remember that several of us up here asked about, you know, what type of mixed income affordable housing we might have. Recognizing that, of course, affordable housing is one is a significant crisis in the city and county of Denver.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Also realizing that public transit, both West Colfax Bus, which runs very frequently as well as the fairly recently created West Colfax quarter light rail runs there being an excellent opportunity to to create some affordable housing. And then we understood from that time that the developer, the master developer Ffg was looking toward and working towards acquiring a parcel'",
        "'speaker_7': 'and selling it to DHS. Following some conversation that we had in committee last week, I do understand that that conversation continues to move forward. Please bear with me. We have a lot happening on this parcel, which is why I'm bringing it up.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There's a lot of conversations happening specific to different pieces of this that have passed through council will be passing through council. So there's another bill that's coming through very soon that we did discuss last week regarding a zoning that would likely trigger our recently amended affordable housing ordinance, which is known as the Inclusionary Housing Ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'As the developer, as we understand it, will be building 224 for sale condo units. In committee I asked about what type, you know, how the IHS would be required or or satisfied. And we understood that the master developer had made an initial proposal to add requesting credit under the age for the DOJ product, Denver Housing Authority product'",
        "'speaker_7': ', which is planned, as we understand it, to be rental housing for low income seniors, 30% of area meeting of area median income. So we definitely had a lot of questions about where is the city's stance currently on this issue?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'What are those negotiations looking like and what is the timeline? So my question for the Office of Economic Development and I see Seneca homes back there is will this council have a clearer understanding of the affordable housing planned for this site before any future upcoming public hearings and final readings happen, both with regards to the urban renewal'",
        "'speaker_7': 'area and also the TIFF, and then of course, the potential rezoning of BLOCK One.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Great. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Seneca Homes with the Office of Economic Development.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have been in communication with AFGE. I think they have submitted essentially a framework proposal for.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'What they would expect to do to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Fulfill their affordable housing requirements. Over the last.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Week, we have been constructing our response and we will be meeting with them within the next couple of days, and I'll be able to give you more information after that meeting. Certainly we will keep council up to date and letting them know essentially what our stances and how our assistance is consistent.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'With.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'First the newly passed affordable housing plan and also the spirit of the IHS revision.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. Thank you. That's my question for now. I do have some comments, but I see that councilman probably has questions as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Katherine, can each go ahead?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah. Thank you very much, Councilwoman Sheppard, for pulling this out. And I guess minus more of a comment than a question, which is that I do believe that the developer in this case was very responsive to the comments.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think it was over a year ago, maybe, maybe even eight months ago that we created the initial urban redevelopment area. And many folks asked about this topic. And so I'm glad that the discussion is progressing. But I will acknowledge that hearing the proposal that was described in committee last week was concerning to me, because even though'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I really do believe in low income senior housing, and I believe that that proposal was very responsive to the questions we asked about the urban redevelopment area. This site has always really prioritized also families, you know, all the way back to Anthony's visioning plan, it was really commented that this was an area with a lot of families'",
        "'speaker_5': 'and a desire to keep families. And so I think that the inclusionary housing ordinance requirements are above and beyond this initial commitment that was made to look at the redevelopment area and and think about that project. And it's important to you can't necessarily trade off many of the condos in the plan that I have been briefed on'",
        "'speaker_5': 'our two bedroom units. And so if they all get converted to senior apartments that are one bedroom, we really won't be doing anything to address families and we'll be missing an opportunity. So I do think it's important for us to be weighing the whole site and the different types of public participation that are happening here.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We are creating an urban renewal area with a tiff tonight, so we are foregoing property and sales tax to fund some very important projects that we'll hear more about during the public hearing, which will be, I'm assuming, a few weeks from now.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But I think that the housing plan is very clear that we do need a mix of housing. And I think the inclusionary housing ordinance is very clear about the ways that we compare what we're getting and what we're losing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so I really do trust the department to have that discussion, and I'm glad to hear that it is happening. But it will be very important for me when I'm having final reading on this bill, as well as any others related to this site, to have a little bit more of a sense of where that's at.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I was a little concerned with what I heard in committee, and I hope that the conversation evolves in ways that really are thoughtful about that mix and what our plans say about them and what the opportunity on this site is.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilman, can you just Councilwoman Shephard, did you want to give another comment?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Sure. I'll say a couple more things. So the committee discussion last week was very vibrant around not only recognizing the need and creating affordable housing for those, you know, who really are very low income folks who are going to need who may never be able to buy a home and need, obviously good quality, decent housing to live'",
        "'speaker_7': 'in the 30% of AMI addresses that. But I would very much like to echo with councilman can each said I mean I talk to families in this neighborhood all the time and there is a growing concern that there isn't going to be affordable housing for low to moderate income families.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And that neighborhood, which has traditionally been available to people in that income bracket there. And it is quickly, quickly becoming no longer a possibility. So I want to underscore that, you know, I believe that the conversation needs to include, you know, the discussion around affordable for sale housing.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And one thing that I mentioned very specifically last week was that, I mean, lots of people would love to come to Northwest Denver and buy a single family home. You it's but it is exceedingly expensive to buy a single family home in northwest Denver.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The opportunity for perhaps an entry level condo or other attached housing with price points much lower than what it cost to buy a single family home would give families an opportunity to buy. In my district and as we all know, home ownership is one of the best ways that families create wealth for themselves by continually paying down'",
        "'speaker_7': 'their mortgage payments and hopefully appreciating or realizing the appreciation of some capital of their investment. And that it's one of the chief ways that they hand that wealth down to future generations. So it's an important tool in helping to break the, you know, continuous cycle of poverty.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And it's one way that we need to to look at how we address our affordable housing crisis in northwest Denver and in Denver particularly. So I'm supporting these bills moving forward tonight, but I just felt like we needed a little bit more discussion on the issue tonight.'"

        "'speaker_4': 'Well, given that DIA did receive the grants and we are putting in a substantial amount of money, we are going to also be a part of the conversation and make sure that that point of view is stressed in these conversations.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Will there be any follow up from this council on it? Maybe.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Absolutely. We do intend on keeping all of council updated on on this and if any questions come up in the meantime, we're always open for discussion.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. All right. I'll yield.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. I also have a few questions. So first of all, this is part of a contract that we approved previously, correct? That is doing with planning overall for the Aerotropolis, which includes a whole cast of different players, if you will, that are part of it, correct?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So so what are the deliverables that we've received so far for the 490? 8409 $401 that have been spent.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Actually, none of that has been that money hasn't been spent. There is a small portion of money that was spent, and that was for a previous on call, a contractor that we had. But out of that $500,000 that we did receive, 408, $498,401 has currently not been spent, and that is for the future.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so we're adding an extra $124,600.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That is why we to.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The contract and and is that with the the conglomerate of who all those different players are.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Know that that money that $125,000 comes from DIA. It was part of the our agreement for the matching grant.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So this is just.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Discussed just is money that someone.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That is that out of DIA operating dollars or is that part of the general fund money that would normally come to the city's general fund from taxes generated from the various concessions. And so non airport revenue I guess I should.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Say this is this is DIA is money comes from what comes from one of our funds and I think I believe it's fund 98 or 94, but it is not using any taxpayer money. It's not coming from the city's general fund.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'What is it, non airport revenue?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Non airline revenue you mean.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That's what I mean. I mean. So one of the things that I would like to see is the scope of work on this contract. So if you can get that to me, I would appreciate it because I like to thoroughly review that so that when you come back to committee and give us an update on what kind'",
        "'speaker_8': 'of progress has been made with this contract, we can at least be, you know, thoroughly familiar with it and ask some intelligent questions about where we're going with this. The on call contractor. What is the uncle contractor doing and how is that different from.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I mean, is that part of the multiple players that are involved with this planning.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The uncle contractor that we're going to get from Cedar?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes. They're so weird. So Sudan is going to be managing this contract. So this uncle contractor is going to be one of that's on call contractors that we're going to be using.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So so who's been managing this so far? Has it been seedat or is it somebody else that's been managing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It so far? It's been DIA. We were the ones who received the grants and now we're going to be working with S.A. to use them as their.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'New decision that's been made to shift the responsibility over to see Dot to manage this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Why?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Because we need a third. Because of the sensitivities of the issue. We want a neutral third party to manage this contract.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But it's managing the planning for the aerotropolis, not necessarily the transportation issue. Solely, correct?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Not the Aerotropolis planning the infrastructure and transportation mobility planning.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That's not what the bill title says. It's it's says.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Those plans are part of as a result of the growing aerotropolis. We also need to take infrastructure and transportation plans into consideration.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I get that. But what is in front of me says undertake the dia aerotropolis planning. And in my mind that's all of the planning for aerotropolis, not just transportation related issues. If it was solely transportation and it dealt with highways and some of the things that CDOT deals with, then I might be more comfortable with that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But the fact that CDOT does not normally do bigger picture planning around other things. Right. That's where I'm not comfortable with this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, that's where we we that's where we rely on the expertize of the consultants because they do have experience in those matters.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But you're saying that. See Dot will oversee all that work. And they. It sounds like, because we already have the team of people. I'm not clear what it is that this. On call contract or how that's different from the team of people that are already on board.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Is it the same? Is it different?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's the same people that are already on board.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You're just saying the management of this will be different now? It's no longer seed and it's no longer dia. It's not.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Correct. Okay. But we will be having input of our own as well, as long as these as well as these other jurisdictions. That's why it's so important to have set up, because there is different jurisdictions involved and they do have experience dealing with multiple jurisdictions simultaneously.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. I'm just not comfortable with that playing this major role because their primary function is transportation planning and and the work that has been done, as I recall, as it was brought forward to us originally for the work that's being done with their Acropolis is so much greater than just transportation.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm not comfortable voting in favor of this tonight. I think the work that's happening is important to to be done to help us figure out, you know, where are we in particularly in relationship to the conversations that we're having with our neighboring counties.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But in terms of just the oversight. I'm not comfortable with it. So I will be voting no against this tonight and just wanted to explain that. So thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilman Ortega. Councilman Robb.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah, Aaron, you actually confused me a little bit or that line of questioning. How is this planning different from the ch2 am hill planning that we approved some time ago because Denver has contracted with C or DIA excuse me has contracted with c, h2m Hill to do planning.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I did believe coming into this meeting that this was a transportation planning that would supplement that. But. You know, now, it was unclear in that line of questioning whether this is just transportation, how this plan sort of meshes with the to him Hill plan.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Absolutely. I do actually have a colleague with me from airport planning, so I am going to ask that he comes up. Hi I'm Brandon house with day planning. And I think the clearest distinction is that the term hill planning is focused solely on Airport City, meaning it's on a property, whereas this aerotropolis planning is going to be'",
        "'speaker_4': 'for the whole northeast metro quadrant and that will involve multiple jurisdictions. And that's the primary difference.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. That that helps. And then finally, without this quote match from DIA, what we're voting on tonight, do we still have the grant funding? Will the planning still go on? I mean, what we're voting on is this match.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'A requirement of receiving the grant was a 20% local match. And so this 125,000 is that local match. So that's one of the requirements of the grant. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Robert Kaplan.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mr. President. This is a new area of discussion for me. I didn't serve on this committee. So if it did get heard in committee, I did not. I did not know about it. So can I please follow up by clarifying who is the grant from?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Where was the source of the funds?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The Federal Highway Administration, FAA?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then I want to clarify, because everything.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm sorry, it's not the FAA. It's the Federal Highway.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Administration, FHA, Federal Highway Administration. Okay. Very important distinction. Thank you. So then can I clarify this? Is amending an existing agreement? So we already had a contract with Seedat?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'No, I don't. Oh, yes. But this is in order.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's amending a grant agreement with Seedat. So we already had some contract with Seedat.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Correct. But in order for this contract to take place, in order for us to receive the $500,000 the city needed to put in $125,000. So that's why we need council approval to have the 125,000 come into play.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So correct me if I'm wrong, but what I'm hearing is this bill is doing two things at once. One is it's putting in a necessary match amount that was required no matter what happened, correct? Correct. Secondly, it's making a change in a role for seedat from something that it was just something new.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Correct?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So what I'm trying to then trace back is if the role that you've described in, in answer to Councilwoman Ortega's questions is new, what was their role previously? Why did we have an agreement with Ciudad at all before.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The money was originally going to go through the Colorado Department of Transportation and now the money is coming through DIA.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. So we're also doing something else, it sounds like. Then we're changing how the money flows.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's part of it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think that what might be helpful is just, you know, I will I will start asking more questions. But I think what we need is a before and after of these contracts, what were the roles of all these parties before?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And what is changing? Because I am a little confused. If the grant was from the feds, why did we already have an agreement with the state? And I don't I don't think share the same concern that Councilwoman Ortega does about the state playing a role in facilitating things.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think that that can be helpful. So I'm not sure that I, I have that same philosophical concern, but I clearly don't understand the the before and after of what is changing. Since this is an amendment, I need to see the existing contract which I do not have.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I only have the amendment before me. So I'm missing some pieces. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right there. But what if was there anything that you wanted to add from. Go right ahead.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The four risk of confusing things even more. Let me just say that the word aerotropolis is very nebulous. It's my understanding that when you see the scope of services, the scope of work that Councilwoman Ortega talked about, you will see it is primarily about roads and transportation planning.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It's not about comprehensive land use planning. The thrust, that's why it originated with a grant from the Federal Highway Administration. CDOT is an appropriate partner because it's primarily about transportation planning in the region outside the boundaries of the EIA.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So again, we've got other planning contracts on site and so forth. There's probably a lot more to be done with our regional partners through the years as the whole thing takes shape. But but I just want to be clear about that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'If there's concern that this is a planning for all purposes in the so-called aerotropolis area, that is not exactly correct. It's about infrastructure, particularly transportation infrastructure. But again, it's fair to ask for the to actually see the scope of work and we can provide that right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Monteiro said she did not have any questions. Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It's a comment. Go ahead. So I just think the communication with us becomes really important to make sure that as these things move forward and I get we had a lot of bills that move forward on consent during the holidays.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But by not having had the opportunity to discuss this in committee and to see the details, it's hard to know what exactly we're being asked to vote for. So that's why I was not comfortable with this and had all those questions.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so I think as you guys continue to move things forward, and I've had this conversation with our staff director that really is asking the administration, when you bring bills to committees to committee and and especially when you're asking for information on consent, we need a lot more information because the the.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Descriptions that we get is not sufficient enough for us to be able to make an informed decision about all the things that we're being asked to vote for. And then if we do let something go forward, you know, and we ask questions down the road, we're told, oh, you guys, you guys voted for this, but yet we'",
        "'speaker_8': 'were never given all that information up front. So I think it's vitally important and especially as we're going to have six new people coming on in, you know, in in July, that there there is a lot more details provided to us that helps us make sure that we know exactly what we're voting for.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilman Ortega. Any other come. Oh, Catwoman Shepherd.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yeah. Thank you, Councilman Ortega, for bringing this discussion to our attention. You know, there was recently a discussion that I was party to, you know, about the potential forthcoming plan for her, you know, Airport City. We don't know yet what it is.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So and I have been asking for this information and I'm about to have. A briefing from a lead contractor about what the plan is. But it's a little bit cart before the horse to be talking about building the transportation infrastructure to service the plan that we don't even know what it is.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So this is part of planning. This is not to build new infrastructure.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But I mean, I it's I share Councilman Ortega's discomfort on this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Shepard. Any other comments or questions on 1132? It is on the floor. So seeing no other comments. Madam Secretary, roll call.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'We have five other ones, Catwoman. Oh, those were just from infrastructure and culture.'",
        "'speaker_8': '1502. Sorry. Oh four. 1418. And I believe that's it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There are those where you need to to from business development that you've read infrastructure and culture and safety and well-being. So the first two, 1089 and 1190.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Sorry, I missed that. Sorry. Okay. So 1489 and 14, 11, 19, all ordered published. Those are resolutions. Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Those were the resolutions. So adopted in a block. Got it moved in second to any. Oh.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You're good. Yeah, I think we want to clarify. It's 1089, not 89, and it's 1118, not 18. So let's just clarify the numbers.'",
        "'speaker_6': '1119, 1190.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, there was an 11.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There's a 1118.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Entertainment spread is an 18.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Got it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So the last one from safety and well-being was read as 18 instead of 11. 18. Just trying to clean up the motion for us.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We got Madam Secretary, are we good for that? All right. Any other comments? Thank you for that, Councilwoman. Can each scene? None. Madam Secretary.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'However, Councilman Ortega bills 1102 and 1104 are companion bills for two bills that are scheduled for public hearing. So do not call those out.

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilman Ortega has been moved and second in a public hearing for council bill. Um, no one is open. May we have the staff report?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Good evening, Mr. President, members of city council. We are here tonight to talk about a proposed amendment to the existing Walton Corridor Urban Redevelopment Plan to add the 2460 Welton Street Redevelopment Project. The Walton Corridor Urban Redevelopment Plan was approved by City Council in September of 2012.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'In doing so, council found the Walton Corridor Urban Redevelopment Plan to be in conformance with the Denver Comprehensive Plan 2000 and its applicable supplements. While the Urban Redevelopment Plan authorizes the use of tax increment financing, TIFF cannot be used until it is specifically approved for a project.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Therefore, the Denver Urban Renewal Authority is here this evening requesting City Council's consideration of an amendment to the well-known Corridor Urban Redevelopment Plan plan to add the 2460 Walton Street Project and create the 2460 Welton Street property tax increment area.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The Walton Corridor. Urban redevelopment area, as I mentioned, was established in 2012 to encourage redevelopment along the Welton Corridor. The urban redevelopment area is comprised of approximately 29 blocks, generally and approximately bounded by Broadway Street on the West Glenarm Place and 24th Avenue on the South Downing Street on the east and on the north by either California'",
        "'speaker_10': 'street or the alley between Welton and California streets. At the time, the Urban Redevelopment Plan was originally approved. No projects were identified. However, the plan allowed for future projects to request TIFF assistance and contemplated tax increment areas would be approved as projects were brought forward within the area.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'To date, one project has been approved. The Affordable Housing Development Project at 23 Welton. The project, being considered through an amendment to the Urban Redevelopment Plan this evening is the redevelopment of the site located at 2460 Welton Street.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The project site is located at the southern corner of Welton Street and 25th Street. The project is comprised of three discrete buildings, built a above below grade structured parking. A five story stick on podium building at the corner of 25th and Welton will include 82 apartment units, 18 of which of which will be rent restricted to 80%'",
        "'speaker_10': 'of the area, median income or AMI and 3500 square feet of ground floor commercial space adjacent to the building facing Welton Street to the corner of 25th Avenue are nine townhomes, and additional five townhomes will be built facing the adjacent property to the southwest.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The project would include ten ground floor parking spaces and 84 below grade parking spaces. In addition to the 14 parking spaces each under each of the townhomes. The apartment units range in size from 550 553 square feet, four studios to 938 square feet for the two bedrooms.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The unit mix is noted on this slide here with which you can see that there are four studio units, if you will, with a zero separate bedroom and one bathroom, 53 one bedroom, one bath and seven two bedroom, two bath.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Those are the market rate units. On the affordable units, there are 17 one bedroom, one baths and one two bedroom, two bath unit. The Urban Redevelopment Plan authorizes dirt to finance projects within the urban redevelopment area by the use of tax increment financing.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The plan amendment will add the 2460 Welton Street Property Tax Increment area. Dura staff has reviewed the budgets and pro forma submitted by the developer and believes there is a financial gap in the project of $1,350,000. This financing gap would be addressed through the property tax increment generated by the redevelopment of the property.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The site is currently owned by the developer who is paying approximately $15,000 per year in property taxes. This amount will constitute the base taxes from which property tax increment will be calculated. The estimated taxable value following redevelopment is anticipated to generate approximately $130,000 per year in net property tax increment.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Again, these incremental property tax revenues will be used to reimburse the developer for eligible expenses of $1,350,000 over 25 years. As I noted previously, City Council found the Urban Redevelopment Plan to be in conformance with the Denver Plan 2000 and its applicable supplements.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Accordingly, any amendment to the Urban Redevelopment Plan must be in conformance with the Urban Redevelopment Plan objectives to maintain the continuing conformance with the comp plan 2000. The general objectives of the Walton Court or Urban Redevelopment Plan are to reduce or eliminate blighted conditions and to stimulate the continued growth and development of the area.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The proposed project meets the following objectives of the Walton Corridor Urban Redevelopment Plan to eliminate the present and growing factors which contribute to the blight in the urban redevelopment area. Such blighting factors are detrimental to the community and represent an economic liability to the city.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'To renew and improve the character and environment of the area and its surroundings by preventing or ameliorating economic, physical and environmental deterioration to encourage residential retail and commercial development and redevelopment that is socially and economically inclusive and from which the urban redevelopment area and its environs can draw economic strength to more effectively use underdeveloped land within the'",
        "'speaker_10': 'urban redevelopment area to encourage land use patterns within the urban redevelopment area and its environs, which will reduce dependance upon private automobiles for transportation, to encourage land use patterns within the area and its environs that result in a more environmentally sustainable city to encourage land use patterns within the area where pedestrians are safe and welcome to encourage'",
        "'speaker_10': 'the participation of existing property owners within the area in the redevelopment of their property. Encourage high and moderate density development where appropriate, including structured parking promoted to a diverse mix of dense housing options. Promote a diverse, sustainable neighborhood economy, including mixed use and commercial development opportunities along the urban redevelopment area.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'There are a number of findings that are required by Colorado Urban Renewal Law in requesting the plan amendment. The first of those is that the 2460 Welton Street Project is located within the 29 BLOCK Welton Corridor Urban Redevelopment Area, and it will promote the objectives set forth in the Welton Corridor Urban Redevelopment Plan that a feasible method'",
        "'speaker_10': 'exists for relocation of displaced individuals and families and business concerns. The project area contains no residences, therefore no individuals or families will be displaced. Additionally, due to the vacancy of the site, no business concerns will be displaced by the project.'",

Written notice was mailed first class mail to all known property owners, residents and owners of business concerns in the Welton Corridor, Urban Redevelopment Area on December'",
        "'speaker_10': '5th, 2014, which is at least 30 days prior to this public hearing. The statute requires that no more than 120 days have passed since the first public hearing before City Council on the Plan Amendment. Tonight is the first public hearing before Council on this Urban Redevelopment Plan Amendment.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The statute also requires that two years must elapse before council can consider an urban redevelopment plan amendment if they previously failed to approve an urban redevelopment plan amendment for this project. This is the first consideration by City Council of an Urban Redevelopment Plan amendment for this project.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Also, the plan amendment contains no property that was included in a previously submitted urban redevelopment plan amendment that was not approved by city council. As such, the requirement to wait at least 24 months since any prior public hearing is inapplicable.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Conformance with the Denver Comprehensive Plan.

In closing, jurors very pleased to be working with the city and county of Denver and the developer to bring this project forward.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The redevelopment of the site and the delivery of 96 housing units with the combination of for sale, for rent and affordable units near downtown and along an existing transit corridor captures many citywide goals, objectives and strategies that are found in the Denver Comprehensive Plan.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The Northeast Downtown Neighborhoods Plan and the Walton Corridor Urban Redevelopment Plan. The 2460 Walton Project advances many of the plan objectives which are intended to revitalize this important corridor. We asked for your favorable consideration of this amendment, and I will be happy to answer any questions when the time is appropriate.'",

I have been the executive director since 2011, which means I have been very much involved in what has been going on in the revitalization of the well two street corridor'",
        "'speaker_6': '. I worked closely with Tracy Huggins, Endura, to come up with the study to determine whether or not we had a blighted area and therefore qualified as an urban renewal area. One of the plans that Tracy did not talk about, because there was a study that was done in 2013 that specifically talked about what would it take for'",
        "'speaker_6': 'the revitalization of the Welton Street corridor? I quote, target 4 to 500 new residential units, including mixed income, rental and townhomes in non-core areas, and a prioritized commercial uses for a mixed use district. This is one of the very targeted goals that we have for the Welton Street corridor.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so we are very much in support of 2460 here today because this project exemplifies what we need, what we want, the vision for this community on the Welton Street corridor. I also would like to encourage that all of the members, please look at what this is happening here today, that we're far ahead of schedule.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We are really ahead of schedule because of what your efforts have been with regards to housing and revitalization in the city of Denver. And we are part of your plan, and so we therefore encourage you to approve this project today.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you so much for your time.'",

We stand categorically opposed to this project. It smacks of race and class discrimination. And as a further continuation of the gentrification of the five.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Fabulous. We talk about affordable housing units. I'm on Section eight today and with my voucher I can't afford to live in the neighborhood that I was born and raised in for 62 years. 62 years and now I can't live in the neighborhood I grew up in because the cost of the rent is beyond my budget.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And that just doesn't impact me. That impacts all folks in my neighborhood was born and raised there, and now we're scattered all over the city, living in Wheat Ridge, Littleton, Aurora, and a neighborhood that was 90% African-American is now down to less than 20%.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'These are the intended, quote unquote, consequences of your actions over a period of time over the last 15 years. Now. I don't know about you guys, but imagine if you were in my shoes and this was happening in your neighborhood and you were going around sites such as this where you have no black folks working there in'",
        "'speaker_11': 'the construction. No black folks internal in the upper management of this development company. And now we have a miniature version of South African. So who is this really for? As if we don't pay taxes. And then you use federal funds to do this with.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And then you're going to have a unanimous vote here tonight in support of the project. Because the horse is out the barn now. So we go through this dog and pony show. To make it look as if. There's some fairness and justice in this.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And then right around the corner, we got Martin Luther King's birthday. We're getting ready to celebrate. And I watch all the y'all sit there and participate in his legacy as he flip flops in his great. It's a shame.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'Catwoman Ortega I have one question for Tracy, if you wouldn't mind coming to the microphone. So as a city, we traditionally use the TIFF tool tax increment financing for commercial projects more so than residential. So can you give us some examples of other residential projects that we have used TIFF for?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Certainly we have a a rather, rather lengthy list, including the existing project that is along the Welton Corridor, the 2300 Welton, which is 100% affordable residential in downtown. We have a number of specific tax increment supported projects that include ground floor retail, but the upper floors, many of the historic buildings that were repurposed include affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So the Denver Dry Goods buildings, the buildings that are part of the Mercantile Square Project, Boston Lofts Guaranty Bank Building. So again, a number of projects downtown have had a mixture of residential as well as commercial projects such as City Park South was primarily residential, St Luke's primarily residential.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So it's not unusual for us to use tax increment financing to support residential projects.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I don't remember if I heard you say that this does include any commercial component. So this is consistent with what we've done. Yes. In other areas that has the ground floor with commercial in the housing.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Yes, there's about 3500 square feet of planned commercial space in this project.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. Thank you. I'd like to make a comment, but I'll wait till the comment period. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If I. Katzenberg seven questions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah. Thank you. Mr. President, we call upon the earth, the development crew, the developer here. And and, Paul, can you talk a little bit about the commercial, the retail aspect that you guys are thinking about for this site?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then, as most of you all know, this Five Points is a historical kind of community. And we really asked folks who are coming in and in a part of the development to to really reach back and think about us.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I want you to kind of talk about the naming of this this building in this development and and how that's a part of the history. Well, thank you, Mr.. Councilman Brooks, President and members of City Council. We're excited about the retail presence in this project.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then in addition to that, we are in the process of working on a few other projects in the neighborhood that we hope to provide even additional retail. And so I only mention that because we kind of look at this as.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Kind of we want to look at.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All the needs and services that would be attractive to the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And make sure that they all fit and they all.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Function properly. And so we're in the process right now.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Of moving forward with the retail space and kind of. And we've always made a promise to the citizens of the neighborhood that we really want this amenity to them, that we want this to serve them and be something of their interest.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We even plan to do.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'A process.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Where we can collect ideas and collect some of their thoughts and needs. So as of today, we don't have any specific tenant suggested, but we do foresee.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There to be you know, it could be one large retail space, but more than likely two.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Spaces. So we're excited for that. And then in regard to the naming, we.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Kind of found a gem that you don't always find when you're, you know, doing development. And we started looking into the.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Site and we we discovered that there.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Was formerly on.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This site, which is currently.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Dirt.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'A Phillis Wheatley YWCA on the site. And for those who don't know, Phillis Wheatley.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Was the first African-American female and she.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Was actually a slave and eventually emancipated and eventually emancipated.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And she wrote short writing poetry.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And she actually.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Was it took the court.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Because they thought there was no way that was possible for an African-American female at the time. And she was found innocent, obviously. And those of like George Washington have praised her poetry and such. And so we're really looking forward to really representing her.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And what she's.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'About with this project. And also, that's the namesake for the project.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank Catherine Brooks. Any questions for 1101? C nine public hearing is now closed on for comments. Councilman Brooks.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah, thank you, Mr. President. And, you know, I think for city council to two plus years ago, we were here going over this urban renewal area, attempting to try and get a new kind of vision for what the historic Five Points in Welton was to become.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And it's really exciting to see. This is the third project actually. You'll see two today and 23. Welton came by about four or five months ago, which was 225 affordable units. And I'm glad someone talked about Section eight housing vouchers because 2300 Welton, which would be the new development just breaking ground except Section eight vouchers.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we're really excited about this. And I think Tracy really underscored the important point. A mix of housing is what we're really looking for on Welton. You can't find the type of mix of housing anywhere in the city like you can in Welton, and 30% of all of our rental units, all of them are affordable in Section'",
        "'speaker_1': 'eight. And so this 80% am-I level, which many of you are trying to do your calculations at home, is between the 40 and $60,000 range a year, depending on the number of people you have in your household, is a missing component in this neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There are actually a ton of units available. Very low vacant vacancy, understandably, for the 30 to 60% am-I. But we need we need more. And that's been addressed. But, you know, the last development, major development on Welton was the Point Project in 2001.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that's where Coffee at the Point is right now. And to see 14 years later, we finally are getting a development off the ground is really exciting. And to know that it meets some of the needs of the neighborhood is really exciting.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Paul Bucks You don't need to do any outreach to the community. I can tell you what they want right now. And it's a fresh food grocer as a retail spot in your building. So they told me to tell you that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But you know, we're really excited about this development. The community engagement process on this was lengthy. This is within the historical landmark district. So this this this developer went through an entire process with both Curtis Park Five Points Community and San Rafael to make sure that this was the right type of building, the historic nature of it'",
        "'speaker_1': ', and making sure that it met the needs of many folks in the community. So we're really excited. This is just the beginning now. This is just the second project. You will see Tracy Huggins up here many more times because the market is here and now we have some cool redevelopment ideas in the future.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I hope that you all will be voting for this as this fits the guidelines of many of the plans laid out in front of city council in the city. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Brooks. Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I just wanted to express my support for this project as well. We have seen lots of different projects on the one street corridor coming forward, and we're seeing some transformation of that part of downtown.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And you know that the downtown Denver Partnership has been working to expand, you know, the what we've known as the Silver Triangle in that area of the city for quite some time. The need for affordable housing is important.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And although some might think that 80% is not low enough, as Councilman Brooks said, having a mix of income levels becomes really important. I know over a course of time we've seen some changes with some of the housing that existed in this area.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But the kind of changes that are occurring that bring some of the retail to the community is also important because I know in in this area, some of those services have not been available for for a long time.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so some of these projects are bringing those services to the community while at the same time, by creating the opportunity for Section eight units within some of these different buildings, it's still keeping many of the same people in the community and bringing in other people that will help support part of that retail that is being brought'",
        "'speaker_8': 'forward. So Tracy, to you and your board and the team of people who have worked with you both, Tracey's actually, I want to commend you both on your efforts. And obviously, Councilman Brooks, your leadership in working with the community is is important.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I'm happy to support this moving forward.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Ortega. Councilwoman, can each.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. Mr. President, my comments were very similar to Councilwoman Ortega's. To compare and contrast earlier, we had called out a bill for a large site with a single master developer and being able to kind of have a mix of affordability in an area where you have one person kind of doing some of the planning is one'",
        "'speaker_5': 'thing. But to try to have the mix of projects in an area like Welton where you have separate owners, really does rely on the leadership. And I just you know, that leadership Councilman Ortega named him. You know, it's Councilman Brooks.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's it's Tracy Huggins with Dora and Tracy with the Five Points Business District that you wouldn't think necessarily would have a mission to be looking out for this housing mix. But you have been at every affordable housing discussion that I've held and many others, making sure that the business district has a voice in that diversity of housing'",
        "'speaker_5': '. And so just kudos on that. And the one other thing I wanted to add for those who may be concerned about this level of affordability not being deep enough, the thing that's really important about the this level of affordability isn't so much necessarily that it's deeply affordable, but it's that the folks who live in are guaranteed against'",
        "'speaker_5': 'rent increases outside their income range. It's not impossible, perhaps, to find market rate units at some of these prices, but what will happen over time is prices will go up and those folks who are there will end up moving.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We've seen that, you know, time and time again where people have to move every six months or a year because of price increases. So the important thing and the thing that I appreciate is that even though this isn't the deepest level of affordability, it will be guaranteed.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So the people who live there can count on it. And that's really a valuable asset for our community, along with the kind of housing we built at 2300. Welcome. So thank you for the thoughtfulness that you all put in together in structuring this, and I'm happy to support it this evening.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Kathryn Brooks.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Nothing, you know, and I just got to throw some support into the Office of Economic Development is never get the credit. But they these guys invested in this project so that we could keep these affordable units affordable and so that we could make this project pencil out.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So thank you guys so much for your vision around the city, your device around the city. And it's it's it's very much appreciated. So obviously economic development. Paul Washington and crew. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Brooks. All right. Any comments on 1101? And then we'll be voting on this companion bill 1102 right after Madam Secretary.'",

        "'speaker_10': 'The statute also requires that two years must elapse before council can consider an urban redevelopment plan amendment if they previously failed to approve an urban redevelopment plan amendment for this project. This is the first consideration by City Council of an Urban Redevelopment Plan amendment for this project.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Also, the plan amendment contains no property that was included in a previously submitted urban redevelopment plan amendment that was not approved by the City Council. As such, the requirement to wait at least 24 months since any prior public hearing is inapplicable.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Conformance with the Denver Comprehensive Plan. On December 3rd, 2014, the Denver Planning Board unanimously found that the proposed amendment to the Welton Corridor Urban Redevelopment Plan conforms to the Denver Comprehensive Plan and applicable supplements. A letter to this effect has been submitted as part of the record of this hearing, and during request the Council find and concur'",
        "'speaker_10': 'with that finding. A planning board in the Welton Corridor, Urban Redevelopment Plan, as amended by the proposed amendment, will afford maximum opportunity consistent with the sound needs of Denver as a whole for the rehabilitation or redevelopment of the Welton Corridor.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Urban Redevelopment Area by Private Enterprise SMP 2801 Welton LLC, a subsidiary of Star Mesa Properties LLC, is the owner and a private development entity who intends to undertake the redevelopment project. This amendment to the Walton Corridor Urban Redevelopment Plan contains provisions for property tax increment financing.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Accordingly, Denver Public Schools District Number one has been permitted to participate in an advisory capacity with respect to the inclusion in the plan of the tax allocation provisions authorized by Section 31 does 25, DASH 107 and nine of the Colorado Urban Renewal Law.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Finally, the city and county of Denver can adequately finance and agreements are in place to finance any additional city and county of Denver infrastructure and services required to serve development within the 2801 Welton Street Urban Redevelopment Project area for the period during which the incremental property taxes are paid to the authority.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The plan allows for cooperative agreements between the city and Doura to address additional infrastructure requirements and city services should they arise. Again, we're very pleased to be working with the city. And with the Five Points Business District and with the developer in bringing this project forward.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The redevelopment of this site and the adaptive reuse of a 100 plus year old building into mixed use space, including restaurant and office space, is wholly consistent with the redevelopment vision of the Welton Street corridor, a corridor that has seen limited development activity in many years.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Its proximity to and presence along an existing transit corridor captures many city wide goals, objectives and strategies that are found in the comp plan. The Northeast Downtown Neighborhoods Plan and the Wilton Corridor Urban Redevelopment Plan. This project, particularly taken in connection with the two other residential projects along the corridor, begins to put together the pieces necessary for'",
        "'speaker_10': 'a vibrant community. We ask for your favorable consideration of this amendment, and I'll be happy to answer any questions you may have.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Ms.. Higgins. We have two speakers for this one. Traci Winchester You may come on up and begin your remarks, followed by Mr. Sekou.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. President, and members of the City Council. My name is Tracy Winchester. I reside at 217 South Jackson Street, but I am the executive director of the Five Points Business District. At 2444 Washington Street and had been the executive director since 2011.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'As I mentioned in the previous project that we did put together a revitalization study that was funded by HUD, and we had six urban planners that developed the strategy that came out in 2013, August of 2013. And one of the guiding principles in that plan was preserving our historic cultural district, that it is a valuable asset for'",
        "'speaker_6': 'the neighborhood, and that to keep history and culture visible within the district by balancing the preservation of the district culture with new development. I can't tell you how happy we are about this development. This beloved building resonates in this community.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I mean, really? BJ's Port authorizes hotel pub. I mean, it has had so many names and so many iterations over the years and the history is still alive and well and everyone is excited about this developer Stamas coming in and preserving this property.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'What is interesting, although it is in the cultural district, the historic cultural district, it is not a contributing building. As you know, a contributing building means it cannot be torn down. Well, even though they had the option, it was never even put out there for consideration.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Their whole intent was to preserve the history of this building. And so we couldn't be any happier than to have this developer come in and redevelop this building and bring it back to its life and the history that it has enjoyed over 100 years.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So without much ado, I just give full support and I encourage you all to please support this historic district, this historic building within our urban renewal district, because, again, it's part of the bigger vision, the wider vision to have new development, as well as preserving our history and our culture here on the Welty Street corridor.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you again.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Miss Winchester. It's your second.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'There was a song that was popular the 1980s called Another One Bites the Dust. Slowly but surely, the buildings are being preserved. And they're going to be nice and pretty interesting and the bricks are going to be blasted.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But now who now owns the building? I think the ownership has changed culturally from black to white, and then there's going to be a restaurant in there or proposed. Now, one of the criticisms of this plan that we had with this thing that everybody's up on board for was there was a overabundance of barbershops and beauty shops'",
        "'speaker_11': 'and under-development down here on the Five Points. And now we got an overlay of nothing but restaurants and bars come. There's no mix in economic development going down here. So you tell me where in the plant that's at.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And then we have these organizations in our neighborhood. And it's no criticism of Tracy because she don't live in a neighborhood. She lives in Cherry Creek making policy decisions for our neighborhood that she don't even live in or have any historical relationship to the building or the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So what outpost is she working for? Because most of these developers are coming from outside our neighborhood. So we're at the black economic development for the black community happening in the black community. Hmm. Thank you. Yeah, it's crying.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It makes me want to sneeze, too, because when it's all said and done. You have a phasing out of a culture and now you're getting ready to turn black folks into museum relics where this is the building they used to be in.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And this is a neighborhood that used to be kind of like Arapaho Forest, but this is where the Indians used to be. But then they're eaten and left. And there's something very dehumanizing about that. There's something very criminal about that.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I think there's a United Nations law against ethnic cleansing and gentrification. It's called genocide. Removing populations with pencil and pen and government audiences. And then folks go to jail for that. I think the guy in Yugoslavia went to jail for that.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'What he did to Croatia. But you're missing the prosecution because you haven't been brought on the carpet for the work that you're doing. And it's okay because you're going to vote unanimously for this, too.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mr. Speaker, your 3 minutes are up.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you. And thank you for you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you for your time. You. We do appreciate that as well. That is all the speakers. Time for questions of members of council. Councilman Brooks.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah. Just two questions. Tracy Huggins. You don't need to bring all that up there. I just I just I think I missed the year that this building was developed in 1895. Wow. Okay. Thank you. That's it. And then I'm going to invite, if you don't mind, Mr. President, Kelly Slater up here from Star Mesa.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I just have a couple questions for you on. Can you just give us an idea of, you know, the restaurant type? I mean, maybe you can't see everything. And then when do you guys plan to start redevelopment?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah. So I'm Kelly Slater from Star based Properties. Thank you for.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Being here today. So we're really excited.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'About a restaurant.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Going in maybe two ways. We haven't exactly picked out a restaurant tenant, but we think it would be perfect for a destination type.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Idea with the light rail being in there and.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's proximity to downtown, it's actually only a about a ten block walk from the central business district. So it could be a nice place for people to go after work. So we are exploring.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'A lot of options for different tenants.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right. And in the time that you guys are thinking about oh yes.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We are hoping to start construction in March or April.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay, great. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman. Councilman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Tracy Higgins, can you clarify if the tool of that Dora has the authority to use of eminent domain has been used at all in this in any of the in this particular project or the last one that we just talked about?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'No, it has not. In fact, we are not authorized under the urban redevelopment plan to use eminent domain. We would have to come back to council to get that. But it is not been used on any of the three projects that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We have brought.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Forward for council.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So any of the current ownership or previous ownership were willing sellers to who the existing developers may be on these projects?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Yes, they have all been brought to us as as that transaction has already occurred between the purchaser in the seller.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I just want to clarify that. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Ortega. And the questions on 11 03c non public hearing, 1103 is closed time for comments. Councilman Brooks.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. President. And actually, I want to thank Councilwoman Ortega for for bringing that up. This property was owned by Charlie Cousins. And since, you know, Charlie Cousins was a huge business owner in the area and has since passed and was owned by his daughter, Dr. Ren Cousins, and they own quite a bit of property on'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Walton. And you know, as someone who is has been down there for years, they actually want to see development get going and some of their properties, they thought that it would be advantageous for them to sell. So this was all kind of willing participants.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But again, this is the third project of our urban renewal area. And, you know, I keep I keep bringing this up. We we.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Passed.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The formation of the area in September 2012. Here we are in January 2015. And there are projects that are going through there. And and let me just let the public know and let let the folks up here know something that doesn't get advertised enough.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I think in the five points area we get criticized a lot for is the indigenous ownership. What is the percentage of indigenous ownership that's on Walton? Has anybody answered that question? Well, it's 55%. And I heard in a meeting the other day that it was 10% ownership in the area.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And it is pretty spectacular seeing that there is indigenous ownership for 50 years who are still redeveloping their properties, revisioning their properties because they're working with the five points, the business district with Tracy Winchester, who is going door to door, working with folks, making sure that they get every tool available to them by the city of Denver'",
        "'speaker_1': '. And so I just want to make that clear, but we're very excited for Kelly and her team coming in and giving us another use some more office space and something that doesn't get talked about a lot using tax increment financing dollars for the preservation of a building that they didn't need to preserve.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I can tell you right now, there are residents all over this area that if you to torn it down, there have been another 300 emails for me and, you know, all this other stuff. But thank you for having a very.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Vision for the area saying we want to have adaptive reuse. We would love to rethink kind of this building and this this whole area. So we look forward to to the restaurant. I know you say that there's some other space that potentially could be used for something else.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Have I ever mentioned this grocery store idea? On what? It could be amazing. Fresh produce. It's tough to get a salad on Welton. And so this could be a great opportunity. I'm just saying. But thank you so much for your investment and where we are.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We're excited about the future and council and folks in the public. You will not see every development come up front in front of council, but there 6 to 7 more redevelopment opportunities that we're really excited about coming up in the next eight months.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Traces, traces and I's favorite word is $200 million of redevelopment is coming on Welton in 2015, which is extraordinary and it's because of all of the partners. OED Urban Renewal, Denver Urban Renewal Authority, the city, everyone has just been great.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I want to thank my colleagues as well and I hope you'll support this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Brooks.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Councilwoman Robb.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I just wanted to add an exclamation point to the historic preservation side of this, to everyone involved from Duryea to Tracy Winchester to Councilman Brooks, and particularly the property owners. That vision for what the building is going to look like is pretty exciting and a real treasure.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman. Um, Councilwoman Chabot.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Oh, thank you. I just wanted to clarify with Councilman Brooks what he means by indigenous ownership. Usually when the word indigenous is used, I think of it as native peoples. So I just want to be clear that I understand what you mean when you say that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah. So indigenous to this street in this neighborhood would be African-Americans and Latino individuals who actually own the property in this neighborhood. So that's it's exciting, exciting news for us as we went in and actually went by from and we're talking about let me clarify this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We're talking from 23rd and Welton all the way to Downey. And so it's it's very exciting.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Any other comments on 11 03c None. Madam Secretary, Rocco Brooks.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I.'",

We're going to vote on the companion bill 1104. Councilman Ortega, could you please put 1104 to be placed on final consideration and do pass I.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Move that council bill 1104 series of 24 be adopted on final.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah you said 2004 I make sure it correct corrected 2014.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm sorry I didn't mean 2014.'",

All right, we are halfway there. We're now moving on to Council Bill 1071. Councilman Ortega, will you please put Council Bill 1071 on the floor?'",

        "'speaker_0': 'It has been moved in second and their council bills 1071 to 374 and 1080 approve zoning map amendments. This Council is required by law to conduct hearings on this, and Council's actions are subject to a court review in order to provide a record for the court review.'",

We will be doing a combined public hearing for 1071, 1072, 1073 and 1074, which is now open. Speakers may address in your speakers may address any or all of the council bills.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'At the conclusion of the public hearing, council will vote separately on each of them. May we have the staff report?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Mr. President, members of council David Gasper is with Community Planning and Development. Also with me today is Brandon House of DIA. If you have any idea specific questions, he can help answer those. We're here to have a rezoning for DIA own parcels in the piano transportation corridor.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'All four parcels are in Council District 11. Three of them are in the Gateway Green Valley Ranch neighborhood. One is in DIA neighborhood, a combined acreage of over 162 acres. Map here shows all four of them. We'll run through each one of these, but we'll start on the north with what we use.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Application number. Here's a to keep things clear. There's not clear addresses to some of these 65 and working our way down so 00065 is essentially at the 61st and patio station area between Pangea Boulevard and Tower Road on north of 56 and south of 64th.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So it's right there at the station for the future. East Rail Line opening up in 2016. Next, moving south is 00066, which is on the west side of Pangea between Grand Valley Ranch and 56. You see Parkfield there on the just to the west of this property.'",
        "'speaker_4': '67 actually straddles Pioneer Boulevard on both sides. It is south of Green Valley Ranch. And then 68, the further south is down by airport way and 40th, essentially the intersection of I-70 and Pinion Boulevard and. The request tonight in front of you is to rezone all four parcels.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They are all vacant and undeveloped. They're all owned by. The intent here is really to provide consistent zoning for all DA owned land in the transportation corridor. On top of that 00065. That's the one at 61st. And Panya would also carry forward the airport influence overlay zone on that parcel.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So the actual zoning or going to the DIA Zone District was created as part of the 2010 citywide rezoning, specifically for this purpose for DIA owned parcels and the influence area area overlay zone actually comes from the former.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Chapter 59 has been around for a while. The intent there was to limit uses a near DIA that could be been in conflict with airport activity, avoiding having residential too close essentially today, similar to how we had issues at Stapleton.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I'll quickly run through existing zoning, land use, building performance scale and most importantly, I think what the PENNER Boulevard Transportation Corridor means to these four parcels, mostly a mix of former Chapter 59 mixed use zoning. That's a CMU ten, 20 and 30.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And Alpha PD's out in this area. There is some new code mixed use zones, mainly towards the south in the 5 to 8 story range, again starting on the north side with the parcel at 61st and Panya. Again, it's vacant.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Closest development is actually across Tower Road to the east, over a half mile away with some townhomes and I believe a hotel 66 on the west side of Panya. Parkfield is the closest development. Again, vacant. 67. Again vacant.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Closest development is kind of the office, hotel and some apartments to the south west. And finally, 68, a same kind of complex of airport related uses to the West is the closest development. In building performance scale, low density, low scale suburban building forms, multifamily, some hotels and offices in the 3 to 5 story range.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And as I mentioned, probably of of importance here, the Pinion Boulevard transportation corridor and the scenic buffer. So if you look at this map, everything in the crosshatch is within the transportation corridor that was created when the idea was being planned for.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And intent was to maintain the transportation function of Panya to make sure that it was ability to get to the airport. The green border that is overlaid on top of that hashing there is this scenic buffer. So as a subset of the transportation corridor, within the scenic buffer, essentially the land is treated as open space and is'",
        "'speaker_4': 'developable. It's important to note, because the bottom three parcels you see there are within that scenic buffer. So no development will occur on those three parcels at all. The fourth one, the one at 64 some panya is in the transportation corridor but outside of the buffer.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So development can occur on that property. But that is where the overlay zone is applied and limits the type of residential uses that can occur at that site. So running through a process quickly planning board was in November.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We went through a subcommittee in early December and we're here with you tonight for the public hearing. I have the wrong date there. I apologize. Typical public outreach occurred with the Arnaud's and was notified properly. We did not receive any comments.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I will run through the review criteria, mainly focusing on consistency with adopted plans. Out here we have comprehensive plan 2000 Blueprint Denver, the Gateway Concept Plan from the early nineties as well as the most recent stationary plan and GDP for City First and Pana to consider for consistency with adopted plans.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Generally speaking, strong consistency with adopted plans here, especially with the mobility objective of air transportation. And then as with the 64 something as site land use mobility strategies that encourage TOD in walkable neighborhoods because it's in that scenic buffer blueprint, Denver did not actually attach a feature length designation to these bottom three or southernmost properties.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But with the 60 person panel one, we do have the more recent stationary plan that recommended transit oriented development and designated this as an area of change and specifically had a mix of land uses there between eight and 12 storeys in height for this property and that de zoning would allow that to occur.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The general development plan also called for a dense, walkable, mixed use community community at this site. So there's consistency with the GDP that was just finished mid 2014. So CPD does find consistency with adopted plans for these four rezonings.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There's also a unit for uniformity of basic regulations. We're actually creating a situation here where we have DI zoning consistently through the transportation corridor for property that's owned by DIA, furthers public health, safety and welfare. We're maintaining open space and creating opportunities for TOD.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Just trying. Circumstances are the same for the Southern three properties and since that there has been change or changing conditions, the previous zoning out predated the airport actually there and the de zone district wasn't created till 2010. They weren't brought over because they were pads or had waivers and conditions with the property.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think for some, Hannah, it's actually a mistake to fact the intention 2010 was to zone all down property to DIA, but the state went from OTU to O.C. so that was a mistake. My mistake to fact. Excuse me.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'With the consistency, with context and zone district. There is no neighborhood context as the airport, but there is clear district intent with the DIA zone district that is for DIA own property. So it's consistently under their purvey. And so with that, CPD recommends approval of all four and requests.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. We have two speakers for these bills. First one is Mr. Sake. Who? And then Josh Bieber.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yes. Chairman Sekou blacks are actually movement self-defense. You know, this is my most enjoyable moments when these kind of presentations are given, because I'll guarantee you the people that was watching this on TV don't have a clue about anything you just said not one word.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So I'm opposed to this thing for the lack of clarity for the listening public that's paying for this. And we are. So I would like for you to please. Any one of you, city council people, all of you come together and have a group huddle to please break this down as to what he's talking about so that'",
        "'speaker_11': 'we will know basically, right from what I gather, the only thing they want to do consistency with the zoning on it. And so they're going through a technical thing to get this thing done. But there's not going to really be nothing done there because they're doing some things with the airport and it's a no fly zone.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Is that what you told me? Somebody help me out.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Images of Mr. Josh Bieber.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening, counsel. I would like to speak on this so that.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Are there that it's kind of confusing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Why don't they just, like, put the cost into, like, hybrid fuel and electric planes and solar panels on the planes and stuff like that and using it and not.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Using high.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Costly gas and stuff like that. I, I agree with them that it's kind of confusing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so that was my.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Kind of question comment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That was the comment and a question.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And at the same time. Great. Could you say your name for the record?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Oh, sorry. My name is Joshua Bieber.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right. 1259 Avenue.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Albion Street.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Well, that concludes our speakers. Time for questions from members of council. So I'm not taken.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I'd like to have the map pulled back up. That shows us the northernmost boundary. I'm trying to pull that on here. And it's not giving me the the full scope of. All those shots. Some of the that one's good for right now.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So some of the work that we've seen related to the development. Right at that location. So how much of that was already reasoned? I mean, we see so many of these people that it's hard to understand, you know, the big picture of what we're dealing with.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So. Help me understand what you've got shaded in yellow on this one. How that's different from what we've already approved.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, in this location here, which is. So this map is from the 60 person and Panya stationary plan, which we adopted last January. Actually, it recommends a land use and building heights in that plan. But there has not been a rezoning since that time in this area.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So this is the only parcel of that whole plan that we're changing the zoning?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's correct, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Will we be seeing other parcels in that development come forward with different zone changes?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes. CPD does anticipate that the property owners that are in the station area plan area will come forward with rezonings here in the future.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So that's that's part of the confusion, is seeing them all piecemeal as opposed to the plan, looking at what the zoning is for the different parcels to help us understand, you know, sort of the scope and scale of what can can be with that site.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We would also anticipate that that would any other rezoning in this area would come all at once, essentially. So there's essentially three property owners outside of DIA that are within the station area, and they have been working together.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So to support a rezoning that would come together. All three property owners at the same time. So there's some sort of consistency.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So they're not pushing. They didn't all come together. Excuse me. Is there a reason all of them haven't come together as one?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That'd be up to the applicants there. It's, you know, they're property owners and they have just not moved forward with a rezoning at this time.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. I'd like to ask the DIA representative in question. So I think maybe this map might be good, but can you show me? And if it's not this map, maybe one of the others. If you could pull it up where the lda noise contour is on dere property.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yeah, probably now, but.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This might be the closest. Yeah. I don't have anything.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That might be good.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We don't have the contours of Brendan House, the Planning Office. We don't have the contours shown on this map. But within the entire 61st and the general development plan, stationary plan area, the contours are not within.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That area whatsoever.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They are to the north.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That's not what I remember us being told when the whole station area plan was brought forward. That part of the noise contour included part of the development. And we're trying to understand is if any of the residential and I'm understanding it's going to be rental, not for sale housing.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You can clarify that if I'm wrong about that. If if that if the housing is included within that area yet.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I believe it's since I was a project manager on the station area plan, I can kind of talk a little bit more about that. So Brandon is correct. The the noise contours do not lay go that far south, essentially.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So they're farther north. But the airport influence overlay zone, that air air overlay, which is kind of that pink there is actually what's regulating the land uses within that 60% panel to limit the type of residential development that can occur.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So that overlay zoning does not allow a single family north of 56 and does not allow multifamily north of 62nd. But that's outside of the noise contours that would be typically applied to the airport. These are actually further south that we're being.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I would like someone to provide me the actual LDA noise contour map so I can look at that and be able to determine that. Because I remember asking this question when we did the planning the area plan for this area.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I recall somebody saying that the the noise contour line had changed. And I don't know what justified that change. So I don't know if you can address that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Can explain it in a I'm not an expert on it, but a general overview. The noise contour lines year to year to year change slightly depending on the number of flights. But then there's also adopted noise contour lines.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The adopted noise contour lines are for maximum build out of the airport in future runways. So a future southern runway that has not been developed yet would be the closest runway to this area. But it's not expected that that runway will be for another 30 years, it's estimated.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But what is going to drive the other and I mean, the primary focus of the airport is to operate as an airport. And so are we saying that by allowing residential development that close to what would be, you know, one of our airfields, you know, it may be the last one.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It may be the next one. You know, I don't know what the schedule in the pecking order is of which one is going to go next. But, you know, I just don't want to see us put Denver in a situation where I very clearly remember Denver being sued by Park Hill, by Commerce City because of noise issues'",
        "'speaker_8': '. And they know some of the technology is changing on the planes and a lot of that kind of stuff. But there was a lot of careful consideration when this land was purchased and where those contour lines were were set.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so that's why I'm raising these questions.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Sure. And I'd be happy to provide that map to you. And the airport influence overlay is kind of an extra layer of protection in that area. And that's why it was adopted to provide the protection from single family houses being developed specifically and even multi-family at certain point.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So will this site. And I see it's the the red dot the further north actually have residential within it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's possible you could have multifamily residential in this site. No single family would be allowed.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But what's making the distinction between allowing single family and multifamily?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The multifamily building techniques have better sound insulation than the single family homes.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. Thank you for answering my questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman, to you. Any other questions for 1071? Seen on public hearing for 1071 is now closed time for comments as the representative for District 11 where these rezonings are moving forward. I was asked in my colleagues to to support these.'",

The request is to rezone to APD G 12, which I have a lot of letters and numbers there, but that means a planned unit development general and it is the 12th update to come forward and a general PD is basically a standard zoned district and in this case'",

        "'speaker_1': 'And that's the urban center neighborhood mixed use and about allowing up to 12 stories the deviations from C C 12 to acknowledge the South Platte River. There is not a street in between this property and the river. So we acknowledge that the river, by transitioning, allowed building height, increasing the transparency, altering the build to requirements, and requiring'",

        "'speaker_1': 'It is slated as open space. Some of the standards in the party and you can find the beauty in your packet is to transition the height from the reverse though, so the development will actually step down to the river.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Within the high transition zone, up to eight storeys is allowed and then on the remaining portions of the part of the property, 12 storeys would be allowed. Also the PWD calls out primary street zone lot Frontages. The zone districts are kind of built around the streets that the Zone district faces, so a future development has to address'",

This would actually calls out the river frontage as a street, and so future development will have to address the street with an entrance. The PD would not allow parking in between the building and the river.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Frontage would require a higher level of windows and transparency along the river's edge in addition to the dynaudio edge and would require active uses on those on those first floors facing these street frontages or river frontage.

        "'speaker_1': 'river frontage or the Denaro Street frontage. And if if you come that thick line drawn from future development touches one of these frontages, then that ground floor must be active. It cannot be a parking. So the surrounding site, there's IP on properties to the south and to the west of the site.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The river, South Platte River is just to the north, along with some city owned property. And then there's Army 30 with waivers and conditions and pads associated with the to narco GDP. The site is industrial.

This is these are a few images the top images of the site in the foreground with downtown in the background, there's an image of that new multi-family residential. And then the bottom image is looking north towards the river with the site just to the left of the image.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So why opposed zone district? The zoning code allows use of zoning in unique and extraordinary circumstances when standard zoning, at least without multiple variances, waivers or condition, won't result in the desired development pattern form use consistent with the adaptive plans.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And also when more zoning flexibility or customization is appropriate to get the desired development pattern form and use. So what are the unique and extraordinary circumstances? In this case? It is. The site is directly adjacent to the South Platte River.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There are very few sites in the city that do not have a street in between the site and the river. And therefore that is fairly unique and the river is a gem of the city and the powder does build in requirements to address the river.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Also there is some phased development and planned open space so associated with the group.

So height and build to alterations to transition between the river and future plant open space. And then again, there's no parking allowed between the river and future structures.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So this case went to a planning board on December 3rd committee on the 10th of December. We're here tonight. All our no's within 200 feet of the subject site were notified. Signs were posted for this public hearing in the public hearing for planning board.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There are six review criteria in the code associated with APD. The first is consistency with adopted plans. There are three plans that apply to the site. The first is complete in 2000. The plan recommends and promotes infill development, designing mixed use communities, calling for more amenities and a variety of compatible uses.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Because we're investing in the neighborhoods and creating and promoting those mixed use communities where folks can live, work and play. Blueprint. DMR recommends mixed use area of change and the goals include high intensity development with a sizable employment base as well as housing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The areas of change are called out as areas where a blueprint desires channeling growth and improving access to jobs, housing and services. Donato Street is a residential collector and Brayton Boulevard is a mixed use arterial and an enhanced transit corridor.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Identified in Blueprint Denver, the River North Area Plan adopted in 2003 recommends residential mixed use for this property. Donato Markets placement along the South Platte River in proximity to downtown provides an opportunity to create an exciting mixed use area with its own identity.'",

Donato Market offers the potential for a significant mixed use development with destination commercial uses anchored by housing and benefiting from its relationship to the river corridor and to downtown.'",

The beauty district is necessary because there is no zoned district available in the zoning code that requires grounds, ground reactivation, activation along planned open space or the South Platte River.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It only applies to existing streets. The General PD district utilizes the same x 12 building forms and uses to ensure land uses, height siting and ground spray activation are compatible with surrounding properties.

The River North Plan also goes on to say that the residential uses will be predominantly located along the river.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So this rezoning is to accommodate for a residential. Mixed use project that will truly embrace the river. As Steve discussed in the staff report, the reason we're seeking a pudi, which largely resembles x 12 is such that we can agree to treat the river like a primary street.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And with that comes ground story activation, transparency and other requirements. Additionally, we're seeking flexibility from the build to requirements such that we can design and responsibly integrate this project with the river and the surrounding parks and open space.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We filed the application originally on July 7th, 2014, and at that time it should be noted that it was 420 storeys in height. We had a number of dialogs with the surrounding neighborhood groups, but it's fair to say that the real back and forth didn't start until a few weeks leading up before planning board.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we actually delayed the project three times at planning boards so that we could continue on with our meetings with the neighborhood and community. The results of those delays was actually that we reduced the application from 20 stories in height to 12 storeys in height.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You know, there were some other tower heights approved in the neighboring and adjacent and Argo market GDP. I believe there's 180 200 feet and 220 feet towers approved and the site just next to us. But at the end of the day, the project team and the development team wanted to be good neighbors, good partners with the community'",
        "'speaker_4': '. And after a long, lengthy series of internal conversations, found a way to make the program and the project work with the 12 stories. I want to personally commend the folks in the Rhino Arts District and that neighborhood group for the series of dialogs that we had with them.'",

        "'speaker_12': 'And we we it most likely will be called to now go straight on the river. And it is really all about the river. And it is another opportunity in the Rhino District to to create a place where as a group, we are involved with placemaking and hope and think that we have a reputation for getting some kind'",

        "'speaker_11': 'You guys are going to have to share this in Rondo districts, Cherry Creek, all throughout the city because it's still a city. That has residents of human beings who have value. We have the right to live. In a place that's safe and secure and a place they can raise their kids and be a part of, as opposed'",
        "'speaker_11': 'to being isolated and stigmatized and feeling unwanted. So originally I was opposed to this thing. But I changed my mind. Because you're in danger. And I know your heart is sick.'",

        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you. So I know her heart. I know Dana. And I know that we can sit down and have a conversation. And maybe we can open up some doors here and see if we can get some done things so that this can be a more exclusionary project.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Mr. Speaker, your 3 minutes is up. Thank you. Thank you. That concludes our speakers. Time for questions from members of the council. Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I have a couple of questions. So the first one is for. The developer. Dana? Would you mind coming forward?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Where we're multiple.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay, so this is a four acre site.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Rice for four plus.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'How how many residential units are proposed generally in general?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We don't know exactly where as we wait for the rezoning, why, we have discussed a number of different proposals. We don't know whether they will be for rent or whether they'll be condominiums. We just know that the primary use will be residential.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And as I said, this is really all about the river because there are very, very few places so far. I hope that's just true so far in this community that people can live in a place and be really involved with the Platte River.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'You want to come in so.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'For Akers, you can do a lot of units if you're allowed to build up to eight storeys in some areas and 12 in others. So if you're doing any for sale units and they exceed 30, then obviously you'll comply with the city's FHA ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Right. Okay. That's that's all I have for you right now. I'd like to ask Steve Nelli a question, and I'd like the map pulled up so we could see the surrounding parcels. It looks to me on one of those maps, like we have railroad to the west.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Is that an active railroad line to the west?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It is a very active railroad line.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. So what I would like to know is if there was any discussion in the process about the interface with the railroad and issues related to public health and safety. And raising this because we have had a number of meetings with the planning director in our fire department around how especially in the design review process.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But, you know, when you're you've got people coming in wanting to rezone, I think the discussion about how do we ensure that if there happens to be any kind of incident on the railroad next door, that we as a city are doing everything we can to protect public health and safety.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So, for example, some of the things we've talked about have been like, how do you make sure that you don't have, you know, exit doors, if you will, that face the railroad tracks so that if you've got to evacuate the building and there's some kind of spill and we know that, you know, we're seeing more and more'",
        "'speaker_8': 'tanker cars that are carrying crude oil because we've seen more and more drilling, although that's kind of slowing down right now with the oil and gas industry. But communities across the country have had situations and incidents. And I'm trying to look at how we can be proactive as a city to ensure we're addressing those public health and'",
        "'speaker_8': 'safety issues. So I want to know what kind of discussions took place around those that that concern.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right. So I should just add that the North and metro commuter rail line will actually go in between this property and the rail that you can see on the map. So RTD does owns a property in the north metro line will go through there.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Also through the discussions that we've had to date, it was more about what what sides of this property should be active. And there there are no requirements to have an entrance along the edge of the railroad beyond that discussion.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's that's that's all we had for the zoning. Now when the development team comes forward for site plan review, I'm sure those discussions will continue, especially with the fire department.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. I appreciate that. I just I just think it's in our collective best interest to ensure that, you know, we're thinking about that, looking at how we address it. With with all projects, I mean, and what really brought that to light was going out to a particular site where, you know, you've got roll up windows and people'",
        "'speaker_8': 'have very active space. The tracks are right there. You see the kinds of, you know, tanker cars that carry different types of materials. You know, I mean, I have a long history with those neighborhoods where from time to time we've had to see evacuations, you know, because of various types of spills or whatnot.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And if we can in our process, really make sure that we're addressing that public health and safety issue, I think we would all be better off. Thank you. I have nothing further, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Ortega. Councilman Canete.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mr. President. A couple of really quick questions probably for you, Steve. First of all, I, I know I've written this section of trail, but I cannot for life. Remember, does the trail, the bike trail go between where the site is in the river or is it on the other side of the river here?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It is on this side.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It is on this side. So they won't just be interface with the river. There actually be interface with the transportation corridor first. Okay, great. Further supporting, treating it like a road. Second question is I'm bad. Also on the new zoning code, old zoning code, I be weaver.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I can't remember seeing another rezoning from B. Is that old code.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That is new code.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Or new code?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sorry, Denver zoning code. No, it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Was it was updated. Okay. Got it. And then my third question is the sign overlay. Got asked this question recently about because there's a whole net billboard situation in the state, if I understand correctly. So does the site have a billboard now?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And what happens to the sign overlay with the PUD? Is it written into the pad or how does that work? Is it being extinguished?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So the overlay is going away. I don't recall that there's a billboard on the site. I could be wrong.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The zoning is there, but it's not part of the current allocation of how many signs are allowed.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right. The zoning would allow a billboard there today, but there is not a billboard on the site.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's going away.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And it's going away.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you very much. That's it, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And Councilwoman Carlson. Councilman Brooks?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah, thank you, Mr. President. I think the developers won't give us a hint on what this development is going to be. So I'll go to my next question and maybe Councilwoman Monteiro can answer this, Steve maybe can answer this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But for for the Rhino neighborhood, it's a it's a it's a great opportunity because it's a blank canvas. And there's going to be a lot of development in the future. I'm just wondering, has there been any talks about creating design review guidelines for the future just when all these developments start hitting oak shaking?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So one of your can can answer this question. I just think I think it's important we talk about that. And then one, I think it's important that we get to action on that. But I just want to I want to hear from either one of you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There has been quite a bit of discussion, especially in the neighborhood. So I would defer especially to Justin. But in considering design guidelines, I think there are a few ways to go about doing those. The traditional way is to adopt design guidelines as rules and regulations and then establish a review board and make permits or approving permits'",
        "'speaker_1': 'contingent on approval from that review board with a finding of consistency with those design guidelines. Some other things that we've discussed with the neighborhood has been more of an informal design guideline design guidelines where developers work with the neighborhood and they have a conversation with the permits aren't necessarily contingent on approval.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Justin, do you want to?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we've been talking about design guidelines for a couple of years, specifically for the reasons that you brought up, which are there's so much development coming to the neighborhood and, you know, what does that look like and what is the neighborhood looking for and what's the vision for the neighborhood and how is that articulated?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We've actually talked with Brad Buchannan on a couple of occasions as to what the best way to move that process forward is, specifically because we don't necessarily want to create the typical design guidelines. We want to be the neighborhood wants to be pro-development and pro change.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The other reason is that we're not particularly caught up in architectural styles. I think what we're really interested in is great urbanism and having reinoehl be a place for great urbanism in the city. And so what that tends to look more like is form and activation of buildings at the street.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we are in the process of determining how we're going to articulate that and what the formalized process will look like with Mr. Buchanan. The other thing is we're looking at forming a business improvement district in the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The idea being at that business improvement district would fund the creation of a set of design guidelines which we don't currently have.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah, I just asked that question because I've heard some rumblings about it, but I didn't know if there was a formal plan to action this development. I'm sure it's going to be great, whatever it is. But I think this is a microcosm of the other 20 that are being planned in the future and this district has the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'opportunity to be incredible, like you said, new urbanism. And I just I'm glad that we're moving forward with that. It's good. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You, Councilman Brooks? Councilman? No.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I think this is for Mr. Neely, but anybody else on the development team may have the answer to this question. I raised this privately first when we had this at committee, and it was just a little source of anxiety on my part.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Slip up a different picture, maybe the zoning picture. Yeah. On that thing. Right. No, no, that's the that's the land use picture. Is there a one? Yeah, that's a good one.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we're investing a bunch of money to make the river nicer, to make that, you know, a more of a a destination. And the developers are investing a lot of money in making this project actually speak to the river and interact with the river in a direct way.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then. But when I was looking at the map, there's this weird sliver of land that lies between the property in question that we're rezoning. And the Open Space C district, which is the river which appears to be owned by the railroad.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I don't know about y'all, but I haven't had great experiences with dealing with the railroad. So somebody somebody reassure me that this is understood and that there will be nothing standing in the way of creating developed space that speaks to the river and our investments on the river.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That between those will not be a whole bunch of. Railroad ties and. You know, 50 gallon drums and Lord knows what all. Maintenance junk at the river. I mean, do you see you see what I mean about that?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The space there.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So the ownership is as well understood. The the the property is not abutting up for its entirety. The sliver actually ends and there is it's hard to see on this map. And I don't know if my pointer works on your screen.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Oh, no, there it is. Yeah, I see your point. Okay, so this there's a very small sliver of upland in this portion, right?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Just enough to fit some 15.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I believe the ownership ends here and that it's city property and combination of city owned property and a property that is planned for open space associated with phase two of the Niro market GDP. Right. So a large portion of this area and here it's actually slated for open space to meet the center for the GDP.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Now, I may ask the development team to to speak to any of negotiations or discussions they've had, but we do understand the ownership.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'd like to just dovetail on that a little bit. So first of all, we've really tried to approach the entire property almost in a sequential basis, and it's been very challenging. The acquisition of the land because of the seller was very challenging.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The dialog and the and the zoning conclusions were challenging. And then again this the way we address the park and the open space will be a challenge. But so first of all, I will say we're very aware that it's a railroad property, it's a very small sliver, is probably 6 to 10 feet wide at the most at'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the biggest piece and narrows down. But most importantly, as has mentioned, we're very focused on trying to solve this problem and solve this river park, open space on the next step. So in terms of that sequence, that's our next next step.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then also will be the the actual land use the size of the project. To answer Debbie Ortega's question, we have engaged in a lot of dialog with the Greenway Foundation and Jeff Shoemaker. So far. We have engaged some planning and landscape architects with him.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we are working in concert with Greenway Foundation at the moment. It's very possible that it's a public private type of partnership that will solve that problem. So again, we don't really have any pat answers tonight, but but we do feel like we're solving these problems in a hierarchy that will get that accomplished.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. I stand reassured.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman. Councilman Monteiro.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. Would you mind coming back up to the podium? Would you talk to counsel about the general background of the property? And in that it's been an activated for quite some time. And what you saw in this particular piece of property we've talked about.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Most of the conversation is oriented towards the river, but are there other merits to this property? So I want you to answer that also and then clarify again. I think it's a little bit confusing that we keep talking about the Dynamo Market General Development Plan, which is not your character, which is not the proposed property that we're'",
        "'speaker_6': 'talking about. And be clear about the connection that the property that you're talking about, the connection that it has across the street to the do not go market.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah. So I'm going to play planning staff in point. So we are. So first of all, to answer to try to answer your question. This property has been on and off of the development radar for over ten or 12 years.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's been a very difficult challenge with the seller to acquire this parcel. Wind and cargo market GDP was originally applied for in 2006. This property was was thought to be included in that. And then that didn't work out.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And as a result, it remained almost sterilized by itself for four, eight years. We had the opportunity to reactivate that in negotiations for the purchase of that. We felt the the value of this property as another gemstone for the rhino neighborhood and on that river was worth the challenge to try to activate that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I don't know if that answers your your question, Councilwoman, with regards to the assemblage piece, with regards to the Drago market, GDP, that GDP is across the street to the east of us, we are not part of that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'However, the reason we keep referring to the general market GDP is the scale and the size and the planning of that property helps inform our decisions and how we want to interact not only with the rest of the urban context, but also the river as well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And part of that river and that open space is the negotiated open space agreement with the our market GDP to put that open space adjacent to our property. So we feel like there's a a need for the dialog between the two parcels that the target market GDP in our property.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Monteiro. Any other questions on Tinetti? See? No other questions. Public hearing on 1080 is now closed. Time for comments, Councilman Monteiro.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. President. For quite some time. It's probably been 10 to 12 years. I've been very concerned about this particular piece of property, especially around the time that the the general market development across the street was being discussed in that particular zoning application.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think past probably 12 years ago before the Reno neighborhood even got any traction and is as attractive as it is today. This particular property has the potential to be a major anchor on that side of the river.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Today, it's pretty isolated and it's a it's just it looks like it's an old grocery store garage where the semi-trucks were back up to the to the loading dock and take the groceries and to distribute this whole particular area to the merits of the diner go market, which is across the street, is because it really was a'",
        "'speaker_6': 'market at one time where people would go and purchase, I think it was wholesale produced fruits and vegetables and then distribute them around town. So there really is urban agricultural feel in this particular neighborhood. I was concerned about the height of the of the project and I was concerned about, you know, why are we doing another piece'",
        "'speaker_6': '? Those arguments have gone away as Steve, Nelly and the developers have explained why we do need to put under these extraordinary, extraordinary circumstances. The biggest one is that the project is oriented to magnify the use of the river.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And it's my understanding that through going back and forth with the neighborhoods, the development team has has agreed to the 12 stories as opposed to the original 20. So that does build goodwill within the neighborhood. So I want to say that I am relieved that there will finally be an activated use for this particular piece of property'",
        "'speaker_6': '. Today, it just sort of seemed like it's wasting away and it's kind of an asphalt parking lot. And the idea of activating and being able to have this kind of use is very, very important. I will say that in my mind it doesn't really relate to Brighton Boulevard in that, you know, it's several blocks away, which I'",
        "'speaker_6': 'know is probably not a popular thing to say, but I like that we have Brighton Boulevard developing as it is in terms of its uses bikes, pedestrians, automobiles and other vehicles. But this sits back, I don't know, two blocks maybe.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so it kind of gives it can give potential people in the future a respite in terms of being away from the the harshness of and maybe it won't be harsh in the future, but today it is the urban harshness of Brighton Boulevard.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So you can easily just walk a couple of blocks and you're near the near the the river. So I am supporting this and want to commend everyone, Steve, Nelly and to the developers and the whole team for actually taking the time to sit down and listen and being able to work out all of the, you know, all'",
        "'speaker_6': 'of the concerns and come to presenting the application that we have to do. So I will be supporting this and I encourage my colleagues to do the same. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilmembers.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. President. And I'll be supporting this because of similar reasons that Councilwoman Monteiro mentioned. But I want to say something that's a little different. I believe this is Bob. Alex, this is the first time we we've seen a project that Bob Gorelick has been representing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I want to thank Shamali for standing in. And we just as a council, just want to give our thoughts and prayers to Bob. We know he's doing a little bit better, but we want to see him to a full recovery and be up here talking that that zoning mumbo jumbo.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So here's the here's to Bob Gorelick. I vote yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Brooks. Seen. Their comments on 1080. Madam Secretary, roll call.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Montero I never i Ortega I Rob I Shepherd I'm Brooks. I can eat lemon.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Lopez All right.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Mr. President. Hi.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Madam Secretary, please. Kosovo only announced results tonight. Tonight 1080 has been placed on final consideration and does pass a one period German announcement on Tuesday, January 20th, 2015.
