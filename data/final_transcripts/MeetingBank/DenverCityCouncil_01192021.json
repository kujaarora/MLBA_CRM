        "'speaker_4': 'any employee who works at Dan. We appreciate this being brought to our attention. So with that, Madam President, I'm requesting that my colleagues all vote no on this. This is what this is is it's a reduction in our leasehold area for the remainder of the year.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The lease actually expires at the end of this year. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilman Flynn. Next up, we have Councilwoman Keech.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Council President So as Councilman Flynn describes this bill as an amendment to a lease agreement with prospect there, a passenger service provider at the airport, as Councilman Hines described. So they subcontract to the airlines to help get individuals who need help to their flight safely protected if something goes wrong during the during the wait for'",
        "'speaker_2': 'their flight. So it's a very important job. And I, too, want to make sure that any prospect workers who are listening understand how important and valuable their work is. But they subcontract to the airlines for the service, but they contract directly with us as an airport for their space that they need to run their business.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think it's really important that there are some questions I've asked about the lease that are not yet answered. So just about the nature of the space reduction and the swap of space. So I do look forward to those questions being answered during this pause that will occur by us voting no tonight.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I want to expand a little bit on the the situation with passes over the course of several years, some former members of this council, prior council and workers advocated for were employers to begin providing eagle passes. This was not a practice at the time and there was a discussion should we have a policy or should we'",
        "'speaker_2': 'have a conversation with employers directly? And employers were responsive in part because it was in their best interests. It's difficult to attract workers to get to the airport with the expense of the transportation, with the barriers to getting to the airport.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There's a lot of lost time for workers commuting and going through security before they get paid. So the eco pass was a win win not just for workers but for employers. And that practice continued. And all of the competitors, they just want to make this really clear.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There are several passenger service providers at the airport. The competitors to this particular lessee are still providing this benefit, as are all of the other service contractors, large service contractors out at the airport. So but over the course of the past several months, they first reduced and then eliminated the eco pass benefit for more than 90 employees'",
        "'speaker_2': '. These are folks who cannot afford to necessarily absorb this cost. And so what that means is for us as an airport, this is a concern both in terms of workers and their ability to make their ends meet, which is always a concern for our city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But it's also a concern because if it increases turnover, which workers are already saying, why should I work for you? If I can work for your competitor and get this benefit paid for for the same wage, then we will have an increase in turnover.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We will have a increase in the need to badge and screen new employees. We will have less experienced individuals providing passenger services. And make no mistake, turnover has already been a challenge for this company and for this field.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So these are concerns for us as an airport owner, right, as a city, about how these types of services roll out. So I want to urge prospect during this pause, in this conversation with the airport and hopefully with the Union of Workers who are representing their needs, which is SEIU Local 105.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I urge them to reverse their decision and to reinstate the eco pass as their peers are doing at the airport. I recognize that the cost of an eco pass has gone up. We can all commit to working together to try to reimagine transit, to try to reimagine past fare structure as we come out of this pandemic.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There is no question that that conversation will be happening because this pandemic has upended our transit approach in our country, not just in Denver, but in our country. So we can work together on that. But to balance the books on the backs of workers is not okay, particularly when it results in turnover and risks to our airport'",
        "'speaker_2': '. So please reverse this decision, work with the parties. And I'm grateful to the airport for taking this concern seriously. As we vote no tonight, I hope we'll be having a different conversation when this lease comes back next time and that all of the other questions I won't get into those details, but other questions about the least can'",

        "'speaker_3': 'plan 2019. So within comprehensive plan 2040, there are several specific goals and policies that give direction and I'm going to that there are highlighted in the staff report. But I want to highlight some here just in this presentation.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'So. I think that it's I just wanted to shout out the part about inclusive and affordable housing that is a part of the Denver plan. And. And I'm just. Hoping that city council can keep that in mind when we are.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Planning, which, you know, I hope.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That that type of planning is happening. It doesn't always feel like that, but when we are planning for our unhoused neighbors, so it seems like it's of relevance and it's being taken into consideration by the community and Community Development Development Department.'",

I've talked about this before and when I read the staff report and I saw some some indecision or some issue over a detached ADU and how that would be applied to this slot.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you for your email today. You said that the applicant intends to do an attached ADU, but also with a separate garage on the property. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The applicant is here and clarify that as what is intending to do with an additional garage or not.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. I don't know if Aaron is if we want to promote Aaron Roediger and have him respond to what what his plan is here. I know that we have some few of our 500 and think 548 A.D. use now in the city, according to the permitting office in the last ten years.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And very few of them are on parcels that don't have access from a from an alley or a street. And so I wanted to I am concerned that CPD developed first some sort of guidelines for the suburban context, which is primarily dominated by lots that may be on cul de sacs as this one is, or actually on'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the end of a cul de sac. So the actual frontage isn't isn't very great. So the question was, how do we determine the rear plot line? How do we determine the envelope within which a detached adu could be built?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I understand again that that this is going to be an attached adu. Aaron is in here.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Aaron is. You might need to re pose your question, Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm curious what your plan is. As I understand, it's to be attached to you, but also with a garage. Is that for certain now?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you for that, Councilman. Thanks. Aaron Roediger and the property owner of Geneva. Yes. So my my original plan was to actually build a detached garage, which would have a garage on the first floor, obviously, into the living unit, second floor, and that would be in the back.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So if if you look at the front of the property, there is a very wide entrance for a gate, basically for steel to pull in. So the plan would have you would have a driveway going through the back area and.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The garage detached.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Within the property. You probably wouldn't see it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'On which side of the house is the is the access going to be?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That would be the the east side would be the left side if you're looking at it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Whether it's a gate there now. Yep. Okay. Are you currently renting the property out?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I live here currently. I have two roommates, but I know it's the harvest.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. And so you're living here now? Not in California?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'No, I do go back and forth, but I do. Okay. I'm a software engineer. I work remotely. So I do like to jump around and possible.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Flint. Next up, we have Councilwoman Torres.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, madam president. Edson I'm just wondering if you can share for folks that are watching. I know we've had a couple suburban applications come through in this question about absentee landlords has come up, done all of them, I think.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Can you just share a little bit of what what you might have shared with the commenter who originally opposed this about whether or not that would be an issue with an edu rental?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes, great question. The individual that originally wrote the letter of opposition was under the impression that the property owner didn't live on site and that it was completely being rented. And so they had concerns that it was going to be two units being rented out completely.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so the proper owner does live on site. And then there is a provision in our zoning code that states that states that end single units on districts where 80 days are allowed, that the property owner must live and maintain that unit.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So if Aaron decides to build the the attached avenue and he is required to live on site, and that's only if he decides to build the ADU or not. And this happens for any zoned district, whether that's attached or detached.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you so much. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman. All right. One final look. If there's any hands raised in the public hearing for Council Bill 20, Dash 1414 is closed. Comments by members of Council. Councilwoman Black.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, madam president. And thank you, edson. We talked a bit about this at the looting meeting. It is the first application to make it to council in a suburban salt zone district. And I am very curious about it, as is Councilman Flynn, because we don't have alleys mostly in these kinds of neighborhoods and there's big setbacks'",
        "'speaker_2': '. And so it'll be interesting to see what happens with this. So I guess here we go, suburban zone districts. And I guess I'll just look forward to seeing what the project proposal is and Mr.. Right after. I'm glad to hear that you live in Denver, New and I guess that's all I have to say.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It meets the criteria as laid out by Exxon. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Black. Next up for comments, we have Councilwoman Sandoval.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilman. So just a little side note. I live in an urban context and I have no alley. I live and like several of my blocks in northwest Denver, have no alley and a half a block. Rezoning is actually coming forward for the 46th and more for accessory dwelling units that have no alley.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So this isn't, I think, just in the suburban context, I think this is a context everywhere in Denver where you have no alley. Because I know some of my neighbors would like to see an accessory dwelling unit in my neck of the woods.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But once again, we have no alley, so I'm not quite sure. How do you determine that? So just wanted to go on the record saying that I would support CPD looking at this in all context where there is no alley and how do we address people going in and out from the yard?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I guess I'm more personally curious because I have lived for 20 years on a block that has no alley right in the smack heart of northwest Denver. I know several people as well. My mom lives on the same block as I do, and I'm interested to see how these rezonings come forward with no alleys.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So just wanted to go on the record to say that as Councilman Black mentioned, he did meet the criteria. But I still hope that CPD studies this a little bit more. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Next up, we have Councilman Sawyer.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thanks, Madam President. Just wanted to jump in on that conversation. As Councilman Herndon and I are looking into the rezoning in East Colfax for 80 years. This is an issue because there are blocks that don't have alleys in East Colfax and it's very site specific.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We've actually been talking to the fire department about what that looks like and the fire department and CPD in site review have a have a plan for that. So there is there is conversation happening about that, but it is very site specific and it very much matters exactly what is already on the land.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So it'll be interesting to see exactly what happens with this particular one. But it it matters what form and structure is already built on the land. So it's very interesting. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next up, we have Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Madam President. I want to support Councilwoman Sandoval in her request. That's exactly what I was going to suggest. Also that CPD take a look at the different settings and and determine that rather than a one size fits all, even just determining what envelope they could be built in.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Take a look at such things as life safety and public access and things like that. There is no I mean, there is no public access to the rear of this particular property. So I think that's appropriate. And I support Councilwoman Sandoval in asking CPD to take a look at that going forward.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Wonderful. Thank you, Councilman Flynn. And I'll go ahead and chime in, seeing that this meets all the criteria. I am happy to support it, but I think we're all paying close attention what this looks like for suburban context and where we go forward.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's an exciting time to see what this might look like. And so seeing no other hands raised for comments. Madam Secretary, roll call, please.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'What I said about the. I. Clark.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I. Flynn, I.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Herndon.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Fine.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hi. Cashmere by. Can it?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I. Ortega, I. Sandoval, I swear. I. All right. I. Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I. Madam Secretary, please close the voting and announce the results. 1313 IES Council Bill 20 1414 has passed. Our second hearing tonight is 20 dash 1435. Councilmember Taras, will you please put Council Bill 20 1435 on the floor for passage?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I move that Callum Hill 20 dash 1435 be placed upon final consideration and do pass.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. It has been moved and I think Councilman Herndon got that second in the required public hearing for council bill 20. Dash 1435 is open. May we please have the staff report? We've got Jason Morrison here from Community Planning and Development.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Good evening. Members of Council. Jason Morrison, senior city planner with Community Planning and Development. And the rezoning in front of you today is for a legislative rezoning sponsored by Councilwoman Kendra Black in the Hampton and Hampton South neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The Map Amendment resource owns a number of commercially zoned properties along East Hampton Avenue, with the goal of improving design outcomes by decreasing setbacks and requiring greater build to percentages. As I mentioned, we're in Council District four, Kendra Black's district.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In the Hampton and Hampton South Statistical neighborhoods. And the request. The proposed rezoning includes three large areas along East Hampton Avenue. These three areas include approximately 122 parcels or 164 acres from Interstate 25 to the west to south of Anna Street to the east.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The proposed Map amendment intends to rezone properties that are in the former Chapter 59 Zone District and the S.C. three s annex to mix three and six five within the Denver Zoning Code to S-Max 3amx5a. The purpose of the rezoning is to facilitate better design outcomes along East Hampton Avenue.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And in addition to bringing many of these former chapters of the nine properties into the Denver zoning code. The additional design standards found in this mix three eight and in the next five eight districts include improved building form standards along this corridor to create an active and uniform street front.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This includes, among others, reducing setbacks of current zoned districts, increasing build to requirements, eliminating surface parking between the primary street and the building, and finally requiring entrances to face the primary street for pedestrian access. There are many existing zone districts included in this rezoning, including several business districts pwds within the former Chapter 59 zoning code and mixed'",
        "'speaker_5': 'use and commercial corridor districts within the Denver Zoning Code. The existing zone districts are largely commercial districts which allow parking between the primary street and the building. And these zone districts also contain generous setbacks. More information on these individual zone districts can be found in the staff report.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'A portion of Area One, which is near Interstate 25, is within the sophomore Park U. Plane. This results in building height limits ranging from 12 feet to 42 feet. The view plan does not does allow exceptions in allowable height, including that any district zone for businesses may be built to a height of 42 feet above the natural'",
        "'speaker_5': 'grade. Furthermore, in existing structures that do not comply with the height, restrictions may be replaced with the current height and use the proposed zone districts within the view plan RSM s3a and 658 and have a maximum height of 45 feet and 70 feet respectively.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We're looking at the existing land use, the properties contained within this rezoning, our commercial, retail and office with some industrial mixed use and parking uses. The proposed rezoning is adjacent to mostly single and multi-unit residential uses as well as park and open space.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And here's a look at some of the existing building form and scale within area one of the proposed rezoning. And to orient you, this is near Interstate 25 in East Hampton Avenue. And here's a look at some of the existing Brill Building form and scale.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Near Yosemite Street and East Hampton Avenue. And then finally within area three, just near Havana Street, near Kennedy Golf Course. This is some examples of some of the existing building foreman skill in that area. The Map amendment application was unanimously recommended for approval by Planning Board, Planning Board and before it by committee.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Since the staff report was published, we received no public comments. The Council office held an open house to discuss the rezoning back in November of 2019, and overwhelmingly, residents agree that they'd like to see new, walkable, mixed use development that activates this area.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Because this is a legislative rezoning. It's only subject to three of the review criteria shown here. We'll start first with consistency with adopted plans. We have two adopted plans and that's Plan 2040 and Blueprint Denver. There is no neighborhood plan for this area.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Looking first to comprehensive plan 2040, the proposed MAP amendment is consistent with several strategies from current Plan 2040 shown here and also detailed in your staff report. Specifically, this application is consistent with two equitable, affordable and inclusive goals and strategies.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Because the proposed districts allow for a variety of uses that will provide services and amenities to the residents of the surrounding neighborhoods, and the design standards will promote greater walkability and accessibility to those uses established along the corridor.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Similarly, they're consistent with the climate strategy because the text and map amendments will allow high quality and mixed use development at locations where infrastructure is already in place. Switching gears and looking at Blueprint Denver Blueprint Denver maps, this area is mostly as a suburban context.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The proposed zone districts are consistent with this plan direction of commercial development that is focused along main corridors and the aspiration to make the context more urban in nature. The western portion of Area One, which is near the South more RTD station along Interstate 25, is mapped as the urban center context.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'These areas have a high mix of uses and street level activation. Blueprint states that neighborhood context are meant to guide which zone districts are appropriate and may be interpreted with limited flexibility. The 63a and five zone districts will implement the mixed use and walkable areas that are envisioned within the urban center neighborhood context.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Looking at future place type. The frozen districts are consistent with the future places mapping of this area of community center and community corridor which allow for a mix of uses with heights up to five stories and typically have an active street level.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The proposed districts are in mixed use districts allowing 3 to 5 stories and include design standards that do promote an active street. Hampton Avenue is a mixed use arterial and other streets within the rezoning are commercial arterials and residential arterials and collectors.'"
