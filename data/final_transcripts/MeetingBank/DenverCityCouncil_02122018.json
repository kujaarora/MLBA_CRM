Just want to go over just like this confusing is a multiyear contract and put in what do we spend last year for the emergency transport service for the homeless.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Last year. So we're splitting the allocation for this particular amendment. 20,000 will go to last year's services and I think it ended up being one. $1,460,000 total. Okay. So and that kind of fluctuates when the weather gets frigid like it is right now.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. And it looks like that's maybe a cost of per passenger about, you know, 6 to $8 a trip, which, you know. Right. And I think they were looking to look at the expense of this race for this this appropriation of all dollars gives you to September, where you're going to be reevaluating the cost of the transport'",

        "'speaker_3': 'How the city could personally invest to also reduce costs for these services, so that that would kind of be two separate projects happening at the same time with the goal of not breaking service.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'All right. Well, I encourage you also, we've got homeless all over the city. You know, and I know that you're transporting work from the rescue mission with three areas you're coming from.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'It's important to get the homeless off the street. There's no question about that. So I just encourage you to look at that transportation system, that address the homeless or in other areas of the city, as well as those main areas.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I know it's a difficult job and we've ridden with the homeless out there. And so it's a it's a it's a very needed service. But I think we can probably do a more cost effective if look at it.'",

Approves a $4.5 million supplemental appropriation from the general fund contingency for program management services to implement the 2017 General Obligation Bond program.  The Committee approved filing this bill at its meeting on 1-30-18.": [
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, sir. Thanks, Vince. Thank you, Councilman. You. All right? Yeah, you can do it. We now have a council bill. One of five. Councilman Espinosa, will you put us on the floor for publication?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yes, I move that council bill 18 105 be ordered published.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. It has been moved and seconded. Comments. Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Thanks, Mr. President. I called this out for a vote. When this came into committee and it was discussed that the we were using general fund contingency and then each year a general fund appropriation for the management and oversight of the 2017 Geo Bond program.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I voted no in committee because I believe that the costs of the bond projects ought to be borne by the bond proceeds, as has traditionally been done. I know there are other areas where we do use general fund to administer certain other programs, but it's been traditional to administer bond programs out of the bond proceeds.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And so I wanted to vote no. That's why I called it out.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilman Flynn. Councilwoman Connection.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I am I did not vote to advance this bill from committee because I shared some of the concerns that Councilman Flynn has. You know, the mayor just this briefly in the mayor council meeting and his his point was that he decided to propose using the general fund because he did not want to pay'",
        "'speaker_14': 'interest, literally borrow money to pay for staff and to pay interest on it. I think that is a compelling argument for why not to put personnel in the bond if you have a strong enough general fund to do that.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'I think my challenge is that we're not doing it consistently. There are other programs where we have dollars that are set aside specifically for capital construction, and we do require those funds to pay for their personnel. Some of them are borrowed money, some of them are not, some of them are sales tax or other sources.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'In the case of the housing fund, it's a property tax portion of a mill. So so in those in all those cases, it's not the case that we're borrowing the money, but we are taking the money from money set aside for capital and we're using it for staffing.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'I think this is just generally speaking not an ideal practice. So I actually am not so much in disagreement with taking the funds out of the general fund for the bond as I am the fact that we're not doing that for other programs.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'So I think that, you know, having thought about it some more since committee, I am going to support this going forward. But when we say, for example, where's more money for housing, 60% of the administrative costs for housing are coming from the housing fund that was intended to build units.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Right, 40% or general fund. I think I have those numbers about right, but I might be off by a point or two, but more than half the administrative dollars for the housing fund, paying for staff, paying for important oversight.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'You need people to implement programs. You need people to make sure the money is being spent properly so we could free up money for capital construction and for units or the same for other funds. We have human services, similar thing.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'We're dealing with safety net programs and some of the administrative staff is coming from the fund intended to provide emergency services. So I think it's important for us to just like we do with other programs, there is the cost of doing business.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'You need city staff to run programs, you need them to do oversight and you separate that out from the money you need to build projects and to invest in programs and you don't steal from one to pay for the other.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'So so I hope that we continue that conversation. I will certainly be more vigilant about it in the next budget. And I think that we will have a chance to read about this for the bond in the next budget cycle, because my understanding is and the staff should jump up screaming to the microphone if I'm wrong.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'But my understanding is this is a one year decision on source of funds, and nothing precludes us from moving this program back into the bond program for all of this overhead in the future. So again, if I'm misstating that, I hope someone will disagree, but I have decided to go ahead and support it for today based on'",
        "'speaker_14': 'the good logic that it's not ideal to borrow money to pay for staff. But but we need to do better in protecting other programs and not getting overhead dollars out of those program dollars. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Can each. Anyone from finance want to address that or it's a good. Okay. I think we're good. All right, Councilman Espinosa.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yeah. I just wanted to explain that I do like to agree with Councilman Flynn's position and will be voting no. You know, I would love to have four and a half million dollars to expand our sidewalk pro bono program by two more regions.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Or the one thing that I've been demanding but it's a different bucket is money to address gentrification concerns and displacement and staff to do that. And so once again, we find money to do these sorts of things, but we can't find money for things that the constituents are truly requesting.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I have a question for someone from the finance department if they could identify themselves and come forward. Laura.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Laura Perry is on her way.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Hi, Laura. Can you tell me if. This particular budget request includes any of the additional office space that is going to be needed for the staff that will be hired on to help administer the bond projects.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes. So that is it. I'm just I'm so sorry. Laura Perry, capital planning program director in the Department of Finance. So we every time we add a position, if there is space required to support that buildout, we typically look to our real estate capital fund that we have established to support the build out of space.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So that cost is included in this 4.5 million. Yes. Okay. So the fact that we're going to be looking at additional space at the Denver Post building, which is some of the most expensive office space, concerns me. And I've expressed that to our folks from the real estate office.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We've got other properties in the city. We've got a building sitting at Alameda and. I don't know. Jason Street, somewhere over there that we purchased for the Solution Center that never move forward. And I challenge that we should not be spending the most expensive, spending these dollars on the most expensive office space.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And so for that reason alone, I will be voting no tonight. I mean, I don't have a problem with us, you know, spending money for staff to administer these programs. But the fact that we will not see the contract and I'm assuming this presumes that this is the okay by approving this tonight or will there be a'",
        "'speaker_10': 'separate contract on the expansion that is proposed for the Denver Post site?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So let me clarify. There are no dollars in this 4.5 million for the expansion at Denver Post building. Those funds, I believe, from a separate source that are not related to this particular appropriation request.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But that will be an additional cost to the bond. Project, if you will, that will come out of you're saying that'll come out of real estate.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'There is a general fund appropriation for real estate for that particular transaction.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. Well, when I asked the question earlier, if that those costs were included in this 4.5, you answered yes. So you're clarifying now.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Clarifying now that in generalities, any time we add personnel, we always look to add resources to support any space requirements to support those, whether it's an existing appropriation or adding new through the annual budget process. And in this regard, these funds are strictly for staff in professional services for implementation of the bond.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And we will be seeing something separate brought to us looking for the build out of space.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I can certainly confer with our real estate division and get back to you on that.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. So for that reason, because it's not absolutely clear, I think I'm still going to vote no tonight. I mean. I'd like to know where that money is coming from that covers that cost. And so until we know that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So. So Councilwoman Gaby, I wanna ask you if you know this from the mayor's office is that's a separate I'm assuming that that is a separate allocation.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Gabby Correct. Mayor's office. Yes, that's correct. Well, we plan to bring a separate lease for space forward at a different time to city council.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Well, the fact that we're spending $10 million for a for a lease at the Denver Post building, I don't know what this is going to add to the cost to look at more space in that building. You know, I know we have access to the auditorium for any of our agencies, which is great.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But again, I think we should be as efficient with taxpayer dollars as possible. And this is an opportunity where we could be looking at other space and not just presume that we should be utilizing some of the most expensive office space.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yep. I hear you, Councilman. All right, Councilman Cashman, you're up.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Laura, please remind me how we paid for similar management services in the better Denver Bond and the 27 issue.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Sure. So in 2007, actually, all the positions started out in the general fund. And as we saw the economic and market conditions change and we saw departments having to take major reductions in budget cuts. We actually utilized and looked at all the projects in Better Denver to determine if there were any savings within Better Denver that could'",
        "'speaker_8': 'accommodate the charging of staff. And so at that point in time, the decision was made to actually charge staff time to better Denver bond around the 2728 timeframe to be able to allow for us to sustain employees and also allow for us to meet budgeted targets within the city.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So if the general fund had been healthier, you'd have left the costs in the general fund, which is what you're speculating.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The general fund would have borne some costs. The project managers at the time were working on multiple projects. Some were in the bond, some were not. And so legally, they're only able to charge their time for a bond project that they directly work on.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so their other work continued to be borne by the general fund.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And thank you, Councilman Casper. And seeing no other. Thank you, Laura. See no other comments, Madam Secretary.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Councilman. I'm Joyce Caprio.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'With the same platform where the agent for the owners of this property. So really just here to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Answer questions.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If you need.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Them. Thank you. Thank. All right, Chairman Sekou.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. Good evening.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'My name is Chairman Sekou. Founder organizer for the Black Star Action Movement.'",

        "'speaker_12': 'And senior citizens. We see.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That. This has the possibility.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Of enhancing the.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Neighborhood. One, which I attended high school, Emmanuel Manual High School, right around the corner. And there's a caveat in it because it needs to be this whole zoning thing needs to be consistent so that, you know, we know exactly what we're doing with this and people aren't caught up in the process.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's economically. Not fair. Many of these projects, you have to spend thousands, tens and thousands of dollars before you even dig a hole in the ground, because you got to go to this zoning process and changes and whatnot.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we're moving forward with this thing as it comes out. We're changing it. So that's a good thing. That's a good thing. Now the question becomes. What's coming with this? What's coming with this? Because when you change it into another deal here, you open up the door and Pandora's box.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To housing that folks in the neighborhood can't afford does number one. It don't look like none of the stuff that's there. Well, they throw up a building and then, whew, in the midst of brick houses, we got this ultra super kind of looking kind of thing, and we got this witness.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It was a Mendez. You wouldn't want to have in your own neighborhood. I mean, come on. Can you imagine putting this in Cherry Creek, man? Come on. For real? It wouldn't happen. So we see the vulnerability of our neighborhood and us organized.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that's why we need City Council to ask some real specific questions like, what are you going to do with this? What's going to do it safe? And some people feel this zoning and a place for it to go.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I know all of you know, most of you have talked to these folks before, even came to the floor about what is to do, what's to do, what is what's the planning. And we don't know what that is because that's not on the agenda.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'See, and most people in neighborhood don't even know these folks. All right. So gentrification comes in on the down low because you start building stuff that people can't afford in a neighborhood, and then they had to move out because you increased them corner lots.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then what we have is increase in property taxes for folks who are in the middle of that, who are fixed income, who lose their houses because they can't pay the property tax. But the house is already paid for and here comes the developers are gone.'",

    "A bill for an ordinance relating to the Denver Zoning Code, creating certain overlay districts in the 38th & Blake Station Area. Approves a text amendment to the Denver Zoning Code to create a new River North Design Overlay (DO-7), establish Incentive Overlay District as a new category of overlay zone district, and create a new 38th and Blake Incentive Overlay (IO-1) in Council District 9. If ordered published, a public hearing will be held on Monday, 2-12-18. The Committee approved filing this bill at its meeting on 1-2-18.": [
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. 12 Eyes Council vote. 1461 has passed. Congratulations. Okay, Madam Secretary, we have a couple of bills we need to put on the floor here. How would you like to do this?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Just put one on the floor and you can include the others. I was one at a time on the floor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Councilman Espinosa, would you put Council Bill 16 on the floor?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I move that council Bill 16 be placed upon final consideration and do pass. And I apologize for not being here after the recess last night.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's okay. It's been moved and seconded. Councilman, will you please put Council Bill 17 on floor?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'No, it's fine just to have 16 on the floor right now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And you want to you want to handle this when we get done with the public here?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. All right. It's been moved and seconded. The combined public hearing for 16 and 17 is now open. May we have the staff report? Mr. Barge, I'm going to yield my time due to due to we as having a lot of speakers and I'll make my comments there in the comments section.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So do you want to bring up Brad Buchanan first?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Yes. Brad, are you nearby? He's coming.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'He's hustling in.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sorry for the delay. You were quicker than I expected. It's no problem. Good evening, Mr. President, members of the council. I'm Brad Buchanan, the executive director with Denver Community Planning and Development. And here to make a couple of quick introductory comments before the staff report about this family of amendments you're going to be considering this evening.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm very pleased and proud to be part of the team presenting this significant new tool and how we create the future for our city. On the surface, it's a text amendment and a map amendment. It is, in fact, much more than that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'As our city wrestles with all that comes with the historic levels of investment we are currently experiencing. There are many tools, both proactive and reactive, that must be employed. This is yet another arrow in the quiver to help the the progress our city's experiencing be something that everyone enjoys, not just those who can afford it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, the ordinance you will decide on tonight will not singularly disappear are affordable housing challenges. They create tools that to date have not existed in our city, nor in all but a few U.S. cities. First, the process that the legislation requires is better than we've seen in the past.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Often, cities up zoned areas only based on plan recommendations. And while this requirement is a critical one, this legislation recognizes that in addition to planning density in the right places, in the right ways, that development and a hot, hot economy come with strings attached.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Rising housing prices, increasing rents, displacement, gentrification, all impacts of the incredible investment confidence we're seeing in Denver right now. This family of ordinances created a conversation between the development interests interested in developing around 38th and Blake and the neighbors.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'A conversation that in this case started two years ago to discuss what kind of future all of the stakeholders wanted to see in Reno and around the station area. Yes, of course, density makes sense around a significant station area, but how much, how tall and what are the impacts going to be and what is needed to mitigate'",
        "'speaker_3': 'those the impacts of that development. Tonight, you will hear the answers that the surrounding neighborhoods gave to us to those very questions. They said they wanted affordable housing to help mitigate displacement and gentrification. They said they wanted to see better design quality and they wanted better results in terms of community serve and businesses as the area develops'",
        "'speaker_3': '. So tonight, you hear about an approach that gives our communities a real voice in this conversation, in the decision making of how our city develops, not just in in the plans we make that we're creating with Denver. Right.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And blueprint Denver right now. But in the actual crafting of what is allowed in and around the 38th and Blake Station area. Secondly, what is before you this evening creates a value sharing between the community and developers. Do you want to build higher?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes, you can do that. But at a price, a price that the community helped to set and to define. Will this solve all of our problems? No, it will not. Some say it doesn't go far enough. Yes, they do.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Do others say that we've gone too far? Yes, again. But through the feasibility study process, we ground in ground and honed in to get to the right numbers, to get to a place where we can maximize and optimize to get the outcomes we want without getting into the zone where projects become impossible to finance or underwrite.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'While not the panacea to all our city issues. This this legislation will create a significant new tool for our city to use in bringing our neighborhoods to the table and in crafting the future of their community. I look forward to the discussion tonight.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you very much. A barge with community planning and development is up next.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Brad. Before you do that, I neglected to make a comment tonight. Councilman Lopez Espanol repeat that we have Espanol or Spanish translation for anybody who needs it. Can you repeat that, please, in espanol? Dang. Come on, brother.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'As you're trying to speak Spanish to me. Yeah. All right. You're doing all right. The animals introduction in Espanol parallels can associate them.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Gracias. All right. Okay. A bunch. You're up.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Thank you. Council President Brooks. Members of city council and Brad for your introduction. I'm also joined by Laura Brzezinski from the department or the Office of Economic Development, who will help out with the part of the presentation that deals with the specific affordable housing requirements that are part of the system.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'This is all about implementing the adopted 38th and Blake Hite amendments that you adopted in September of 2016 with those key goals that Brad talked about. It's about promoting greater design quality, promoting higher intensity development to support transit, while ensuring that that development gives back to the community in the form of specific benefits, especially affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'That plan amendment process was was its own very significant process that involved over 13 major meetings, including five community workshops. There was a steering committee that guided the process. Members of the steering committee included representatives from all of the surrounding neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'There were also presentations to R.A. meetings, newsletters and a project website.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'As we move through this.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Presentation, I'll try to keep you oriented because there are several related components here. The first are the zoning code, text and map amendments. Those are over on the left hand side of this slide in green and orange. That is part of one package of text amendments and then is implemented through a first a math amendment that we'll'",
        "'speaker_13': 'discuss as part of this public hearing to apply the proposed overlays to existing properties with existing mixed use zoning. And then later this evening, we'll have a separate public hearing on an additional map amendment to rezone properties that don't have mixed use zoning and apply the overlays.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'The text amendment includes two distinct components the River North Design Overlay and the 30th and Blake Incentive Overlay. The design over overlay is all about that enhanced design quality that the adopted plan amendments recommend. The incentive overlay is about promoting that density to support the transit, but ensuring that the density provides in this case, a very specific'",
        "'speaker_13': 'and tangible community benefits. The incentive overlay in the zoning text amendment is then related to a proposed amendment to the municipal code to introduce a new article that will include the incentive affordable housing requirements that are related to this overlay and provide a placeholder for any future similar overlays and the requirements that would be associated with those'",
        "'speaker_13': 'overlays. So the on the zoning side, the incentive overlay enables the greater height and intensity. And the municipal code amendment then includes the specific requirements that are that are tied to that in terms of affordable housing. And then finally, there's an ordinance to establish a new fund to house the funds collected through the incentive system.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So I spoke about the significant process that went into the plan amendments. And then there's also been a significant process as part of this implementation effort that included quite a few community and stakeholder meetings, as well as information item discussions with planning board and the City Council Committee.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So we've heard a lot through all of that. But at the very high level, I'll just talk to you about some themes. There is a lot of excitement that we've heard regarding the future of this area and what kind of place it can be, and general public support for having an incentive system and specific design requirements.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'There are some concerns generally about growth and change and also about how that growth and change relates to the infrastructure capacity of the city and this neighborhood in particular. For some concerns about the removal of minimum parking requirements, in some cases that will go through.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'That's part of the design overlay as well as the required amount of affordable housing, both that it's too much for development or that it's not enough. And then some specific property owner and development concerns about there's an active use frontage requirement that we'll talk about in a moment that we've heard from developers that have some concerns about'",
        "'speaker_13': 'that, as well as some concerns about the specific rules and regulations about how affordable units are provided, exactly when they're required, and the ease of negotiating a community benefits option that I'll also talk about in a moment. So to begin with the details, I'll talk about the proposed River North design overlay first.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So again, this is one of the two major components of the text amendment. The component that deals with enhanced design quality. There are two major categories of design that the overlay addresses building design and massing and street level activation.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And to give you some examples in each category in terms of building design and massing, there are requirements that address the design of structured parking. I know we've all seen some of the larger new buildings that are dominated by structured parking that looms over the street and has a very cold, inactive appearance.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'This design overlay would require that 70% of that frontage be wrapped with another use other than parking, or that 100% of the frontage be designed to mitigate the impacts of the visual impacts of the park cars like headlights and security lighting, as well as to integrate the design of the parking levels into the overall facade design.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Also, there is a new requirement in the design overlay for incremental mass reduction. That's a that's a fancy name. The intent is to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Ensure that.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Larger buildings. This would only apply to buildings on zone lots over 150 feet in width, incorporate reductions in mass that help promote more creative building design so that buildings, the largest buildings, are less blocky and also preserve more light and air at the street and preserve more of a sense of human scale.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'The requirements increase as a building increases in height. So in some parts of the area that we're talking about, the incentive overlay would allow buildings of up to 16 storeys near the transit, and that's where the mass reduction requirements would be highest.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The River North.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Art District and other proponents were were very interested in having requirements that would help promote creative building design. So the incremental mass reduction is pretty flexible. Just see, a couple of it may be slightly wacky in the case of the one on the right, examples of different ways of meeting this requirement as part of the intent is'",
        "'speaker_13': 'that it's very flexible, but there's a mass reduction that's increasing as the building rises in height. In terms of street level activation, some of the important tools, street level, active use. There are special requirements in the design overlay that go over and above what we have in our existing mixed use in Main Street districts today in Denver'",
        "'speaker_13': '. So for the largest projects, there would be a requirement on a primary street that at least 50% of the frontage be uses other than residential or parking or storage. And so that could be uses like office or art spaces.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'It also could be retail or restaurants because smaller projects may have frontages that are entirely residential and bigger projects could still have some residential. There's also a requirement that the street level be designed to accommodate potential future changes in use.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And so it requires that the the height of the street level be a minimum of six feet, which facilitates that. And then the final tool I'll talk about addresses the street level residential specifically. So when there are residential units built on a street level frontage that they actually be set back from the street by a minimum of'",
        "'speaker_13': 'seven feet and that there be an entry feature for each street level dwelling. This is a concept you'll see as the text amendment to address slot homes comes forward as well. And just looking on on the left of this slide, you see just a basic diagram of a building meeting those requirements.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'On the corner, there's something other than residential units could be the building lobby or retail or a restaurant, but where there are those residential units there, there's set back and there's a there's a transition to the street because we've often seen when residential units are built right along the sidewalk edge, as is allowed at a zero setback'",
        "'speaker_13': 'in mixed use districts, that they have a very defensive design to protect the privacy of those units. This allows for a more natural transition. And then just a couple of additional tools. The design overlay actually removes the minimum vehicular parking requirement within a half a mile of the commuter rail station at 38th and Blake to promote transit'",
        "'speaker_13': 'use. It also provides additional criteria for how primary streets are designated. So the zoning administrator, according to various criteria, has the ability to determine which streets are primary, which means which streets get the highest level requirements in terms of transparency and other measures.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'This sets additional standards that will ensure that the most important streets in the area are designated as primary, including the riverfront. So just addressing the important criteria for consideration of the text amendment. Just in terms of the design overlay portion of the text amendment, the comprehensive plan recommends encouraging quality infill development that's consistent with neighborhood character and'",
        "'speaker_13': 'also directs us to focus design standards and review efforts on new and evolving districts that are undergoing the most dramatic change, as is certainly the case here. Blueprint Denver recommends creating new or modified zoned districts where there is not an existing zone district that allows the appropriate uses densities and design standards.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'We're not proposing to specifically create new base zone districts, but the overlay district is a mechanism to introduce the appropriate standards here. The 30th and Blake Station area height amendments make very specific recommendations related to the design overlay, including adopting a new regular regulatory approach to ensure greater design quality throughout the station area.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And finally, the Northeast Downtown Neighborhoods Plan from 2011 recommends promoting pedestrian orientation and minimizing the visible visual impacts of structured parking and locating commercial uses on the ground floor to activate buildings and the street.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I'll move.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'On to the second, a major component of the text amendment. And then while discussing this component, will also weave in the related proposal to create a new article in the Municipal Code to include the affordable housing requirements that are related to the overlay as well as the incentive fee fund.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So just looking at the components that address height and density in the area or proposed to on the text amendment side is establishing a new category of design overlay called an incentive overlay that doesn't exist now. And this is something that could be used in the future to create other kinds of incentive systems other than what we're'",
        "'speaker_13': 'proposing tonight. Then establish the first of those as incentive overlays as the 30th. And Blake stationary incentive overlay, which will allow from 1 to 11 stories of additional height over and above what the base zoning allows. And I'll show you a map.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'It depends on the part of the plan area. Specify the height transitions that are required adjacent to the neighborhoods, and then it cross-references the affordable housing requirements that will be on the right hand side of the slide in the proposed new Article six of Chapter 27 of the revised Municipal Code.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And that. So when you're using this incentive height, what do you have to do? And in very broad summary, what you have to do depends on what type of project it is. A primarily residential project using incentive height would have to build affordable units.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'That's the only option. And the requirement for affordable units is expressed as being the same requirement as applies citywide when using the linkage fees build alternative program, which is the alternative to build units instead of paying the fee applied to the whole building and then just applied to the incentive height, those additional stories allowed by the overlay'",
        "'speaker_13': 'a requirement to build four times that many affordable units. And so another way to look at it is that the base citywide requirement applies to the lower part of the building, and then the incentive stories are required to build five times as much affordable housing as would be required elsewhere.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'For a project that's primarily nonresidential, there'd be more flexibility because it can be challenging to provide units on site so they would have the option of building the affordable units or they could pay a fee. And the fee structure is similar to the affordable unit structure that I just went over that essentially on the incentive portion of'",
        "'speaker_13': 'the building, it it comes out to five times the fee that would have applied to that square footage elsewhere in the city. And then finally they'd have an option to meet the incentive portion of the requirement by negotiating a community benefits agreement that I'll provide more details on in a moment.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'The incentive fee fund is then related to those amendments and is a new fund only to house money generated by fees charged on the incentive stories of of a building. So this is the map that's included in the text amendment for the incentive overlay.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And this is the map that sets up the incentive heights. So the base heights are addressed in the underlying zoning. It's the maximum height in your zone district. But you can build taller than that according to those affordable housing conditions.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Up to the maximum height specified on this map and where you see actresses, actresses on this map primarily adjacent to lower scale neighborhoods. There actually are specific height transitions that are required in the text of the text amendment to ensure that the taller development steps down towards the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And I'm going to turn it over to Laurie Brzezinski from the Office of Economic Development now to go through some scenarios for how the incentive could be used. Just to help you understand that and just looking at this map, again, the examples that she'll use will use a property that would have a base height of five stories'",
        "'speaker_13': '. So let's say the underlying zoning was IMX five with a height limit of five stories and an incentive height of 12. So that would be true of some of the properties in on this part of the map, for example.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Hello. Members of Council Laura brzezinski, Office of Economic Development. I am going to take the numbers that Abe showed you just two slide ago and break it down in an example project, just to help understand this a little bit better.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Just before I do that, I want to highlight the fact that as we approached this process, a CPD city attorney's office, we had a couple of core goals that we were bringing to this approach, similar to what we brought with the linkage fee that was adopted in the fall of 2016.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'One of those was to introduce equity across different development types, including residential and commercial development types. Another of those values was to build a program that was predictable for developing the development community and finally to build an overlay and an approach that was replicable.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So those were some of the main components that we brought as values to this program. So first, we are going to walk through what the citywide linkage fee would look like in a typical five storey development. So this is the citywide program.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So in this example, we have 75 gross 75,000 gross square feet in a five story building. As you're aware, we have two options for this residential developer, and we're going to walk through residential first and commercial second. Certainly there's the option in the citywide program to pay the linkage fee that's a dollar 50 per square foot.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Or to use the calculations outlined in the citywide linkage fee ordinance to determine what number of units would be produced to offset that linkage fee and would have to be produced. In this case, we results in one unit to offset the linkage fee requirement for this five story building.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'In the incentive program. As Abe mentioned, we're using the example of five stories, up to 12 stories. The first step in our process is certainly, as May eight mentioned, there is no option for a fee here. So we are only utilizing that unit calculation, unit conversion that's calculated on a per square foot basis to determine what number'",
        "'speaker_8': 'of units would be produced. So our first step on the residential side is to determine what is the contribution and the number of units that are required to offset the citywide calculation. So in this case, because we've gone from 75,000 gross square feet up to 180 gross square feet, that results in three units that would need to'",
        "'speaker_8': 'be produce produced to offset the citywide linkage fee requirement that exists here as well as everywhere else. The second component of this analysis is to look at what the additional requirement is, because this developer utilized up to the maximum allowable storeys in this height incentive.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'As I've mentioned, this requirement is four times what's required by the citywide, but just on the square footage above the base. So our step next is to add those seven units that are required to offset the incentive overlay requirements with the three units for a total of ten units.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So this gives us, as you can see in this example, because the overlay existed even with the requirements we're required to get to that maximum height and set an incentive, a net gain of nine affordable units compared to what would have been developed if the developer only builds up to the five stories that was previously previously allowed'",
        "'speaker_8': 'by zoning. So as you can see, that's ten times the number of affordable housing units that would have been produced if that developer only built to the five storey base. So I'm going to walk through a commercial example, but the logic remains the same.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We're doing 5 to 12 stories here as well. Certainly there is the fee option for commercial development. Again, that's one times the citywide requirement. It's a dollar 70 per square foot on the total square footage and then four times that citywide linkage fee just on the area above the base.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'In this case, it brings us to a little over $1,000,000 that would be contributed to the fund. Apologies. We're missing a dollar sign there. The commercial developer who utilizes this incentive, just like in the citywide linkage fee, also has the option to build affordable units on site or off site within the overlay area.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'In this scenario, the same calculations apply at one times the citywide and then four times for the area above the base, up to a total of 414 units that would be required. There is a third option, and it's going to talk a little bit more about some of the details of this option in just a moment.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'To provide a community use of a portion of square footage in the building or in the overlay area for community serving users. In this scenario, we are still paying the city wide linkage fee, but there is a negotiated agreement with the Office of Economic Development for exactly what that community serving use is, how much space is required'",
        "'speaker_8': 'for it, and what the length of time that it would be affordable for. So in this scenario, for the unit option, it would be 14 times what would otherwise be provided by that five story similar to what we saw on the page before.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And just a little bit of additional background on what these affordability requirements are. This the rules and regulations for the citywide linkage fee are applicable for this overlay area, except for one unique piece about the overlay area in this overlay or in within the report affordability requirements of this overlay.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The units can be built on site or off site somewhere within that overlay, like the citywide linkage fee. The units have to be affordable at 80% AMI or lower, and the units have to be in a mix in size that's comparable to the market rate units.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So if all of the market rate units are one bedrooms, the affordable units could be one bedrooms. But if the market rate units are a mix of 1 to 3 bedrooms, the affordable units would have to be in a ratio that would match the market rate units.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So those units that are built offsite have some specific rules in our existing rules and regulations for the linkage fee, including requirements for an escrow and a specific timeline for construction. And there is also a requirement with our citywide linkage fee, as with this overlay, that the market rate units, the affordable units that are provided as an'",
        "'speaker_8': 'offset to the market rate units have to be of the same tenure type as the market rate units. So if the market rate units are for sale, the affordable units would have to be for sale. Likewise with rental.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'One thing we do want to note though is because we have fees paid to an incentive fee fund as well as units produced on site. We do have the onsite units produced at 80% AMI or lower, but the fees collected through the commercial development would also be invested in a consistent way with our other federal and local'",
        "'speaker_8': 'resources to address housing along the full spectrum. We have our housing plan coming to council next week that outlines some specific targets for the investment of our resources along the income spectrum, and the comprehensive housing plan would be applicable for funds are collected under this incentive overlay.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And then one last note on the the fees collected as part of the part of the incentive overlay would be collected into a new incentive fee fund. And that's necessary because the linkage fees go into their own fund, which is for the exclusive use of those linkage fees.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So we do have a separate fund for the collection of the incentive feeds under this overlay, and the uses are consistent with our dedicated housing fund.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Thank you, Laura. We're getting closer. I just want to mention a few of the details of that final option that, you know, certainly in our conversations with the community were we're well aware of that the the needs of the surrounding residents go go beyond affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And that as a as an area like the area around the 30th and Blake Station changes, the kinds of things that can afford to be in the neighborhood sometimes don't serve a diverse spectrum of residents. And so this system includes a proposal for an option that would just be for primarily non residential development because residential development has'",
        "'speaker_13': 'to build affordable units. So primarily nonresidential units, instead of paying the incentive fee for additional height, could execute a community benefits agreement administered by the Office of Economic Development. That agreement would meet the incentive requirements only, so the project would still have to pay the affordable housing linkage fee on all of its square footage.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'The agreement would translate, in general, the the value of that fee into an agreement to provide community serving users such as art studios and maker spaces or neighborhood services like childcare or community kitchens and community serving nonprofit spaces.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'The agreement would need to address the the rent reduction that would be necessary for the tenant. The terms and timeline of the agreement, as well as the recourse if the agreement was not in good standing. That is, if the developer or property owner lost the community serving tenant or some other non community serving use in the space'",
        "'speaker_13': '. And Jeff Romaine from the Office of Economic Development is with us here tonight, who can help answer detailed questions about this. So just looking at the incentive overlay component of the proposed text amendment, just run through consistency with adopted plans.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'The comprehensive plan recommends encouraging mixed use transit oriented development that makes effective use of existing transportation infrastructure. The adopted height amendments for this area recommend adopting a new regulatory approach to integrate affordable housing and mixed income development within the 38 Timberlake station area.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'That's exactly what this implementation effort is. Delivery on Swansea. A neighborhood plan from 2015 recommends neighborhood collaboration to determine whether taller building heights may be appropriate near the 30th and Blake Station. That neighborhood collaboration was embodied in the public process for the plan amendments themselves to determine those appropriate incentive heights and what it would take to get'",
        "'speaker_13': 'there. And then finally, the 38 template station area plan from 2009 recommends providing financial incentives to include flexible zoning and provision of density bonuses in this area. The text amendment introduces some criteria that would apply only to creation of a new incentive overlay or mapping of an incentive overlay through a map amendment.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And that includes a finding that the incentive overlay district will provide community benefits that provide that further one or more adopted city policies, that those benefits have been determined to be best achieved through incentives rather than direct requirements, that the incentive overlay district will ensure clear and predictable outcomes consistent with the applicable neighborhood context, building forms and'",
        "'speaker_13': 'the stated purpose of the zone district, and that the incentive overlay district will apply equally to all similar projects in an area or district to provide equitable outcomes. So the staff recommendation, community planning and development staff do recommend approval of the text amendment that includes both the design and the incentive overlay is based on a finding that'",
        "'speaker_13': 'the review criteria have been met, that the special review criteria for an incentive overlay district consistency with adopted plans, that they further the public health, safety and general welfare and results and regulations that are uniform across the District Office of Economic Development Staff and Budget Management.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Office staff also recommend approval of the related Municipal Code Amendment and the ordinance establishing the Incentive Fee Fund. So we have one last piece to go through. And just to reorient now we're talking so far have been talking about establishing this new framework of regulations on the books, in the zoning code and in the municipal code.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'This next item is about mapping them on the ground, determining where they apply. And so this proposed map amendment would. Why the design overlay and incentive overlay two properties that have mixed use zoning already in the area, which is entirely within Council District nine.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And looking at this map, the the blue area are properties with existing mixed use zoning that are right around the 30th and Blake Station that are in the area of the plan amendment. They're proposed for application of both of the overlays.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'The remaining area is is the remainder of the Reno Business Improvement District. It's proposed for application of the design overlay. That's DOT seven. Only the reason for this is that the Reno art district, basically, concurrent to the conversations we were having about implementation of the plan, made a request for a design overlay to cover all of Reno'",
        "'speaker_13': 'looking to promote enhanced design quality. Their desire was very similar to the objectives coming out of the plan amendment effort. So this MAP amendment proposes to take that design overlay developed to apply at 30th and Blake and extend it to the rest of the Reno area.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So the existing land use in the area, it's a large area. There are a lot of land uses now, however, that that kind of purple color is industrial. And so you can see that it is still primarily an industrial area and much of the zoning is split between industrial and mixed use now.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And there's a variety of new and old building forms in the district. Now there's some large new developments that are already near completion on the north and west side of the tracks, such as the catalyst development that's on the lower left.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And but a lot of the area is characterized by buildings like you see on the middle right there, low scale one, one and a half, sorry, industrial buildings. And then I just want to mention that the last item on the agenda tonight is a separate public hearing for an additional math amendment sponsored by Council President Brooks, which'",
        "'speaker_13': 'seeks to change the underlying zoning for a number of properties in this area that don't have mixed use zoning now. So change the base zone district and apply the overlays. And assuming that both amendments passed, what we'd be looking at in the area is that everything in yellow there on the map would have the overlays applied.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So you see that there are still some little missing pieces. That's primarily because we haven't proactively proposed to apply the overlays to planned unit developments PUDs. Also, Council President Brooks gave the opportunity to property owners with existing industrial zoning to opt out of changing that to mixed use at this time and applying the overlays.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And so a couple of large properties took advantage of that consistency with adopted plans. The Blueprint Denver Land Use recommendation is primarily mixed use for the area, as well as transit oriented development south of the station. It does include a recommendation for industrial.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Primarily north of the station and then the 30th and Blake plan amendments includes this map that really gives us our marching orders in terms of those incentive heights. And this map, the colors are the incentive heights that are recommended for the maximum available heights.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And the numbers on this map are the base heights. And those numbers are essentially consistent with all of the previous adopted plan recommendations, as well as much of the existing zoning in the area. And then the colors are consistent with the new vision for greater height, but requiring the additional community benefits.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And Illyria and Swansea. A neighborhood plan includes a recommendation for City Council member initiated rezonings to implement the plan vision, which is what's happening tonight as part of Council President Brooke's proposal. So finally, community planning and development staff recommend approval of the MAP amendment based on a finding that all the review criteria have been met, that it'",

        "'speaker_0': 'And I'm going to call the first five members. We have 26 speakers tonight. And this is a public hearing that is open. So we're going to get through them all. Ryan Kinney, Mercedes Gonzalez, Andrew Feinstein, Angelina Torres and Jamie Lit Co.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You are the first five. Please grab a seat here, Abe, if you can. If you can find a seat elsewhere. I'm sorry, buddy. All right, Ryan, Kenny, you're up first with 3 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Greetings, Council members. My name is Ryan Kinney and I live in Denver at 1920 South University Boulevard. I'm here to speak in favor of the bills relating to the rezoning of the area around the 38th and Blake Commuter Rail Station.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I'm supporting these bills for several reasons, but I'd like to talk about just two of them here. One is that in the face of the housing crisis, these amendments would increase the number of units that could be built in our city.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Adding more units to the housing stock will apply downward pressure on housing prices citywide. This will at least slow the rate of price increase, which is good. But if enough units are built, prices can actually go down. As evidence for this earlier in this year.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Seattle Intense infill development has caused rents to decline by an average of $50 a month as compared to the previous quarter. Beyond this, if the affordable housing incentive in this rezoning one courage more units to be provided at below market rates further helping the affordability cause in River North District.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'My second major reason for supporting this is because it facilitates more walking, biking and transit use. Increased adoption of these modes of travels is good for our health and essential and fighting climate change. One of Mayor Hancock's 2030 sustainability goals is to lower single occupant vehicle commuter mode share to 50%.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Changing city policy to allow people, services and workplaces to intensely concentrate around transit stations is essential if we want to achieve this goal. The rezoning of the 38th and Blake Station area is in line with this and if built out would substantially increase the walkability of the area and increase the number of destinations that can be conveniently'",
        "'speaker_12': 'accessed by Denver's transit system. Because this rezoning would sustainably and responsibly allow for more homes to be built for people who want to live in our city. I support these bills. I urge you all to vote in favor.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Kinney. Mercedes Gonzalez is up next, and she will have translation, so she will have 6 minutes.'",

It's a drop in the bucket compared to a thousand people that come into Denver every month. So you guys have to really consider that that, you know, there's so many people coming in here.'",

Directing density to this location also help support attracting a variety of community serving retail and businesses that make their location decisions on adjacent population and business counts. This will directly benefit the adjacent neighborhoods by bringing these kinds of services into it.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'It will be driven by market demand, which will take time to build. But by creating this new overlay district now, there is a greater chance that will happen. And when it does happen, the city will benefit from this density being tied to the creation of affordable housing.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'In fact, community rights are being further diminished as residents will not have the typical ability to comment on individual projects and rezoning proposals. There is no coincidence that community groups supporting anti displacement efforts were not included in this two year long process.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'A two year long process that did not address potential impact of gentrifying of gentrification until very recently reveals a complete disregard for communities pleas for more responsible development in our city. This incentive overlay is wildly insufficient and will absolutely exacerbate the problems we have yet to solve with regard to housing.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I support higher design quality and a much higher affordability housing affordability in housing percentages and targeting to a lower am-I. I do not support this zoning overlay at this time and true leaders would HALTZMAN overlay. And so we have meaningful housing solutions.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'We owe this to the ones that came before us. I think it's very important that if a developer chooses to buy out of this affordability a requirement, that those dollars go directly back to our community and not into a general fund.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We need to be able to earmark these dollars and be a part of the decisions of where these funds are best used.'",

I'm a native and I have what I feel bounced from council meetings to council meetings because I think the whole city is getting out of control with the way it's building.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We don't have a housing shortage. We have an affordable housing shortage. And the problem is the buildings out of control. The architecture is out of control. The height restrictions are getting out of control. I have lived here my entire life.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I like to see the mountains. I like to say if you go west, you see the mountains. Now I see brick and mortar everywhere around us. Like we're being built into a tunnel and a cave and a box.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The architecture down near the eighth Street Vay Viaduct. When you go near the railroad tracks, they look like Legoland. It's boxes with smiley faces. And I'm very disappointed. I've been in real estate my whole life. My father was a developer here in Colorado, and the developers have become completely irresponsible developers.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'If they have deep pockets, they buy their way out of affordable housing. Because I've seen it done in a lot of projects I was on that I had to sell and we are so worried about the people moving in.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Why are we not worried about the people who live here and grew up here and they deserve to have the housing in the neighborhoods they live in. They should absolutely not be forced out by higher homes, higher density.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We don't need it. We just plain don't need it. And everything they're building around, they look like mousetraps. The city is becoming ugly. I don't even know where you go anymore to enjoy the beauty you get out by the northwest corner of Arvada.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You've got the same problem. You've got $6 million land transactions being sold for $30 for incentive programs that are going on throughout this city to protect the development. And you know what? I love my car. I like the light rail.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I think it's awesome. And we should all use it when we need to use it. But a lot of people don't live near the light rail. They need to own a car. So don't make it sound like if you own a car, you shouldn't even be driving.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You should be on the light rail. It's not a perfect fix. You haven't perfected it, but you're driving people in. We need to work on infrastructure and not so much more on building and development, work on fixing the streets.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I have switched to another industry that I know is making this city tens and thousands and millions and billions of dollars, and you need to start using them to improve the city instead of making it into what just looks like a box with eyes and a height restriction that lets you go to the sky anywhere you want'",
        "'speaker_9': ', because all it does is let the next guy come in and we will never see our mountains again. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Miss Gordon. I'm going to call the next five up. John Rickey. Jesse Paris. John Hayton. Darrell Watson. And Chairman Sekou. John. Ricky, you're up first. You have 3 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_15': 'Hello. My name is John Ricky. I live at 945 Washington Street and Capitol Hill. I find myself of two minds regarding this proposed incentive zoning. On the one hand, it fixes one of Denver's what I feel most underappreciated problems, which is the underutilization of our rail stations.'",
        "'speaker_15': 'It allows much needed density, which would work to support ridership. Our tax base and our multibillion dollar investment replaces acres of parking and low density zoning with a plethora of people. It also adds affordable housing, a stated goal of both supporters and opponents.'",
        "'speaker_15': 'This incentive explicitly requires affordable units when increased floors are built. It also adds customers for local businesses. People ask for grocery stores, doctor's offices, hardware stores, restaurants, the whole gamut of services, which should be available in a city neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_15': 'And this overlay will provide the customers to support those businesses. These are all good things. On the other hand, it adds costs. Units which must be sold below market, which may not cover construction costs. It adds complexity to what I would argue is already a frightening code.'",
        "'speaker_15': 'It would also. I would also note that dialing in incentives is a difficult game. Other cities have seen unintended consequences from such attempts. This new overlay is supposed to be precisely balanced to get the results we wish for.'",
        "'speaker_15': 'And it may work. But will neighborhood conditions still support this precise mix in five years? In ten, why not get out of the way? Instead, make it easier for to get the things we want rather than more difficult.'",
        "'speaker_15': 'Every neighborhood is experiencing high demand. The answer is not to choke off investment and growth. It's to add opportunities for investment and growth all over the city, at every rail station, in every neighborhood. We will never be financially solvent and have the infrastructure we desire with the low density development we've been allowed by people who oppose this'",
        "'speaker_15': 'kind of change in every single neighborhood. We need to build our city not just to be able to pay our bills, but to provide much needed housing and to continue to be welcome and affordable for all people. Restricting new housing does not lower prices.'",
        "'speaker_15': 'So in the end, I find the solution flawed but necessary. It adds what we need density. A mix of uses. It adds more people and affordability. It works within the current paradigm to get what we need. But we can't let it end here.'",
        "'speaker_15': 'We must fight for similar solutions all across our city. And since I have a few more seconds, I'll suggest something which shows how much further we could go instead of always stepping it down the station height to meet the single family homes.'",
        "'speaker_15': 'Why not step up the single family homes to meet the station? That way we get the most use out of our stations and provide even more housing for people. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Mr. Rickey. Jesse Paris.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening. Members of council. My name is Jesse Paris. I'm here representing for Denver, homeless out loud. We are a homeless advocacy group that advocates for the homeless and those that have been displaced by way of gentrification in the city of Denver.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Members of council I am voting against I am against this bill. As has been previously stated by other members, I have spoken today. This is not the solution. More gentrification in an already gentrified area is not the solution.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'More displacement of people that have been long time residents. I myself am a third generation northeast Denver native. This is not the solution. Giving more lead way to gentrification and. Is this opening the door for more people that are not native to this area, to the city?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You are literally opening a door for them and closing the door shuts for already existing natives, which is adding to the already existing homeless problem that is going on in metro Denver in all areas, specifically northeast Denver. The city likes to claim that they are responsible for the tiny home village, but this is not true.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We have literally been pushing for three years to allow them to allow a space for a tiny home village that I would like to ask for. The record has to move every six months. So this area in question is exactly in that area.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And for the past two years, at least, the areas it's been going to rap rampant and gentrification rapid development for those that are not. Natives, but out of towners and business developers, this city seems to value commerce over humanity.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we are here to let you know that we are not letting up on this. This has to stop. This is not a solution. This is literally putting a Band-Aid on an already existing issue. These developments are not anywhere close to affordable.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There is no talk about attainable housing in any of this. All I keep hearing is affordable this, affordable this and affordable that. Affordable for who? It's definitely not affordable to the second, third, fourth and fifth generations of native to have already spoken tonight.'",

And then the the the the heights steps down, respecting the lower density neighborhoods around us.'",

        "'speaker_11': 'The majority of people who are displaced from their neighborhoods leave for one of two reasons either because they cannot have access to services that they need, such as good schools, shopping, transportation, or because they can no longer afford the housing in the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'This proposal seeks to address both of those issues first, by providing greater supply to market rate, to bring market rate housing into line, and to by incentivizing actual affordable housing for people who can't afford market rate housing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And three, by incentivizing mixed.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'This list not address the council and your time is up?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, you just have to thank you. Give it to me. It's too much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Time's up. Thank you, sir.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So thank you very much. And have a good evening.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mark Marshall, you're up.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Council President Bert Brooks. Council. My name is Mark Marshall. I am the director of real estate at the Urban Land Conservancy. We are a nonprofit group that provides affordable housing, office space. Schools and commercial are community space. With the acquisitions of land that we purchased.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm here tonight to provide our to give our conditional support for these bills tonight. The as a land owner, we have a 1.5 acre site immediately in front of the 38th and Blake Station. Our goal has always been twofold to maximize the density at this site and also to maximize the affordability.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We have a plan in place to meet both of those measures. We are partnering with one group, Commodity Community, our development group, to provide 65 units of permanently affordable housing on the Walnut Street portion of our site. And we are partnering with another group, Mcwhinney Development, to provide the density at this site with the market rate development'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that they will be bringing in. The idea of density has always been at the forefront for for us. Long before this conversation and the Hyde Amendment started, we were in support and we were looking at ways to get higher density at the site.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We recognized the need and support the need to have a robust ridership for a expanding rail station. So we are fully in support of the Hyde Amendment. On the affordability, there are a couple of issues that we have concern with.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'At the time that these conversations first came about, we drafted a letter to Mr. Buchanan Brad and then head of OED Paul Washington. In this letter, we requested that 25% of the A of the development that happens in the up zoning be affordable right now as it is, there's 10% of affordability in this up zoned area.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So for instance this eight stories gets another eight that eight that eight story increase gets 10% affordability which results in 5% of affordability for the entire building. By increasing the affordability to 25%, we get close to 12 and a half to ten, 12 and a half percent affordability for the for the building.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The other issue that I want to talk about tonight is permanent permanent affordability. Right now, as I understand it, there is a 20 year requirement for affordability in the in the properties in the units that are being developed.'",
        "'speaker_2': '20 years goes by quickly at the rate that it's going right now. You see the property that we own with you will be the last remaining site with permanency of permanently affordability after this 20 years burns out because in order to reach this affordability, you've got to have the lower land basis.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we are one of the few groups that have that in time.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Your time is up. Thank you. Thank you, counsel. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Vanessa Quintana.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It's Quintana. If you interact with your residents, you would know that. So, Vanessa Quintana I was from the east side until your lovely friends here gentrified and made it unaffordable. Since your friend over here. I think his name.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Can you speak.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To the substance of the. Of what we have in Ferguson?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'He was an expert. So I'm going to say I'm an expert. I grew up in poverty, concentrated poverty, because I was the east side, formerly no are now known as Rhino.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'And I have experience of poverty.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'This project here is not affordable. Affordable, affordable to who? Because it is in my people who is being displaced. It's not my people who cannot live in this city. It's not my people who's who's been here for decades.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Let me get back to the script, because these people are pissing me off. This project gives an illusion that it is a solution to the housing crisis all Democrats are experiencing, including myself. However, this is not a solution proposing.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'This is not a solution. It is proposing it. Proposing a development project to offer residents relief with affordable housing. This is a mere, merely a gift to your campaign financiers, the developers. To further gentrify my community, the neighborhood I grew up in but cannot afford to live in.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The project only requires 10% of affordable housing units. Remember, let's put that in quotes. Affordable because that's 80% AMI. And that's not affordable. 10%, literally. Are you serious? 10%. What does that do? Drop in the bucket. Oh, boy.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Over there said oh. Every unit is is appreciated. It. No, it's not. Because that does not go to my community. Let's get to the real problem. Furthermore, the project defines affordable as 80% of the annual median income, according to the Colorado Fiscal Institute, the Army.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'This is back in 2015 is 56,258. Who the hell? Okay, let's get to that point. 80% of that is 45,000. So your project is proposing to support those with the 45,000 annual income. What about those who are on fixed income?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Who? What about everybody else who's been here, living here? Not for those folks who are coming in. Not for the transplants, not for their offspring, not for the recent graduates. No, no. We need it. We need housing for the people right now.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So. So according to the to this to the report that I read, that means your project will be will will cost 1200 or 1400. Who could afford that? Mr. Councilman Brooks, have you forgot about your families that are being displaced in your district?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Have you forgot about the families living below the poverty poverty threshold? Because I know I can't. My mom lives on a fixed income. She lives on disability. She's dependent on that. In case you all forgot what affordable is.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That is $700. Tell me. I mean, I don't know if you know math that well, but who could afford that apartment with 700 bucks a month? Who could afford to live in this city? The city they call home.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The city they were born and raised in was $700. Nobody can. Then that's a goddamn shame. None of you guys are doing anything about my bad. There are a couple of you guys who are, but most of you guys aren't.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'How could anybody live with that? Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Your time. Your time is up, right?'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Thank you. You're lucky.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Appreciate it.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I want subsidized housing for low income families.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Appreciate it. Okay, Justin Kroft, you're up.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Good evening, members of council. My name is Justin Croft. I am the chair of the Rhino Business Improvement District. I also sit on the Reinhardt District Board and I served on the steering.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Committee for both the.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Affordability and the design components.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Of.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'This bill in front of you tonight. I'm here to support this bill with reservations on the design component. I think that that piece.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Is.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Critical. Rhino worked on it for a long time. The focus of the design component.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Really is in the form of.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Buildings. We intentionally tried to not get caught up in necessarily finishes and sort of demonstrations of buildings because those don't necessarily affect how the project lives day to day. You'll notice that what's in there is things more about flexibility for buildings over time, how buildings interact with the street.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'One of the key components is having a front door on apartment units that face buildings so that people actually are interacting with the neighborhood around them and not just driving in and kind of entering.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Into more of a dormitory.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Style development. It also allows for creative expression and design in the way that buildings are designed and doesn't overburden that that aspect of the regulation. On the affordability piece.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We've been working on this for.'",
        "'speaker_13': '2 to 3 years and here we are.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Two years later.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And I wonder.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If there's maybe something a little more that we could have done.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'That said, I am in support of this bill. I think it's.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's a it's a tool. It's a small tool.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Towards what we're experiencing in Denver. But displacement has reached a fever pitch in the past three years. And I'm concerned that this small tool could be ultimately a distraction from the size of the disparity that currently exists between wages and housing and the attendant size of the solutions that are ultimately going to be required.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So again, I support this tool, but I would really encourage you to look towards the next set of tools. What we are experiencing is basically becoming a public crisis, and there needs to be a sweeping commitment to solving that and addressing that for Denver to keep it.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So a couple of things that I want to call out specific to this bill. The community serving businesses component of it, which I think is really interesting, you'll notice, is not specifically defined or particularly defined so far. I would ask that there be exploration of a tool similar to small business enterprise designations, which I suspect Dynamic Development'",
        "'speaker_13': 'currently has, that businesses, nonprofits, etc. could sign up.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'For.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'That designation. And that way a developer can go to a pre vetted list.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And basically.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Figure out what organizations could move in and ultimately meet that requirement. Otherwise, I fear that this will not be used by anyone because at this point it's a little too nebulous. So to the degree that the city can vet out organizations, that will really be assets, the need to stay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In the community.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'I would support that. I also think that, as you've heard tonight, the linkage fee for those who buy out of this needs to be spent.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Within.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'This area. Right now, if you have the units going into another building, they have to be within the station area. The linkage fee, I don't believe, is currently held to that restriction.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I would encourage you to look at.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'That as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Cross. Andy, since.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. My name is Andy Sense. I'm a resident of Denver. I'm neither a bid nor a jet. I'm actually just a school teacher. And because of honestly, because of a recent life change, I'm somebody who's probably looking for housing soon.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I'm desperate for us to say yes to all housing and not say no to it. Some folks seem to want a very tight and specific filter on the kinds of housing that we say yes to and when we say yes to it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And many of the objections that I've seen, probably mostly on the Internet, are from people who are usually and rightly bemoaning our housing shortage and and the price tag that goes along with housing. And yet, you know, those same people right now for some reason are asking you to say no to this housing opportunity, and we can't'",
        "'speaker_2': 'do that. The good thing is you already have a filter for saying yes to this housing. You've already voted unanimously on a filter that you've said was good, the filter of the 38th and Blake Street Station neighborhood plan.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You've all said yes to that. And that plan, and for my understanding, requires this running rezoning or reunification to go forward. I think. Right. We obviously have to do way more for affordable housing and nobody's up here trying to claim that this is somehow going to solve the affordability problem.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Why this has to be an either or argument escapes me. I think we have to say yes to housing at all price points and also work for a much bigger, affordable housing fund. Housing shortages have never disenfranchized wealthy people because wealthy people have the means to find it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And nobody ever beat gentrification by saying no to housing. When there's a shortage of market rate housing, people with means displace people with fewer financial resources. And the fact that developers are building market rate housing right now and filling it up means there are folks buying it who would otherwise be displacing more people.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So let's definitely keep our eyes on the prize and work towards increasing the affordable housing fund by at least $110 million, like all in Denver is asking for. And also say yes to this. This is the housing opportunity that's before us today.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And here's why you should say yes to it. This housing opportunity creates the city's first ever incentive to create an affordable housing, to create affordable housing in a mixed income format. The guidelines for this housing opportunity were arrived at after a two year community process.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This housing opportunity is in line with the adjacent neighborhood plans and is reflective of the goals suggested by the new Denver housing plan and blueprint. Denver. This housing opportunity comes with an embedded design overlay which will enforce a higher quality built environment and improve the pedestrian experience.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This housing opportunity supports transit by increasing density. This housing opportunity incentivizes more housing, which all of us desperately need. We can't afford to say no to housing, and we also can't afford to have thoughtful, community derived plans like these get derailed by folks with political axes to grind.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mr.. Since your time is up.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Please. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right, we're going to call the next five. Mr. Kraft, you can head back to your seat. Ryan Tobin to bed. Lock. Frank Lock and tour. John Dwight and Joel Noble.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Mr. President, members of council. My name is Ryan Tobin. I'm a resident of 2515 Lawrence Street in the District and also a commercial land owner in and around the light rail station. My work is involved around developing affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I've been a member of the stakeholder group, the resident group, and attended almost all of the meetings as time permitted. And trust me, there were a lot of meetings collectively. Getting everybody's thoughts around this topic is obviously, as we've seen from tonight.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Challenging, but also rewarding. And what I can tell you through the process is that not only did CPD staff do well at presenting the material, discussing the issues, but making themselves available for comment and consideration through the development of the plan.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Hats off to you, Mr. Brooks, for continuing down this journey and actually listening to those of us in and around the neighborhood and seeing the change that's around that. I'm encouraged by the proposed zoning and the overlays. I think that it will create an opportunity that we can create a minimum affordable housing to the percentages that are'",
        "'speaker_12': 'out there. But oftentimes what's not discussed is what opportunities may be created for those that choose not to build affordable housing. So we all know that that is a very challenging industry to bring the financing together. But long term preservation of that particular topic is something that I'm set out to do and certainly through property with an'",
        "'speaker_12': 'incentive to build higher in around TOD. It's a whole nother discussion about taking advantage of the system and the empowerment that we can do to those residents that do have lower incomes around the light rail stations. But nonetheless, I think that there are a lot of tools in the zoning.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'The tools are what give developers like myself the ability to solve the problems, at least make an attempt at dealing with challenging issues, but then also bringing that in the context of how we'd like to see the city shape and form through its built context.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And so I just wanted to come here today, obviously, and support the bill and hear what everybody else has to say so that as we continue this path, this is just the first step. We're not going to see housing overnight as a result of this.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I mean, they're still two years down the road before you're seeing these products come to light. And so the vision is an early vision. But with those here, I think in support of this, you'll see that that vision right down through the community businesses that we support will turn this into a vibrant neighborhood, and it'll be a'",
        "'speaker_12': 'successful neighborhood at that, benefiting all incomes throughout the city in county, Denver.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thanks. Thank you, Mr. Tobin. Tie a bit to you.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Well, hello, everybody. My name is Taya and my husband John and I own Eric Motorsports. We've been in the neighborhood for over 20 years and we were actually the first retail business in Reno. And I also live in the Whittier neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I've been there for ten years and I employ about 25 people at my dealership and oh, I'd say probably about ten years ago, three or four of my employees could no longer afford to live in the neighborhood, and they had to move out, which meant that they were living in suburbs surrounding Denver and they were driving 20'",
        "'speaker_9': 'or 30 minutes into work and they really wanted to be back in the neighborhood, but they couldn't afford it. So when I look at a proposal like this, I say, Woo hoo, go city council, because this will bring my employees back to Reno.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And it's going to also give people an opportunity to live around a transit station that helps alleviate the need for the upkeep of a vehicle and allows for things like motorcycles and greener transportation, like Vespas and bicycles. I mean, I'm all for this plan, and I believe that by providing affordable housing, we are giving developers the chance'",
        "'speaker_9': 'to be true partners in our neighborhood and set a precedent that I can only hope becomes the standard going forward in our fast growing and quickly evolving city. And I realize that some people in this room don't think that this bill is perfect, but unfortunately, there is nothing that is perfect.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I think that daily Reno becomes a more vibrant, safe neighborhood, an example of how an industrial neighborhood can involve to can evolve and to be able to house people and create jobs. And that's what I think this overlay brings to Reno, and I'm really excited about it.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Mr. Bill Duck. Frank likened to.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Good evening. Thank you. Council President Brooks and good evening, council members. My name is Frank looking for I live in City Park West and I. Am a huge supporter of affordable housing. We need more. We need a heck of a lot more.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And there's no two ways about it. And you all know that, and you're all doing things to help on that. You've done things in the past, and I'm sure you're going to do things in the future that are that is going to increase the affordable housing situation.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I am reminded of when I first moved here, yes, I'm a transplant, and I don't think that that makes me evil. I looked at I lived in a number of different places and I chose Colorado and Colorado and Denver are an awesome place.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And me and my friends who are natives here and I saw them living in two separate apartments, got married, moved into one apartment that freed up an apartment. Then they had a couple of kids and now one of those kids is away to college.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Another one is about to go away to college. Pretty soon those two kids are going to be done with college. You're going to move back and they're going to need their own places. Those natives of Colorado propagated and there's nothing wrong with that.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And but now that is.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Causing more of a need for housing.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'In Colorado. So regardless of evil folks like me moving into the state, there are people that are natives of the state that are also requiring more housing, too. And that's why we need to do something. And so I appreciate the efforts.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And yes, is is it enough? No, it's not enough. Of course it's not enough. Are you going to be doing something after this? I really hope that you are. And I have a lot of confidence that you are.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Is this a development around a rail station that can give people the opportunity to not.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Have a car if they don't want one?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Yes, it's it's able to do that. So I am.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In support of this.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'But just like everybody else, it's not enough. It needs to be more. And I really encourage you to be doing more as quickly as possible, to be helping to make the prices be more affordable. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. This is like a tour and.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'A good job. John. Dwight.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening, council members and Council President Brooks. My name is John Dwight. Living at 2100 Gainey Street. I'm speaking tonight in favor of the bills sitting in front of you. We own or control over 140,000 square feet of land in Reno.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'All within about three or four blocks of the train station or less. It's a pretty exciting night to be here and watch this process over the past two years. An ordinance of this magnitude is daunting. It's a daunting undertaking for everybody involved.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But the results of the bills in front of you are impressive. I want to start by thanking the officers of the community planning, economic development, the Ryan Arts District and their boards, all the committees, the business owners, and most importantly, the residents of Rhino in the surrounding neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Dealing with growth is never easy, but it's a reality. It requires making tough decisions. And the city of Denver isn't the only city across this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Country that's dealing with it. It's most places.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Nobody's ever going to be perfectly happy. It's hard.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'I see great progress.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And great innovation moving forward. I'm going to encourage you to vote yes on these bills in front of you tonight. But with any new ordinance of this magnitude, there's still lots of work to be done. As I mentioned earlier.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Our properties, we're focused on residential for sale product and that's one of our main goals. And we hope to build residences that people own and living in this community. It's not an easy environment to build. For sale residential today, there's all kinds of strikes against us just right out of the gate.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'With the passing of HB 1279 last year, it was a good start. But there's still a long ways to go and there's a lot of.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'To continue the work on the underlying regulations for affordable housing. As Miss Hayes stated earlier tonight, I think there's an opportunity to provide more 35% AMI versus 80% AMI, but it's going to take some work.

        "'speaker_3': 'past number of years in this in this city, in the Rhino neighborhood, I think is one of the first communities to really leverage the train. It can connect anybody throughout this entire city with a public transportation system. Thank you very much for all your hard work.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. DeWitt. We have three more folks. Oh, you know what? Before you go, John Noble I'm just going to invite up an Elizabeth and Keith Prior. And Joel Noble. You'll be next. This is the last three.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'The ludie committee is something they said couldn't be done for ten years, was do incentives get some value capture? Say, we want something that we can't get any other way, like requiring affordable rental as well as for sale, requiring affordable commercial, provided it's in the context of an incentive that could be opted into.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You probably want to build these additional floors. You have to give back. I believe that this package together squarely meets the community's vision, and I appreciate if you would vote for it. There are a lot of people here said a lot of things.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I've got 20 seconds left and can't address all of them. But this leaves us with a new tool, an incentive overlay tool that can be then used in other places, either in a similar way or in a different way, a different incentive, a different thing that you get back for what you be giving.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that's going to be a lasting value. Thank you, Mr. Noble. All right. And Elizabeth.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Forgive me if I start coughing, I'm going to step away and that'll be it. It's just the way it is. I mean, Elizabeth is 50th from Washington in Globeville. I am here neither supporting nor opposing this, having been in a immersed participant in the public process.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's been described it was very, very rigorous, did have a great deal of involvement, did come on the in within the framework of the neighborhood planning process. It's been incremental. There's a couple of things I want to speak to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The reason I'm neither for nor against it is because I'm for the vigilance that I think has got to continue and get very specific to bring about through implementation on a much shorter timeline. The enrichments and the empowerments, which are words I prefer rather than benefits directly to people in real time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I am a big be here now person. If I was, I was relieved at the setbacks that came so that we could keep this guy. I also said, look at the reflective buildings downtown that preserve the sky. Even in conversation with you on the buildings.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think we need to be vigilant with design. But more than that, we need to declare that we want to have employers that come in to transit oriented development areas that are committed to hiring in specific zip codes like 80216.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'When I hear multi-generational families say, we have been here for many generations and we cannot afford to stay here, I cannot make a transit oriented development responsible for that. But I can say what are the generations of education, workforce development and the creation of a level playing field doing to remedy that?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And how are we breaking that cycle? We have an individual in Mr. Feinstein whose family has been here for generations prior to the formation of the city, who I have known to do some remarkable things to help folks in not not help, help, but to to to try to imagine and envision things that create some parity.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And there are contradictions in the mass of resources that individuals have available. At the same time, I hear people that are have been here for generations and say, we need to stop these things. We need to not have this type of affordable because this type of affordable isn't accessible to us.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I'm saying, how can we break that cycle? There's something wrong. And why does it break such that the black and the brown are constantly us that are saying that they are the ones that are the multi-generational people that cannot access all of the benefits.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's institutional racism through neglect. And we have to recognize that I am a person who needs work, live situation. I don't see that in this development and I'd just like to end on that. Me personally and I'm speaking personally, I have not been able to get across the threshold to have something for myself to afford.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I was Elizabeth at the work live. Ms.. Elizabeth Elevator. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Your time is up. Thank you. All right, Keith Prior.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Very well, said Keith Pryor, 2418 champ, a street fifth generation Coloradan, been in the Five Points neighborhood for 24 years. You know, you've heard obviously everyone needs to do better. And I'd like to commend Ms.. Black, because she's trying to get density in a very district that is pushing back immensely in your district for this type of'",
        "'speaker_3': 'development that is so desperately needed throughout the entire city. Mr. BROOKS, you're awesome. Thank you for all your hard work in ushering this through all of the public processes that have gone on. I've attended I have a property that's adjacent to this zone district at 3361 Lawrence Street, and I'm in for it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm very much in favor of it. Is it far enough now? Can it do more? Yes. Five points. Fine. District nine has the most affordable housing in the city. What are your rest of your districts doing for affordable housing?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We're actually going forward and pushing the envelope further by having this piece on your desk for approval tonight to increase our affordable housing. Even though we have the most in the city, we want more. And so you need to go back to your communities and say, well, why can't we be like District nine?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Why can't we start picking up our pieces and actually start doing our part? Having density because without the density and getting rid of the corridors of crap, five storey buildings along Federal Boulevard, along Alameda, along Evans would really go far to solve our housing crisis because what it comes down to is supply and demand.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You can have only so many houses currently built. If you look at East Wash Park in the number of houses that were decimated there, Cherry Creek, North Hilltop. All of those were affordable housing. Those neighborhoods went through gentrification, but not a single person says the word gentrification for those neighborhoods, even though they were demolished and decimated.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Here you're looking at Rhino, which is an industrial zone. For the most part, there are some single family residential homes on the outskirts. And you're actually increasing the density. You're actually creating housing stock that was not there to help solve these problems.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But yet we have these situations all over the city where we have low density uses that aren't solving our problems. And so this particular piece of legislation addresses a lot of the concerns that you've heard from people talking about displacement, talking about the lack of design that's in our city that's currently getting built, and how everyone is'",
        "'speaker_3': 'really, really lamenting how ugly our city starting to look. This is all in this bill. So everything that these people had said, they're actually saying, well, this is taking a step. Is it a step far enough? No. Can it go further?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. But you have to take that step. This step allows you to go back to your constituents and sit there and say this may be a tool that we can use. It's a tool in the toolbox. You need to start somewhere.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Please support this. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Pryor. Okay. I said it was three more folks. We have one last person. Armando Payan.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I mean, they need those, which is great. Yes. Yes. And I'd like to think that you can vote. I am the president of that. We didn't get a vote, a full board vote in supporting this bill. But however, I did did participate on the committees and have the wonderful opportunity to be a part of that process.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But what I like to talk about here and like to focus in on is the community benefits agreement, which Mayor Hancock already has one in place through the National Western Stock Citizens Advisory Committee. From my perspective, I think what is needed here is that community benefits agreement needs to go further, further than the affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I'll give you an example. What happened was that I met with the president of Renault, Jamie Local, and I asked him, Can you help us out with garden plates, elementary school? Her response was, no, it wasn't part of their their goals, which is fine, you know.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But let me tell you about Garden Place Elementary School real quick. He grew to 16 is the most polluted zip code in America. These kids go to school to get to die. The high level of benzene. And I can share this report with counsel council here.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But my point is, we need to focus in on that community agreement so we can get those fees, get those services to those public institutions, the rec centers, get environmental policy out there to help combat the eight or to 16, turn that label that stigmatism around to make it one of the best and brightest in the country'",
        "'speaker_1': '. And I'd like to leave with what I think, what I think and what I believe. What we need here in City County, Denver, in the state of Colorado, is we need smart students. We need smart schools. We need smart communities, smart neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And with that, I'll leave you all to this rally together and put something together. And let's focus in on building things on a positive note instead of being negative. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Mr. Page. And thank you, everyone who's able to stay and pay for parking, come through security and sit in these hard benches. Really appreciate it. Okay. Questions by members of council. We'll start off with Dr. Sussman.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Turn your might go.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Turn this on. Thanks, everybody, for staying a long time and for being so passionate about what you care about and for giving us your questions and concerns. Abe, I have some questions coming at you. Right? Coming at you.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It seems like there was some misunderstanding about the Army plans for this facility. 80% is the highest right rate.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So right now in the citywide linkage fee system, if you're building units in lieu of paying the fee, the requirement is that they be affordable to residents at 80% AMI or lower.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Which makes the payment in lieu of as high a higher. But they could build affordable units at 20%. Am I right?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Yes. And in that case, there would likely be other programs available to help them put together that deal that that goes the extra mile.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So 80% isn't a isn't the number. It can be anywhere 80% or less right now, 20% of AMI, I think about it and am I for a single person is about 40 to $43000. So 20% of an am I would be a home that would cost somewhere between eight and $9,000 a year.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'For 20%.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'For 20%.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Ami Laura, if you're nearby, you may come closer just for the specific questions about AMI. So you're asking if.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'If there's a.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Home like.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'My what the rent would.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Or what the if you were doing a for sale is kind of what I'm thinking of if it's if your income is about $43,000, 20% of that is about eight or $9,000. Right.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Okay. So you're asking about the for sale price at 80% AMI at 20%.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'AMI, it might not been clear.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The minimum sales price.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Then the minimum.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Value.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Right? So the maximum sales price for a home that's attainable to a resident earning 80%. Ami.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Do you have a general ballpark there?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yeah, but he's giving me 20%. He's giving me 80%.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'You want it at 20, 20%, AMI?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I have 30% and I can do the calculation. Okay, do 30. 30 is fine. 30%. Ami for a one person household, that household would be earning $17,650. Right. And the price of what would be affordable, let's assume it's a one bedroom for that one person household.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The price that would be affordable for a renter would be $472 a month. Okay. Thank you very much. I just wanted to make that clear to folks that it's not 80% AMI for every single facility. It could be much lower as you go through.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The second thing that I heard that I hadn't heard at committee, so it made me it made me a little curious is you said that we had not decided on how long the of how long they would be affordable.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I listened carefully to Mr. Marshall's testimony, and he said that it was 20, 20 years affordable. Is that a a constant for all of the affordable houses, or is it variable by location, size, everything? Can you tell me a little bit more about that?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I didn't realize that the affordability was not going to be permanent. So the affordability length is outlined in the rules and regulations for the linkage fee and a minimum of 20 years. Certainly anything above that is encouraged, but the minimum is 20 years.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Who sets it? Who sets rules and regulations for the linkage fee, which is approved by OED and CPD? Okay. That's a that was interesting information that I didn't realize before, but we have at least 20 years and a potential for permanency.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'If the OED made that. Made the decision. So certainly any developer building underneath the overlay as well as the linkage fee could select to build that longer than 20 years. As far as what that minimum threshold is set at, our next stage in implementation is to look at our rules and regulations so I can take that feedback'",
        "'speaker_8': 'back to our team about what that 20 years looks like. Okay. I appreciate that very much. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Dr. Sussman. Councilman Espinosa.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yeah, just on that. I mean, there was nothing in the incentive that prevented us from making that permanent, affordable housing. I mean, that is the whole reason behind the incentive is it's elective. Councilman, is that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Correct? Is that a is that a question talk for.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Laura or is there anything preventing us from having put in a permanent or a longer term requirement than the 20 years in the incentive portion?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'I'll start and then turn it over to Laura. So the first part of the answer is, I think no, it would have been possible to set the requirement differently. We went, however, with the existing citywide rules and regulations for the current system in operation and as to why one might not want to require permanent affordability.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Laura Are you willing to take that on?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well, I guess I'll just take back the feedback that we've heard tonight and from council about the desire to see longer than 20 year affordability for this overlay to our next step in the process, which is the rulemaking.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'This ordinance does explicitly allow us to promulgate rules for the incentive overlay. So I will take that feedback back.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So, you know, as the as the sponsor of the bill, what I'll say is what we did was we mirrored the linkage fee with advice from our legal team that since we just passed this in 2016, we can mirror exactly the rules and regulations from the link tree.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That does not mean that we can't ever change it or anything, but we wanted to keep that consistency.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Except for on the actual fee. I mean we deviated specifically on the fee, did we not.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But then we didn't on unit size makeup or or a term.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. Unit size make.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'A decision, was it not?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So all of those are proposed currently to be consistent with the rules for the linkage fee.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yeah. And so when you hear people talk about how this doesn't go far enough, I think that's pretty much what they're talking about. We're not hitting deeper armies. We're not mandating deeper armies. We're not doing longer terms. We're not.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'You know.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So so let let me address comment. Let let me address that. Number one, this is in the rules and regulations. So what we're voting on tonight is the ordinance. As a matter of fact, we'll get into this a little later.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There are several issues regarding rules and regulations that we need to adjust, and we can do that within the next month or two months if that is the will of council to talk about this. It's a larger conversation for us.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We had several issues. We've been working on this for two years and there are several issues that you may feel, but it's a larger conversation. It's a citywide conversation. And so I just want folks on council, you know, as you start having these issues of certain things that you want to attack to say, can we begin to'",
        "'speaker_0': 'address this as you look at rules and regulation over the next two months?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yeah. And actually, that's actually the real genius of this, is the ability to use the sort of carve outs that are being created in other ways, in other places. You know, so this is sort of weird. It is a citywide thing, but it's this is also sort of simultaneously a very specific 30th and black rhino solution.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And so, I mean, I don't feel like we've had necessarily a citywide conversation, but I do think that we can use these tools in other locales. And I think that was by design, was it not? Yeah. Yeah. So I have a question for Joel first.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Sorry, and I'll just start. You know, you expressed the history going back to 2015 and stated that density was a condition for I mean, there was a during the community conversations, there was a density condition for required affordability.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Was that required affordability? 80%. I thought you said the affordability requirement was based on the existing H0 at the time, which would have been a 60 to 120%. Am I? So when you say above because you said above the the current requirements, do you mean that it was 121% or do you actually mean lower it by being'",
        "'speaker_11': 'above at 59 or below?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I really appreciate the opportunity to.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'To.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Respond and go a little deeper. The the community consensus that was reached and captured in the 38th and Blake Hite amendments basically came down to what's embodied here as the base heights and the incentive heights and saying to get these incentive heights that the community is comfortable with.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There were great SketchUp models showing views from different directions and discussions about, okay, those that density is okay. But we're seeing in this industrial area the the move out of artists and others that require affordable commercial space and affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we want to push back on that as hard as we can. There are a lot of frustrations with Joe that were attempted to be addressed in version two and then further addressed with the linkage fee, for instance, the ability to buy out that under the H0, almost every development that that would fit the fairly narrow parameters'",
        "'speaker_0': 'of the H0 bought out. But we wanted the affordability built and when the affordability was built using the money raised with the H0, it wasn't necessarily built in the community where the development happened. So what Watts expressed in the Hite amendment is we want to see the affordability built here and in exchange for the taller heights, we'",
        "'speaker_0': 'want to see a lot more of it. When that got calibrated in the past year, it got calibrated to this five times what the what the linkage fee is. So I don't think the community discussions, you know, around the table with a couple hundred people there got into exact I am army levels those.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sorts of things but we saw these.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Frustrations with the previous tools. It doesn't require it to get built here. So this does that. It doesn't require as much as we'd like to see. So if you take the incentive, you do more and it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Does for sale, for rent.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Housing, as well as commercial space. So this really nails a lot of a lot of things. It's probably not going to be perfect. It's probably going to have to be tweaked down the down the line. But it's a huge step forward.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. Thank you. Thank you. So do you have two questions for AIM? One is and sorry this didn't strike me earlier in multiple presentations we had on the mass reduction, but the master. Production, is it? It's based on the gross floor area of the ground floor or the zone lot?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'The zone lot.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. So and it is it is a it is a combined mass reduction. So I did the math and I stacked up all those different percentages. So if you built a two story base on your zone lot and then you did a 20% carve out all the way up, you would conform.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'The 13 to 16 storey portion of the building would need to have further mass reduction because the requirement there is 30%.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So. But no, but but you could. So that's where I'm getting. Can you extrapolate that on the mass, the gross mass of the building, the.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Mass reduction that's required has to happen within each of the required increments of the building. So you don't get credit for that for doing more lower. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. That's that's what I wanted to know. Okay. Now, that's sort of still my problem with the mass reduction is it's sort of weird like that. And then I will actually let some other colleagues. But I well, actually, you know, this is important for everyone to understand on the on the am I so questions for Laura why'",
        "'speaker_11': 'not make the incentive right now? We already said does anyone have the figures on what percentage of service workers live in households that are that are at a 80%? Am I?'",
        "'speaker_14': 'I have the race figures that I'm going to offer during my comments.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay, I'll wait for that. We've got the minimum for the cost for a 30%. What is the minimum cost for a home? An 80% single person household?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Sure. So an 80% and my one bedroom household would sell for $176,000. Well, that $176,328 to be very specific.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So. On the on your slides, you had a. A minimum on your bass residential slide. The one unit that had to be provided in the base was at 122. So a. Developer. But we have talked in the past that it takes $250,000 to build a housing unit.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I mean, so is a developer losing from 250 or gaining from. Well, and I'm confusing myself. Never mind.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman, can I jump to some others? We got a lot in the queue to come back to you. Yeah. Councilman.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilwoman Canete.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Thank you, Mr. President. My first couple of questions are for Laura, please. Laura, I wanted to see if you could share what are some typical occupations of people earning in. Because we keep talking about this 80% of am I like it's a generic number and we're talking about families and households.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'So let's just get a picture of who we're talking about.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Sure. So just as an example, for a two person household on the Army, for 80% is $53,700.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'It could be like a painter and a child.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Right. So that might include a kindergarten teacher, a school counselor or a chiropractor. As a couple examples of occupations that might be at that level.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Great. Thank you. And then we we were preparing the housing study. We looked at the number of folks who were cost burdened. And so can you share with me, are there folks right now earning? So let's let's use the full range.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'We got 47,000 for a family of one up to 50 something for a family of three parent. Two kids, two adults, one kid. Are there folks struggling with housing at that level in Denver right now, according to our research?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Sure. So our housing plan in draft form right now outlines the number of families who are cost burdened. So that means they're paying more than 30% of their income towards housing costs. More than 85,000 households across the city are currently cost burdened.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'And what about we also looked at severely cost burden, which means this family is spending more than half their income on housing. Are there some of those in this category?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'About 45,000 of those earning below 80% of the area. Median income are severely cost burdened, meaning they're paying more than 50% of their income.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Okay, that's really helpful. I wanted to ask a little bit about the research that you and Councilman Brooks. You can answer this question as well. So I feel like we heard loud and clear from community that there was a desire to have developers participating in the solution of affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'And so, you know, for ten years we had folks saying it couldn't be done. And I will admit, I didn't take the bull by the horns. So my colleague did. I didn't. But during that time, we. So you guys decided to take this bull by the horns and start to look at this.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'You did some looking at other cities. And I guess, you know, if you were to be able to on paper say, here's an ideal thing, I want 50% affordability and I wanted at 30% to be. What did we learn from other cities research in terms of, you know, when these things worked and when they didn't?'",
        "'speaker_14': 'I'm just curious if you can connect because other folks have tried some of this. So enlighten us.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. So they're they're basically two cities right now who are really taking advantage of this. And it's Seattle. And also we learned a lot in Brooklyn, but Portland is also trying something. And they just did a 20% mandate on affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And, you know, again, all of these are new policies. And I think starting to get the responses from these, it's a bit premature, but supply is drying up. On that, meaning that they're starting to feel like that is a bit too much ownership.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right. It's too much for one of the things we did. And Laura, you can talk about this as we did in a complete analysis of what this area could take financially. Economic analysis, same thing we did on the linkage fee.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we did find that this five times the amount was about the right amount for it to to break even and make money still on the project and get a project done. There's a lot of responses from individuals saying, let's do 20%, let's do 30%.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, if you make the requirement too onerous, like we're seeing a little bit in Portland right now, you don't get the project. And so we had to to get that balance just right. And and Laura, I don't know if you want to go into the analysis that we did from Seattle.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Sure. Well, I can at least speak to the feasibility analysis that was conducted as part of the proposal that you see in front of you tonight. Many of the folks in this room who have spoken to that proposal did participate in that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I want to thank them for that participation and that input throughout this process. But we use David Rosen Associates to conduct a feasibility analysis for this particular proposal. We used ten different scenarios in office and other commercial prototypes, as well as residential prototypes, to test the specific scenarios that you saw here today from five stories to'",
        "'speaker_8': '12 stories, from five stories to 16 stories. We found that seven out of ten of the prototypes that we tested came out feasible, even with the requirements that you see in front of you, which represents more than 80% of the land area in this overlay.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'If I may, just one more question and then I'll go back in the queue in case if my other stuff doesn't get answered. Ryan Tobin, can you come forward? So. I know that you're on the development side of the Denver Housing Authority, but I'm hoping you can pinch hit here.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'When we build a unit at 80% of median income. The rents, I think you said. What did you say our rent was 800. $900. Sorry. Okay. So. So there's that amount. The rent. Are the rents at this level?'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Eligible for vouchers? As in, could a person with a voucher go to a unit priced at this level and be able to afford it? Is that within the maximum rents that you all use vouchers on?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Sure. So a voucher is based on fair market rent. That's what's happening here. So these projects are valued at that fair market rent. So a voucher would apply.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'So many of our units in Denver are not at a fair market rent, so we get 20 $500 units downtown. A resident can't go there and use a voucher because their rents are too high.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'That's right.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'But these rents are within the range where you could use a voucher. That's right. So is it possible that we could that residents could layer a voucher into these units and then be at what what are your typical voucher holders incomes in the Denver Housing Authority?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'A voucher holder would make below 30%. Am I.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilman Kinney. Councilman, New Europe.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We asked Brad Buchanan to come up plus. I just want to talk a little bit about the vision for Rondo and what your what you see. How's Rondo going to look like in the next 20 years? What effect will this incentive ordinance have on that?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think there's two pieces to that. There's. What it's going to look like and what it's going to feel like and what they're they've been, you know, to a great extent, getting the what it's going to look like part.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Right. And I think the projects that are on the boards right now are some world class architecture that we're going to see over the next few years. The design overlay helps to ensure that everyone does that, not just the folks who care most for that and not just for the developers who choose to maybe spend a little'",
        "'speaker_3': 'more on design. This ensures that what might have been C plus projects can be a B plus or a minus projects. So there's that piece. But in terms of what it feels like, well, if we don't ensure that the population that the residents in in Reno, the artists that are in Reno are still able to afford to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'live there, then we've lost the heart and soul of what what created Rhino in the first place. And I believe this these amendments are a step towards ensuring that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay, so the density in haste doesn't bother you at all about the future of Rhino there in terms of gentrification or affordability.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So to to, I think our plans and and to me personally, I would say putting height and density around our transit stations is exactly what our plan says we should be doing. And in doing it in a in a way where we have this much community discussion and input and and effect in the result is exactly how'",
        "'speaker_3': 'we should be looking at not not everywhere in our city. This this solution isn't right for every stationary in the city, because our station areas all have different personalities, different neighborhoods with different desires. But this is the right solution for for this station area.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And the overlay will cover a majority of rider.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. So it's more than just the transit station is the really the rhino itself is whole character.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Right. Correct.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Thank you. As we look at the question, please. Similar question, Jamie, what do you what do you think it's going to look like in terms of uses? You know, we've given examples of commercial and residential work. What do you think Rhino, big, big or rhino is going to look like in terms of of that whole development'",
        "'speaker_6': 'along there as well as affect on the neighborhoods?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well, I think that based upon this and a lot of other things we are trying to do. I think I see a vibrant, mixed use, fully functional district activated, safe street level pedestrians, bikes, people of all types being able to live and work there.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I definitely see that we'll have artists spaces, community spaces. You know, I often talk when I'm asked about gentrification and what we're doing and what we want right now to be. I, I use the same phrase over and over and that I want there to be a place and a space for everybody who wants to be there'",
        "'speaker_8': '. The homeless population, the artists, people of all age ranges, families. And that's the type of place that we're trying to build.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Since you're so good in managing and so involved with running. What do you think that split of users is going to be between commercial, residential and retail? What do you think it's going to end up looking like?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Oh, you asked the tough questions. I mean, I think, you know, density and a vibrant residential population is what supports commercial and artists and other community uses. So I think. In terms of percentages. Hard question to answer, but I think that we need the density of people living there and working there.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I think what that also does is that help support a lot of great community benefits and assets that Reno can offer to the neighborhoods that we're a part of that are around us.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So be a great benefit to the neighborhoods as well.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'If we do it right. Yes. And if we continue to provide additional programs and services. Absolutely. Right.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Last question, Mr. President. Thank you, Laura. I got the old lady hand out of the scenario of the residential and commercial that we're going from, you know, 8 to 16 floors and, you know, just trying to calculate the number of units and just looking at that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And, you know, I was just calculated as saying that 85% of that square footage is usable and using 1200 square feet for a safer unit, there'd be about 340 units in that, according to my calculator there. Pull your calculator out.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I just want to make sure I have the right number.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So there's 480,000 square feet. I used 85% and divided by 1200 square feet as I got 340 units. Okay. And and so the I don't just want to compare the I do to the incentive plan and I like the incentive plan.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I didn't like the punitive nature of the idea. But I also would have required, what, 34 affordable units, right? 10%. Correct. Now, on the illustration that you've given you and you said that this incentive plan will be 24, so be tuned less about 30% less in affordable units.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I can certainly do some additional calculations, I think. I don't have the sheet that you might have in front of you, but I.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm okay. I'm reading. And but but the the buy out, you know, for the affordable housing was but say 25,000 per unit there, that's about 850,000 versus the buy out for this, which is you can't avoid the the linkage fee rate, but the buyer would be 1.6 million.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You know if you if you wanted to buy a. So there's much more money in terms of the buyout provision through the incentive plan you have less units is my my my valuation is that you have less units, less affordable units, but there'll be more money and that money is going to go into affordable housing construction in'",
        "'speaker_6': 'the city. Right.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So let me maybe just clarify on the residential developer who builds 480,000 square feet would have to provide those units. Sounds like that example is 24 units on site. I can certainly do some additional math to understand exactly what that number might be.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But the commercial.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Right. The residential developer is required to build the units on site or within the overlay area, but there is the option for the commercial developer to pay the fee.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. So so he would be buying in the bay out there is much more expensive than I mean in my calculation I would think. Just from the numbers I see, because as you do, 25,000 per year.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So sure, I can spend just a couple more minutes me back.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm just I'm just trying to understand it. You know, I see less affordable units, but I also see more bailout money, which is going to. And that money goes into affordable housing construction.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Right? Yes. So the uses of the fund are consistent with actually the property tax side of our dedicated fund, which is a little bit more flexible than the linkage fee side. Because if you remember from last fall, we had to conduct a extensive Nexis study to determine the linkage fee.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So the uses of this are flexible, but it is development, preservation and programs generally. But one other thing I wanted to just note, and I can do some calculations and come back, the the percentage of units in a residential development will be largely dependent on the size of the units that are built.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Since the issue was structured around a percentage of units, you came out with a specific number based on the overall market rate development at 10%. Since this approach, like the linkage fee is structured around square footage, it will always calculate the same number of required units.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Whether those units are 300 square feet or 1500 square feet, it will always result in the same number of units. So that's one differences. Depending on the size of the market rate units in the development, the percentage might fluctuate from seven 8% all the way up to ten, 11, 12%, depending on the size of the Mercury units'",
        "'speaker_6': '. I'm sorry, just last question, just to clarify, you only quite understand, like the H0 buyout, that money went into affordable housing construction, right?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So the Iho buyout fund was a closed loop fund where the requirement to pay a buyout came to the city. Right. And it also went out to pay rebates for developers who did build for round. They were right there were correct for sale or rental, affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'There were a couple of instances where we used it for developers as well.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The buyout for this plan, where where will that money go? Exactly the same as the H0 will be ended up going toward affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Somehow it will end up going towards affordable housing, but the uses are specific in the ordinance you have in front of you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So the advantage of the buyout here, it is still the money will go toward affordable housing, right?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman. New Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Would you mind coming up to the mike? I'm looking at the map that shows the geography. It's got the green and the blue on the map. You've got two different maps that show the green and the blue.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I'm trying to understand the total amount of acreage that we're looking at within this entire area that makes up the 30th and black overlay zone.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So in.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Your.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Staff report that includes the applications or proposals for the two MAP amendments which have the acreages of each. And I'm just to take a look at that here the. Math Amendment that's part of this public hearing is covers properties with an area of about 250 acres.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And the subsequent map amendment that you'll consider as the last item on the agenda today includes. Uh. Hang on one moment. I believe it's for a slightly smaller area of about 200 acres. So together it's more than 400 acres.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. So as part of this conversation. Was there ever any discussion about open space?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'There certainly was.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Is there a reason why it's not included?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Yes. So there was discussion, particularly on the design overlay side of the discussion, about whether a minimum amount of open space as part of private development should be required. I think in in the overall discussion, other items were prioritized more highly than that, although I will note that some of the requirements that are in the design overlay'",
        "'speaker_13': 'effectively do produce some open space. For example, the requirement that residential units at the street level be set back, create some space, and then also there's an incentive for open space built into the design overlay because that incremental mass reduction that Councilman Espinosa was just asking about, there is an alternative to provide that as what's defined as'",
        "'speaker_13': 'private open space in the code now, which basically is open space that's on private property that has to be publicly accessible. It has to have minimum dimensions. It has to be facing the street, it has to be at street level.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So we would expect to get some of that kind of open space through that incentive. But the conversation focused more on requirements for things other than open space like the the mass reduction.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you. I'd like to move on to a couple other questions on the length of time of the affordability. I wanted to ask Mark Marshall from ULC, if you wouldn't mind, coming forward. You own some land within this boundary.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Can you tell me if any of that land was purchased with any of the City Todd Fund that you all were a catalyst in helping to secure the property or maintain it until it's developed on?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, that's correct. We use the Todd Deep Fund to purchase the land. We repaid the Todd Fund about a year and a half ago. So we've refinanced and paid back the Todd Fund, which is a. Fund. That is a recycling fund.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. And you all are part of the discussion about a community land trust. And we'll be getting a briefing on that, I think, this week in our committee. But it's it's my understanding that you will see exists to look at permanent affordability.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I mean, that is why you guys exist as an entity in helping to acquire sites that can then be utilized for affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's correct. Oh. At our Blake site with Medici, we have a 99 year lease to ensure affordability in perpetuity at this particular site.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. That was going to be my next question. So I'm glad to hear that. So even though the requirement is 20 years, your 99 year lease, how does that play into the 20 year requirement?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Because we own the ground lease on it. We've written into our contract requirements for the developer. If this developer decides to sell off this property after ten, 20 years, we have requirements within our contract that allow us to have some say in what happens in this in this development going into the future.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we ensure that this remains a community benefit in over that 99 years, which has a 99 year option after the end of the first 99 years.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So does that get filed as a covenant or is it just. It is in the contract.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's in the contract.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. All right. Thank you for that, Covenant. I have a couple other questions for different folks. So I wanted to talk about parking requirements. So if you're within a half mile, you don't have to do any parking, is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'That is correct. No vehicular parking requirement. Bicycle parking requirements would still apply.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. So how can we understand where that came from?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'That came from the community conversation around supporting the transit and also, as Council President Burks mentioned and others. It also relates to affordability in terms of potentially lowering construction costs for buildings that otherwise would have had to spend a considerable amount providing affordable housing or providing parking spaces.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'They have the opportunity to not do that and design projects that appeal primarily to users of the transit that could be offered at lower prices.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So did we have anybody on the committee that was from the lending community? Because sometimes the lenders require parking, even though the city zoning code might say, let me.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Let me just say just a couple of words real quick that may help with this. Although we say minimum parking requirements, it is the best practice. We've done this at Arapahoe Square as well. We're not saying maximum. We didn't get rid of the maximum.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So you can still build parking and most developers will build parking because they can't get, as you were alluding to, the lending. But we we've done this. I don't even know if I've said Arapahoe Square. I don't even know if there are any other areas that we've done this in wealth.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Downtown has not had minimum parking requirements for a very long time. Of course, you do still see production of quite a bit of new parking.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'At Cherry Creek as I was as Chair Creek as a 1 to 1 ratio, and they're building 1.7 to 1. So it's is market dictating parking? Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Well, part of the reason I'm raising this is because some of the new development that's gone in in the Reno area and specifically some of that that's along the Arkansas corridor, has parking all lined up on both sides of that street.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I'm not sure that it's because the units, the development did not include enough parking. But, you know, this is this is one of those catch 22. You know, on one hand, we'd like people to get out of their cars, but we don't have a transit system that provides adequate connectivity to encourage them to not need a'",
        "'speaker_10': 'car. Right. And until we get there, people are going to own their damn cars. And then what we're doing is we're exacerbating or parking in traffic challenges where we're creating more density, but yet we're not requiring enough parking.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And so I'm really concerned, just seeing what I have seen driving through this area just on the Arkansas court corridor. So so I'm just raising that as a concern. Let me move on to my next question, and I know you've got other folks in the queue.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I'd like to know if the Salvation Army and the taxi site are within the boundaries. Looking at the map, I can't quite tell. It looks like part of taxi is, but I'm not sure that's all of it.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'I believe all of taxi is within the boundaries, as is the Salvation Army site.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. Because I'm seeing a little parcel that is outside along where that all is between the blue and the green. And I wasn't sure if that was the Salvation Army site or not.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's all in there.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It is within the boundaries. Okay. And to the to the north of the taxi site, is that not where their new development is going in? The housing part. So if it is, then it looks like the only part of the taxi side is in is that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Not all of it is.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'In all of it too. Okay. I will defer my other questions. If you could put me back in the queue.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Ortega. Councilwoman Black.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Abe. Hi. Just some clarification. So. Currently. What is what is there in all these properties? Is it industrial? Is it housing? There's been a lot of conversation about people being displaced. If we start seeing development, there are people going to be displaced.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Yeah. I'm really glad you raised that point, Councilman Black. The the area that's proposed for the incentive overlay, which allows the greater heights around the station area, is primarily industrial and land use. Now, most of the residents who are in the area actually live in nearly brand new mixed use projects because this this is not previously been'",
        "'speaker_13': 'a neighborhood, the area that's within the overlay. It's immediately adjacent to of lower scale historic neighborhood but doesn't actually apply to that neighborhood or allow greater development in in that adjacent existing neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So to follow up on the comments. The guy with the beard. You know, there's a lot of bald guy.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Beard was.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Frank Lock and Frank Frink.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'He had a guy.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'He had a beard, and he was born.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'His his point was, we're creating new housing, so it's good to know we're not displacing people and any housing we create is is a good thing. So that was a very good point that he made. My other question just to clarify is.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'This is not a development plan. We don't have developers coming in who have plans. That's a question, do we?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We we do.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Have a number of conceptual plans that are in review right now in the development services side of our office for projects that plan to take advantage of the incentive height. None of them are within immediate sight of of approval.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'But I can say that, you know, if all of those projects were to move forward in their general conceptual framework that we see now, it would be around a thousand units of market rate residential and likely close to 100 affordable units alongside that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And again, how many acres were you were answering, Councilwoman Ortega? About how many acres is the whole area?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'It's a little less than 500 acres total, I think.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so do you have any idea of the projects that are under review? How many acres that would.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'I don't know. But I do know that they represent a relatively small proportion of the land area. So I think that even after that round of development, there could be another and then another that essentially the even though the area is very hot and there's a lot of development activity, that it will be a long time before'",
        "'speaker_13': 'the area is built out and we see the zoning maximized, if it ever is.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I was going to comment, but I'm not allowed to. I'm not going to. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Black, for restraining yourself, Councilman Cashman.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Yes, good. Good decision to stay there. That was that was great. So it appears to me doing the math on slide 17, where we went from a five story to a 12 story, 180,000 square feet.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It looks to me like we're ending up with about 10% affordable. Is that reasonable to use that as a ballpark with what we might expect to get.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'As a general ballpark? Most of the scenarios we've looked at would probably result in just under 10%. But I think it's important to remember that since the requirements are all based on a square footage formula, it can be a little frustrating to try to translate it into a percentage because it's not based on a percentage.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'It uses a formula that can be better applied to a variety of land uses because it applies to commercial as well.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Sure. Thank you. Laura, a couple of questions for you. What are how are the conditions, the economic conditions? Leading to affordable construction at this point. I mean, the tax situations and so on. How do we envision that over the next couple of years?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And are you referring to tax reform? More generally.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Just. Yeah, all that stuff.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Sure. So we've had some changes at the federal level, too, particularly the corporate tax rate and it going down to the twenties from the thirties. And we expect that will have some impact on the tax credit pricing for one of the biggest tools that we have to produce low and moderate income housing, which is the low income'",
        "'speaker_8': 'housing tax credits. And so both 9% low income housing tax credits and 4% low income housing tax credits. Have investors who are motivated to invest in those changes to the corporate tax rate certainly might affect what kind of pricing we see for those different low income housing tax credits moving forward.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So we're evaluating what that looks like from the cities get financing.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So at this point, can you say whether it's more favorable for those four and 9% credits or not as favorable or we don't know yet.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It's likely to be less favorable. Less. We will see how the market adjusts to this new corporate tax.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. And sorry to ask you to repeat, but can you give me the your numbers on housing burden?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Oh, yes. So it's about 85,000 households earning below 80% of the area, median income who are currently cost burdened and a little under 45,000 of those same households who are severely cost burden. So cost burden being paying more than 30% of their income towards housing costs and severely high cost burden being paying more than 50% of their'",
        "'speaker_8': 'income towards housing costs.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. Let me see if everything else was answered. Yeah. The rest of the comments. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Laura.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hey, thanks. Thank you. Councilman Cashman, Councilman Flynn, you up?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Yes. Thank you, Mr. President. Is there someone here who can address the 38th Street underpass? Because some of the community members who expressed support conditioned it on having concrete plans for improving that awful. Underpass.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh. You want to take it on a trip? I can. I can.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Take it on unless.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'We have somebody from public works here. And do you want to say anything?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I can just I can just take it on real quick and just let you know. There is there's no one here from.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Okay, from.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'From public hurts. Cause I think I need a car rental. Public works. But what I want to tell you, this has been a big issue in folks just specifically in the whole neighborhood, wanted it on the bond. It was not ready.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The scope of work was not ready yet.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I saw that in the staff report.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah but we are currently under a scope right now. Should be having how much it's going to cost. Mhm.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So is there a conceptual plan to widen it, to light it up.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There in the middle of that.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'They are. Yeah. Okay. And Abe, can you. And also, is Keith.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Pryor still here?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Yeah. I like to get a community view on this also. But how does this proposal address. The concerns in the community for. Addressing displacement, does it? Encourage displacement? Does it discourage it? Does it mitigate.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'How does it address it?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So I need to understand that.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'You know, I'd be interested in Keith's perspective from from the neighborhood side. The way that we would see it is that this incentive overlay specifically enables greater development potential, which sets the stage for more housing, which is certainly necessary in the city.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And as a few speakers mentioned, under general market conditions, the more housing that's provided at any house range, the more pressure it takes off of the housing market and in general. And then by also greatly upping the requirements for the affordable units that are set aside as part of new development, we get more affordable units.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'All of that is happening in an area, as Councilwoman Black mentioned, that is really not currently developed. So it's not happening within.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Residentially at least.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Right. It's developed with industrial, so it's not displacing residents. And what we'd ideally see is that some of the residents of the surrounding neighborhoods call, for example, would be able to qualify for some of the affordable units or will move into some of the market rate units that will open up housing in the neighborhood, which will take'",
        "'speaker_13': 'pressure off of it and open up that neighborhood as well.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Okay. Just to elaborate on that a little bit, the in the incentive overlay addresses the incentive to provide additional affordable units. Does the design overlay, which is broader and covers covers more area, does that have any impact in CPD's view on on displacement?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I would say it.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Doesn't have a specific impact on displacement, but it is designed to ensure that as the area redeveloped in this higher intensity development happens, that it remains pedestrian friendly and very active at the street level and so can perform as a neighborhood center for all types of people.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Mr. Prior, do you have anything to to add to that?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Um.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Abe did a really great job. You know, it is critical. I mean, as John Hayden said earlier, displacement generally occurs for a couple of main reasons. You know, either you don't have the services that you need in which to stay into your community or yes, there, there, there's just a lack of housing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so because of the lack of housing, your prices go up. And that causes you to, you know, evaluate. I think that there's a lot of things that it's a very complicated situation, you know, in talking about displacement, because, again, as as Abe has said and I think, you know, Ms..'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Black pointed out that this is an industrial area that's transforming. And you have single family homes and historic homes that are on the edges. And so, obviously, you know, you're displacing some industrial, light industrial, some vacant industrial buildings that maybe artists had had.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So, you know, there's going to be that. But I think that this plan obviously addresses that and tries to keep that available for their spaces to to exist. You know, but what it really comes down to is you've already put the main piece, which is light rail.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You've created the actual investment in this community by putting a light rail stop here. And so you've increased the service. And so I think one of the things that really is lost in talking about displacement and gentrification is are you really penalizing people of lower income by denying them services?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Do you not want them to have light rail? Do you not want them to have investment in their community which allows them to walk safely with a sidewalk that doesn't exist in a lot of parts of this area to a convenience or to a dentist, to a grocery store, to a convenience store, to a place of opportunity'",
        "'speaker_3': 'of employment. So now they're not reverse commuting or if they, like Jamie had mentioned earlier, to wear or I'm sorry, one of the business owners has said that their employees moved out of the area because they can no longer afford to work in right now.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Okay. Let me let me bring you back. Let me bring you back to Central. Let me bring it back to the central question, which is this this incentive overlay will mitigate, in your view, will mitigate displacement immensely. It will slow it down.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Slow it down.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Because I did look at the I did look at the the partial maps. And there are some single family homes still in the incentive area, in coal, on the edges of coal and on on the Allegheny Street. And I did look at the ownerships, and some of them are some of them are still owner occupied.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'They're not rentals, but there are few and far between, I guess I would say. But you think that's this will mitigate?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think it will mitigate it hugely because you you're adding a significant supply to the housing stock, which will will basically stabilize the area for further price increase.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'President, I had I want to bring up a couple other community members. Is Vanessa Quintana still here? Oh, she's right. You were over there before. And Mark Marshall, what is the impact on affordability and displacement, in your view, under the current under the current zoning that we have, if we did not pass this?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'What would happen, in your view, under the current zone? And as for Mark, you also under the current zoning, what would happen with displacement and affordability if we did not adopt this? Would it accelerate? Would it slow down?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Would we would we not see it or would we see it more?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So no one is taking into account all the factors that goes into it goes into this. No one is taking into account property taxes. No one is taking into account the increased cost of living with all of this development.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'When you bring these these these developments in looking at the natural grocers, how is that going to contribute to these people? All right. When you consider all of the development here, you are raising the cost of living for the people there.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'They keep on talking about the increased supply of housing for who, but it's not for us. What about the homeowners in the area? Who's going to care about the property when they increase the property taxes for them? Who's caring about the increase?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The cost of living? Of transportation. No one's talking about the cost of transportation for RTD. Let me know about this. Who could offset who could afford the bus pass now? Would that with a for a low income household for someone who is on a fixed income, no one is talking about this increases accessibility to transit.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. Could we talk about affordability of transit? Can we talk about affordability with these property taxes? Well, we clearly there's a clearly a gap of understanding on what it is to live in poverty. I suggest you all and they all take a do a field trip in the hood, in the neighborhood, and go ahead and try to'",
        "'speaker_8': 'live on my mom's income or somebody else's income. And you tell me how affordable it is for transit. Like they keep on saying try to buy groceries with that income. Try to go ahead and pay the rent. Try to go ahead and have a good a try to live the American dream with that.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So are you saying that for.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Both for renting and homeownership?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Are you saying that this this collection of ordinances would accelerate and make that worse?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yeah, that was the end of my speech. I couldn't get to that.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I'm glad I gave you the opportunity.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Thank you, Mr. Marshall. Kind of your thoughts on this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think it lifted.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Mike.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Under the current market forces, I think the affordability displacement would dramatically increase if continue displacement if not for this bill.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'If we do not pass, we do under the current markets.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If things take the same market conditions, conditions as they are now would continue. And it's pretty well documented the amount of displacement that's happening in this coal neighborhood. Five points neighborhood, gas neighborhood. It's very well documented the amount of displacement that has happened and it would continue to happen probably at a higher rate as than there is'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right now. I don't see a slowing down right now and in development in these areas.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I'm very I'm very familiar with your site at the 30th and Blake Station. Yes. And without this ordinance, what would your project look like versus with this with this package?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Without this ordinance, what we were we had two previous tax credit applications that were denied at our site. We have gotten the third when passed. Without this ordinance, we would probably what we were trying to do was trying to pencil out a development that would allow us to get higher density, but that wasn't happening because of construction'",
        "'speaker_2': 'cost. On going up from a Type five stick on top of a platform. Construction up to concrete, steel construction Type one construction being the most expensive, affordable rents don't support that type of construction. We would probably be at a development site that is still five stories on a platform, on a parking platform structure and getting probably still'",
        "'speaker_2': 'trying to maximize the affordability, but. Okay, but a lower density site.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'All right. Thank you. Thank you. Laura.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'One other thing I wanted to comment on your last question about the effect of gentrification and displacement in this this particular area at the station. We've opened up conversations, we've initiated a plan. And some of the development community that's here tonight attended a meeting that we had a few weeks ago.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We got financed by a JPMorgan Morgan Grant to look at a community impact study of what all of the development that's happening now that affect on the community. We decided we wanted to take a little bit more of an opportunistic viewpoint of it and say instead of having an impact study, how about we look at an equitable'",
        "'speaker_2': 'development plan? So we've opened up conversations in the development community has been very receptive. What we're trying to do is allow the residents who've been in this community and who've lived there to also participate in this prosperity that's happening and be a part of it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I heard a misquote of somebody, but I think it's appropriate, the term that they misquoted and they said gentrifying in place. We like to have the people who live in this neighborhood be able to rise with the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we are taking a look at the jobs that are being brought in with all the new developments. And we're looking at the commercial space that's being developed. We're trying to partner that with the community groups. We're looking at skills, individual skills, business resources across the community and trying to marry those two things together to make take'",
        "'speaker_2': 'best advantage of this 10% of commercial space that's been being developed. So we're looking at a plan, hopefully that's going to help to reduce some of the the displacement that's happening in the neighborhood and allow residents to participate in that.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Thank you, Mr. Marshall. I very much admire what you, Elsie, has been able to do in the community. Laura, I have one last question, Mr. President, for Laura. 80% am-I is the maximum. How did we pick 80%? I was intrigued when you said elementary school teacher, $53,000 a year.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'My daughter teaches elementary school. She's been teaching for ten years. She gets about 38,000. How do how is 80% picked?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So the number for 80% is outlined in the linkage fee rules and regulations, and 80% was originally selected as part of the development of the linkage fee because that was the highest allowable use of the linkage fee resources for investment.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And it was an appropriate amount to set the numbers that the units would be affordable at as well.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I think that's almost present.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. Councilman Lopez, you're up.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I think Councilman Flynn's last question got to my question that I've been having this whole process just waiting was how to re arrive at that percentage. Go ahead and just just continue on down the line.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I have other questions, but I'll just keep listening.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So back in the shoot. Councilman knew. Are you are you in the queue again? Okay, company.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Go ahead. Mr. Dwight, can you come up? You're developer and runner, correct?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes, sir.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The what would prevent you from, you know, buying out in this kind of incentive plan? I keep thinking about the age where all the developers bought out. They just didn't produce the affordable housing we thought, and we got the money going into affordable housing built somewhere else.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'BURWOOD What would prevent you from buying out on this kind of plan, if not for a commercial building, not residential?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, we're just doing residential, so I'm not as in tuned with the commercial side. So we don't have that option.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Well, I was just I was just doing a little calculation on just like one 1200 square foot apartment, you know, that that, you know, one. Well, he's part of a 1200 dollars a month. You know, these people are like, you know, 14,400 a year versus $20 a square foot for a commercial.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You know, they'll be like $24,000 a year. So that's $10,000 more, is there? Maybe I'm asking. Maybe I'd be the I should be asking Laura this question. So. Sure. Thank you. Thank you. Appreciate it. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Laura, what's what what is going to what is going to prevent the developer from on the commercial side from buying out? And are we going to be in the same situation with Asia, where we're not going to be producing affordable housing units because it's really more financially attractive to to buy out.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So as as John said, residential developers don't have the option to buy out. They must provide units. Commercial developers have the option to pay units or build or the option to pay the fee or build the units. We don't necessarily expect as many commercial developments to build the units because they're building commercial development.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So there aren't inherently residential units in their development. Certainly we do have the option for them to build units and they can be off site with a partner developer within the overlay area. So that's something that is possible and certainly something that we can work with developers to figure out.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Do you have some goals on how many affordable units you want to produce in Rondo? Do you have a say? If we're going to produce 50% residential development and Rondo, I mean, how many units will that be? Is there a goal that you'll be monitoring or are you going to be evaluating this as it goes along?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Is part of the rules and regulations going to be a semi annual or annual evaluation of what's happening?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Sure. That's a suggestion I can take back to the team. For what the ongoing evaluation of the implementation of this overlay looks like. The residential units will be, as we've discussed here, roughly six, 7% to 10% of the overall residential units will be affordable based on what we've outlined here.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The commercial developments that pay into the linkage fee will be invested consistent with our comprehensive, affordable housing plan. So we'll be evaluated in terms of the city wide goals outlined in that plan.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Thank you. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you. Back up to the list. Councilman Espinosa.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And I. Because you ll see was talking about it. I think it's important to get an answer on this sort of on record. What is the surrounding community, the sort of quote unquote surrounding community as used and then in sort of defined or intended in the incentive overlay?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So that term surrounding community is used to refer to the negotiation for a community benefits agreement as specified in the ordinance that the use that's part of the agreement must serve the surrounding community. I think the that could be interpreted dynamically, but I would say that it certainly means that it's the community where there is.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'It's the adjacent neighborhoods that demonstrate the need for a specific use that would not be provided by the market otherwise would be eligible to be included in the development and of course the the actual community serving use that's part of the agreement occurs within the overlay, but a developer could use demonstrated need in the surrounding neighborhoods to'",
        "'speaker_13': 'justify that inclusion.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Is there any reason why we wouldn't at least make a fairly clear definition that that cannot be a single developer or single development or a block of development, you know, that you couldn't just build a whole bunch of highrises and essentially say, that's my surrounding community.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And so that it's not it's clearly not self-serving.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'I think. Yeah. And especially as we review the the rules and regulations, there's an opportunity to clarify that. But that the example that you gave would certainly not be the intent to build a large development and then say that you are only meeting the needs of that development with your agreement.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'It's about the wider community.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But there isn't a current prohibition because there is no definition.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'It doesn't specifically say you can't do that.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Right. So that's more a message to OED. Not one building or one project. And then the other question, looking at the math, which I'll expound upon in my comments, prompts this question Do these rules favor small, inexpensive units to build and sell or build in rent?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I mean, and I can go into my math, but it's not a question. So. Did you do the math and does it seem to work out that way?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Yeah. I'll let Laura jump in if she'd like as well. But because the, you know, the square footage of small units is less than that, you know, using the formula then may generate a requirement for fewer units, but those units are all going to be essentially comparable to the to the market rate units.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And so I think in the end, the intent is that it balances out. Do you have any more to add, Laura?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay, great.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you, Councilman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I've got just a few more quick questions. The first one is for Abe. What is the length of time for the community benefits agreement? Is there was that defined?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'It is not specifically defined. The intent is to to mirror generally the way that agreements around affordable housing are done. And so that would mean looking at a at a minimum of around 20 years. But I think that that's something that could be evaluated on a case by case basis for an agreement, because something an agreement for'",
        "'speaker_13': 'a specific kind of use might make sense to commit in a longer term, an agreement for another use in a in a shorter term. The key to be looking at is that the agreement, however long it is and is providing subsidized rent.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'In a comparable way to the fee that would have been paid if the agreement weren't in the path that was taken.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So I think a great example of something like that is the commercial program on the taxi site where I believe they're offering a discounted rental rate to the nonprofit that is involved in running that. And so will this include looking at entrepreneurial opportunities?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So you've got a nonprofit that wants to have a coffee shop and they want to, you know, use it as a training program, hire people from the community. Is that an example of something that, you know, might be considered?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I know that means that. If the developer is looking to put in their own coffee shop in, that's not going to sell. Right. But, you know, that's an example of something where you're creating some greater value and sustainability to some of our local nonprofits by looking at social enterprises as part of how we do this.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'I'll let Jeff Romaine if if he jumps out of his seat, it means I'm saying the wrong thing. What I would say is you're right. You know, that's a tricky one, the coffee shop, because you wouldn't want a developer just saying, oh, I put in a coffee shop and the community loves that.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And therefore, you know, I shouldn't have to pay an incentive fee. But if they're really making an agreement about a coffee shop that has a workforce development program that's specifically aimed at the surrounding community, I would say that potentially is an opportunity for the agreement.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. I see him nodding his head.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Okay. He didn't jump. All right. That's good.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Let me move on to my next question. Brad, would you mind coming forward? I want to get back to this parking conversation just for a minute. I want to know if CPD has studied what percentage of of tenants that have gone into our new buildings that are building parking or were not requiring, you know, particularly near TOD'",
        "'speaker_10': 'sites where we're reducing the parking requirements. Have you looked at that? And if not, is that something that CPD is willing to study? Until we have that transit system that closes the loop on the first mile. Last mile.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I'm concerned that people are still going to use their cars, you know, whether they go into a micro unit or whether they go into, you know, a unit in in this area. Until we close that gap, we're I think we're going to be dealing with this challenge.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So is this something that you all have studied or are willing to study?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, this is what I know for sure. The projects citywide and particularly the projects specifically around 38th and Lake Station area and are over part. They are they are building to finance requirements. They are building to appraisal requirements, and we're building too much parking.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Look for.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Parking according to our requirements.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm way over our requirements and in I believe over the actual need. Arkansas court for example today and you drive that and I've driven that many, many times I know what you're talking about right now. The vast majority of that is construction, parking, not resident parking.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Those projects have got plenty of parking for their units. Now, I think there is another issue that we should look into, and that is are the are the apartments in that those cases apartments charging additional money for their parking.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So that, I think, will be very interesting to see how many of those parking spaces are actually occupied. I've seen that with for sale projects before where they're providing the amount of required parking or in excess of that, but they're selling them as an extra line of revenue.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So that that's that's a piece that we don't have control over. But we are we are absolutely building more parking than these projects need. And I don't think we're going to see that anytime soon. We are having conversations now about parking maximums, not in this area, but in another area of the area where, you know, to keep'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to try to keep the market in check so that we don't have the opposite of the problem. You're you're suggesting.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So let me let me move on to another question, and I just want to be clear in my mind as this bill moves through this process. Assuming the votes are here tonight to move this overlay forward, does this presume then that each development no longer has to come before city council because we're essentially up zoning and for'",
        "'speaker_10': '. The Development Review Design review. They simply deal with CPD and no longer come before council.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah. This this is a legislative rezoning, so you're correct. And use that term correctly. And are there specific rules on words legislative. But this is a legislative rezoning that's happening as this body has done many times. The largest one in 2010 will be remapped the entire city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But so this is a legislative rezoning and they would not come before this body unless they were asking for an up zoning beyond what this this amendment map amendment would accomplish.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'In the 2010 rezoning did essentially up zoned some of our areas within the city in terms of creating the opportunity for mixed use zoning that didn't that didn't apply before under the old zoning.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Primarily areas of change in and around transit stations. And this area was up, zoned, up, zoned then to meet the then current plan for this area. But this area in particular has seen substantial velocity and investment like nowhere else we've seen in the city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And that's why this has moved. So this you know, it has basically implemented its nine year old plan inside nine years. That's not a common occurrence. So we're now trying to capture some of this value, some of this velocity, while there's still substantial development to be done there.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So my last question for you, Brad. As as we look at the opportunity to address the impact to neighborhoods that are experiencing displacement. And I believe that public investment does attract more people to an area that has a result of displacement.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So have you all discussed and explored it? CPD and I'll ask the same to Jeff Tweedy about the city trying to get a waiver to create preference opportunities for people who have been displaced and want to stay in their neighborhood, who want to come back, or.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm not familiar with that specific tool being discussed, but Laura's as nodding yes, so I'm going to have to answer that. But I will say this, that in the Denver right conversation, our umbrella for the four plans, the reality that we we very clearly understand that public investment does can cause places to improve and progress and a'",
        "'speaker_3': 'negative impact can be mitigation. We are talking about, you know, understanding that both of these responsibilities come simultaneously through the Denver process. I'll let Laura speak to the specific. Are you done with me?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Yes, thank you, Laura. And I know you've dealt with this issue. You know, we've done some research on it as well. And I know it requires a a HUD approval, but is this something the city is looking at, sort of overarching LA with neighborhoods that are experiencing rapid displacement to.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We have included reference. Yeah. Sorry to cut you off. We have included as part of our five year draft housing plan, the exploration of a resident preference policy. This is a tool that some other cities like Portland in San Francisco are using to provide an opportunity in new housing developments for residents who have experience or at risk'",
        "'speaker_8': 'of displacement. We have also included this as a priority for our 2018 work.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you. I have no further questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you. I'm going to tell.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Someone one quick question. Brett, could you come out one last time? I just want to make sure I understood what Deb is questioning about of zoning. You know, on the map, we've got the heights at five and eight stories on the map.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And with the incentive allowing go to 12 and 16, when tonight we're not changing the zoning to 12 and 16. Right. It's the same heights that is now was just an incentive to do more. Right.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm going to be because I want to make sure we're very accurate in general. Yes, but.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In general.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Yes, but so so.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Absolutely.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Yes. In terms of the the zoning the underlying zoning will reflect the numbers on that map in the plan, which is like the previous vision in in all the plans that predated the plan amendment about the maximum height in the area.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And then the overlay enables the colors, which is the increased height. Then the second part of your question may have had to do.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'With, I mean, if we leave that so we are tonight we are changing it with the overlay to this increase heights instead of five is two and a 12 and from eight is going to 12 or 16, right?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'That's right. But they'll still have the zoning. For example, you might have IMX eight zoning like eight storey zoning and the overlay would actually allow you to build 12. But you're working with the incentive requirements on floors nine, ten and 12 to get there.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. So the zoning will change to the higher limit, but you don't have to pay to go. Still have to pay to get up that high. Right. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. A couple of quick rapid fire questions, because I think we've we've beat this a little bit. Laura, let me ask you real quick. Angelina Torres asked about a gentrification study specifically on GSE. Is it possible for OED?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Obviously, we've done a gentrification study, but. You know, we haven't really zeroed in on high targeting neighborhoods. We talked about this a little bit on the comprehensive, comprehensive housing plan that's going to come to council. Can we do something to study the impact on that for globally responsible?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Specifically.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I want to make sure I understand your question. What is the impact that development has had on housing prices in Greece? That's certainly something that I can take back to the team. Great.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Why don't you stay up there? Jamie, look how many others have talked about funds being used locally, localized funds that are coming from the commercial development for the buy out. Can we. In rules. There's some reason we can't do that in ordinance because it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It handcuffs us, but in rules. Can we put. That the as as affordable units become available. Those resources can be directed to those affordable units in the 30th and Blake Station area.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So that's certainly something that I can take back to the team as well. As you can see in the ordinance that the funds have to be used for housing purposes and they have to be used in a way that's consistent with the comprehensive housing plan.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But as far as considering the location near where the funds were generated, that's something I'll take back to the team as part of the rulemaking process.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. You know, I think that's a. You know, I don't know who this should go to. This should go to the team. Someone just talked about it. Oh, that was Councilman New. An annual evaluation. I think that is a best practice, seeing as you know, folks, every time we bring up a show on each side, say, man'",
        "'speaker_0': ', this was an issue. An annual evaluation, I think, is is incredibly important. I think that's something that I hope we can add that to the list. And also what Councilman Espinosa talked about defining the area is something that's good.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Public hearing for Council Bill 1617. Madam Secretary, make sure I'm right. 16, 17, 14 and 19 is now closed. Comments by members of Council. And I will. I'll go first.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, two years.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Two years of working on this, 250 people over 30 meetings, outreach meetings, a plan that was passed unanimously. And because of a growing, growing crisis in this city, you see some anger. Because we didn't see any anger at the plan in September in 2016.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We voted on it. We didn't I didn't we haven't received one letter of opposition, not one. I don't know any project that I have. There's concerns you've listed them. And so this has been a long process. And I've I got to tell you, I want to thank our staff.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This the staff at this city are they don't get the appreciation they deserve. They get called all kind of crazy names. We do, too. Or I do. But I'm out there. I'm a public official. You all hats off.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So, Brett, thank you for taking this on. There was an individual in here who said that, you know, this was a gentrification, you know, tyranny, you know, masquerading around here. There are not any large city city planners who would take on something like this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Let me tell you, because we've talked to him. There's only a couple. So thank you. A barge. Thank you for this last year and a half has been really tough and just really appreciate your leadership. Andrew as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We still got a public hearing to talk about you. But thank you for your leadership, Laura. You've just been amazing to sit with the community. We really appreciate you. And I just want to thank everyone from the coal, the rhino, you know, Curtis Park, Globeville, Alice wants everyone who was involved in this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Because you've all ask tough questions. I think people think about, you know, legislation like this and like just make it happen. Doesn't work this way. It's a lot of collaboration and a lot of give and take.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So usually I just talk extemporaneously on this issue. But after two years, I had to gather my thoughts as a leader in this city. The question of how to fix our housing crisis is what keeps me up at night.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm unable to fully celebrate Denver's countless economic successes without sitting with the countless stories I've heard about those being pushed out on the margins and beyond. And I'm able to benefit from Denver's current boom. Like leaders in the city and others like it, I'm antagonized by this reality.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Nationally, no city has adequately addressed this concern. And even though we recently established Denver's first dedicated fund for affordable housing, we all know we must do more. I recently read The New Urban Crisis by Florida. If you haven't read it, read it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's everything we talked about tonight. And in it, he discusses income and inequality in our urban housing crisis. He makes a point that is of interest to today's discussion. It's worth considering. He points out that, ironically, the same economy that caused these divisions in our city will be the same economy that fixes them to close Denver's economic'",
        "'speaker_0': 'gaps. We don't need a new economy. We need to adjust the one that we have and make it work better for all of Denver's residents. One with more victors and fewer victims. This is a thought behind these hide amendments beginning to capture value that developers receive from increased density in a way that provides much needed community benefits'",
        "'speaker_0': 'like workforce housing, artspace and neighborhood retail. The proven economic rationale of supply and demand in cities tells us that height restrictions limit supplies and with increasing demand, we will see soaring costs for greater displacement. This plan puts density where it belongs near high capacity public transit, following healthy national principles around transit oriented development.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To find a balance and inclusion for all. Florida says ultimately and this is so important, our only way forward for our economy and society is more, not less, urbanism. The plan promotes more housing density, increased affordability, safer pedestrian activity, less congestion from single occupancy vehicles.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But most importantly, the clustering of diverse people. And it uses our economic engine to do it in a balanced and inclusive way. This is the deepest challenge when it comes to our housing crisis, when all new development and taller buildings are perceived as bad for a neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I think this goes deeper than just NIMBYism or holding on to an old way of thinking in a new economy. It speaks to the fear of change. The changes that come with Denver's growth come with our own set of pains and excited.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And it's critical for you all to know that I feel this pain and carry these stories on the margins with me every day. My my kids go to Casa Nicole and they come home every day talking about someone who's been displaced out of the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The irony is that zero development would lead to higher housing costs. Great displacement. Like most of life's toughest challenges. The answer lies somewhere between the two extremes in the tension in that liminal space, somewhere between soaring skyscrapers and soaring housing costs.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Lies the answer. And is the space where we most will be most teachable and truly profound transformation must take place. So this is where we find ourselves tonight. And I'll say this again to close Denver economic gaps, we don't need a new economy.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We need to adjust the one we have and make it work better for Denver and the residents here. One with more victors and less victims. The plan. This plan before you tonight is small, but it's important. Piece of a larger plan to do just that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilwoman, can each.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Well, that's not fair. I'll change my mind about where my order is. That was very eloquent, Mr. President. Sorry. So I, I first just want to thank folks for the important dialog. It seems to me that there is a real trend in our debates about housing, which is one they're never about just the bill in front of'",
        "'speaker_14': 'us. And to the opponents and the supporters of whatever ordinance or issue is before us tend to agree on some really important fundamentals. So I think that that's a really interesting thing. It's hard to govern right in that environment, but it is also really healthy to have that kind of honesty.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'And I think that the pressure that the community is bringing, particularly the opponents, is really appropriate and necessary for the city, frankly. I want to start by just talking a little bit about the WHO, since one of the main themes I heard from folks who were concerned was about the the income levels here.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'So I just was doing some research while we were talking. And, you know, if you look at the income of 45000 to $50000, there are about 11,000 households of color in Denver that hit just that $5,000 income range.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'So we're talking about more than 3000 black headed families, more than almost 4000 Hispanic head of household families, and more than 3000 mixed race families. And so there are a significant number of families of diverse racial backgrounds who are in this very income band.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'And I think that's important because I think, you know, it's important that we're having a conversation about race in this chambers, and it's not always well designed for this debate the way we do this about really important topics.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'But I do think that that this this range of incomes and we heard about the fact that there is severe cost burden. And so I also think homeownership. Right. Is another piece of this. And so I just want to talk for a minute about the disparity in homeownership.'",
        "'speaker_14': '40% homeownership among black families, 47% homeownership among Hispanic families and 70% homeownership among white families. To the extent that this ordinance will create affordable for sale units, they aren't going to be affordable to the poorest income families. It's absolutely true.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'By design, homeownership is for folks who earn a little bit more. But the biggest factor in the wealth gap between families of color and white families is homeownership. And so that is the families that we care about. The families that I heard speakers caring about families of color are a piece of this income band that this housing'",
        "'speaker_14': 'affects. And I think is just we got to talk about that. Now, how do we try to get this housing into the hands of those families? That's a really important question that we need to be challenged on. Laura talked about the work on resident preference.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'I hope counsels your partner in that because we want to be a partner in that. The other thing is many cities have a much stronger pipeline of pre-qualified folks that are centralized rather than allowing each owner to do their own recruitment.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'And so we should think more about going in that direction. There's pros and there's cons, but it does mean that you can maybe get some of these housing units to more of the folks that you're concerned about. All right.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'So second thing I want to talk about and respond to is this question about so why? You know, I talked a little bit about the who, why, why use this policy to get to 80% of my families? Why not use it for 30% of.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'And my families are really, really deeply low income. The short story is typically you need public subsidy to get to that really low income. And the thing that I like about this policy is it doesn't cost a dollar of public money.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'What it does is it uses the development community and it leverages you can use whatever word they'll call it an action because there are developers who don't support this who aren't here tonight. They're going to call it a, you know, a black male who knows what they're going to call it, but.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'It leverages their money and it puts it directly into affordable housing without our money being required. Now, what does that do? It allows us to free up our public money for some of these other things. And I just want to just really quickly.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'So. Less than 30% of our housing funds. So 20 to 30% of our housing funds in our new plan will go to folks earning from 30% of AMI to 80% of AMI. I would suggest with a policy like this on the books now this is only one neighborhood and I get that.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'But it is the case for spending less of those public dollars on the 80. And a lot more in the 3250, for example. And you'll notice that that's only a very small portion of our housing funds. 40 to 50% of our housing funds in the new plan are prioritized to very low income families.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'So I can't vote on this ordinance and this policy in isolation without thinking about the public money. And so every unit produced in this program without a public dollar is a in my opinion, an additional unit that we can then have those public dollars really prioritize.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'And I think the community should hold us really accountable to that. And I will say also, we should hold the community really accountable to that. I continue to go to public meetings where I see neighborhood opposition to housing for folks earning $20,000 a year for folks who are homeless.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'And so for everyone who's here tonight telling us to lower these arms, goes to a community meeting and speaks up for that housing. There is a project right now on the edge of Reno, where I've already been invited to a kind of association that wants to kill it because it's for homeless people and they don't want any'",
        "'speaker_14': 'more homeless people housed in their neighborhood. So that's happening. And I would love for the folks who are here posing to come and be a part of that dialog too, because we get beat up to build it and we do it anyway and we'll keep doing it, but we sure need community to.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'So I think the accountability I hope it goes both ways. Last thing I wanted to touch on is the to do list, because I think there's been some important things for my colleague, Councilman Brooks, about the income set aside.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'You know, I actually that concern was new to me. I did not hear it before today. I just wanted to remind folks, a lifetime ago in the inclusionary housing ordinance, we included this language. About the special revenue fund.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'With consideration being given to create housing from funds that were generated from areas identified in this article as high needs zones in areas proximate to those same high need areas. We have language that we've written in the past, so we probably could have put it in the ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'I didn't know about it to suggest it. Sorry, I didn't hear that concern sooner, but we could certainly look at that language in the rules. We've done it before. We should be able to do it again. Secondly, when that money comes in, we can and should be using a chunk of it for lower.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'So this program, right. So if you build the units, they might get built at 80%. But for all those commercial folks who are going to buy out because they're not going to build housing in the middle of their shopping center or their business office building, they're not they're not going to add a housing unit.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'And if they're going to pay the fee. That's the opportunity to use this program to get at lower EMIs. There's no reason this program can't be delivering on that through the use of those funds. The last thing is I wanted to mention the the idea of the community benefits.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'We focused a lot on the housing, but I did hear those of you who raised concern about the community serving businesses. I probably would have pushed for a little more specificity in the ordinance on this piece. I absolutely hope I've shared some draft language with folks that didn't quite make the cut, but I think the rules and'",
        "'speaker_14': 'regs should say, I, you know, God bless the Red Cross, that that kind of scale of nonprofit with hundreds of millions of dollars in budget is not the kind of nonprofit that should be going into these spaces and getting these incentive funds.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'The rules should set a limit for nonprofits with a maximum, you know, annual income of X or artists. I mean, this is not for the Mendelssohn Gallery, for example. So there should be serious do we should just say it's for you know, it's for folks with with with an annual income of less than X and or serving'",
        "'speaker_14': 'in underserved. And I again, there's language out there. That language is there. I heard you community and I think that should be on the to do list. And lastly, I echo the conversation that occurred about putting the lengthening of the affordability period into a that's that's that's on the to do list overall for the housing plan to'",
        "'speaker_14': 'look at that 20 year minimum. And you know it should be it needs to be longer and that should, you know, apply if and when we do it, it should apply to everything this as well as the other programs.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'So with that, I just want to end by saying I will be supporting this tonight for all the reasons I've kind of laid out. And I I've I've sponsored many housing ordinances in this council. It is such a pleasure to be passing something that I did not have.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'To co-sponsor or did not get to co-sponsor.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'It did not. I mean, my colleague, Councilman Brooks, when folks said no to me, I just took them at their word and I didn't take this up. And he did not accept no for an answer and the staff didn't accept no for an answer and reopen something that had been considered closed multiple times.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'And that is important. It's important this is not complete work, but it is important work. And, you know, I can count on one hands the number of times we in this chambers have passed a policy that asks more of the development community on equity.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'And this is the third time, it's only the third time that we've done that. And so it's real that we're saying to development community, you are responsible for developing and and contributing to equity. And so for that, I just I want to really congratulate my my colleague and the council president, Councilman Brooks, for his leadership.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Canete. Councilman Espinosa.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I agree three times is not enough on that. I believe to Lauren's last comment, I believe you can have a proximity rule for the incentive fee, but the base linkage fee remains subject to the linkage fee limitations, but you'll find that out.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So the thing that I was trying to question, I figured it's just easier for me to just state. So here's the math $176,328. Is the sales price mean? The sales price is the highest minimum sales price at this very moment, but it will cost north of $250,000 to build that unit.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And you could probably sell it for at least $340,000. So a developer would lose $75,000 on the house cost to build and $170,000 from the sales price at market rate. So the choice is really, do you want to build an 80% unit and lose $75,000 or pay the linkage fee and make $57,000 while the linkage fee is'",
        "'speaker_11': 'hefty on the incentive portion. The math only gets more favorable to opt out the linkage fee in the example. Residents 100% residential project that was shown tonight is 900,000. The total hit to build 1010 units is $750,000. So a developer saves $150,000 on upfront costs, which is meaningful because you don't have to carry that through the through'",
        "'speaker_11': 'the project. Alternatively, if they paid that $900,000 to opt out of the base and the for it x linkage fee combined, they will profit an additional $570,000 over providing affordable housing. So they will make a half a million dollars more by not providing the affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Mind you, if the cost to build those units or the sales price are higher, either one. In both cases, it makes it even more it makes even more sense to pay the higher linkage fee and not provide the 80% army units.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The rules, as they exist right now seem more geared to increasing funds over the minute meager leakage fee that we passed two years ago than an actual generation of affordable and mixed income housing in private, unsubsidized developments within the TOD.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I'll be honest, when we smartly approved heights to afford a fort mean to support affordable housing and density previously at the TOD the massive public fence around this massive public infrastructure projects. My expectations were far higher than what I just laid out right now.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So that was my sort of where I was going with the math. Now my actual comments. So. I agree. Brad, you mentioned this is like the 2010 legislative re zone. And in that we did not have any real provisions for it to address any sort of gentrification and displacement issues.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'In fact, we did the exact same things to fuel to really spur and help development community sort of go gangbusters in in this economy. And this was an opportunity we still have other toddies where we can use this tool.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So I like it as a tool. But again, you heard it already and you're going to hear it some more that we're not there with this as is. So I agree. They're great tools and that was your very first statement.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And so 100% behind that. So but I need the supporters of this to think about this. The constant droning about keeping your artists makes one thing very clear Gentrification is alive and well with these land use decisions in Reno.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'For a long time, this was a deeply affordable area, a heterogeneous community of wild diversity sprinkled with artists and collectives and all manner of businesses, precisely because it was a truly affordable area. The fact that this canary in the coal mine is is the fact that the canary in the coal mine is used to prevent the further'",
        "'speaker_11': 'displacement of artists. You know, I don't even know what I was writing there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'You know that it's sort of a canary in coal mine argument that we're doing this to preserve our artists community. That should be an indication. Those artists were not having a hard time existing down there until all of this is happening.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And so the fact that we're using that to further the displacement of artists and almost. Are mean and speaking specifically only to the artist community, despite the fact that there were a whole host of other communities down there.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Smacks of of. And this is going to be mean I but I lost my mind my location I'll highlight smacks of a callous entitlement. This community for decades was far more than artists, and there is no reason it cannot be in the future.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But the mechanism of this ask shines a light on the failings of this proposal. But the failings not. Actually, I got my words wrong. The mechanism of this act. Does not shine. Yeah, but the meanness of this act shines a light.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Not on the failings of this proposal. Not on the failings of this proposal, but on the failings of this Council. I am sorry that once again we have failed to dig deep. The silver lining is that the structural changes that the city has made to accommodate this proposal creates an opening to do better.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I hope that now that CPD has taken these steps to pursue land value capture that they focus on, TOD is not where the community is asking for development rights, but where communities are asking for redevelopment to address displacement for all, not just a select segment of the community.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I have had a number of meetings with Brad and my constituents on this challenge. I hope that now addressing displacement where it is out of control now becomes a priority over developer requests to give us additional development rights.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The two question to the question, does this go far enough? Which many, many people said no. It does not a resounding no, it does not go far enough. I will be supporting both overlays tonight because it is marginally better than the status quo.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But I am under no illusion that this as is is a significant is not a significant step. I mean, that I am under no illusion that this is a significant step towards an affordable community. It is just not deep enough.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We should be asking for more. And you're going to see it more on the next public hearing, which is creating work kits in a way opportunity by because the only time incentives work is when there's a low base and a high incentive.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And when we raise the base with that, you know, that hurts the ability to do land value capture. These tools are here. You guys made them and they could work on all existing entitlement. And to get to this point without raising the base.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So I'll talk more about that later. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right, Councilman Lopez, you're up.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate everybody that's worked really hard on this. And I know that, Councilman, you've been working two years on this. Right. And I know you've worked hard. There's a lot of folks that have helped figure this out.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Now, I want to be very clear. There's a difference in terms of rules. You know, as you know Brad folks are CPG. A lot of folks in the city we said we keep saying we want more tools. How far can we go as a city?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Uh, to to collect some wins for affordable housing. What can we legally do? And that's what staff is tasked to do, and they do it. However, the question of how far can we go? Is a political one. Something that a community push is, something that elected, elected and appointed officials can do.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And that's a question we have to ask ourselves. So is this absolutely great work by our staff? Absolutely. Good work by council members in trying to address the solution or bringing a tool to the table? Yes. Does it go far enough?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'No. And I would love. To support this because of that new tool. I'm happy to see that there's a new tool. But there's. Something that just keeps eating at me. And I'm glad somebody came up to the microphone to challenge other districts to create affordable units.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm glad, because it shouldn't just be in some areas in the city. It should be everywhere. Should be on Colorado. It should be on Hamden. It should be spread out throughout our city. And you look at a map and you see how Denver how segregated Denver is.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's because of economic redlining. And that hasn't stopped. And we are also not reversing that trend. Why? Let me tell you why. In the last ten years since I've been on council, my ten year old girl was giving you props, by the way, Brad.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We've had Altos, Alameda on Alameda. Somebody said we want it on the Alameda and federal get ready with their pin because I'm going to load you up 94 units. Considerado. That's number two 100 units on 10th and bring that's a little sal another 100.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'PALOMA three. Another 100 on Morrison Road. Project number five 581 units at Mariposa. Westwood crossing opening now on Alameda. I made a 98 units that I set and sold 42 on federal and Alameda. Delicatessen 197 units. One of the hardest lifts that we ever had.'",
        "'speaker_3': '197 units on Morrison Road. Del Norte. This project on Avondale. A lot of units on that one right by quirky right aren't. Prime real estate for Colfax in Irving. The Jodi Apartments. Have city investment, public investment, political investment on Sheridan in ten at a light rail station at Royal Village.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Opening up shortly on 12th and Perry West End Flats on Colfax. Housing for homeless individuals. Little push back, but with open arms, the west side said Yes, let's house. We're not counting Sun Valley. That's going to be coming online with hundreds of units of affordability and public housing or even potentially the Salvation Army.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And the discussions of locating on Alameda. So yes, district three in the West Side has come to the plate. We've done it in a recession. So it brings to the question comes to me why and these and these the kicker is is that they're at 60%.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And some of them are nonprofit and some of our partnerships with private sector.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And if we can do this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We can produce 1592 units. At 60% throughout the West Side. And we can build. Why can't we do it in Reno? Excuse me. Five points. Why can't we do it? In areas that are popping that are here and it's not necessarily.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And and then and so that that for me it's a question of political will. It can be done. The staff showed us this is a tool. All this work has brought this into the light. Now. Why are we going further?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Why don't we just say, okay, we'll do 60%, 100% in the West Side, but we don't want to do it over here. We'll keep it 80. What neighborhood is immune to 60% asthma or lower? Tell me which one is.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I don't think there should be any. And so, you know, I as you know, as much like I said, I really would like to support this because I like the tool. I like the new tool in the toolbox.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I want to take a swing at that hammer to. But I also have to say that. It could be a. Heavier hammer swing. And I don't want to think about this in terms of a vacuum. But, you know, we also I mean, my colleague, Councilman Ortega, brought up the issues of parking.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Look, I think I would love to get to a time where we don't have to be so dependent on a car. I love being able to be in New York and not have to depend on a car and see families taking the train.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But that's New York. In Denver, it's a little different. In Denver, it's a privilege not to have a car and to be able to get around to take your kids to school at a good school in the neighborhood where you live.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'For me. I have to take my daughter out to choose. I'm forced to choose to drive all the way down to Coons Mill or possibly to take my daughter before I get a school that hasn't been experiment on.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Right. So. It is an absolute privilege. Depending on your zip code and we need to break down those barriers in terms of where we can build 60%. Am I a lower? For me, 80%. Is this not affordable and not knowing how many units.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We're dealing with and not knowing the breakup of those units, are they going to be two bedrooms for families or are they going to be one bedroom for an artist? Because it's not just artists that are suffering in the city, it's families.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The crisis is with families. The crisis is with folks like my my sister, who's a single mother working for the public sector and barely being able to scrape by. Too proud to take public benefits because she actually works in the same department.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They do it. But wanting to survive in this city. On the brink of having to move. Those are the kind of families we should be aiming for. Those are the kind of families that are struggling in this city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And does does this address all of those families? Absolutely not. But it should. At the end of the day. You know, I I do believe it's political will. Somebody said that this is a bold move. 80% is a bold move.'",
        "'speaker_3': '80% is not a bold move. 60% is a bold move. 30% is a bold. Being able to say every crane in this city that's building a unit, whether it's for housing or for rent, should have a requirement. A 20% requirement.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's what I heard in Brooklyn. That's a bold move. And it doesn't just require us as a city, but it requires our friends across the park. And it requires us like we get this every day, we get a briefing on what's going on at the state and if the cities opposing the bills are not.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I would love to see us supporting a bill that talks about rent control. It talks about being able to regulate that rental market because until we have those other tools, this one is just one tool in our toolbox.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah. So I, you know, I. I really want to get there. But I don't think I can tonight. That's not the that's not to say that a lot of good work hasn't been done. I just, you know. I guess I don't want to be offered a tip.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I want to be offered a salary in this kind of situation. Not necessarily a tip.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Lopez. The U.S. development actually mediche is 65 units, 30 to 60%. Am I a little bit more information? Anyway, Councilman Clark.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I will. I want to first thank everyone from government for coming down, for fighting through this, for sitting in those chairs for so long. Thank you so much for being engaged. It was especially a treat for me tonight to see Darrell Watson and Keith Pryor signed up to talk because it felt a little'",
        "'speaker_3': 'bit like a proud reunion for me. So thank you both for all of your commitment to this city for so many years and continuing to be here at 11:00 at night. You two are just rock stars in my book.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I something we there's a lot to talk about. A lot of my colleagues have done a great and eloquent, eloquent job of talking about that. I'm going to touch on something a little bit different in here is something that I think is really significant for us and really important, and that is making the river a primary street'",
        "'speaker_3': '. That is huge for a city that has turned our back on the South Platte River for decades and decades and decades. To see that in here is just incredible, to really recognize that that is our front door, not where you put all the utilities, not where you put the trash cans with.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That is our primary street. And to treat it like that is an incredible transformative piece of this that didn't get a lot of talk, but I wanted to say was was recognized and appreciated. I want to thank our council president for bringing this forward and for leading on this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We see rezonings come through in this area. We would see them come through if we vote this down tonight, like some of my colleagues seem to be inclined towards, that will not stop rezoning applications of the property in this area.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But when we see them, when they come through one at a time, we don't see the river as a primary street. We don't see any inclusion of affordable housing beyond what is required in our housing ordinance. And we don't see design standards as part of that by doing this legislatively, by looking at this entire area.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Maybe it's not perfect, but this was pushed way farther than what we would have seen and what we might see if this doesn't pass. We have a lot of work to do as a city on all of these issues, and I don't think anyone thinks that this is the solution.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But the solution starts with a step and this is a huge step towards what we can expect to see instead of these one off rezonings where we don't get any of that. And so for that leadership, I am thrilled to see this come forward and set the table for the future of our city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so I will be happy to support this tonight. And thank you. Council President Brooks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Clark. Councilman, new.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. President. You know, I do love the like the incentive nature of this plan, you know, so much better than having a penalty for a developer. But to incentivize improvement and growth, I think is very attractive.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And it seems as a practice with council around the top East Asians, we have increased density in heights and very consistently wherever around the city. And and I keep I keep looking at this map in the book here and I can't tell where that circle is around the top.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And but I think it's probably covering most of Rondo. And in terms of heights, at least as I look at the the map is further toward the increase. Heights is much more prevalent toward Brighton Road and toward the railroad's north rather than toward the neighborhoods to the south.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So so I think it may not have as a greater impact as we think. I just hope that that there will be able to deliver and make sure that that doesn't happen and there will be a very good future relationship with all those neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Displacement. Gentrification is coming. It's continuing. Right now, it's going to come and and it'll be very interesting to see how the city responds to protecting our low income families is so important. And we every every meeting we talk about is what are those tools to help those low income families?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so those neighborhoods close to Toronto will be a challenge. And I think if this plan, if Rodo can deliver this plan and produce the vision they want and make that the continuity between the neighborhoods and the business areas very cohesive and supportive.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I think it'll be a successful place up. I'll be voting for this tonight. And and I look forward to seeing the evaluations that occur on this and hopefully affordable housing will be produced. I'm a little skeptical that we'll see units, but I just hope we won't be like they were where developers buy out and would actually'",
        "'speaker_6': 'produce affordable housing. So. Thank you, Mr. Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilman new councilman Cashman.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Boy, I'm. Feeling like. My colleagues on both sides of this issue. As I recall, I was of lone no vote when the Arapahoe Square rezoning came up because there was a zero affordability component. This.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'To hear that we've got projects in the pipeline in this neighborhood for a thousand units and we're looking for somewhere around 90 affordable units out of that. It's better than zero. It's not a lot better than zero. It's not a game changer.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You know that there's a development being talked about in my district that that is looking at 60%. Am I? But there's a buyout in that contract. And 150 units. I mean, we're here in 85,000. Cost burdened households. The private market is not going to get us out of this.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The the the economic system under which we exist has no innate social conscience.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I believe.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That this. Is probably what we can expect when we leave it to the private market, these types of tools and that level of give. I think for me it just points out to as a city, we need to get way more serious than this.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I'm not talking about just council or the administration. I'm talking about the 700,000 other people who live here. And we're going to need to dig deep and get creative and come up with funding streams to deal with the preservation aspect of keeping people in their homes and making things affordable.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You know, I'm not a great mathematician, but if if we're talking about that 10% number and we have 85,000 households that need affordable housing, we need to build if we're going to do it by building at 850,000 new units.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I don't advise that as as my friend Councilman Espinosa said, this is better than the landscape there today. You know, the whatever number of affordable units we get on on this land is better, but we need to come up with a bunch of new tools to to supplement this.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so, as with my colleague, I will be supporting these overlays. But it's a minuscule ask. And as was the linkage fee itself. You know, when we have a study that says we can justify I think it was seven bucks or something like that and we come up with a buck 70.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I have developers around the area telling me, God, you guys are letting us off the hook. So easy. So getting way far afield. We need to do way more. If this is all we do, then we're in a world of hurt and we're not doing right by anybody.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Castro and Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you, Mr. President. You know, this is this is really tough. And Councilman Cashman, you took some of the words out of my mouth about the fact that we have a long way to go. We've got immediate needs for people in our neighborhoods who are.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Who are being pushed out of this city because they cannot afford to live in this city. And I don't know anybody who doesn't know someone who's got a kid or a relative or a friend who just can no longer afford to live in this city.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And we all need to be part of the solution. I appreciate the fact that this this is an approach that asks the developers to play a role. But in doing that, we've got to give them more to be able to participate.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'In the 2010 rezoning, we gave more zoning density to these areas and as we have continued to up zone, we should be getting affordability out of these developments. But we just keep giving and giving. And you go to other cities around this country, you don't see this happening.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I know that the Telluride ruling plays a big part in this, but, you know, we are spending investment dollars in so much of the infrastructure that typically developers have to pay for. I mean, you look at the Fox Street corridor for an example.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I mean, that's one where they think the city is making some headway in in trying to get the developers who will be building in that area to be part of that traffic nightmare solution that exists today before that development even comes in there, as well as some of the drainage problems.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And, you know, we need to be doing this with all of our development where, you know, the city is not expected to just foot the tab for so many of the the infrastructure improvements that then make the development, you know, want to come.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That should be part of of what we're looking at. We're talking about 450 acres and somewhere in the ballpark of 100 units. 450 acres. Right. That's what I heard. I mean.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. Well, thank you for that correction, because that's that's a big deal. But. We have so much more to do in this city. And I would love to see, you know, somebody in this area, look at a site for the tiny homes.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We need to be looking at changing the zoning to allow a multiple use of different housing solutions. There's no one bullet that's going to solve the problem for all of our housing needs. You know, I believe that looking at micro-housing was one part of the solution, but not the answer.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'You know, so we need all the tools in our toolbox. I argued against getting rid of our show because that was creating some affordable for sale units. And the people who are in those homes I know are grateful because they would not be homeowners if it were not for that program.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So. I would love to see a preference policy, not that we're going to look at it, but for us to have a preference policy in place that ensures people who are being displaced actually have a place in their community that they can go to.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Because we're making.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Outreach to HUD, to to get those exceptions to be able to keep people in this city that want to stay. You know, we have I just met with the folks from Game Plan today and on the open space issue, they're saying we've got so much building going on in this city.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We don't have enough open space. We talk about it as part of these developments. And unless you're more than an acre and, you know, a lot of these sites are going to be, you know, smaller, smaller developments, even though it's a total of 450 acres, we're going to be challenged with where do these people recreate?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Right. I mean, you can't expect they're all going to go to a rooftop garden, right? So it's some of these issues that I think are critically important, where this is, where public policy matters and looking at how we prioritize our needs and how we prioritize people over projects.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And people over money. We're going to be losing our workforce in this city. You know, they're they're they're going to the edges of our metro area because they can't afford to live here. And when they get there, they're going to find jobs in their area.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And we're going to be challenged to find our workforce, particularly in the service industry. You know, I think we're going to face this idea. Gaylord is going to open long before our, you know, great hall expansion occurs. And I think we're going to be challenged to find the workforce to fill all those service industry jobs for those'",
        "'speaker_10': 'concessions. So these are some of the challenges. And this is, again, where I think, you know, there's a nexus between affordable housing and quality jobs that pay a livable wage. But, you know, I'm not sure where I'm going to land on this.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I'm trying to be open. I appreciate the efforts that have have been put forth to ask the development community to play a role in being part of the solution. But we we together with the development community, we the city, we, the people who live in this city need to wrap our arms around this in a much bigger'",
        "'speaker_10': 'way that ensures that we're not a city just for people who can afford to live here, because that's what we've become. We've lost our socioeconomic diversity in this city, and we'll see that when we see the 2010 census, the 2020 census come out.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So I'm just, you know. Expressing some frustrations and concerns about how how as a city, we've not been as intentional and focused on some of the things that we should be prioritizing. While as we have grown as a city, you know, we have developers that that have an interest in the city.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We don't have to give dollars to developers to build in this city who want to be here. There was a time when we had to do that, right, when when there wasn't an interest in people wanting to be in our in our core city.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But that's not the case today. Everybody wants to be in Denver. So this is where I think we need to to do a better job of of prioritizing and and working together and rolling up our sleeves. And I know many of you feel like this is what you've done on this project.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I mean, I'm still waiting for you to tell us what's going on with the 48th and race project. There's been no dialog with the community who's been waiting for units. This is a project or a site. The city helped the choir and there's no communication back to any of us about where where that's at.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'This is an example of where, you know, some of us thought maybe we would have had a project in the ground by now. And I don't know where that's at. I'd love to chat with you and hear what kind of progress has been made on on that site.'",

        "'speaker_0': '11 I's council, 14 and 19 has passed. All right. We passed four bills and we still have another one. Now you see why this took over two years. So why don't you come up? Councilman Espinosa, please put 15 on the floor.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Good evening, Mr. President. Council members. So what you've already voted on tonight in terms of map amendments is a map amendment that establishes the incentive, height and river north design overlays on properties that already have mixed use zoning.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This application aims to address some of the properties that don't currently have a height based, mixed use based zoning in this area. Essentially, as you'll see, it'll fill in some of the holes in the zoning map that you've already reviewed this evening, which is, of course, in Council District nine and spans four neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This particular rezoning focuses on the area where the incentive height overlay is intended to apply, which is shown here in blue, and you'll see that shape show up on several maps here. Further through the presentation, this map shows this rezoning relationship to the larger river north overlay the design overlay boundaries shown there in red.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And this map shows the actual rezonings proposed as part of this proposal. So this is this proposal would rezone properties with a mix of C-Max and IMAX zoned districts with three, five and eight storey maximum heights that sync with the incentive height overlay system that you've already heard about and discussed this evening.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And it affects properties that currently have non height based zoned districts like I.B. in a in some former Chapter 59 zoning. It does not affect properties with custom zoning, such as some of the pods that already exist in the area and some former Chapter 59 zoning with waivers.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'As I've already explained, existing zoning in this area is is a mix of industrial, commercial and mixed use. Zoning land uses reflect that that varied mix of zoning and uses lots of industrial mixed with commercial and residential in this area.'",

Northeastern half of the project area. And you can see that this is this area is characterized by heavier industrial uses.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'These images show some examples of existing and and recent development in the area. As I mentioned up front, this is proposing a mix of IMX and CMA zone districts. The CMA Zone District is appropriate for urban centers and transit oriented development promotes an active industry in realms with a mix of uses.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In this particular application, it's proposed where a preponderance of adopted land use recommendations are for transit oriented development, mixed use, or something similar to that, and where existing land uses are primarily residential and commercial. The IMX zone districts are proposed where existing land uses are industrial or residential, and this is a district that promotes pedestrian scale, mixed'",
        "'speaker_2': 'use development similar to CMCs with an active street level, but also permits many industrial uses that currently exist similar to how they're regulated in the IB and air zone. So it's appropriate for areas that are transitioning from industrial to more of a mix of uses.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Abe already covered the the extensive public process for this. I won't go into much detail here, but I did want to highlight that during the discussion of this base rezoning, we did two mailed notices and held two meetings specifically for property owners interested in learning.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'More about this proposed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Rezoning. There are about 20 registered neighborhood organizations that follow whose boundaries include properties proposed as part of this rezoning.

The Blueprint Plan calls for a mix of transit oriented development, a mixed use, industrial and employment mixed uses in this area, reflecting some of the the small area plans in this area as well.

        "'speaker_2': 'for transit oriented development. This is the the the area plan that kind of brought together all of the kind of reconciled all of the height recommendations from the many area plans impacting properties in this area while carrying forward their their height recommendations.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This is the 2016 and 38th and Blake Height amendments and this is essentially the core policy from which this incentive program was was created as has already been explained several times. The the base heights are shown there in numbers and then the proposed incentive heights, the allowable instead of heights are shown in Color River North Plan established'",
        "'speaker_2': 'recommended a mix of transit oriented industrial mixed use and commercial mixed use for this area 30th and Blake Station area plan also recommended a mix of transit oriented development or tree core closest to the station with residential and employment mixed use.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'As you get closer or further away from the station, the Elyria and Swansea Neighborhood Plan recommended a mix of of transit oriented development, industrial mixed use and then general mixed use in the area. With regard to the other criteria, this request is consistent with the requirement that the request result in the uniform application of district regulations that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'will result in the uniform application of the CMCs and Impact Zone districts. And finally, this request will implement further public health, safety and welfare by implementing many adopted plans in the area for walkable development and mixed uses near high quality transit.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Andrew, we're all proud of you. Well done. Thank you. I have good news and even better news. We have two speakers this evening and they have both left. So questions by members of council. Do we have any question, Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I'd like to ask whether or not this creates any nonconforming uses. So, for example, we have marijuana growers allowed in the industrial zones. And I'd like to know if this creates nonconforming uses within. With with the zone change.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I believe that for some existing uses it might create some compliant uses. So those uses that may no longer be permitted in a new zone district would be allowed to continue as long as they as long as they do.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'But once they're those uses are ceased.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There may be some uses that that are no longer permitted.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. And then I would like to know if part of the discussion with these specific boundaries, which abut the Globeville rail yards, included any conversation about buffering or complying with the new the new policy that, you know, when folks come in and want to develop, they've got to now check the box and be able to address how'",
        "'speaker_10': 'they're going to deal with that issue.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This particular rezoning does not directly address that issue, but any any single development that comes in and goes through the site planning approval process would that that is the point at which those types of issues would be addressed.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Ortega. Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Andrew, could you explain the parcels that are in the opt out and what of what's happening with those? They are we are not rezoning those parcels. We did put we did put the overlay, the two overlays on them.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilman Flynn Actually, the the properties that requested to be opted out will retain their existing base zoning. So the, if they do not have a mixed use zoning today, the overlays will not apply. In some cases they may have lower intensity or they may have.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'IMX versus the proposed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'CMCs. In those cases, the overlays will apply if the existing base zoning is a mixed use zoned district. However, those properties that opted to keep iby or if zoning overlays will not apply. And those are shown on the slide that I just pulled up here.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Okay. Thank you. That's all.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you, Councilman Flynn. Seeing no other questions. Public hearing for Council Bill 15 is now closed. Comments by members of council. You know, I'll just say I didn't get a chance to say too much about Andrew and his work in this sort of new to the CPD team and getting thrown into one of the most complex'",
        "'speaker_0': 'projects and rezoning. Some of these based on districts where people don't understand about this whole project is that we had to bring it into compliance of of what the plans that you guys voted on 12th September 2016 were like.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So thank you. It was not easy work. A lot of confused folks. But I got a chance to talk to two homeowners in the Cole neighborhood who really appreciated the outreach and how you took the complexities of this issue.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I made a very simple so really appreciate your work and just want to say to everyone who's still standing, scratch that sitting in those chairs. Thank you so much for being a part of this, no matter what your view was, no matter what your.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We really appreciate you being engaged this way. Excited, too. This is. One tool. Of 700 that we're working on, you know, and so really appreciate you guys.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Councilman Espinosa Yeah, I'm both grateful that surprised that there are no speakers because more than anything, we just passed. To me, the reason why I'll be voting no on this is that this is that this is the the gentrification problem.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'This is the the displacement problem. This wholesale rezoning. Lifting the base of these properties is that lost opportunity that I was just speaking to on my prior comments, which is the incentive overlay could be applied to the existing zoning as it is.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And that delta between this new base and what is entitlement today could also then be captured as incentive and get to those deeper assets that we are talking about. It is the fact that we have such liberal base zone districts that create the problem that we have in trying to leverage value capture to get better outcomes.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Because, you know, and we have tools in the zoning code to address all of those things, but then that takes other resources, general fund resources, dedication of staff in time. And so for ten years now for yeah well for eight years that we've had the zoning code, the only places aside from this that have gone through overlays'",
        "'speaker_11': '. Honey did it by themselves for five years. Yeah. Curtis Park. All the tools of zoning really take community resources. Councilman Cashman had the Christina Park again. Community led efforts to try and address all the other conditions that are wrought by this base, very generous base zoning.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And so it is frustrating for me that we we would choose we already have plans that support this these sorts of changes. We now have the incentive overlay we should have we should have used these tools to sort of compel a sort of better outcomes in this area.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We're going to get outcomes regardless of whether we did it or not. But we could have been more comprehensive in a more holistic in that approach. You've heard the concerns in the prior issue about the the sort of weakness of the tools, the the discrepancy between needs and what we're doing.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And it's just it really bothers me that this is being pursued and it's in again, I'm surprised because this is more than anything, you know, the redevelopment opportunity was here. The incentive was the real. The incentive was the to pedestrian crossings.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The incentive is all the infrastructure that we're putting into this area, the incentives is the Brighton Boulevard improvements. The incentive is the National Western Center is an incentive is the align. You know, development was going to occur here so it wasn't the height.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But now we just raised the base about around a whole bunch of properties and and you know, so I'm going to I'm done talking. Let's go our evening. But that is to me, this is the missed opportunity in this whole thing.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And and this is what's going to result in rapid displacement of the entire area and a real transformative character going forward. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right, Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Mr. President, I believe that the Salvation Army is within these boundaries. Correct?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Let's see here. You know what I know. Yes, it is. Yep.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. So, Brad, this is an opportunity where we have a nonprofit that actually owns our own land in this area that wants to rebuild. And and I'm hoping that they will be given the same consideration as they move forward and want to rebuild and put a brand new facility there that we're giving to all the other developers'",
        "'speaker_10': 'that are that are building in this area. And this would be an opportunity where we would see truly affordable housing in a development that will look totally unlike what it looks like today, that will serve people in a completely different way.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And they will have to go through a separate reason application process. If this passes tonight, I don't know how many other nonprofits actually own land in this area. I know that we're still trying to do our hardest housing in this area.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Correct. And I think that's moving along so that that will be another attractive development for this site that is trying to help keep artists in this area. I mean, you know, we saw this same thing happen to lower downtown.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'You know, this was an artist community. And once we started seeing the investment and people wanting to go in and build these build out the historic buildings in lower downtown. And, you know, we did have a $750,000 revolving loan fund to assist some of them with their, you know, gap financing and whatnot.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But in that area, they got pushed out. They couldn't afford to stay. You know, my hope is this one project helps some of those folks. We think to some degree, the ordinance that we passed and the funding to assist the DIY folks is helping until their particular buildings are developed.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But, you know, that's a short term gap in in helping those folks. But. I am hopeful that we can get there with Salvation Army being able to to do what they want to do on that site. And, you know, this is a case where we will prioritize people over project.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I thank you, Councilwoman Ortega. See no other comments. Madam Secretary, roll call.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Black Eye.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Clark Espinosa No.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Flynn I.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Herndon Cashman. Kenny G. Lopez.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'New Ortega. Sussman, I. Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I. Please also voting. Announce the results.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You are missing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, we got. We got them all.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Oh, sorry. Tonight's to name.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Tonight's two names council will 15 has passed on Monday, March 12th, 2018. Council will hold a required public hearing of Council Bill 009 for change zoning classification of 3050 Colorado Boulevard in Hilltop and require a public hearing a council bill 129, which places a moratorium on certain development plans.'"
