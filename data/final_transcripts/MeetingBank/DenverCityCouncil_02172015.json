        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Madam President. First of all, I'd like to ask that my name be added to the proclamation. I can remember coming back to council and having discussions about the hours being reduced in all of our libraries. There was discussion about whether or not we should be whether or not the library system should be sort of a'",
        "'speaker_2': 'separate entity apart from the city similar to an authority. And we were just struggling with how to deliver the same quality of services to the citizens and the taxpayers. With with the challenge, the financial challenges that we had.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Madam President. Cheri. This is a hard day for me and seeing you seeing you go in. And one of the reasons is, is I just feel like you get it. As a librarian, you understand it's not just about books.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It's about the community. And I remember we when we first met you talking about you see the libraries as community centers. And I was like, oh, my goodness, this librarian gets it. Because it's not just a place where people go to read books, but it's a workforce center.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It's not just a people. A place where people go to read books. It's where young folks who don't, who come from single family homes, aren't exposed to some of the programs to read. So they're there. It's a place where we have homeless services, especially around Blair Caldwell, which is in five points.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so I, I just appreciate your work and I appreciate your your boldness in even putting social workers at the at the libraries. And so I pray that this vision will continue to go on to the next person, because we have a lot of work to do in our urban libraries.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'And, you know, you and I and several others have had, you know, our share of angst and nail biting, wondering, you know, when and if and how it was finally going to come together.

        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. Madam President, I wanted to just thank you, surely publicly for your work in making sure that libraries are still a thing of the present, not a thing of the past. You wouldn't believe how many times we heard people say, Why do we even have libraries anymore?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'When you have the Internet and I'll tell you why. Because they are. They're centers of knowledge, centers of opportunity. Our libraries nowadays are not just books that are getting dusty on a shelf. What happened to being able to do good research and teaching our young people not to just rely on what they see on Wikipedia or on'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Facebook as fact, but to go look for it themselves. And that's what that teaches, that that's what it's all about. I'm a generation Xer. I don't know about anybody after me. No offense, Elvis.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But in the same generation.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Hey, you claim to be young. I'm just picking on you. Even now that you're young, you know, three months younger than me. So it's such an invaluable it's such a valuable lesson, right, to to look for that information.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It is the center of knowledge. Folks going to the library to seek refuge, to find work, to find peace. In some cases, there are only community centers and communities where we don't have any. A library is a community center and it's a place for community that and I'm proud.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That at the end of this month, we will finally open the doors to the Rodolfo Corky Gonzalez library at the Avondale on Irving and Colfax. And you can clap for that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You can clap for that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And it's in a neighborhood that needed it the most. And when I worked with you, sure, you work together, even though it was contentious at times, even though we had a fight for every inch, we had to say we have to look surely mark my words surely said that we have to make sure this isn't the area'",
        "'speaker_6': 'for where the greatest need. And we're looking at putting this library somewhere in the west side. She says it needs to be in the area with the greatest need, and we all concurred with that. And this library is going to be a game changer, and it embodies the spirit of its namesake who fight in the streets so'",
        "'speaker_6': 'that we have access to the same seats that you all are sitting in. And so they can sit in the front seat of their classroom and not the back seat. Right. And so that's exactly what that library entails.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You, ma'am, were critical to that. And I wanted to thank you on behalf of the folks in the West Side that I represent. Thank you so much for your work, Shirley.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman Lopez. Councilman Nevitt.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you, Madam President. Shirley, I'm really sorry to see you go.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That's for sure. I'm trying to avoid the word, Shirley, but.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You've been great to work with in. You know, a number of my colleagues have already talked about sort of, you know.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The hurricane of.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Activity and, you know, the tremendous things achieved. But I kind of like to think of you as sort of the librarian's librarian, the uber librarian, quiet, ridiculously organized, highly knowledgeable. You actually know the answer to the question before I've asked it.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But you're very generous in letting me go ahead and ask the question and, you know, pretending that it's an interesting question and that that's something that you'll consider. But and the couple of things we've gotten to do together, working with Councilwoman Robb to get the funding for the bookmobile.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Again, not a whole lot of drama and not a whole lot of fuss, just quietly working away, getting that done. And then the my Denver card, I remember coming to you all sort of, you know, hair on fire about how we could do this.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And you explained that you'd actually been.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thinking about this for some time. And that was an excellent idea, Councilman, and we'd certainly get on it. But I think that was.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Your idea before it was.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Any of the rest of ours. And thank you for then quietly setting about making it happen. So librarians.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Librarian, thank you for being.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That. And you have big shoes to fill.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman Nevitt. Next up is Councilman Fights. Thank you, Madam President. It has been a true pleasure, Shirley. Really enjoyed having you. You came at a time that followed some really tough budget cuts, and that's not a good environment to enter in to be the heroine.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But you turned out.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'To be able to add libraries, add library hours, add library services. And you also worked with.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Council.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Officers very graciously to make those work for each of the areas.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I sincerely thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Councilman Fox. Councilwoman Robb.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Madam President. Pro Tem. It seems like just yesterday that I met you at a reception for three candidates for city librarian. And boy, did we or I should say, the library commission choose. Right, as you've heard in all these comments.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'If I were to echo because really everything's been said. Any of the comments tonight? I think it would be Councilman Brooks. And I do want you to know, Councilman Brooks, there are books in the library older than you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But I really do see through the example of the main library here in Civic Center, the Central Denver Library, how much you have crafted a place that serves all people, regardless of the challenges. I remember going over and seeing the new computer technology center and it was just so exciting and I remember your excitement about it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I also remember your excitement at numerous book Lover Balls, all the dressing up and, you know, eating in the library that I don't think a librarian is actually trained for. But you were you were wonderful. I think the whole approach that you have had to community is also reflected in what we have heard from city departments and'",
        "'speaker_5': 'library employees about how great you are to work with. So thank you very much for your service.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Robb, are there other members of council? I, I want to just take the time to thank you with all of my heart and soul for all of the work that you've done in our community. As usual, the way it goes in District nine, we're always embattled in something.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And the way that we bonded and started to work with one another all had to do with the potential.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Closure of.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The Byers Library in West Denver, one of our Carnegie. And you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Were.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So supportive, understanding that politically myself and the rest of the neighborhood had to get through it. We need to we needed to speak up. We needed to advocate and. And you completely supported it and understood that never took it personally.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Just understood that we were fighting the good fight to keep the library open. And as a result, it's still open today with a beautiful mural by Carlota Espinosa and then us working together to try to find a site that was a confluence.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'For the three council districts.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And finally we found a home for the Corky Gonzalez library. And I want to assure you that I believe with all my heart that that is going to be the center of the universe. As for many of the people that live in the neighborhood and many people that will be seeking and understanding what what the Latino movement'",
        "'speaker_2': ', Chicano movement was in the city of Denver and how.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Much it really did forge history.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'In this way.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And now let me introduce Shirley. I'm all.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'Given the libraries over the years. I know during those really tough.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Budget times, I could always count on city council to support the library and provide whatever.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Service you could.'",

This is a redevelopment site, Southlands Lake, or former St Anthony's Hospital to the east and the south is CMC's five.'",

This is just a land use map showing the predominant land use that is surrounding this redevelopment site.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This has been the subject of much planning over the years when the hospital decided to leave and the proposed rezoning tonight is a continuation of all of that momentum in implementing the West Colfax Plan and implementing the vision for the St Anthony's redevelopment.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The subject site, of course, is is a sunny picture and looks different probably every day. But most of the hospital was raised in the last few years. Of course, to the north is the park. To the east of the site is yet more of the redevelopment site for sale signs like in an area known as block two'",
        "'speaker_2': '. And then the area to the south is block six one, two, three, six along Stewart Street. The Western context. Just a few photos are definitely looking at a change in context to single unit and multifamily and then also a school just to the southwest of the site.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'A proposed rezoning goes through a typical review by other city agencies. Agencies include Asset Management, Public Works, the Surveyor Parks and Rec Development Services. We didn't receive any substantial comments on the rezoning itself and the legal description for the site was approved.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Public Review. This site actually was the subject of a public meeting presentation in October when there are a lot of other issues going on around the site and discussion of the design overlay that actually is on the site.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Now, informational notice for the proposed rezoning itself was sent October 31st. There's a planning board public hearing. We're planning board recommended unanimous approval or excuse me, I shouldn't say unanimous, but approval 6 to 1 with a condition that it only be approved if the DOE five is retained on the site, which it is proposed to do.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The Neighborhoods and Planning Committee for Council heard this on January 7th and it is now at council hearing the register neighborhood organizations include West Colfax Association of Neighbors, Denver Neighborhood Association, the Sloan's Lake Citizens Group, West Colfax Business Improvement District, Northwest Quadrant Association, the ANC.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so and so like Neighborhood Association. At Planning Board. Like I said, Planning Board did recommend approval. Public testimony included both support and opposition, with support focused on the appropriateness of the proposed zoning for the site, consistency with plans and a positive neighborhood response to the overall work and planning that has been done by the owner.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Opposition and Planning Board focused on the St Anthony's Task Force Report recommendations, many of which are incorporated as guiding principles in the West Colfax Plan in some of the district discussion. And. But there was an overall opinion that the CMCs 12 zoning proposal tonight doesn't implement those recommendations.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm sure you'll hear more about that this evening. Got to go. City council notice we have included in our staff report what we had received at the time, a week ago of over 50 letters of support, individual letters.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We know at planning board there were two petitions and opposition, but we didn't list the names individually. You may be in receipt of those. And we also received an email today regarding a petition signed by several people who were signing to say they did not they no longer opposed the rezoning.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So there there's been a lot of back and forth and discussion, I'm sure, in the neighborhood. It all sounds well-represented this evening. Review criteria includes criteria found under Denver Zoning Code, consistency with adopted plans, uniformity of district regulations, furthering the public health, safety and welfare, and then in addition justifying circumstances and inconsistency with neighborhood context and zone'",
        "'speaker_2': 'district purpose and intent. There is one more criteria that we are able to follow in this case, because there is a general development plan in the site, which I'll explain. The city council may approve an official map amendment or a rezoning application for property located within an approved GDP area.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Taking into consideration the approved GDP. So with regard to adopted plans, the comprehensive plan and Blueprint Denver are both overarching plans for the city blueprint. Denver is the land use and regulate and transportation plan was Colfax Plan was adopted in 2006 and forms a much more specific vision for the West Colfax neighborhood and for this site.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then this all sounds like general development plan got even further into detail about this specific redevelopment. With regard to the comprehensive plan. Your staff reports lay out several details that you can review. I'd like to highlight under portions of that plan, legacy is land use and environmental sustainability.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This rezoning is consistent with the policies set forth in the comprehensive plan regarding infill development, increasing density where desirable and can be accommodated, particularly at vacant sites or redeveloping sites. Housing and Mobility. Another section of the plan talks about promoting transit oriented development as an urban design framework for urban centers and development areas.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The site, while not next to a light rail, is along a bus route and is also an urban center and development areas called out in the plan. So that policy really can extend to planning for the site as well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Also, encouraging development of housing that meets the increasing diverse needs of Denver's present and future residents. Identifying and capitalizing on opportunities to build housing along transit lines. And just pointing out where this site is located, obviously along 17th, but it's also six blocks north of the West Line light rail corridor.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then, of course, multiple roads along Colfax. Blueprint. Denver gets further into detail on the site designated as an area of change for mixed use development, with applicable concepts really focused on channeling growth where it can best improve access to jobs, housing and services.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Looking at areas of change more specifically, there's a lot of language in the plan that we've highlighted in the staff report as well. But it really gets down to focus and growth that is more intense in areas that can accommodate it to incorporate more people into our city, larger parcels, increased density, increased tax base and increased transit'",
        "'speaker_2': 'ridership all benefiting the city as a whole. The important thing when we're looking at plans is to ensure that we're doing it in the right places. And certainly St Anthony's fits the description of a place that has been informed by a lot of planning over the years as it's been redeveloped.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The West Colfax plan for two from 2006 gets further into detail and incorporates the vision that we redevelop St Anthony's Hospital in such a manner that it catalyzes reinvestment in the larger study area while respecting, complementing and enhancing the stability of the surrounding residential neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The plan focuses on this site as an urban town center district. The scale and quality of development to promote an influx of new residents and mix of commercial activities that promote West Colfax, the neighborhood and the corridor to promote compact development that radiates from a dense core and centralized gathering place variable scale where greatest height and intensity'",
        "'speaker_2': 'in the core radiates to lower intensity at the fringe. By adopting the design overlay earlier in January for this site, that design overlay is specifically identified as ways to taper down height in this block is is specifically affected by that overlay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'From Pages 128 four 133 in the plan, calling your attention to the town center district, there are recommendations incorporated as guiding principles from the U.S. Anthonys task force that you may hear about today as well. For medium intensity development, a mixture of residential uses over active retail along 17th Avenue, transitioning to higher intensity on the south portion'",
        "'speaker_2': 'of BLOCK one. Predominantly residential development in taller structures. And we believe the proposed rezoning to see m x 12 retaining the d05 overlay affords the density vision and provides for appropriate transitions. And recommendations from that task force incorporate language says redeveloping St Anthony's in such a manner that it catalyzes reinvestment in the larger study area while respecting'",
        "'speaker_2': ', complimenting and enhancing the stability of the surrounding neighborhoods by identifying an optimal density range that assures economic viability of the site and then capitalizing on the views of mountains, lake and city lights and of course, zone districts with a zoning see a max 12 could allow a building up to 12 stories that can take take into account'",
        "'speaker_2': 'some of that vision. The general development plan. This all sounds like general development plan. While it's not a supplement to the city's comprehensive plan, is allowed by city council to consider it as part of the approval for a rezoning.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The GDP also talks about including larger residential buildings, to capitalize on an opportunity to offer views of the city, to locate buildings of a high intensity, to form the core of the redevelopment site, and provide opportunities for significant increases in residential density and employment.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Allow higher density residential uses that are necessary to attract desirable retail and services for the benefit of the surrounding community. And then the high concepts in the general development plan itself actually call out this block specifically as heights varying from 1 to 12 stories.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The design overlay effect results in a high transition that requires a three storey limitation between 17th and 16th for a distance of 60 feet from the street before it can go higher. And then along 17th Avenue, there is a restriction of five storeys within the first 43 feet from the right of way.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So that being said, that actually creates a tapering effect and provides an opportunity to put more of the density and height of the building toward the center of the cell phones like redevelopment area. With that, the GDPR codifying the overlay design district rezoning blocks one through six of the GDP area, 2d05, which we did earlier in February'",
        "'speaker_2': ', and then rezoning the subject property to see 12 D five. The proposed rezoning tonight are all enforcement mechanisms for implementing the 1 to 12 story recommendation from that GDP. On other review criteria, much broader MAP amendment results in regulations that are uniform across the district.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This just means that the owner and development will follow the regulations and see them x 12 and D or five. Further in the public health, safety and welfare of the CMCs 12 zone district requires upper storey setbacks adjacent to protected districts and promotes pedestrian scale design.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In addition, the overlay provides additional transitions with a three storey height limit along that lower density Stewart Street, where there's lower density development to the west and a five storey height limit along 17th. To create more of a pedestrian.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Urban scale. Along 17th. Across from the park. With regard to justifying circumstances, we're required to find that the land or surrounding environment has changed or is changing to such a degree that it is in the public interest to encourage a redevelopment of the area or to recognize the change character of the area through this rezoning, as well'",
        "'speaker_2': 'as many actions that the city has taken as the site has begun its redevelopment phase. There is change occurring to the south and east of the site and of course the site is subject to that change as well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Purpose and intent of the CRM. X12, the urban center context promotes safe, active, pedestrian scale, diverse areas, all of which are called for in all of the plans that support this rezoning on multiple building forums, including the apartment form CRM.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'X12 is intended to be applied to areas of intersection served primarily by major arterials, where a building scale of 3 to 12 story is desired, stories is desired. That is based on recommendations from the group in the West Colfax Plan and that the 12 storey height provides flexibility to allow variable heights, including taller buildings deemed appropriate to'",

        "'speaker_1': 'For the first one?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. So we have 45. Individuals signed up for tonight's public hearing. I'm going to go ahead and call the first five speakers. When you hear your name, if you could make your way up to the front bench here in front, that will really help us to speed things up.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Not that we're in a hurry, but we just want everybody to have their equal time. So the first one is Melinda Yearly Yuri. Next one is Sarah Lavatory. Next one is Cameron. Petron Tate. Take Vernon. Oh, she's not.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'She's on there. All right. That's okay. All right. Let me do that again. Sarah Laverty. Cameron. Bertrand. Tate. Vernon. Herman. Herman Blough and Brittany Vernon ticket. Please come to the front. Our first speaker is Sarah Laverty.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening. My name is Sarah Laverty and I am speaking as the applicant on behalf of EFG Cell. Sloan's Like One LLC, located at 4601 DTC Boulevard, Suite 130 Denver, Colorado. 80237. I would like to reinforce the basis for approving the rezoning of so stones like BLOCK one from C, Amex, five DEO to C Amex 12 DEO'",
        "'speaker_4': '. And the criteria set forth in section 12, four, ten, seven and 12, four, ten, eight of the Denver zoning code. Number one, this rezoning responds to a changing condition within the neighborhood. Most significantly, the closing down of the neighborhood's largest employer, St Anthony's Central Hospital.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'At this location, the subsequent and ongoing redevelopment of the vacated property with the new infrastructure and new uses, the opening of the Perry Street Light Rail Station one half mile away, and the recent rezoning approved one block away at Student Canal's.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Number two This rezoning is consistent with adopted plans, including the comp plan 2000 Blueprint, Denver and the West Colfax Plan. As previously previously detailed in the staff report. Number three, the rezoning is a uniform application of the district regulations.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It is not a one off rezoning taken without regard to the context. Rather, it is in response to the previously mentioned neighborhood changes guided by the goals of the previously mentioned adopted plans and as one rezoning among many anticipated in the city's efforts to revitalize the West Colfax corridor and develop a variety of mixed uses dense housing'",
        "'speaker_4': 'options around the West Line, light rail stations and the site of the former hospital. Number four. The rezoning is beneficial to the public health, safety and general welfare. For one, it follows the principles set forth in Blueprint Denver.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'By developing housing in close proximity to jobs, retail, transit and open space. Number five. Finally, this rezoning is consistent with the neighborhood context, description, zoned district purpose and the intent statements as there is no change to the underlying zone district, only to the proposed maximum height.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Our next speaker is Cameron. Cameron Bertrand.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I thank you. And I believe I have 6 minutes. Yes, thanks. Hi. My name is Cameron Bertrand. I live at 1145 Gaylord Street. I also work for EFC, South Sloan's Lake, and I'm also speaking in the stance of an applicant.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I wanted to reiterate what what Sara just said and dove more deeply into a very specific area, which is the degree to which we believe the proposed rezoning does conform with the city's adopted plans. And I really have two specific points I'd like to make.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The first is that the West Colfax plan requires that a general development plan accompany the application of new zoning to ensure the rational and strategic growth of the former San Anthony Hospital site. Not, as some may suggest tonight, to preempt the outcome of future rezonings, but rather to, and I quote here include standards for the development of'",
        "'speaker_9': 'streets, water quality management and infrastructure upgrades, and also to ensure adequate opportunity for property owners participation, community involvement and public comment. Over the course of 2013, the city's Community Planning and Development Department undertook precisely this effort for precisely these reasons.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So while the South Sloan's Lake General Development Plan alone is not a reason to support this rezoning, its existence does three important things. A It's part and parcel of conforming to the recommendations of the West Colfax Plan. It ensures that infrastructure capacity precedes the growth that follows it.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And finally, it ensures that the community has been meaningful, meaningfully consulted through the GDB process. We had over 60 public meetings and through the public process specifically for this rezoning. It has also been robust. Robust at the back of your packets, you will find a summary of the process that we went through, which includes four open houses'",
        "'speaker_9': ', six presentations to various registered neighborhood organizations, a telephone town hall meeting attended by more than 300 people, and an informational flier sent out to all registered neighborhood organizations in the vicinity. So a robust public outreach. The second point I'd like to make about the West Colfax plan is that it states clearly that future development should, and I'll'",
        "'speaker_9': 'quote here again, focus the most intense structures and uses to a dense core surrounding a community gathering place. Ring this dense core with medium intensity structures that taper in height, mass and scale to a fringe area where the town center blends with the surrounding neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Following more than 60 public meetings during the development of the South, phones like General Development Plan, the Chapel Plaza has been identified as that community gathering place and ground floor retail on Raleigh Street has been identified as that town center.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'As such, this rezoning conforms perfectly to the expectations of the West Colfax Plan and the previously approved design overlay district ensures that heights will appropriately taper to the surrounding neighborhood. Tonight, you may be shown a concept plan from the West Colfax small area plan that that accomplishes these same outcomes.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But using a different approach, I'd like to be clear that failure to adopt that specific plan doesn't make the South Sloan's Lake General Development Plan or this rezoning not compliant with the West Colfax Plan. Because the concept plan is just that a concept I'll quote directly from the West Colfax plan about that concept plan.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It illustrates one of many possible options for the configuration, massing and scale of the Saint Anthony Hospital redevelopment. And here I'd like to take a step back from the technical language of the plans and just be clear that the master plan that was put forward through those 60 community meetings and in the general development plan was done'",
        "'speaker_9': 'so with a purpose. And and one of those purposes was to address all of the recommendations in the West Colfax Quarter plan, including solar orientation. And simply put, putting buildings to the south end of this site would cast a shadow directly in the streets and public spaces that are so valued by the West Colfax Corridor plan.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And, and here I'd like to put forward a concept which is that which you may also hear tonight, which is that somehow buildings on the south end of the site excuse me, on the north end of the site would block the views of buildings on the south end of the site.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And it's just simply not a true statement. While it's true that a fort that a ten story building placed in front of a five story building would block the views of the five story building. It's equally true that a five story building in front of a ten story building would block the views of the bottom five floors'",
        "'speaker_9': 'of the ten story building. There's just no way to orient this site in a way that would increase the views in a way that is appreciably better than any other way. So it's appropriate to focus our efforts on solar orientation, on getting light into the streets and the plazas and minimizing the shadows on the existing neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'In closing, I would simply like to acknowledge that redevelopment on a scale of a project like St Anthony's is never easy and never universally supported. Some residents have been participating in this process for more than a decade, while other had moved into the neighborhood in the last year or two precisely because of the changes that are taking'",
        "'speaker_9': 'place. Tonight you will hear from both points of view and many in between. I I'm sure.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You can.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Conclude I'm all done. All right. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So much. Our next speaker is Tate Vernon.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Hello. I'm Tate Vernon. I was born in the neighborhood right there by the new library. And after college moved back into the neighborhood, my wife and I bought a house that, in a short five or six more years will be turned on our dream house.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But we started a family. This is our baby, Tennison. She's big on the neighborhood, too. Councilman Ortega already offered to hold her while I spoke. But it's a great neighborhood, and there are some wonderful, great things happening, largely due to what you guys, you people, men and women are doing here.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Our city council.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We got the new library. We've got this world class.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Park playground coming in. We've got the Perry Street Station. And we're here to ask you to keep it up. We need this kind of change to make our neighborhood great. And the reason I'm here, the one thing that we're missing is a good, comfortable, safe place to walk to businesses.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'As I try to take our baby out, just imagine walking down Colfax with a tattoo parlors and the pot shops and the used car dealers. There is nothing there I can take my baby into. And we're looking for this development that they're doing.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We're so excited that their shops and restaurants and businesses that are going to make it a wonderful place to go. But with a business and real estate background, the cute little businesses, shops and restaurants like 32nd Floor can't happen when there's not a retail base to support it when you don't.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'If we chop this off and limit the number of units, they can't get the funding to start to be a small business successful to be a great Denver's best new restaurant to be 52. It is a top of the town stuff.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'They need a big residential anchor, something that can be a landmark for a neighborhood. They can make these businesses working and thrive because if they don't have the support, they can't get the funding to start or they can't stay in business.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And then we have failed development with failed businesses and nobody wants that. There's a lot of people here that are trying to fight it because they don't want change. They don't want something different. Well, I've been in neighborhood long enough to know that I can't stop the change, but I can support you guys in what you're doing'",
        "'speaker_8': 'and creating good change that helps the neighborhood. And so being afraid of change doesn't help. Being afraid of failure, I think, is worse if.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'This thing doesn't go.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'If the shops don't thrive, if it's not a great place to be. It's not good for anybody. So I put in my vote for Tall to support the businesses. Baby Tennyson, who tried valiantly to stay awake to show her support for the redevelopment votes.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Tall because there will be more families and more friends for her.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Vernon. Our next speaker is Herman Boulogne. And if you could please pronounce your name correctly for this.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'My name is Hermine. Yes. Can you hear me?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, I can.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'My name is Herman Blough. I speak with an accent, so if you cannot understand what I say, please stop me and I will repeat it. I also will like to hand this down. To you, young lady.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So 40 years ago, my husband and I, after saving Darla. After Darla, we were able to attain the American dream. We bought a small house by Sloan's Lake. It had a backyard for a swing set a driveway for our small station wagon.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We were told that this was a necessity since we had kids and pets. As I like to put it, two legged and four legged rug rats. Many of our friends and neighbors lived the same dream. We were all happy, satisfied when we needed medical care.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'St Anthony's Hospital was the destination of choice. Even so, we are nervous about the expansion taking place on the old Stanton St Anthony's ground. We are somehow excited and accepting the fact that some growth is necessary and will improve our neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'It will be an asset to all of us to see five storey buildings built on this grounds. But 12, 16. 20 storey? No.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You. You. You, you.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Imagine this happening in your own back yard. Would you like it and be happy? Please use your good judgment. Don't look at a picture or a.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Plan.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'To make a decision. Pictures are deceitful. Don't believe that everyone who buys an expensive and luxurious condo we live in, it's privately owned condos get rented all the time, no matter what the owner bylaws says. The stakes are high for the developer.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Millions. For the people. Individuals. Groups that supports them. I'm not sure any more what really drives them. Definitely not the security and the well-being of their community. We all know statistics don't lie. Increased density brings problems. For us who oppose this changing of zoning.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We have a lot to lose. We have no choice but accept whatever your decision is as good citizens do. But please vote, as they say in French avec vote. But I'm a conscience with your soul and your conscience.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And remember. Your decision now will affect the future of this neighborhood forever. Now I have something else. It's an affidavit of Brian Malta. Brian Malta hereby affirm and see as follow.

        "'speaker_12': 'See the attached notice piece. For several weeks prior to the meeting and several weeks after the meeting, petitions in opposition to the proposed rezoning had been circulated among members of the Jewish community.

I also had the opportunity to cross-reference these names with the total database of the Westside Jewish Community.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'After comparing the names of the member who signed the petition opposing the rezoning with the total list of the members of the Westside Jewish Community, I am satisfied with my finding that the overwhelming majority of approximately 77% of the members of the Jewish community of the West Side of Denver opposed to the rezoning, the remaining 25% may'",

        "'speaker_2': 'We're in all due respect, we're not going to do that tonight because it eats up into everybody's time. So if you could refrain from making applause and other comments, I really appreciate it. Our next speaker is Britney Vernon, followed by Jude Aiello, David Goldblatt, Larry Ambrose and Bernard Stein.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Harder.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hi. My name is Britney Vernon.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I live at 14th and.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'To have this happen in my backyard.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think it's wonderful. My husband and I bought the most disgusting thing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'In the neighborhood three years ago. We were thanked by the neighborhood cops for doing so and we are turning it into our dream house over the course.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Of the next rest of our lives. We have been to so many meetings with AFGE that I think meaningfully consulted is the understatement of the year. I think I could give Cameron Bertrand's presentation by memory and maybe even draw the slides.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The AFGE has been so incredibly transparent. They've been so great to work with. They have come and answered every question. Cameron has stayed after there's been open houses, slide shows, pictures, I mean, ad nauseum. We have been meaningfully consulted.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'As far as the redevelopment at St Anthony's, we're very excited.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The only thing we're not super pumped about is that everything is apartments due to Colorado's liability laws and this tower would allow it to be condos, would allow there to be ownership, would allow people to move into West Colfax, not for a 12 month lease while they find something better, but move into West Colfax to make a'",
        "'speaker_1': 'home, to raise a family, to join our community. And that would just be so fantastic. As a parent of that little wiggle monster.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We are excited to have.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All those shiny new tax revenues to help Colfax Elementary. Wouldn't that be a fun thing to have more money for Colfax Elementary and our neighborhood needs retail. That is not scary. It would be really great to have cute coffee shops instead of used car lots.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It would be really great to have a place to have lunch. It would be really, really wonderful. And AFGE has been great to work with. Nava has shown us beautiful drawings and a wonderful plan. They have shown those shades studies that doesn't shade the wrong parts of the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They've been incredibly conscientious. We own five homes in West Colfax neighborhood, which we've bought over the years, and we own a four plex right across the street from the hospital. And as tenants love to complain, we have received.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Zero.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Complaints, not a single one. Everyone is excited.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'AFGE and Nava have been or AFGE.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I guess is. Who is in there now have been the most conscientious developers. It's been truly, truly amazing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Ms.. Vernon. For those of you that have already been at the podium and have exercised your right to speak, if you could please vacate the front row so that we can bring up the next people, the next speaker is Jude Yellow.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hi. My name is Judy. Alo and I live in Denver and at the time that St Anthony's was being sold, I was the land use chair for the Sloan's Lake Citizen Group. And I remember St Anthony's promising us that the task force that was put in place by the mayor would that that plan would be followed.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And they would only sell to someone who would do that plan. And as you know, the plan had called for the height to go toward the middle and toward the back toward Colfax, which is actually much closer to the light rail than 17th would would be.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You probably also remember me, some of you from 310 in the morning when we were doing a rezoning of Sloan's Lake and West Highlands. And the reason I bring that up is the only planning board member that voted in favor of the rezoning, even though eventually the City Council voted by supermajority to give us that rezoning.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The planning board member who who agreed with us said, you know, by allowing excess building where it shouldn't happen, what's happening is it decreases the chance that the kind of building that you want somewhere else isn't happening. He goes, I feel that because of what's happening in Sloan's Lake, that is the reason why Colfax has never improved'",
        "'speaker_1': '. A lot of this density should be going out there. This 12 storey building should be going out to Colfax. We shouldn't be getting one story marijuana factories and things on Colfax. This is where this development should be going.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Instead, Ifg is going to put a low income housing on Colfax because they won't have to put any low income housing because of the new rules on their property. So basically what I am asking is that you deny this reasoning.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It sets a precedent that could have influence on projects all over Denver. This was a flawed process. Not only was the St Anthony's task force plan, which was put into the Colfax Plan, which was adopted by council, it is being ignored.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The GDP that allowed for infrastructure up to 20 storeys and reduced open space was done administratively. So neither the public nor city council got to make any changes to that or have any influence on that. It is basically operating as a backdoor zoning because I'm sure you will be sitting there saying, oh, well, the GDP said they'",
        "'speaker_1': 'could go up to 20 stories. So what's the big deal about 12? The task force had recommended that the highest height be around maybe eight storeys and then go down toward the edges. The fact that, ah, the councilwoman from this district has accepted campaign funds from the owners of this property feels minuscule.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That is.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Inappropriate. If you could just stick.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To one subject.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. I would encourage the council to vote independently. I know that a lot of times council members defer to the area council person. This is a much too important issue to do that. Please examine it individually.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Okay. Before we go on, let's see if our timer is working. It's up and going.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes, it's going to be fine now.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Right? Our next speaker is David Goldblatt.'",

        "'speaker_10': 'Hi. Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you tonight. My name is David Goldblatt. I'm the president of the West Colfax Business Improvement District. I live in the neighborhood and I operate my business in the neighborhood. And we established ourselves in West Colfax when my grandmother was born on West Colfax in 1896.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We've lived there ever since. My office is housed in a building that our grandparents bought and lived in since 1920. I'm the one who first thank F, G and Ava. Their outreach into the neighborhood for this development has been more than gracious and very informative.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'With the development of a 12 storey building, six storey building, whatever is built there because of the lack of residential community of that neighborhood, we don't have the services and the businesses that we can have support. The neighborhood businesses can't survive without residents and residents can't survive without the business.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Increasing the amount of residential density will help bring business that we used to have. Over the 63 years that I've lived in the neighborhood in my life, I've watched business leave, disappear, go broke. With the development that's coming.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I can envision a lot of business that will come in because they will now be able to survive due to the increased density of the neighborhood, whether it's rental or purchasing and ownership. Ownership is the greatest, though, if they can do it.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The neighborhood will support higher business. Higher density will sustain the needed services in the extended neighborhood. What I mean by extended neighborhood, not only West Colfax, but the highlands to the north and to the neighborhood to the south of west.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Colfax by the light rail and south of the light rail. As of now, the services that we have there, we need to go to Edgewater to fulfill our needs or other parts of Denver. We would like to see West Colfax become a destination rather than a place to leave.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'All this will change the image of West Colfax, also West Colfax as the time has a very poor image in the eyes of people that's more or less known for prostitutes and drugs. We want to change that image.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'To change the image. You got to create density with people that are willing to work with the neighborhood and improve the neighborhood. And this is how it's going to happen. I hope that you will vote for the development, and I hope that more development comes out well after this development has completed, because I have no intention of'",
        "'speaker_10': 'moving from the neighborhood and I want to see it thrive. Thank you for your opportunity to speak.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you for joining us this evening. Our next speaker is Larry Ambrose. And Mr. Ambrose, you have 6 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I think that descriptor or for. I'd like to hand out this affidavit here to counsel for. Thank you. My name is Larry Ambrose. I live at 1750 Main Street. I am here tonight speaking in the capacity as the vice president of Sloan's Like Neighborhood Association.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I was at the time this development process has started, the president of Sloan's Lake Neighborhood Association. I have been encouraged by many people to just give up, forget about it. This is a done deal. Why are you even trying to say this?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'To tell people what you think? Because. This so much momentum behind it that you're not going to be able to influence city council? I do not believe that. I believe that you sit here tonight as judges in a quasi judicial capacity looking at this very objectively and considering the facts.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'When he AFGE first got involved in this program and this prior this particular development back in late 2011, they came to Sloan's Lake Neighborhood Association well as part of their very first outreach. They gave us a general idea of what they wanted to do.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And we said unanimously at our board meeting that they attended. We will have no problems with this development. If you just do one thing, that one thing is to follow the guiding principles of the Saint Anthony Task Force that are incorporated into the West Colfax Plan, which is to set your buildings, your tallest buildings, back towards Colfax'",
        "'speaker_10': '. I was at some of the meetings, and you will hear tonight from other people who who will testify that it wasn't just one guiding principle, but the main guiding principle, the main concern of 100 people that were involved in that process was that they do not do high rises on the park anywhere close to 17 avenue, that'",
        "'speaker_10': 'the concept was to build the buildings in a pyramid so that the shadows were minimized. Back towards Colfax, where there is already a tall building. We are not opposed to development. I am not opposed to development. We're not opposed to tall building.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It's not if you have tall buildings, but where you put them. And the plan and the process was very clear on that back in 2006. For a year, we talked about sloping down towards the park, having a plaza right on 17th, if possible.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The plan was never to allow high rises because, as you may know, high rises on parks have happened before in Denver and they have been stopped. Cheesman Park is a good example of that. So this process started when we said, please follow the Saint Anthony plan and the West Colfax plan.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'What you did not hear tonight in the Planning Department and the CPD's presentation to you, it talked about densities in the center. It talked about all the good things that are incorporated into the West Colfax plan. But you did not hear what you did not hear anywhere in Cameron Bertram's presentation or in that CPD plan was the'",
        "'speaker_10': 'guiding principle. And I will read this to you in its in the West Colfax Plan. Density should be centered toward the middle of the project and towards West Colfax. I presented to you tonight a affidavit from Dennis Cox.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Dennis was the head of the Sloan's Lake Citizens Group Zoning Committee at the time that he served on both the West Colfax Plan and the Saint Anthony Plan Task Force. Dennis has moved to Kansas, but he was integrally involved in this process.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And you will hear from other people tonight who are part of that process. They will tell you that what was meant by towards West Colfax was not to have the tallest buildings on 17th. That's the only problem with this project.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We're not opposed to restaurants and shopping and and development and people moving into the neighborhood. It's where you place these tall buildings and they're in the wrong place. And they chose to do this, I believe, not just for shadows, and it's understandable for economic reasons, but that is not the criteria by which city council return on investment'",
        "'speaker_10': 'is not the criteria by which you do zoning. And you must be in compliance with the small area plan, which is the West Colfax plan. It is an ordinance now for a long time. There was some debate about whether that Saint Anthony task force guiding principle applied to the West Colfax Plan, but that was definitively determined at'",
        "'speaker_10': 'the planning board in December when the city attorney said, yes, the guiding principles of the Saint Anthony plan are part of the West Colfax plan. Now you sitting in a quasi judicial capacity, just like a judge, have the responsibility to determine what was the intent of that ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'What is the intent? If it's not clear completely, then ask the people who were there as the legislators who wrote the law what the intent was. And the intent was not to have tall buildings on the park. It's that simple.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We're not opposed to AFGE. They can do their development. They're doing fine. They just shouldn't be putting these tall buildings right on the park. So tonight. We hope that you will take this into consideration from a quasi judicial point of view.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Listen to the people who were involved in that in that process, who will tell you that it was not sensible. It was the principle not to build tall buildings on the park.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. She's cute. And, you know.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I appreciate your enthusiasm, but if you could please restrain from applauding, it'll help everything move along a lot quicker. Our next speaker is Bernard Stein. Harder. And then we have Melinda, Uri, Shirley Sly and Bill Norton.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Hi. My name is Bernard Steinhauser.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I live I work in in West Colfax. I have for almost 15 years, I represent a handful of property.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Owners as a real estate broker who own property within blocks of the proposed zone change. I know that West.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Colfax would gain from a large infusion of new residences. The status quo of no significant.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Development has been tried and has failed.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'For decades. We need this project to spur business people to consider.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'West Colfax a real option.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We need more homeowners.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Who will care and advocate for our neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We need quality construction, which Nava will provide.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I am in favor of this rezoning.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Our next speaker is Melinda Erie and then Shirley Sly.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Thank you, I. She's passing out some maps and also some other information in your packets. My name is Melinda. Yuri, and.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You have 6 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Thank you. I am a resident of Northwest Denver I West Colfax District. I've been a member of both West Colfax Neighborhood Association and the slums like Neighborhood Association. So the petitions, the petitions that are in your packet have been signed recently to show and we'll show you what that what that consists of.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I know when Susan Shepherd in her office here in Highlands area, she was immediately just. There are a lot of issues right away that happened regarding zoning. And I know that that had to be a challenging time because there are just so many things going on.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And neighbors, you know, were really in an uproar because of the blueprint. Denver They had not understood what those changes might be. So first, the first thing on at that time was Highlands and 32nd, where the zoning was TMX five on 32nd and lower.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And at that time, the neighbors, when they discovered that they were upset and they wanted to have Susan Shepherd assist them in down zoning. That said, the developer could not build the same x five zoning in that location.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I know she looked into that and eventually the decision on that was that the six five zoning stayed because the neighborhood group did not act when the blueprint Denver had been established and did not oppose it at that time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So she voted and they voted to keep the C-Max five in in that location. And that was that was just a non change. It did not get down zoned. The next one was 38th and Lowell, where there is a C-Max five location.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Neighbors wanted it to be down, zoned. And again, Susan discussed that if it had been discussed during the Blueprint Denver opposition, then it would have been considered. But it did. It also state as a C-Max five and that developer will continue to develop that as it was originally designed.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Now we're here at a infill project at St Anthony's. Originally it was a C max five zoned lot. The land was C-Max five at the time that PFG purchased the ground as well. The neighbors, as you've heard, have been very involved.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Both West Colfax Neighborhood Association and the Sloan's Lake Neighborhood Association were both involved at times of developing a plan that was a very intensive plan designed to help guide the building of Sloan's Lake at the Saint Anthony location.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'One of the documents there, you'll see that at one point when when the Stones Lake Neighborhood Association was not in agreement with what Ifg was wanting to do, they decided to go and just work exclusively with West Colfax Neighborhood Association because they were not in opposition of the plans that something that ESG was putting forward.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'What I in this in this particular case, if if the councilman of our district is consistent interactions, she would not vote for an up zone as this is beyond the scope of the the blueprint Denver discussion. And it is it is outside of that window of time in which that opposition would have taken place.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The plans that that people have discussed here about the neighborhood plans were very, very clear on, as Larry had mentioned in his discussion about the buildings being closer to the Colfax section of the development and not right on the corners and front of 17th Avenue where there are pedestrian issues and other issues there.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Again, this map that we have here, this this is one that you have in your packet now this this orange sections, because Susan Sheppard, at one point it decided that she didn't want to listen to other voices that were outside of the zone.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Could you just limit your comments to what we're speaking about?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Oh, I'm sorry. I'm just saying, the only reason that this is being drawn up here is so that we can show the council that there is opposition, that they may hear.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That and that it on the verge of a.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Oh, I'm sorry. No, I don't mean that. It's not intended for that. I just go right ahead. Okay. I'm saying is that basically there was a discussion at one time that the that the petitions that were signed earlier were too far away from the central space.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we we got rid of those petitions. And then we focus now only on the space that is considered right imminently around the the location of the development. So that's the only reason I'm speaking like that, because that is where those, these new orange the orange area is the area of the homes that you have petitions in'",
        "'speaker_1': 'your packet with signatures. They are made from the area exactly around St Anthony's site. So these people are the most impacted people that you're going to. We talk to these people are not non. They are not against development.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They are they want a logical development that is in scope and size, logical. And they also want it to stay true to the plans that they worked on for years and years. Regarding the location of these tall buildings, if they are to even exist at all.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So and again, you know, we are sad in a way that the West Colfax and Sloan's Lake neighborhood associations have somehow been affected by this development because ultimately we've always been good neighbors.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And thank you. Your time is out. Okay. Thank you. State it. Our next speaker is Shirley Schley and then Bill Norton. And then finally Goulard, Rafael Espinosa. Good evening. Hi. Good evening.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'My name is Shirley Sly. I live at 2121 Osage and have lived in the loan's like neighborhood for over 40 years. In 2005.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And 2006.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I served as a member of the St Anthony's Redevelopment Task Force. The members of the task force were appointed by Mayor John Hickenlooper.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'With the approval of City.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilman Rick Garcia. It was made up of community leaders, members of various city departments and the administration of St Anthony's Hospital. We all thought.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That since we were.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Invited to serve by the mayor and he had appointed members of his administration to serve with us and help us with the plan that the work we did would matter. We took our work seriously and worked hard to come up with what we thought would be the guiding principles for the development of the project.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Our vision was one of a beautiful development which would incorporate green and friendly places where people could gather. A promenade that would connect the park to the development. And then on to West Colfax, a project that would protect the vistas of the park and lake, even from the interior, interior of the project, a project that would blend'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the residential area of the surrounding neighborhood on the edges of the project and work back into the interior and toward West Colfax with the higher density buildings, which would help revitalize West Colfax. We recognized that the development would not be done immediately, that it would take time, and our recommendation was that there would be ongoing community involvement'",
        "'speaker_1': '. So the voice of the community would always be present in decision making about the future of this site. Now we are presented with a development that had no community involvement. The so called community meetings that the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Developer conducted.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And those that I attended were always.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The same group of people and were contacted.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'More as a report on the status of the project. Instead of asking for input from the community. As I walked the neighborhood near the so-called Ground Zero, the blocks on the immediate perimeter of the development, I met many residents who had no idea what was being proposed for the site.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'When the community was involved and asked for two things a little bit more green space on the project, we were turned down. When we beg that the tall building's not beyond 17th Avenue, but placed in the center and towards West Colfax.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We were ignored. A major part of the task force recommendation was that the project help revitalize West Colfax as proposed. This project does not do that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It proposes real.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Retail on Raleigh Street and away from West Colfax. In fact, hindering the revitalization of West Colfax. The zoning change before you tonight does not meet the guidelines of the St Anthony's task force recommendations.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Your time is up.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Our next speaker is Bill Norton, followed by five old Goulard, Rafael Espinosa. No, Mr. Naughton.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'No, I don't think it does. Mr. Norton hasn't stood up, so I'm assuming.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Will you please pronounce your name?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Shirley. My name is five, a gaylord. And my wife and I have lived in worked in the West Coast House neighborhood for the last 23 years. We would respectfully urged the City Council to approve the rezoning request being made to allow eight and 12 storey condominiums to be built on block one of the former St Anthony site'",
        "'speaker_10': '. The issues that divide people on the rezoning that arise at virtually every public meeting are easily understood. The tension is between very understandable personal preferences and discomforts versus enormous and far reaching community benefits that can help remake the West Colfax Corridor and environs over time.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The opposition is pained by the prospect of increased traffic. We forget that St Anthony's has been closed for three and a half years and the absence of close to 3000 employees plus visitors has given us an unrealistic hiatus in traffic that will now pick back up as the development progresses.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Traffic will increase, but not due to this rezoning. BLOCK One is already zoned for five storey apartments, which will provide more units than the proposed condominiums, and therefore at least as much traffic as the rezoning will bring. Five stories or 12 stories, same traffic impact.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So that is really not an issue. Plus, the developers have stated that they will provide 400 off street parking places as part of their project when zoning only requires 174. People are concerned about increased property taxes. Even if the developer were to dedicate block one to be a bird sanctuary, the light rail, the balance of the improvements'",
        "'speaker_10': 'on the site, the upscale building around Sloan's Lake and the proximity of all this to downtown town are all going to increase property values and consequently property tax. A fact of life, not the fault of this rezoning. People are concerned that a 12 storey building will shade 17th Avenue and create an ice problem in the winter.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The truth is, so will the five storey building and the developers created the Metro Tax District. That will tax only the properties within the new development to generate funds specifically for such maintenance. People are disturbed by the change in esthetic.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The truth is that just one block north on Quitman is the Metro Manor that is 18 stories tall and hardly noticed by anyone as diminishing the quality of life on the West Side. I've talked to some of the opponents and they weren't aware of the height of the metro man or one of their neighbors, and some weren't'",
        "'speaker_10': 'even aware that it existed at all. Indeed, traveling east on 17th Avenue, the skyline is dominated by the downtown skyscrapers. So tall buildings are really not foreign objects. We've come to accept them as part of our neighborhood landscape without realizing it, just as the residents on the north side of the lake have come to accept the new'",
        "'speaker_10': 'rectangular multi-family units that have popped up on every corner, with progress comes change. The petition from Maltese Manor, rejecting all heights above five storeys is somewhat humorous since they are 14 storeys high and wanting to deny this developer that same privilege they enjoy seem somewhat unjust.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Passions against the project have run high. Overzealous petition seekers have urged people to sign in opposition to 20 or more storied buildings, which aren't even under consideration. Obtaining signatures with incorrect information. My son and I were approached to sign such a petition.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'One of our neighbors was told that since he didn't own his own home and didn't have children in a local school, he would not benefit from this project and thus should sign a protest petition, which he did. He and his wife withdrew their signatures and signed in favor of the rezoning.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Once they received more factual information, a written, expanded version of my presentation here presenting pros and cons was hand delivered to a significant sample of people in our community. 28 people who signed a petition in opposition asked in writing to have their names removed from these protest positions.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Petitions. 47% of the respondents signed on in approval of the rezoning. I am not a statistician, but the survey sample information that I have gathered after Mr. Malthouse, his efforts that you have heard about earlier, seem to indicate that approximately 66% of our committee may be neutral or in favor of this rezoning.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'What constitutes to diminish the quality of what continues to diminish the quality of life on West Colfax corridor is 14 used car lots, two tattoo parlors, 82 arrests in 2014 excuse me of prostitutes and their clients. Those are deep these numbers.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'A cremation store and so on and so forth. There is a dearth of family oriented amenities. This rezoning will introduce a population of residents with more disposable income and not only an expectation that there will be branch banks, dry cleaners, gift shops, coffee shops, etc., but the economic clout that will attract these and more family friendly amenities'",
        "'speaker_10': '. This is an economic fact of life, a proven result following upscale development projects around the country. The additional benefit of stabilizing effect of owner occupied units in the development mix is a known or real estate fact of life.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'This is a good thing. There is always a price for progress. We feel certain that the personal discomforts anticipated by our neighbors will be quickly displaced by the benefit and rejuvenation they will enjoy as a result of the City Council.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Proving the rezoning of block one. Is this a perfect solution to all the things that ail West Colfax corridor? No, but perfect should never be an enemy of the good. Thank you for your consideration.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Our next speaker is Rafael Espinoza, followed by Ben Stetler. Better friend, Deli, Diana. Deep voice, deep post. And Gerald Frank. And let's let's put Jim deep voice in the in the mix as well. You could come up to the bench that would really help us move things along.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'All right, I'm going.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Off script because there's a little bit of a history lesson that needs to occur here.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'This is what you're seeing here today. Both sides as a colossal failure or failure of leadership in north Denver. And what I mean by that is this was a great opportunity. Seven beautiful, pristine, you know, access to the largest.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Body of water in the city of Denver.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'This could have been a confluence, a way to bring West Colfax and Sloan's Lake to established neighborhoods with different, very different flavors together.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Did you state your name?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Oh, Rafael Espinoza, 21 to 1, Clay Norton. The. And so I'm frustrated because the developer has always had even before they went through the pre process, eight storey zoning on Colfax, they could have shown good faith to this community by developing in that eight story zoning.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'A catalyst for West Colfax and instead they sat on it, got their approval and now they're in the process of getting tax increment. They're going to waive their property and sales tax for that up to the next 25 years for that price property to have a theater that sells alcohol.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'If that's not a viable business model, why are we investing I mean, subsidizing that? You know, we're basically deferring our property tax in our general fund money for schools and what have you police. So when Deidre talked about the up zoning, I mean, the need for larger and more density, that's what the CMC's five that's in place'",
        "'speaker_8': 'is you have a community that is eschew single use and right across the street you're proposing five stories. That is a viable business model in any part of this city. You know, if a lot of developers would love to have this proximity to that lake with CMC's five, they could have done a lot with that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Instead, what they've done is, like I said, they're taking their tax credit, put in theater. They wrapped they put in just general market on blocks five and six with the with the residential. And then here on their prime piece of real estate, they're now trying to salvage this project by putting in a proposal that you've heard.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'People already complain. I mean, confused this with Nava. Nava is a developer. That proposal is not on the table. It is beautiful. It is for sale. But this zoning does not require for sale of a 100% rental project with zero affordability component.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Could go in here tomorrow if you guys approve this. And that is unacceptable. The things that have been shown to this community are not the reality.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And you guys need to look past that. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. Espinoza. Next up is Ben Stetler. You have 6 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Hi there. Good evening. My name is Ben Stetler. I'm co-president of.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The West Colfax Association of Neighbors.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Where registered neighborhood organizations in the city and county of Denver with just north of 600 members. First, I want to thank you all for your time. I know there's a lot of hearings this evening, so I will try and be as brief as possible.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I also want to thank Councilwoman Susan Shepherd. Times it seems to be a bit of a thankless job, but you've been there every step of the way, listening to all sides. And I want to thank you for that support for doing that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'A Brief History of our Neighborhood Organization. On September 9th, we held a vote. There were 63 folks in attendance in our neighborhood. At that meeting of those 63, this is September 9th, obviously, 2014. Of those 63 folks. 57 folks voted in favor of block one.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Six were opposed. Of those six, two lived within the boundaries of our R.A.. Some folks have sniped at our membership numbers, calling us nothing more than an email list and criticizing the number of folks attending that meeting. I've got to say, I'm really proud that it's not uncommon for our organization to have 6370 folks in attendance.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And those are folks that represent the neighborhood's wishes and desires. I'm also really proud that as our numbers have grown, we represent many different interests of this community culturally, economically. We represent a large swath of this area. And I'm proud of that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We also, as of today, submitted nearly 70 letters of support for this project. In addition, thank you all heard Mr. Goulard speak eloquently to those people who signed statements of support for this project, as well as rescinded their signatures from the petition.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I know a lot of people will speak to why this project is great for our neighborhood. I will keep that part brief. Suffice it to say that density is needed in this neighborhood. We've got a problem in this neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There's an economic problem. Too many of the people living there don't have a way up. And while I'm not an expert in economics, I went out and talked to a few people who are. And despite their political leanings, you need people investing in the community to support jobs for all folks in that community, living wage jobs to'",
        "'speaker_6': 'help pull people out of poverty. I know that that may seem to be kind of a weird situation of why does why then therefore support a 12 story, you know, project. But the fact of the matter is that will bring people into our neighborhood that can provide an economic underpinning to support the businesses, to help all folks'",
        "'speaker_6': 'in our community.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Butler, your time is up.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Oh, I saw the green light. Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Oh, I apologize. You have 6 minutes. It's not. Oh, okay.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I will. Sorry. My time probably needs to be up, so I will make this really. I'll try to wrap this up really fast.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I do want to speak.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Though, not only does our organization strongly support this project, but to some of the tactics that have been used in opposition to this project. I think it's important, you know, reasonable minds can do and will disagree. Very good people disagree with this project.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Very good people agree with this project. At the end of the day, I guess what his troubled me is I've received emails and phone calls asking why a 30 story, a 24 story, a 16 story building is going along 17th Street.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And the fact of the matter is, many folks here have signed a petition against a project that does not exist. That's relevant. Right. We can all disagree around building placement if we support 12 stories or four against 12 stories.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But the fact of the matter is.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Those are the facts.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This is not going to be a three story building. This is not going to be a 24 story building. This is not going to be a 16 story building. And I think it's really disingenuous to mislead folks and to not give them the proper information.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'EFG has held over 60 public meetings. Nava alone, I believe, has held close to ten public meetings. The community has had ample.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Time to weigh in on this project, and I would say both.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Through the results that our organization has, as well as talking to a good deal, many a great deal.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Of people.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Most folks are really behind this project because what it represents for our community, the catalyst.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That it will provide to our community. So I do want to say.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That while folks.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Can disagree again with building placement, it's really important to stay true to the facts. And this is a 12 story building. It's not a three story building. And I do want to read one thing. Bertha Gonzales, a 61 year resident of West Colfax, wrote a letter in support of this rezone and in relevant part wrote, I would'",
        "'speaker_6': 'also like to point out that someone came to my door representing the opposition. They told me that the building would be 24 stories tall and painted a very negative picture of how this would affect our neighborhood. I am sorry to say that I signed that petition under false pretenses.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think regardless of wherever you are on this project, it's the right thing to do for the neighborhood and facts are important. Thank you for hopefully supporting this project this evening.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Our next speaker is better. Ferndale, Fair and Deli.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Very good. And I do very good. All right. Madam President, members of City Council, my name is Jennifer in Dili and I reside at 1641 Stuart Street in Denver. And I basically live directly across the street from the old St Anthony Hospital.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I knew when I purchased my home in July of 2012 that the hospital was going to be torn down and made way for a mixed use development. I'm here tonight to oppose the rezoning of the partial at the southeast corner of 17th Avenue and Stuart Street from a height of five stories to 12 stories.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I have regularly attended weekend community meetings and others regarding St.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Anthony's.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Including the meeting last fall where a vote was taken in favor of changing the height limit for that parcel. A vote of 16 or so people in favor of zoning, however, is not indicative of the neighborhood as a whole, nor is it a fair representation of residents who live in the Sloan's Lake area who oppose the change'",
        "'speaker_1': '. During these meetings, it has been stressed to speakers and artist renderings of what the proposed area would look like. It has also been stressed continually at these meetings that the new that the new construction in the area would also reflect what is already zoned from the area a height limit of no more than five storeys and architecture'",
        "'speaker_1': 'to closely match what is already.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Namely single family homes, townhomes and row houses. I am in favor of responsible sound development rowhouses and townhomes towering no more than five stories. Not a drastic change in development to 12 stories that will gobble up the entire corner at 17th and Stewart.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I hope that you will vote against this request with the thought in mind that most residents in the area oppose this change. And I hope that you will listen to your constituents, that you will keep our best interests in mind, in mind that constructing a 12 storey building is not in the best interests of those who live'",
        "'speaker_1': 'there, nor would it be the best representation of this area. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Our next speaker is Diana DeForest. Please pronounce it correctly because.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You did well. My name is Diana DeForest and I am a resident at 26th Equipment and I'm a fairly new resident. My husband and I are longtime residents of Highland Ranch, and we were moving up to be in our retirement home, our dream home, and we specifically chose this area for several reasons.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'One was the some of the volunteer work that we had done in the West Colfax area through Extreme Community Makeover and through Confluence Ministries, doing tutoring for children at Colfax Elementary. And we were very excited to be a part of the transitioning of this neighborhood and looking at it in a way that would be beneficial not only'",
        "'speaker_1': 'for those coming in, but for those that are staying. And to try to make sure that there was affordable housing and services for current residents and new residents. And I can tell you that some of our the reaction of our friends from Highlands Ranch, when they found that we were moving into the West Colfax area, was shock'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and dismay, concerned about our personal safety. What about the prostitutes and the drugs and oh, my gosh, you know, you've already got a dog, but you better get a bigger one. And so we really were excited and we still are excited.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We feel that we have moved into the best place possible. One of the top priorities that we had for our retirement years was walkability. We wanted to be able to walk to the store. We wanted to be able to walk to dinner.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We wanted to be able to walk and see friends. We have become involved with Sloan's Lake Neighbors Group. We are involved with Confluence Ministries. We are involved with the We Can the West Colfax Association of Neighbors. We feel in the short time that we have been here, that we are embedded in this neighborhood and that the most'",
        "'speaker_1': 'important for this neighborhood is to look towards the long term future, not just for those that are currently here. Although I greatly respect the history of the people that are here, they have been a huge part in making this a place where we wanted to move into, but also to look towards the future for the others, for'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the benefit of those that will be coming. And the changes need to happen now. Not in the next five years, not in the next ten years. Thank you very much for your time and consideration. I hope you approve it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Our next group of speakers are Darryl Frank, Jim Dede voiced Maurice Scott, Jane Parker, Ambrose and Nadia Hafez. Patrick, if you could come to the front row, please. Mr. Frank.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you, Madam President. My name is. I'm usually called Jerry Frank, and people may recognize me more readily that way. I'd like to begin by telling you two facts about my personal background. I used to teach in the Merced.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Program Masters.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Of Urban and Regional Planning, and I specifically taught urban and or economic and social factors in development. The second thing I'd like to mention is that long, long ago, a council of thoughts and I served as colleagues in the legislature, and she's obviously aged better than I.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But but I carried the text. I carried the bill that put tax increment financing into the Colorado statutes on a debate that's going to be longer than this one tonight. I read the West Colfax Neighborhood Plan six or seven years ago, I guess.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And when I didn't read carefully the the plan for the development of the site of the site, but I was told that it was in conformance. I read in the newspaper that it was in conformance with the West Colfax plan.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I think that it is not. What it has done is flipped it and made this a 17th Avenue project, not a Colfax project. And I would like to focus on three deficiencies, like you just mentioned, and three deficiencies in this plan and then be the bearer.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I I'm afraid of some bad news for those who are looking on West Colfax for rescue from this. The three things that I'd like to mention is that this project is terribly deficient. The project itself is deficient in open space.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And compared to the region, to the area around it, it is terribly deficient in open space and will attack the park. It will pollute the water of the lake further and add to air pollution. Secondly is the traffic problem on 17th.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'This project is designed appears to be designed to dump 3500 vehicles twice a day onto 17th Avenue. And let me tell you that 17th Avenue is a killer street. There are a bunch of us, including the merchants, who are trying to reduce traffic on 17th Avenue, both at Federal and at Sheridan.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And we're going to do it. And I don't know what will happen. And thirdly, I would like to talk to you about economic development. As I said, I'm an economist who has a specialty in in redevelopment or in the economics.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Frank. Your time is ended. Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you very much. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Our next speaker is Jim Deep Voice, first followed by Maurice Scott, followed by Jean Parker Ambrose, followed by Nadia Hafez Patrick.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'My name is Jim Date Faust. I live at 26th and equipment. I am in favor of this project. I'm a business owner. I have a business in Denver and a business in Wheat Ridge. I think this project will help support the business I am and the businesses around me.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I like the idea of the mixed use. I think it's excellent. I like the idea that the building is on the north side. I am a registered professional engineer in the state of Colorado. It makes sense. I am.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'When you look at the way the sun goes, it's not. I understand there'll be some shadows on 17th Avenue, but it won't be anything. Like if it was further south, it would really shade a lot of those buildings.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think it's an excellent job. I think they've done a good job. I hope and wish that you do approve it. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Hi. Good evening. My name is Maurice Scott and I live on the corner of 17th and Utica. And in the interest of time, because there are a lot of other crucial issues outside of this one that need to be discussed.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I just want to let you all know that I am in favor of the project. And while I'm new to that neighborhood, I've been born and raised in northeast Denver and frequented that part of town often every summer.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Jane Parker. Ambrose, I have a.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I have to. It's a Bill Moyers piece on Central Park in New York. My name is.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Jane Parker Ambrose, 17th and May, president of.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sloan's Lake Neighborhood Association. 29th Avenue to Colfax.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Julian to Sheridan. And we.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Stand in opposition.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'To.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Picnic for.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Lake maintenance staff and District one police. We tolerate a multitude of racist walks events grown due to the water and open park views. We helped in designing the canopy at the popular Melrose Inspiration Garden 19th and Meade. The structure was created focused on views of the Lake Park and create a place of solitude where people could absorb'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the garden. If a tall building is built on 17th, it will effect this lovely space by blocking the view of the mountains, especially Mount Evans. Architect Hoyt not only designed Red Rocks, the rotunda of the library on Broadway, but also Lake Middle School for the views.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Many generations of students have enjoyed the views of the Lake Park and mountains. If a tall building was built on 17th, this would affect this group. I sat on the St Anthony's Redevelopment Task Force Committee. We asked for two story buildings along 17th with an open plaza where people could sit and congregate, socialize.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Look at the lake. Since the beginning of humanity, man has naturally been drawn to live near water. Our group visualized terrace buildings to increase property values with views for many people. At the end of the process, when the formal document was written, we had to accept a maximum of 3 to 5 story buildings on 17th.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But with the tallest buildings being built, set back closest to Colfax, not to the park. The reason for this pyramid structure was to eliminate shadows being cast on the park and into the neighborhood. Please look at the Bill Moyers piece on Central Park in New York.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Nine shelters in the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Also, many.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'People cannot afford to visit our lovely mountains and get out of town. They rely on this park to recreate, re-energize. The reason for public parks is not only to create a space of beauty, a place to commune with nature, but to control violence and crime by helping people to air frustrations through healthy physical activity.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The federal guideline is ten acres per 1000 people. Northwest Denver is well below the average four acres. The developers have to enclose the park and have.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Referred to them both. If you can conclude your comments, your time is up.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. Thank you. I asked city council to block this reason. I stick to the West Colfax plan that we spent several years developing. Keep Denver beautiful. I know you care about the city. Focus on creative are creating time spent.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you so much. Thank you, Kate. Our next speaker is Nadia. And if you could please pronounce.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Your life as is close enough. But it's Nadia. Hafez Patrick. Okay. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I live at 1410 Stewart Street, which is roughly a block and a half away from the rezoning project that we're talking about today.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And as someone that will be directly affected by the traffic, by by the extra people, by everything that we've been talking about this evening, I can't stress enough how much we need this in our neighborhood. When my husband and I first moved to this neighborhood about three years ago, the Stones Lake Development Project was still sort of'",
        "'speaker_1': 'a pipe dream for a lot of us that were living in West Colfax. I know that there had been a lot of plans that were talked about, but there was really no concrete vision, no financiers behind it. What we have today is an actual, tangible product that will make the neighborhood better, and to oppose it without any'",
        "'speaker_1': 'reasonable alternative just seems absolutely crazy to me. The representatives of EFG have been amazing in approaching everyone in all of the neighborhoods about what they want in this location. And one thing that we have told them time and time again is what we need is for sale places for people to live.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We don't need more apartments. We don't need more townhomes that people are going to rent. What we need is people that have ownership of the community and have that kind of pride. I have that kind of pride in West Colfax and I want everyone that wants to live in that neighborhood to have the same thing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I might not have mentioned it before, but I'm also the co-president of the West Colfax Association of Neighbors and along with Ben Stetler. And so I can tell you that. Every single person that comes to our meeting wants to know what's happening with this project.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They're excited about it, and they should be because there's great things happening in our neighborhood. This would offer us the kind of density that we need and also offer people that might be a little bit curious about West Colfax, the opportunity to come by a condo that they would really, really like, that the plans that have been'",
        "'speaker_1': 'set forth are beautiful. I'm sure that you've seen them all, and I just can't stress enough how much we need this in this neighborhood. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Our next.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Group.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Of speakers, Thomas Trujillo. Carole MC Lennon, Marie Bien Benedict's. Amen. Lucero and Greg Kerwin. Q Please come to the front. Thomas. Trujillo. Here is Trujillo going once. Okay. How about Carroll? Okay. Let's keep going. Marie Benedict's.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. My name is Marie Benedict's. I live in West Highland, Denver. Time, time and time again in 2013, when the GDP underlying this rezoning was being discussed, citizens of northwest Denver rose up in opposition. The majority of speakers at two planning board hearings strongly opposed it, specifically because of the excessive heights and lack of open space'",
        "'speaker_1': '. 723 people signed a petition to the mayor and his appointees asking them not to approve this plan unless heights were lowered and the open space increased. The mayor refused to see them. That is not democracy. The petition is here and it specifically mentions 12 and 20 story buildings, just for clarity.'",
        "'speaker_1': '723 signatures. I'm going to hand it in in a second. Among many things, residents pointed out that the GDP was in clear conflict with plans adopted by the city for this area. It's also in conflict with existing zoning.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That is not democracy. I'm a member of West Highland Neighborhood Association. We were told by Councilwoman Sheppard that she was not interested in hearing from several surrounding neighborhoods, claiming instead that the West Colfax Neighborhood Organization with 550 members supported the plan.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That turned out not to be true. The 550 members seemed to be an email list, and the support turned out to be a SurveyMonkey poll taken by 40 people. 21 of them were in support. 19 others were against had concerns or didn't have enough information.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That is not democracy. This project would have benefited from a council or councilperson facilitating dialog, enabling community input, and representing voters in a constructive discussions to create a project that better serves the community instead of playing out different neighborhood organizations against each other.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Marie, if you could stick to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'What we have will do.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Today, you have the opportunity to be champions of democracy to ensure that people have a voice in Denver City government. I urge you to listen to the people and deny this application for a blanket up zoning until adopt until more concrete plans have been developed, plans that take into account adaptive plans and citizens input plans'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that address and mitigate legitimate concerns from neighbors. Please deny this application and demand a plan to unit development. Appear to be a champion for democracy today. Listen to the people. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Armand Lucero. And Greg Kerwin.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Good evening. My name is Greg Kerwin. I'm a resident of East Denver, but I'm also a co-chair of the Inter Neighborhood Cooperation Zoning and Planning Committee. And the document that I'm handing to you is from and sees entire delegation, and I'll comment on that at the end of my comments.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I'm a native of Denver, and I would ask you to follow the tradition of George Cranmer, director of Parks and Recreation, 100 years ago, who helped set up this fantastic group of city parks that we have. Be one of the great leaders like Mr. Cranmer, protect Sloan's Lake Park.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Don't contribute to its destruction and commercialization. Once you allow tall buildings next to the park, there is no turning back. You will have defaced and degraded one of Denver's crown jewel City Parks Act as quasi judicial decision makers.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Tonight, with each councilperson making his or her own independent decision based on the actual evidence. Before, you do not approve a zoning change that is not consistent with the adopted local area plan. The plan you've heard about many times tonight, which calls for the density along Colfax, not along Sloan's Lake Park.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And the most important issue I want to address before you is the role of a general development plan. And in fact, what you should not be doing with that reject the pernicious argument from this developer and from others to treat the general development plan as an adopted plan.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It is not even your city attorney's office recognizes the folly of this argument. A GDP, as this council well knows, is an infrastructure planning document, not a plan that the Council ever approved. This Sloan's Lake GDP was never approved by this council and does not have the force of an adopted plan.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And that's what brings me to the handout that I gave you at a ANC delegate meeting of people all over the city last Saturday that Councilwoman Sussman attended. The entire ANC delegation approved the resolution that is in front of you, which has two pieces.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'One is that a CDP does not constitute grounds upon which zoning changes should be granted, does not undergo an approval process that has the integrity and scrutiny of a zoning change process, does not receive council approval, and does not have the effect of law as to its conformance to small area plans.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That principle is important to people citywide. Please honor it. That's why the ANC delegation approved it. And the other change, which I hope is common sense to this council, but which unfortunately people feel is being violated regularly, that zoning changes need to conform with small area plans and changes that violate the clear intent and language of a'",
        "'speaker_9': 'plan. Set a dangerous precedent for this Council. Please reject this zoning change before you tonight and honor the tradition of George Cranmer and predict to Sloan's Lake Park from irreparable harm.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Our next speaker is Thomas Trujillo, followed by Carol McLennan.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Excuse me. Thank you. My name is Thomas Trujillo.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I live at 700 Rolley Street, which is a community a bit south of of Sloan's like. We would certainly have used Sloan's Lake Emergency and have many times. And my concern is that West Colfax is. Should be my street my commercial street.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And it since I was a child has not been that commercial street. I remember as a child it was my father was quite fond of the delis and would bring home Jewish specialties that Chicano families never, ever got except us.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I think that this plan will not help Colfax any more than just following the zoning as it is written. I spent some time a couple of years ago, maybe 40 hours, worrying about the zoning in my neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Mr. Lopez and I and and many others discussed details that made me crazy about the zoning. And we decided at the end that we were happy with it. It was a compromise, but everybody was happy. And I suspect that the people in North Denver did, too.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And if they didn't, they were stupid. And if you want to allow people who were stupid to change their zoning anytime they want, I think that's fine. But if you want to follow the zoning that everybody spent so much hard work on, then I think you you should.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And that it would be the best thing for West Colfax if that zoning were followed. I don't think we need gigantic buildings in the Swan Lake site. I think we need five storey buildings and yes, we need density on the Sloan's Lake site, but not gigantic building density.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And yeah, I agree that maybe if those buildings were closer to Colfax, they might affect Colfax more rather than 17th. And I drive down 17th all the time, and I'll tell you it, Sheridan 17th is a scary street.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Sheridan In 17th is going to have accidents and will and they're going to be some bad one someday. And if you add a whole bunch of people to 17th Avenue, they're going to be bigger accidents and they're going to be more often.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And you guys are going to be spending money on making 17th and Sheridan and 17th and federal better intersections. So think about the money you'll be saving if you don't cause gigantic buildings on this Sloan's Lake site. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I appreciate you listening to me. I hope you have wisdom tonight.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. Hill. Is Ms.. McClellan here? My apologies, I. I understand you were in room 391, and I didn't give you enough time to get here.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Oh, no. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't hear my name. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'My name is Carol McLennan. I live at 2242 Ivanhoe Street, Denver. And I'm a partner in Pleasant Hill Properties, a small real estate company, residential development company with properties in West Colfax and Villa Park. I am not a resident of the area.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I am not individually affected by the outcome of this rezoning hearing. But I do want to say the letter from our company supporting this project is in your packets. I will not reiterate the reasons why we support it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'People who spoke before me tonight listed all those reasons with much more eloquence than I could ever achieve. But I just wanted to make one comment as a developer about the amount of effort I think that has been shown by Nava and the AFGE.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They have put more resources into this project and made more changes in the design of this project to address valid neighborhood concerns having to do with compatibility, sunlight, access, traffic impacts and esthetics. Just as one example, we all know that there's going to be more traffic.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I personally believe that with the infrastructure changes you've made in including the grid through the project, you're going to see that traffic move much more smoothly. And with the transit in the area, we're going to have fewer people needing to move and cars in that area that are going to be moving there.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I also noticed that the project, the developers have added a lot more parking spaces than would ever be required for this kind of project. And not only have they brought the parking there, they put a lot of money into the way that's being developed, and they've also enveloped it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So you don't even see the parking from the street. That's just one example. And one of the reasons why I think this is a good project to go forward. In addition to the arguments about the zoning, you've got a developer who's going to come through with the additional investment to make this the very best project for the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'neighborhood and for West Colfax corridor in general. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Our next group of speakers are Elizabeth Martinez, Nicolo Case, Keswick, Dewey Goulard, Flora Jean Mackay and Alan Burch. If you could come to the front row, please. And also for people that are in overflow. In room 391.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It looks like there might be some seats if you'd like to join us. So, is Ms.. Martinez here? Hi.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hello. My name is Elizabeth Martinez. I am a resident of West Colfax. Our primary residence is on 16th and Newton, and we have three other properties that are within the realm on 13th and the eighth. 1400, Stewart and 20th.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And Perry. I am in full support of this project. My husband, myself and our two daughters were all born at St Anthony's, and we have a love and an appreciation for all that has come about of our city in general, but also of West Colfax.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think all of us in the neighborhood are just salivating for change. We've been hoping for change, and this is the closest that we've come to something concrete. It may not fully go with the West Colfax plan of being set back, but from a development standpoint, it's understandable with the costs of condo pricing and where are'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the profits most necessary to sustain this type of project with litigation going on in the condo development world? I think there's a lot more people that have a lot more to say. And I hope that you support this project.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'Good evening. My name. My name is Nicola. Okay. Sweat and I live at 355 Local Boulevard. And I want to thank you all for sharing the process with the people here. And I want to urge you to vote against this rezoning in light of the fact that it really does not conform with the original intent of the'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Sea Anthony's task force plan, which specifically called for the density to be placed in what we're calling BLOCK five, which is the middle block that's not under consideration today. And also the fact that when you look at the total development, it's it has kind of morphed from the original plan and then the zoning in 2010 to something'",
        "'speaker_8': 'quite different. It's deficient in open space and we need to address open space, not as NIMBYs but really as as pro. This is an either or thing. I've spent 30 years as a developer. I grew up in Barnum.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I caught my first fish at Son's Lake. I ate at sea. What happened to.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Me? I wasn't going to say anything.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That I had to go down. But seriously, I was I helped I helped manage the original charrette for the task force with the air and at my table no one was against high. The NIMBYs have been against height all along.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The views that we said at our table and what I recorded at the time was that it should be pyramid shaped and so that it would not cast any shadows on the three sides. And what's very important is the shadows cast on the park, including those tennis courts and other aspects of the park.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We could have as long. We could have shadows during the winter months of 2000 feet long from buildings like this. So it's important to do the things, the right things. And as far as density, you can have good density and you can have density that is just almost for its own economic sake.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And there's the law of unintentional consequences. Or know when you when you see this, this could spread around the entire lake eventually. So one thing becomes the justification for the next thing. Now, I've lived all over the world, including Boston.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I studied in Boston and in Munich. I came back home because it really is a special environment. There it is. The lake environment is the number one thing. And what we can do is we can do a better job.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And, you know, there's enough density in places like Paris and Switzerland. In Zermatt, you don't need tall buildings that actually can keep north wind and blasted on the streets.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Where.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You don't need shadows. So thank you. I urge you to vote against this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Joining us this evening, our next speaker is Dewey Gilbert.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Good evening. My name is Dewey Goliad. I live in the Sloan's Lake neighborhood. I work there. I live there. I'm invested in that neighborhood. One of the things that has struck out to me, listening to all the speakers this evening, is the people who live who live in the neighborhood are passionately waiting for your approval of this'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. Goulard. Our next speaker is Flora Jean McKee.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hello. I'm Flora Jean McKay. I go by Jim McKay, and I live at 1538 Equipment Street, which is as close as you can get to the project. It's right on the corner there. I've been there about five years and I love the area.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I'm going to just address a few things here. There's in a letter that was sent I was sent to you on a packet to each of you regarding the concerns. And there were two specific areas of opposition in the letter.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I won't go into that, because I know that you've you have had that. But there was one thing that I wanted to mention, the city attorney, Lori Strand, at the planning board meeting when we were talking about the West Colfax plan and so forth, specifically stated that, um, I can read what it says here that the Saint'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Anthony Task Force Report are based on clear and specific language, and it's part of the adopted by Ordinance West Colfax Plan. And what I see is that the problem here is that. The St Anthony's task force plan was put together with a lot of effort and a lot of time and a lot of thought, and it was'",
        "'speaker_1': 'put together as a whole. Now you're being asked, you know, this application for rezoning of just one part of that, and that wasn't the intent of the original plan. I do want to go over some of the guidelines that are in the St Anthony's task force and the West Colfax Plan.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Like the city attorney said, they need they need to be addressed. There's six different categories. One, and I won't read them all. Just, you know, you would have these in the St Anthony's plan context for redevelopment, guiding principles, urban form, guiding principles, mixed use guiding principles, assess and connectivity Guiding Principles and Access and connectivity.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Or that's a continuation of sustained sustainability, guiding principles and the development process, party considerations. And I do want to read for those dependent or some of those depended on my time here. However, like I said, the problem is that this is what's to be looked at is one development and it's been divided up.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that isn't what the people had wanted. And. One instance is like the chapel is supposed to be a area of gathering, and the building that's going up right now is very, very close to that. And that isn't according to what's going on now going to happen.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so some of the guiding principles that I want to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Take, your time is up. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Our next speaker is Alan Birch. And well, Mr. Birch is coming to the podium. I'd also like to invite Josh Blackman, Cindy Hamilton, Aaron Kagan, Lisa McCain. And I didn't get the bender.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The second part of the Vanderpool.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Vanderpool and Dan Schorr, if you would, please come to the front. Good evening.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Good evening. My name is Alan Birch. I live at 1467 Tennyson, which is basically kitty corner from Colfax Elementary. My front porch gives me a good view of the project. I can see exactly where Alamo Drafthouse is. I can see the Raleigh Building.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I will be able to see the top of this building. I am vice president of Weekend West Colfax Association of Neighbors, and we seem to be much maligned tonight. People seem to have called us a mailing list. Several other things have been mentioned.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We are over 600 members. We're much more than a mailing list. We raised $5,000 for the Corky Gonzales Library this year, $3,000 for English as a second language in our community. We've given money to our community gardens. Our street cleanup project had over 100 people show up to help clean our alleys.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think that's much more than the mailing list. I think stood up here and said they represented us and all of the of the neighbors. I can tell you we can is not a member of ink signs like citizens group that I'm also a member of is not a member of INC Federal Boulevard partnership that I'm also'",
        "'speaker_6': 'a member of a board member of is not a member of ink villa park is not a member of Ink Sloan's like neighborhood association president Larry Ambrose and his wife, and who's also president of Ink. Is a member of INC, but INC does not represent our neighborhood and can't speak for us.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'd like to say that it's a great neighborhood to live in. I've lived there eight years. We've been very accepting. We've allowed West End Flats to come in and welcomed West End Flats. Colorado Coalition for the Homeless Dell Northeast but 106 unit building in that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It gives us more workforce housing. DHL has large developments there. Of course, there's Metro Manor with its 18 story, Maltese Cross with its 14 stories, all renters and all valuable members of our neighborhood. Currently, Trammell Crow is building around 400 units on the property of market rate rentals.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And now we'd like to we'd like to approve a 12 storey condominium for owners. We know we need this density. We want this density because we know it will help attract neighborhood serving businesses to the neighborhood. And I'd urge you to follow the Planning Commission's recommendations and vote to approve.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. Birch. Josh Blackman. How about. You, Mr. Blackman. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That evening. Ladies and gentlemen of the City Council. I'm here on behalf of my aunt. It was Mrs. Barron. She leaves at 1635 Tennyson, which is about a block away from ground zero. You've heard numerous arguments already this evening.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I just want to reiterate, this is a beautiful neighborhood. If you allow these tall buildings to go in, it'll cause irreparable and irreversible damage to the entire area. I wanted to address one myth which has been espoused this evening that there seems to be alleged correlation between allowing a 12 storey building.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And all of a sudden, tons of retail moving into our neighborhood. If you take a look at the map that we gave you earlier, if you look at these storefronts or the small areas along the Colfax, there isn't that area.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'There are not large spaces for an OfficeMax or a target or any of those stores to move in, at best, small boutiques. So that is a myth. There's no empirical evidence to back that up. And it's basically a myth which has been perpetuated by the developer and some of his followers.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I also wanted to briefly address the petitions being sent around. If you take a look at the packet, you'll see the petition is very simple, straightforward. It says it's against the 12 storey building. Keep it at five. You've heard all sorts of allegations, people going around saying 60 stories, 30 stories.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Anybody who signed this petition can read three paragraphs and, you know, maybe one or two people can say they've been fooled. But if you have over 550 signatures from a plain English document, I think you can rely on that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I think you can. Also, it's interesting to note that the same people are criticizing these petitions. You don't seem to have any petitions being submitted to you by 200 people in favor of this project, for the simple reason is they can't acquire that because people are smarter than developers give them credit for.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Once again, I urge you very much to oppose this project and retain the orderly semblance of our neighborhood. If any of you have a chance to go to the site on. Right opposite Raleigh and Stuart Street, they put on these new stop signs.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Traffic is already backed up and there's not even one single car coming or going from the project. If you go there and imagine a thousand or 2000 cars trying to get on to 17th every day, there's going to be backups from Sherrilyn to federal and just causing havoc in our neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you very much for your time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. Blackman.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Let's see. Next, we have Cindy Hamilton, Aaron Keegan, Lisa McClain, Vanderpool and Dan Shah. Okay. We will go on. If they're in 391, we'll put him in the queue. Madam Secretary, let me know the next. The next group of people.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Is that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm sorry. I didn't realize you were taking the whole group. I'm Dan Schorr.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Oh, hi. Hi. Take it away, Mr. Shore.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I'm Dan Shore, and I run the West Colfax Business Improvement District. And I really appreciate the opportunity to weigh in on this critical hearing for St Anthony's redevelopment, West Colfax Business Improvement District and Denver's West Side. The district voted unanimously to support the rezoning of the proposed market rate condo project.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That's in discussion tonight because it directly supports our goal of promoting neighborhood and district revitalization with neighborhood serving retail and services with increased density will provide rooftops required to support more retail and services long called for in the West Colfax Plan.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I might point out here that, you know, economic development 101 and downtown development are very much and it's become clear that higher density and more people, more residents are directly beneficial to businesses and services. Those additional residents also support the plan's objectives of building a strong walking and transit oriented neighborhood and a culture.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And that also in itself adds to retail strength, particularly because this is a market rate project. These additional residents will have disposable income that retail and service prospects seek and then rely on to remain in business. Finally, the location of the higher density development has been placed is to the north of the open space on west that's'",
        "'speaker_8': 'planned for West 16th Street and the Chapel Green and ensuring Colorado Sunshine reaches the new and currently missing amenities community. Amanda and district amenities also called for and people are referred to tonight in the West Colfax Plan and the St Anthony's task force.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'At the district. We are planning district first. We are now or certainly have on the agenda to plan festivals, farmer's markets and the like on these greens and festival streets and are looking forward to continuing to part with new businesses like the Alamo, Cinema and Drafthouse to enhance these events.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'All of this makes upselling a real win for the district, its retail and diverse Westside residents existing and future alike. The West Colfax bid supports the reason as director supporting the plan's West Colfax plan's objective of an income diverse, retail, abundant and healthy neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Let's see, is Diane de la Vollmer here? Do Del Haro, Mary Gonzalez, Celine Mac and Bill Fritz. I see, Diane. I see you. Mary Kay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. Was I first? Yes. Hello, I'm Diane Didier Vollmer. I actually live in Edgewater now. I moved out of North Denver. I work for Del Norte Neighborhood Development Corporation, a nonprofit agency that develops housing for low income, special needs, individuals and families.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I recently. Well, we're located at Colfax and Irving now. So West Colfax is quickly becoming my strip again. Well, anyway, I am also. I like that. Hey, it was the seventies. What can I say? Oh, shoot. Anyway, I'm also a member of the West Colfax Business Improvement District.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And as Dan said recently at a recent well, at a recent board of directors meeting, we took a vote. We approved and support this rezoning unanimously. As you can imagine, the rezoning will do many, many things, too, which I would like to say, and that is, number one, it will assist the neighborhood in its ability to supply'",
        "'speaker_1': 'retail services and other amenities. Neighbors and those who work in the area such as myself. We want good retail. We want things such as a theater and other amenities, such as a chapel and a walkway where we can have community events.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'These things cost money. That commercial tax rate will benefit the city and the district. Also, the second thing is the rezoning will supply neighborhood with the residential density. You know, in 26, when the plan was made in regards to housing, everything has changed since 2006.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Nothing is the same. So this plan has changed to allow for all those changes in the housing market. I would really appreciate it if you would vote. I. When it comes up for the roll call. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Good to see you again. Yeah, our next speaker is Judith Harrell.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Greetings. Am I not signed here but waiting? My phone died down. I have no power, so I'm just going to go from the heart here. So, director, founder of Confluence, we took over a Jewish synagogue yeshiva that was located on 14th in an equipment.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And we have been a part of this neighborhood in the trenches for the last 11 years. One of the things there was an Article 2003 when we were looking to actually kind of be and, you know, twisted by the arm going, hey, there's something happening over here.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You know, this building kind of just fell into our laps.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Can you can you state your name for the record.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Dude? Dale Harrow with Confluence Ministries. And so we actually what we saw was a collaboration of businesses and nonprofits and people coming together to put this building back together for the benefit of the community. And one of the things that I would just like to say is that we're we're for this.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The article very emphatically said there are these social problems that exist into in the neighborhood. In order for the revitalization to take place along Colfax, it has to these these issues need to be addressed. And we felt that we were to just be a catalyst, to be a part of what's happening in that West Colfax neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'There's a lot of amazing things going on, a lot of collaboration, a lot of nonprofits and people doing goodwill into this neighborhood. And we just believe this was just part of that vision that we're in favor of just the the 12 story.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And thank you very much for your time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Let's see. Mary Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hi. My name is Mary Gonzales. I live at 1309 Rain and I've been I've lived in the neighborhood for 15 years now, and I've really been looking forward to the redevelopment. I'm here in support of the 12 stories.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I feel that if we go up more and we're more dense, then it'll be less homes. Then, you know, our whole the whole neighborhood is full of these great, gorgeous brick, beautiful homes. And I think if we go higher, the more people there rather than sucking up more homes, I'm for that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We've got to revitalize and we've got to redevelop. And I believe we need to go up. I'm here in support of things.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you for coming out tonight. Our next speaker is Schooling Mac. Somehow I feel you didn't say that you crucified it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's Sue Ellen. Mac. Oh, I do. No, I'm kidding. I. Oh, answer to only two names. So I was born and raised in Denver and I am so proud of the changes that I've seen. And I hate to age myself, but thank you very much and thank you to all your predecessors.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'My husband. I chose to live in West Colfax in 2008. We live at 1368 Utica and we also have purchased a four plex at 14th and Mead. We chose that area because of the diversity, the proximity to the light rail, the proximity to downtown and also Sloan's Lake.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And of course, with the promise of what would happen at St Anthony's when it does develop, I am in total support of the zoning change for Nava. They are one of three developers willing to take on in a development of this type for sale by owners and I fully support it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Sue Ellen, Mac, appreciate it. Our next speaker is Bill Fritz.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Good evening. My name is Bill Fritz. I've owned a business on West Colfax for 20 years and have owned three houses in the neighborhood. And since I'm older than most everybody else, I'll tell you what was called facts and songs like look like in late fifties and early sixties.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'My mom and dad and I and any number of our eight sit, my eight siblings would get in the car and we would go down and bond and do bonfires. We actually skated on Saint Sloan's Lake on the ice.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We had a meet and greets. We had bands down there and then we would go over to West Colfax and we'd go to the hot dog stand that looked like a hot dog. We would go to the food truck, which looked like a schooner.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That's a covered wagon for you, younger folks. Then we'd go to the drugstore and they had the best phosphates, the best sodas and other things that I'd forgotten. They were great. That was West Colfax. We need to have the highest density we can get in this project.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The opposition to this.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Project for for many of them are the residents of this neighborhood for the last 40 years. The same residents that have had tutelage over West Colfax for the last 40 years, which is the most blighted area between this building and Golden.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We need to have.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Money coming into West.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Colfax. We have 400 people. That isn't going to be enough money to change any business on West Colfax. The buildings on West Colfax are mostly vacant. If they're not vacant, they're well underutilized from our highest and best use standpoint.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'They're very expensive to renovate. Because I just completed one. Well over my original estimate. I hired. Plumbers in 2006, and I hired plumbers in 2013. There's a reason the density.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Has to be higher in this project. The costs are easily double. Look how many people and contractors did not have a job in 2006.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That's why we were able to build for less. Unfortunately, I built last year.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. Fritz. Our final four speakers are Brian Levitt, Trevor Hines, Nathan Stern and Aman Lucero. If you could please come up.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Hello. Good evening. My name is Brian Levitt, and I'm here to speak in favor of the zoning to see him x 12 with the design overlay. My company is Nava Real Estate Development 100 Fillmore Street, Denver, Colorado 80206.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Trevor Hines and I are the principals of Nava. We're both Denver residents. I actually grew up in Denver. I went to Hallet Cole, South more Thomas Jefferson, and now I live in Denver right now where my two kids, my two girls go to Bradley Elementary.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So I love Denver and it's a great to have a chance to build here. We are under contract for BLOCK One to purchase the building subject to this rezoning where we hope to build the first LEED and well certified for sale condos in America.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We are fortunate to live in Denver, where our economy is expanding. Residents from the suburbs and from all over the country are flocking towards Denver's core. When St Anthony's closed, it was a great chance to create an infill development opportunity and to create the mix that we've heard of with New Urbanism to work, live and play on'",
        "'speaker_10': 'the same place. Stone Lake is the perfect spot. It's in Denver. It is a well-conceived masterplan with a TIFF district that will help obviously fund the infrastructure and maintain it properly. It's near TOD and right next to downtown was Jobs.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And as a resident of Denver, it's really exciting to have a chance to be part of the West Coast revival. Building condos today is a tremendous challenge. Tremendous. There's a tremendous shortage of housing near Denver's core in this particular market sector.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'For sale five story wood construction is simply not feasible because of condo defects litigation. If not, but for TMX 12 zoning on BLOCK one, we will not be able to build our for sale housing project. The design overlay significantly shrinks the area we're hiking in Crown BLOCK one and we recognize the design challenges this overlay creates and'",
        "'speaker_10': 'feel they are justified to protect the surrounding neighborhood. In accordance with the West Colfax Plan. We have taken part in numerous public meetings over the past eight months to discuss the project in depth and feel confident that there is a great deal of community support for the proposal because, one, it supports the community's goals of a balance'",
        "'speaker_10': 'of housing types at St Anthony's. Two, it helps revitalize West Colfax and the Sloan's Lake. Three, it capitalizes on the new Tod Station, which is great. And lastly, it allows Denver residents to live on one of our greatest assets, which is Sloan Lake Park.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We humbly request your approval of TMX 12 with the overlay D Doe five and certainly sincerely hope to develop the for sale condo community that we have presented to the neighborhood. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. Levitt. Next speaker is Trevor Hines.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Hello. My name is Trevor Hines and my home address is 278, a South Monaco Parkway in Denver, and partnered with Brian Levitt in Nava real estate development. And we are the potential buyer and the vertical developer for the site.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I thought I'd like to address some questions people have from our perspective as a developer. Many others have commented on the finer points regarding conformity with plans and the mandates of City Council. As an aside, I'd recommend to the people in this room to read the West Colfax Plan.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It's actually a very interesting read and has a progressive vision for the neighborhood. But anyway, so some questions why West Colfax? Why develop there? So the business of development is to build new buildings in areas that with potential that is currently unrealized.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I can think of few places in Denver with more unrealized potential than West Colfax. The Saint Anthony site is near a beautiful park, near a diversity of transportation options with close proximity to downtown. And it's less than a mile from Broncos stadium.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Nevertheless, the area is currently sadly underserved in both retail and amenities and is treated to elevated levels of crime and overall blight. We think that the neighborhood is already in a state of transition and hope our development would help create cascading cycles of reinvestment and improvement that would benefit the neighborhood as well as our buyers.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So why does AFGE request 12 stories? So the current legal environment, as Brian has mentioned, does not favor developers. Historically, condominiums represented some 20% of for sale housing construction. In this current business environment, they're are less than 2% of new construction.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Most developers have decided that the risk of frivolous lawsuits is too great and have left the market. Brian and I have a long and detailed plan for dealing with the risks presented, and we hope to be to avoid being sued outright.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Central to our plan is building structurally out of concrete so-called type one construction, as would cannot hold up to the stringent performance requirements that we would need. We must build out of concrete and it is not economical to do so unless we are allowed to build vertically and recoup the costs of the structure.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'People might ask, how can the public know that we will build what we have shown in our drawings and renderings? So first of all, the design overlay map amendment that is running in parallel with this bill would cement a promise to the community that we cannot deviate significantly from the building form that we have proposed up to'",
        "'speaker_9': 'this point. More than that, we have designed a building that we feel is esthetic, tasteful and sensitive to its surroundings. Our building is 12 storeys at the highest point, but steps down to eight storeys to five storeys to three stories and ultimately to two stories on the northwest corner.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The renderings presented here are not mere illustrations, but they are produced from full 3D modeling of the building. A great amount of thought, effort and money has been invested to produce our architectural model, and it represents a solution that best addresses the design needs of the site and of the building.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mr. Hines, your time is concluded. Thank you. Our next speaker is Nathan Stern.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you very much. My name is Nathan Stern. I'm a resident of West Colfax. I live at 1441 Perry Street. I'm also a soon to be business owner. I'm opening gathering grounds, a coffee shop and board games cafe at 5004 West Colfax Avenue in the West End Flats Development.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I first of all want to thank the council for letting everybody speak tonight. Obviously, myself included, I'd like to voice my support for this project, both as a business owner and as a resident in the neighborhood. As a business owner, I can say that the promise of the St Anthony's redevelopment was one of the big reasons'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I decided to locate my business within West Colfax and specifically in BLOCK One. The promise of bringing so many residents who can own their own homes and have a lasting connection to the West Colfax neighborhood will be a benefit both for our business, and we'll also make West Colfax more of a retail destination with the services that'",
        "'speaker_9': 'will come in to the neighborhood. And I truly believe having West Colfax be a retail destination will benefit all of the businesses up and down West Colfax. Mine included. And speaking as a resident, you know, there's no need to denigrate the existing mix of services and the existing retail mix along West Colfax.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But I think it's safe to say that a lot of really vital neighborhood services are absent. So having this development in BLOCK One, as well as the rest of the St Anthony's redevelopment, will bring a lot of services that are really vital for my wife and I and hopefully our growing family to live in the neighborhood and'",
        "'speaker_9': 'make a home here for the next several decades to come. And so having this project be approved and come into fruition will really accelerate that transition and really bring a number of vital retail services into the neighborhood that we and the rest of the West Colfax community can enjoy.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I want to revisit one point, just speaking personally, which is the this project, being a condo project and the ability of people, especially in my generation, to become homeowners in this climate right now, you know, we were lucky enough to purchase our home in May, but for a lot of my friends, you know, just the shortage'",
        "'speaker_9': 'of for sale property in northwest Denver is really striking properties that go on the market. You know, multiple offers will come in that day above asking and that puts homeownership out of reach for a lot of my peer group.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so having this for sale condo project within my neighborhood will be really significant for a lot of people I know personally. But I think also, you know, just for a number of people in my generation, my peer group and others, to be able to experience that joy of homeownership and really make roots in this neighborhood that'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I think everybody here, whether they're speaking for or against the project, really loves. And so I think that will really be vital and significant. So thank you all very much for your time. And I really urge you to vote in support of the rezoning.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. And our final speaker is Ammon Lucero.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I don't know.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Going one.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Going twice.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That concludes our speakers questions from members of council. Councilman Brooks.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. Thank you, Madam President. I'd like to call two people back up to finish their testimony. One is Cameron Bertrand. You're quite sure? Did you throw it away? And then the other is Gerard Franck. Did you leave?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Kerry Ra. Kerry free. Gerard Franck. Okay. Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you very much. You are kind. I just wanted to conclude by saying that, as you have now heard, that tonight you may hear and in fact, have heard both points of view and many in between. And for my own part, I feel strongly that this rezoning is a unique opportunity to support density exactly where our city'",
        "'speaker_9': 'plans call for it, most near transit, proximate to jobs and services, and where it will promote a diverse housing base and best catalyze reinvestment in our city. So and really just to thank really this neighborhood, it has spent a lot of time with Ifg over the past two years.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And it I really, truly believe it's one of the more unique neighborhoods in the city, how forthright it was, how direct it was. And however tonight's vote goes. I certainly appreciate the degree to which they have engaged with us as we've tried to bring forward the plans that you guys have put out there.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. Madam President, I just want to try one more time for Frank. I think he was speaking in opposition. I want to give him a shot to finish. Okay. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Councilman Brooks. Councilwoman Kennish.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you, Madam President. One of our early speakers mentioned that there would be no affordable for sale on this site. And so I just wanted to ask Cameron Bertrand whether or not that was an accurate statement in terms of the conversations you've been having with the Office of Economic Development.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you very much for the opportunity to speak to that. The I think the confusion there, Spence, from the fact that there is one project that we have spent a lot of time on and is much further along than the others.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And that is a project that is located at Colfax and Perry Street. However, we have been working very closely with the Office of Economic Development on not just a affordable rental plan, but really an affordable plan for South Sloan's Lake more broadly.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And that plan does call for workforce housing on the six blocks that is South Sloan's Lake directly. We believe that will happen on block three. And we also are working with them on plans for what I would call H0 units in the for sale sense so that there will be a mix of both workforce rental, affordable rental'",
        "'speaker_9': 'and affordable workforce for sale. So it really is a very broad, much more broad based plan than that. And it ought to add up to approximately 15% of the overall project, which I think is a great outcome. And while I'm up here, I'll just say hats off to the Office of Economic Development, who spent a lot of'",
        "'speaker_9': 'time with us trying to hash that out. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Kelso McNeish, of all your questions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Ask one more.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Madam President. Tina Axlerod I think this question is for Deidre Oates, also known as Tina Axelrod at 9:30 p.m.. Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The question is about we've had a number of of of questions. It's I'm kind of a little confused because many neighborhoods come to us and they say they want more detail before we re do a rezoning. They want more plans, they want more street information.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And so I just want to clarify what kinds of things we know because the GDP that we wouldn't know otherwise. So kind of whether we should have a chicken or an egg first. What what actually is in the GDP that we know now that we wouldn't without it?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Right. Well, before the GDP, we had a neighborhood plan, the West Colfax plan, that does provide a vision and some guidance. What we know now is more about the infrastructure that it takes to actually develop this site in a more realistic fashion.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so it's about the most tangible infrastructure planning document that we have before you start getting into site development plans. And site development planning is an administrative process. The GDP is an administrative process. It does go to planning board for recommendation for approval.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so there is a public process to that. So we know a number of infrastructure details. Stormwater, wastewater, sewer. We know where the lines are going to go. We know about open space, the provision for open space and a GDP that we wouldn't have in the West Colfax plan.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We have a more specific understanding of where that open space will be located, and that was discussed tonight.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Just one last clarification, Madam President. Is so is it fair to say that we know more about this site as we are rezoning it than we would without a GDP?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It is fair. And actually and one of my thoughts as I was listening to testimony is that it is that chicken or egg thing or review criteria do not require details about a site or a site development plan.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But the benefit of all of the discussion that has been circulating around this site for all of these years is that there have been people coming to the table to show interest, and you've heard from them tonight. And I think that's helped us kind of solidify the direction of the plan for the site.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilwoman Robb?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes, dear, dear. While you're there, two quick follow ups on that line of questioning. I had to sort of lines of questioning. One is, as the GDP was prepared, was a traffic study done, was the developer or the property owner, TFG, required to do a traffic study?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There are traffic impact studies that are required, but I would ask actually I was not part of the GDP process. So if you wanted more specific information.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah. Just a quick yes or no, because I know time is sorry.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm looking right over your head. Karen.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Hi. There was a traffic study done, and it's somewhat continuously updated. It was not connected with the general development plan, but with the transportation EOR engineering plan, which is a separate administrative process. So yes, to a traffic study, but not directly as a result of the general development.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But the traffic study was based on the infrastructure in the GDP.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That's exactly right. The build outs contemplated in the GDP, both low and high impact.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That was my question, correct?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yep.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then secondly, and maybe you can answer this. Were there design guidelines written for the St Anthony's project? It's an option in a GDP.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yeah. And in this GDP, it is not an option. You can thank your planning department for that. There is a requirement that that that design guidelines be developed and be administered. And in this case, they have been developed.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'They are recorded against the property. It's administered by the Metropolitan District. But the makeup of the design review committee is three neighborhood representatives, a Peter Park, the former planning director, and then two representatives from the Metropolitan District. So five total.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Maybe I didn't do that math. Right, but.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. And then my other question was, we heard a whole lot tonight about BLOCK five and about Colfax and about where the density or the height. Let me put it that way, is supposed to be on this site.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I know you've shown it to us a couple of times in committee. But could you go back to the drawing in this staff report that's black and white, that shows the blocks and show me exactly how the overlay affects this particular rezoning.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. So this is a black and white drawing that comes directly from the general development plan. And I actually have some other slides in here that I might be able to pull up for you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Now, this is exactly what I need.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This is it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Mm hmm. Okay. So just take your pointer around the block where this is, where the heights are.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So this is block one up in this northwest corner of the GDP area because of the restrictions in the design overlay that was approved on February 2nd, and that was approved for all of the blocks one through six.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So if you count with me, it's block one, two, three, four, five and six. That design overlay applies to all of those blocks. You'll also see the GDP contemplated exactly on which the the design overlay was based limitations or tapering in height.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'As you've heard through the plan language from three stories on this block between 16th and 17th for the first 60 feet from the right of way. And then there is already a restriction of 175 feet from a protected district built into the zoning code for four protected residential.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So that's the little slim line of five story restriction here, which limits the site to 12 storeys, really toward the back of this this lot. The five story restriction also applies to 17th Avenue up here.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. And then finally is Nicholas case would had because I spent part of the time during the testimony tonight looking at this St Anthony's it's now on my iBooks task force report and I was wondering I could not find any illustration that book in that in that report or any wording that said while the density was to'",
        "'speaker_5': 'move toward Colfax, that it was to be concentrated in block five. So is Nicholas here where he might be able to? Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Any other questions, Councilwoman?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'No. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right, Councilman Lopez.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Madam President. Part of my one of my questions was about traffic and traffic study and flow. And I think Councilman Robb's question answered that one. But however, I do have a question on environmental impact and water drainage.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And if it went into Stones Lake or what the deal was, how it trained, where it went, because I think somebody brought that up. And I do want to see if there was any kind of answer to that and how that would work with the mechanics are.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I don't know if Cameron if that's you.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'There is a technical document called the South Sloan's Lake Stormwater Drainage Plan that goes through the vetting process with public works that lays out exactly how water quality and water volumes and discharge will be handled on site. So it will go into the regular stormwater drainage system, those pipes that will eventually make their way to the Platte'",
        "'speaker_9': 'River. Modern development, all of it has to be treated for water quality before it goes in. And in the case of this site, it's actually a lead gold neighborhood. So the street itself actually has a sustainability rating and the water quality is treated in the tree line before it arrives in the in the system.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So it's quite the opposite, I think, of maybe what was suggested.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'In my whole if I may, Madam President, the whole reason behind that is because I know when we when we rebuilt Federal Boulevard, there was no other way for the water to go. But in a Barnham now, I mean, with with the water treatment, with the mechanisms that are in place, I think they're all natural.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They get filtered, the water actually gets filtered before it gets in there, which is cleaner than the water that was actually naturally in there. I don't know if that was the case or something. And I know that Sloan's Lake I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think the first lake I've ever seen in my life was Stones Lake. So I know that know pretty well. Most of the water comes in from Sharon and right under the bridge through it. And then it's actually one of Denver's natural lakes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I didn't know if the water with how the water flow and if it was coming into the lake or not.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So yeah, so, so historically this site has been allowed to drain directly to the lake after it. Actually, I say after that infrastructure has actually been installed. Now it is treated for water quality on the site and it it ends up in the stormwater drainage system pipes and it bypass it bypasses the lake and catches up a'",
        "'speaker_9': 'little for a little further down.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. So it doesn't go into the lake and then out.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It doesn't go. It does not go into the lake. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. I really appreciate that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Councilman Lopez, Councilman Ortega. Don't go too far, Cameron. My question is about some concerns that were expressed about shadows. So can you address, number one, whether there was a shadow study done and based on the location of where the buildings are proposed for this particular application tonight, whether or not the setbacks that we approved affect'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that and what does that do to the park? So can you. I know that's a lot of questions. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So the answer is yes. There was a quite extensive Shade and shadows study done first and foremost at the time of the general development plan that looked at height on all seven blocks. I think one thing you notice here, we talk a lot about Colfax, but two of the two of the three blocks on Colfax were not'",
        "'speaker_9': 'owned by the hospital. So those are truly visionary conversations. And then there was additional shade and sketch shade and shadow study done on block one relative to this this block. And so I think the answer to your question of whether or not this the setbacks in the design overlay that was approved impact that shadow.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I think the answer is yes in one way which is as you taper the edge blocks in so as you as you limit development on Stuart to three stories and then five and then only on the westernmost portion of easternmost portion of block one can there be additional height.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You necessarily narrow the building and the building runs north south instead of east west. So that means that the shadow that will come from the south and go north into 17th Avenue and into the park will be a thin.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Or Shadow than it otherwise would be if you had not passed the design overlay. The balance, I think, of the design overlay was really intended to create scale and staging and tapering away from single family housing, more so than than shadow.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So most of the shadow limitations are driven by the design guidelines, which are more detailed than the design overlay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, ma'am. Oh.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Oh. Are there other are there other.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Comments from members of council? The public hearing is closed. Comments by members of Council. Councilwoman Sheperd.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you everyone for coming out tonight. I appreciate everyone's attendance and participation.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I hope your feedback.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Man, will you please take your seat? Thank you. Thank you. Ma'am. Ma'am, you're going to be asked to leave, ma'am.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. All right.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Are there comments by members of Council Councilwoman Sheperd?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, everyone, for coming down and participating in this very full and fair discussion, weighing all the pros and cons and various aspects of this proposed rezoning. I want to talk I want to address some things in both the West Colfax Plan and the St Anthony's task force that relate to our discussion tonight.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'First of all. Forecasts estimate that Denver's population will grow by 132,000 people and that the metro region will grow by 800,000 people over the next 20 years. This is from the 2006 West Colfax Plan in response to the anticipated growth.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Blueprint. Denver, the city's award winning plan to integrate land use and transportation. Identified areas of change where the city should direct growth in order to connect people to jobs, housing and the transportation system. I've heard. Okay. That's just a little summary about what exactly an area of change is that comes from the West Colfax plan.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I have heard many, many references also to the St Anthony's task force recommendations tonight, which have also been incorporated into the West Colfax Plan in various forms. I'm just going to read a few of them to you. Consider the Saint Anthony site as a catalyst for the entire Sloan's Lake West Colfax neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Height and densities of the edges of the redevelopment site, especially on the east and west, where it is adjacent to residential neighborhoods, should transition from the densities along those edges to higher densities internal to the site. Create a town square, special street or streets and or plaza that provide a focal point for the development and the neighborhood'",
        "'speaker_4': '. Allow higher density residential uses that are necessary to attract desirable retail and services to benefit the surrounding community. Build walkable, safe and attractive pedestrian linkages to surrounding neighborhoods, schools, transit, Sloan's Lake, retail and other destinations identify an optimal density range for the redevelopment site that assures economic viability and responds to the context of the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Stabilize the surrounding residential neighborhood and encourage economic diversity among homeowner homeowners, including high and moderate income and opportunities for low income housing. These are just a few of the highlights from the St Anthony's task force recommendations as well as the West Colfax Plan.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There's been a pretty big debate tonight about whether this proposed reasoning supports the plan and the documents, and I believe that it does. I've heard I believe we have heard a range of testimony tonight from various perspectives. And I believe that the case has been made that this rezoning will help bring residential residents to the Colfax corridor'",
        "'speaker_4': ', will provide and broaden a range of housing options to folks currently living in the corridor, as well as those who intend to move. And I believe it will bring the customer base that will support both the existing businesses already on West Colfax, as well as the new ones who would like to come.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Mr. Stern is an example of that. You need a certain amount of density to help make the corridor vibrant. I think we've had a very rich discussion regarding the design overlay and how that will help fulfill. The desires within the West Colfax plan to taper the central density of this block down into the adjacent streets.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And on this one, we're talking about Stuart specifically and I think MSOs for showing exactly how those height transitions will work. In the document that she showed us in response to a question by one of my colleagues. I want to speak more as well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think it's a great opportunity to have some for sale units at this site. We haven't had any new for sale condos built in northwest Denver or much across the city in years. As one of the speakers tonight talked about, this is an opportunity for people who may not be able to afford a single family home, to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'have an entry level home and home ownership. I talked about the economic catalyst that this will. I thought Mr. Goldblatt testimony was so key tonight, having been. Of a resident, his family having been a resident this corridor since the late 1800s.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Both he and another speaker talked very specifically about the businesses that used to be on the street and how they concert, how they serve the community and the services that were there. We have a great lack in community service and businesses on this corridor and this rezoning and bringing these residents will help be the catalyst that lifts'",
        "'speaker_4': 'up the whole corridor that every group that has been actively engaged in this process from the West Colfax Neighborhood Association to the West Colfax bid to the Sloan's Lake Citizens Group and Sons like Neighborhood Association has been trying to achieve for years.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I want to say something a little. I want to present to you a couple of statistics from the most recent census tract data that talk to some of the issues that are very real and present in this in this corridor.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'One is regarding unemployment. The rate of unemployment in the West Colfax neighborhood is double that of West Highland and Sloan's Lake. It is also more than double the citywide average of 5.1%. One fifth of West Colfax families are living below the poverty line and received food stamp and SNAP benefits in the last 12 months.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'More than one third of the families with a female householder are living in poverty. As I mentioned earlier when I was talking about what the goal of an area of change is, is to connect people to jobs, housing and the transportation system.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'More people coming to this area, which will create a bigger demand for more services, for more amenities, for more businesses, which will in turn create jobs that will provide the opportunity for unemployed residents in this area to get jobs that they can walk to.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'What I didn't mention was that 22% of the occupied housing units in West Colfax have no vehicles available. They need the opportunity to be able to walk to jobs, and that is what will happen on this site, not just this block.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But when you look at the goals and what we're trying to achieve on the whole site overall. One last thing I want to mention is crime. The crime in this neighborhood. And a lot of people brought it up who have lived there for a long time.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Is. Is higher than in West Highland and slogans like combined higher than those two neighborhoods combined with a very, very high prevalence of aggressively aggravated assault and robbery. It was only about a year ago that there was a woman held at gunpoint at one of the convenience stores at the West on West Colfax.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'At Perry. At Perry. It was literally, I think, in about February of last year. One thing that more residents bring. Is more people moving throughout the neighborhood, walking through these pedestrian oriented streets, which creates more eyes on the street, which helps community members to get to know each other, build a community and look out for each other'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and helps reduce crime. There are many reasons to support this, and I think I've outlined at least all of mine. I know that some of my colleagues, you know, may have some other viewpoints as well, but. When I hear so many people talking about how excited they are for the changes and how long they have waited for'",
        "'speaker_4': 'these positive changes and how other people have moved to this district anticipating the change. That is the promise. Of what are planning documents. Blueprint Denver and zoning is trying to achieve and that is the opportunity for this neighborhood to be lifted up to have a range of housing options to have more community servicing businesses.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'For neighbors to create a deeper sense of community with each other, both for those who are already there and those who are moving. And for people to feel safe. And those can all be achieved. Through this rezoning, as well as the development of the site.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I really want to support those of you that have been working on this for so hard. So I'm happy to support this tonight. And I would ask my council colleagues to do the same.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Sheppard. Councilwoman Robb.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. Madam President, council ship Councilwoman Shepard has eloquently laid out her understanding of West Colfax, the West Colfax plan, understanding of West Colfax, a great need for the proposal and the rezoning that's here in front of us tonight.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In fact, one of the early people testifying in favor of this talked about the need and then went on to talk about the plan. I think we do have to look at both the need is this good for the welfare and health of the community, but we have to make sure it conforms to the plan.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And we hear a lot about councilman, a courtesy or think for yourself or whatever. I was looking at all the emails we got today and I did get the email from Is It Dennis Cox? And he referred us to page 133 of the plan.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I had read the land use section in the plan earlier this weekend, but I went to look at the what they call the Holy Tony's site, and I went to what page? 133 And there was an illustration that really talks about what Nicholas K Swit was talking about.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so of course I went, well, looking at this, how can I approve tonight's zoning? And I fretted and I talked to my staff and I went back and I looked at it and then I, I looked again.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You got to read the details. Wholly Tony's illustrative plan, the very first sentence as the concept for Holy Tony's a funny name. Town center on the opposing page illustrates one of many possible options for the configuration, massing and scale at the St Anthony's Hospital redevelopment site.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And reading that, I thought, I've got to keep reading about this. And I went through that tonight. I was going through the St Anthony's development plan. And honestly, I see a lot of conformance with both the West Colfax Plan and the guidelines in the St Anthony's Task Force Report.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'One thing I want to also point out is I heard someone tonight say we adopted this plan as a law. We did, and I'm certainly not a lawyer, but we did adopt the plan as an ordinance. And my understanding the ordinance is that we made the West Colfax plan part of Denver's comp plan.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We didn't make it part of our municipal code and we did not make it part of our zoning code. And I think that's a distinction that some of us up here sit and think about. But when you're looking at the property next to you, it's a distinction a little bit hard to get.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, they approved the plan. And therefore, if I don't think it meets the plan, they can't approve this. Plans are definitely aspirational and visionary. They have guidelines which we try very much to adhere to, but in in honesty have a lot of interpretive room on it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'As I've listened tonight to the to the testimony, I do believe that this meets the plan. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Robb, any other comments? None. Madam Secretary, roll call on Council Bill 1094 oh or oh over councilwoman or take it to Sweden. I just wanted to make a few very brief comments and I won't belabor what's already been said.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'First, I want to thank everybody for coming down tonight and for your patience. I know those seats are not very comfortable. And for those of you who are still waiting for yet our two other public hearings, we appreciate your patience and your indulgence.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We have had a number of different actions on this St Anthony's property that have come before city council. None of those drew this kind of audience as we're seeing here tonight. And I believe that it's because of the proposed density that is in this application.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I remember attending a number of meetings when there were still buildings on the property, and they are being held there at the St Anthony's site, where there was a lot of discussion about the scale of what was being considered for this site.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I remember there was talk about 20 story buildings. And, you know, I think it's part of the process that a developer goes through to try to see what a neighborhood is willing to accept in terms of the, you know, just the overall scale and density of of a particular project.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And. I think that the deliberation that we have gone through tonight in listening to both sides and I appreciate hearing from all sides on this issue. I live in northwest Denver. I walk Sloan's Lake on a regular basis.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know, one of the things I think is important and Councilwoman Shepherd and I had reached out to our Parks Department some time ago saying as we see development that will be moving forward on Sloan's Lake, on the St Anthony's property, there needs to be a look at what kind of changes need to occur at Sloan's Lake'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to address the increase in usage of the park, for example. But putting putting the park aside, I think the the need for density for this area is an important part of being able to attract the kinds of services that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Every neighborhood wants to see in their community. I know in conversations that we've had around the Globeville, Swansea and Elyria communities, they have not been able to attract a grocery store, for example, because they don't have that mass density to get a grocery chain to invest in that neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so it's one of those things. It is a chicken and egg situation that has to it's that mix that has to come together to ensure that if you want those services, it's. It's what you need to be able to attract the businesses.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I am going to be supporting this tonight. And I believe it's it's the right thing to do for this area of town. And I know tonight is not going to be the last part of the conversations that the developer will be having with the community.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So let's just keep the conversation alive. Thank you. Thank you, Councilman Ortega. Madam Secretary, roll call on Council Bill 1094.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'The key point here is that the US sub one, which was applied to the site during the 2010 update to the Denver zoning code. The zoning code also allows for properties that are adjacent, directly adjacent to that US sub one zone district to be exempt from minimum area requirements.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Normally would have area requirements of four or eight acres or two blocks. In this case, because this property is adjacent to the US sub one minimum work area requirements are essentially met by being adjacent and it's simply an expansion of what U.S. sub one is today.'",
