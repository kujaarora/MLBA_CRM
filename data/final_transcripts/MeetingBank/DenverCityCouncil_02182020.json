        "'speaker_8': 'So they're not paying more than 30% of their income on their housing costs. And part of that is made possible because we provide a below market mortgage. Now, if they were to resell and for some reason Habitat didn't buy under its 90 year repurchase rights, it enables that seller to be able to sell it 100% because most'",
        "'speaker_8': 'likely that person who buys that home will not be able to find a mortgage that's, you know, probably double the amount that the habitat mortgage would be. And that would make it very difficult for an 80% AMI person to be household to be able to purchase it.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That 100% makes it possible for our habitat homeowners to actually sell them, you know, in a in a market where they're going to have to the buyer's going to have to have a higher mortgage rate. So that makes sense.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'We have a schedule attached to this covenant that limits price appreciation year over year by 2% so that you can't.

        "'speaker_8': 'Re purchasing the property would be that the price was so high we wouldn't be able to meet our mission of making that homeownership affordable. So with this tool in place, I'm sure it'll be a higher rate, right? Because the price will be kept affordable.'",
