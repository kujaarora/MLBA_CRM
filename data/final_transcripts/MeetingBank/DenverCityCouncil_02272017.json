I am making this motion as chair of the Finance and Governance Committee, where this bill moved through with our intention that it be on the floor today. Due to staff miscommunication, it was not filed in time, but I believe it was the committee's intent that it be on the floor tonight.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so that is why I'm making this motion count.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Very well done. Councilwoman Camille, I think, summarized it. This is just a mistake. And it was a council's full intention in the Finance Committee to make sure this was on the floor. And so we need a unanimous vote to suspend these rules and make sure that we can have the conversation on the floor right now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So it has been moved. And second, I say, Councilman Flynn, you're up.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thanks, Fred. Just a quickly, could you tell us what the mistake was or what occurred and how that can be avoided in the future? Because these these kinds of votes are very rare.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. So I believe this is between OED and the Department of Finance. And one department didn't know when the other department was supposed to file and not file. So this is actually coming out of the Department of Finance.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'However, the bill is located in OED. So they they know they've apologized. And so we're moving forward with a thank you, Councilman Flynn. All right. It's been moved and segmented. Okay. So we put resolutions 163. It should be 156.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right, great. We'll make a note of that. Okay. Madam Secretary, please put up the first one. 163. Councilman Flynn, go ahead and make your comment.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. President. 163 is an agreement between the Office of Economic Development and a development entity on the 16th Street Mall to develop or redevelop the old California Mall property right at 16th in California. And I remember it as the old food court.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You go up to the second floor, and when I saw this come across, it gave me a lot of heartburn, Mr. President, because it would bring a new a very good tenant to the mall, one that I think it would be great, wonderful addition catalytic to what I call upto our sort of answer to LoDo.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This is up doe and but it was target and I have nothing against Target Corporation. Personally I shop there on occasion, but as some folks may recall, Target had a very wonderful outlet in my district at Sheridan and Evans.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And when when Target opened in Belmar, in the Belmar redevelopment in Lakewood, they closed the Target in my district. That alone doesn't give me the heartburn because that's a business decision. But when they left and sold it to an operator who now operates a 99 cent store there, I say we don't even get a dollar store down'",
        "'speaker_4': 'in my district. We get $0.99 store. They put a deed restriction on the property that it could not be used for 20 years for a general merchandise retailer of 50,000 square feet or greater. And I know from my predecessor, Councilwoman Jeanie Fox, that on at least three occasions a national retailer has looked at that property and has'",
        "'speaker_4': 'walked away from redeveloping it because of the deed restriction. However, in the in the course of dealing with this, I was able to meet with guard properties, which is the owner of the California Mall and would be the actual entity with whom we're partnering here, not Target.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I'm very happy to say that they've genuinely outreach to us and they have helped us down in southwest Denver to do market research, to identify potential retailers and possibly even to look at the property as a potential redevelopment.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So for the first time in the five or six years since Target left there, we have some we have some interest. I understand the property may also even be on the market now. So given the genuine promise to continue working with us.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Mr. President, I will vote yes on this and and plan on that cooperation continuing. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilman Flynn. Councilman.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I have been very aware of how hard the downtown community has worked to attract retail to this location. It has been a conversation as long as I have been on the council. Not maybe not this particular location, but the vicinity of the 16th Street Mall.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so I don't take lightly the concerns about how to make downtown an attractive destination, to fulfill the needs of the residents and the workers who are downtown. And, you know, I have not, without some consternation, supported some types of redevelopment assistance in this city's history that have involved retail.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And, you know, particularly with tax increment financing, it's never been easy. Each deal I take one by one. But overall, I have great concern when we are using city dollars to subsidize retail. It is a non economically sustainable job in our city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'For the most part, the average jobs at this site will be 25 hours a week, which is not a full time salary. So even if the wage is slightly above the minimum wage, when you add up the hours, it will keep most families below the poverty line.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And we as a city end up having to step in then with childcare assistance and health care assistance and other things. And that's not unique to this location and it's not unique to this retailer. But I do have concerns about using the Business Investment Fund for this purpose.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The city has been very disciplined in using the business investment fund, almost with the exception of one other retail job, a retail investment for jobs that are higher than the median wage. And I've appreciated that discipline. It is what kept me supportive of this fund for the period of time.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I really struggled with this one and really looked at each a piece of the deal. And I, you know, I would have maybe almost gotten there, but the fact that this agreement is not directly with the retailer and does not give us any privity of contract with them, we do have a history of retailers.'"

The building is anticipated, just for your information, is anticipated to be a six storey building with a residential penthouse on top of it.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. We're not going to be doing anything to to change the ramp that goes down to the creek. This is about a 15 to 20 foot drop off this retaining wall. And so what we're seeking from you this evening is a vacation of this alley, or at least this portion of the alley terminate right here.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Of it, by the.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Way. I do. So here's here's an image of what the building would look like from the this is the creek side. So what you see down here at the bottom is the creek. You see the pedestrian walkway along the creek, the ramp, and there would be a promenade along the creek beach again between Wynkoop Emwazi, which would'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Nos. A pretty straightforward application. And we reviewed it as we review all of our applications for vacation.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. So drug the use of the dead in L.A. then. Does that cause any problems for trash collection or anything like that?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There's there's no there's no problems with any of that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Councilman Cashman.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sorry. Thank you, Mr. President. Whoever prepared to answer this? So the. The building to the north. Which my understanding is, while the lot that the developer wants to build on is now access to that property is blocked off.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Historically, the neighbors to the north had had that kind of open as a cut through space. Is that about right?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes. It's our understanding from some of the neighbors that that the I think you're referring to the use of the parking lot as a cultural space. Historically, some of the neighbors had used that as a cut through space.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'If you're on foot, you can obviously hop the chain and walk across to Osea or Wynkoop, if you like.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And the chain was down for a long time, was it not? So the tenants to the north could cut through the property there? Through that lot.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The current owners owned the property for the past year and a half and the chain's been up since the current owners on the property. We actually know the former owner of the property as well. The chain sort of went down and up and so there were certainly times when the chain was down and folks could access across'",
        "'speaker_7': 'it. But there were also times when the chain's been up when that access has been blocked.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. And then I guess maybe, Angela, if there's anyone here from the fire department, so by cutting that alley off, does that present safety concerns for the people in the building to the north?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So when we do these applications, they're reviewed by several utilities and several different city departments. We did not receive we did receive a letter from the fire department saying that they were okay with the configuration of what what was happening here.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And what is can you describe what the access then becomes for that building to the north?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So basically, this is this is a 400 foot alley which will then they're asking to vacate about 100 feet of the alley. And so it will become a 300 foot alley. You know, it'll still dead, dead end at the 300 foot mark.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. So they have sufficient access and egress without this.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah. I mean, the challenge is, is that this was platted in I think like 1879 or 59 somewhere in there. And so, I mean, this isn't something that we would historically do today, but because of the way it's platted, that's that's what we're that's what we're offering here.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right, Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Angela, could you rise again? You told me you are here and you can speak for Rob Duncanson and right of way as well. So you're knowledgeable of all that he's knowledgeable about. Okay. And he knows and you probably know that I am a map geek and an historian.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So my lesson for today in question. In 1859, Boyd's survey showed this. All these lots, all dead ending at the Cherry Creek. In other words, 14th Street historically ended to the south of here. Just to disagree with Councilman Cashman and some public works folks about the direction of our downtown streets and the blocks farther north along the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'creek, always dead, ended at the creek and not at 14th Street. So all these have always been dead end alleys. Correct? Yes. Okay. And interestingly to me, if no one else, the three blocks, including this one, and then up to 16th and 17th between Wynkoop and OAC on Boyd survey were shown as city parks without an alley'",
        "'speaker_4': '. But my understanding is that the surveyor Ebert came back and later filed the true subdivision plat and we all have these dead end alleys. Are you familiar with the historic uses on that block? If I if I asked you, for instance, were you aware that the entire frontages on Rosie and online coupe historically had been built up'",
        "'speaker_4': 'from lot line to lot line all the way from 15th Street to the creek? Do you know that to be true?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, I do know that there have been several variations.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that the buildings that were there have been torn down, but they are still private property. Right. Okay. If we did not vacate the alley, the owner of the property on either side fronting on either street would be able to build from lot line to lot line.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Without providing a an access out of the dead end. Right. Okay. That's all, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilman Flynn, for that historic lesson of the fine district nine and lower downtown. What else happened in 1859? That's pertinent.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'William Byars established the Rocky Mountain News. Okay, and allowed and allowed me to be laid off in 2009.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There's one more big event that happened.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Eight years ago tomorrow.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Do you know the other event that happened?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I believe it was the councilman's 10th birthday.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I'm going to leave it at that. This is the wheels are off the car here. Okay. Councilwoman Black.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. I was going to ask the same question that Councilman Flynn did, but just to reiterate it. So if two different parties owned it, if two different parties owned each of these parking lots, they could build up to the lot line and that would the alley would still that end.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So what you're talking about is just still making it a dead end alley and it's going to be shorter. Right. So my other question is the building that is sort of to the northeast that has looks like an elevated parking.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Does that go over the alley? Yes. Yes, it does. All right. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Black. 1859, we became a city. I just thought that was important information, but. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And Uncle Dick Wooten's saloon opened.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. Okay, I. I have another question for the. So. So, obviously, we're starting to understand a little bit that this is a private lot. And it's, you know, there's no technical qualifications for us to for me voting for this to deny it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I am concerned about a alley that is blocked. A lot of cars go in there, met with some residents and they talked about, you know, having an alley that's going to be closed and not have that light come in.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Are you guys willing to put lights in the alley to just make sure we have a well-lit alley?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes, we are.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And did you talk to the neighborhood about that?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We did. We offered we offered lighting as well as that. We know that the neighbors also had some security concerns relating to vagrancy or whatnot in the alley. And we are also willing to put in security cameras and to monitor the alley.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And the last question, we each have a huge, uh, I believe is a lawsuit on our, on our desk that we've been looking into. This is not a lawsuit against the city. This is a lawsuit with you and the neighbors.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'No, the neighbors have filed a lawsuit against both you, all the city and against us. It's in the form of Rule 106 action challenging the decision by the Lower Downtown Design Review Board to approve the maps form in context of the project.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And the basic premise of the lawsuit is that the neighbors are alleging that they have a right of ingress and egress across Unicom's property and that by approving the maps form in context of the project, the Lower Downtown Design Review Board has interfered with that right of ingress and egress, as has been spoken to tonight.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The neighbors do not have a right of ingress and egress across our our client's property. And so and they've never had a right of ingress or egress across our client's property. So we are currently working with your city attorney's office to defend that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. But if I'm clear tonight, that lawsuit is not on this particular on council Bill 153. It's okay. All right. The it's been moved in, seconded all members of council. 153 is now on the floor. Madam Secretary, roll call.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Kenny Lopez. All right. New black. I clerk.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I Gilmore. I cashin.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Mr. President.'"
