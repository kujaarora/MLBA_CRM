    "A resolution renewing the declaration of a Local Disaster. Extends the local disaster declaration of March 12, 2020 to May 11, 2020. Councilmember Clark approved direct filing this item on 3-13-20.": [
        "'speaker_0': 'No items have been called out and under pending. No items have been called out. Did I miss anything? All right. Madam Secretary, if you please, for the first item on our screens and councilmember terms, will you please put resolution 281 on the floor?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I move that council resolution 281 be adopted.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It has been moved and seconded questions by members of council. So first up, we have these are two late files that I called out. The first one is our renewal of the the local disaster declaration. So questions will do questions and comments as we move through here, see how many people are in the queue.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Leach.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I first want to thank the mayor for his bold and decisive leadership during this time and making decisions very early in the process, which will hopefully help to save lives. I just wanted to as we talk about emergency declarations, we've been doing a lot of education with our constituents that these issues really are'",
        "'speaker_1': 'administrative in terms of freeing up more potential funding in the future to reimburse the city for costs that it has incurred, etc.. I do see that we have our budget director here and I would not have brought her down for this question, but since she's here, it might be helpful, if I may ask her a question.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Jordan Thank you. I'd like to know if you can just explain to us whether any state or federal funding is available and flowing to the city at this time, or whether that is mostly a post hoc situation. And then the second question is whether or how you might be able to stay in communication with us about things'",
        "'speaker_1': 'like state or federal funding. You know, my guess is we will not need to act unless they hit that $500,000 threshold. But for us to understand what assistance the city is receiving and knowing you have many jobs right now and that you're probably juggling other things as well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But but just kind of trying to get a sense of how we can stay in touch with the financial impacts to the city, at least on the spending side. Thank you, sir. Stephanie Adams, budget managing director for the city and county of Denver.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So, Councilman, at this time, there are no federal dollars that are flowing to the city and county of Denver. We are prepared and been monitoring very vigilantly to make sure that we're tracking our existing spending. I think probably, as you know, and many people are surprised, we don't set aside dollars specifically for emergencies.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We don't know when they would come up. That's why they're emergencies. So we're currently having agencies use their existing appropriation to do that. So that is currently our status. We are in touch with the Federal Government as well as the state to understand what might be available and trying to stay ahead of making sure we're tracking our'",
        "'speaker_1': 'expenditures appropriately for any kind of reimbursements or any opportunities. But we have not applied for any of those at this time, but we're monitoring them. And your second question, I believe, is how to stay abreast of what is going on?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, you know, it is an evolving thing. I will tell you that we had a set of messaging that we were talking to our agencies about on Wednesday, and by Friday it was kind of irrelevant. So we're doing our best to stay on top of it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'As you know, the mayor is having weekly press conferences. I don't believe anything has been set up specifically for city council, although I'm looking at Kevin to see if there's any conversation that's being had. We're still trying to figure out how to stay in close communication with our agencies and moving as quickly as possible and in trying'",
        "'speaker_1': 'to be as responsive and communicative as possible. And. Is there anything if I can just follow up, I just want to say thank you very much. I think that, you know, information about health services, finance is all very different.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I wouldn't expect you to be responsible for anything. I guess I would ask if you do have the opportunity where we do secure state or federal funding, if you can please notify the council of that, even if it's at an amount that doesn't require us to take action just so we can see.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And as our constituents ask us questions, are we getting help? When do we get help? It may not be for a long time, but just if it happens, can you just let us know? That would be great. Certainly.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'As soon as we understand what we'll be applying for, we'll do that. To your point, though, I just want to point out to everyone that oftentimes, in our experience has been in the past with disasters, it could take 2 to 3 years actually to get reimbursement from FEMA.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Specifically, of course, this is a very unique circumstance, and we know that there are other kinds of funding available. So we believe that our best course of action is to make sure that we're being vigilant about tracking our expenditures, understanding how to use and preserve our reserves, looking at our budget and taking advantage of those opportunities as'",
        "'speaker_1': 'they come as they become available. But but we recognize that those are in the future. Thank you. Certainly.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Councilmember Hines.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Don't go anywhere. Come on back. So since you're here, thank you. Thank you very much for coming. And I wasn't also necessarily I wouldn't have called you down, but since you're here, I thought we had set aside or we're targeting a 15% reserve.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Where are we in relation to that 15% reserve? All right. Do we have the 15%?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We do. Councilman, we're actually closing the books and we're waiting for our final audits to come through. We believe will will end a little above those reserves, given some of our unspent from the previous year. You may recall at the end of last year, we work with agencies and ask them to pull back on spending and they'",
        "'speaker_1': 'really stepped up. And so we are going to finish a little above that 15%. I can't give you a number yet. Want to make sure our numbers are audited, Alisyn, to remind you of our contingency that's available to in in our financial policies.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's the first place we'll go. I expect to be sitting in front of you here shortly to talk a little bit about how to leverage that contingency as we get a better handle on what we need to spend over the next several months.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then also, several people have reached out for small business assistance and rental and mortgage assistance. I mean, I know that a lot of our revenue that we collect is from lodgers fees and sales tax. I think that's about half the but half the revenue.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Right. So as as people as as we get emergencies that the national, state and local level that tell people not to congregate and not to travel and not to go to hotels, that affects us as well. So I'm not trying to put you on the spot, but since you're here, what I'm guessing that our budget is in'",
        "'speaker_5': 'a bigger crunch and so it's hard for us to then open up more money for for small businesses, for hotels and for rental and mortgage assistance. Do you have any thoughts on that?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilman, we're evaluating all of our options. We recognize that while we have an obligation to assure that we have the funding to continue the commitments that we've currently made and maybe some changes to our work plan, we also recognize that our community is hurting in trying to understand what sort of balance we have.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To your point, not only is it about understanding the level of expenditures and the needs out there, but we're trying to understand what the impact might be on our revenue. Again, on Wednesday, we were trying to understand what the potential impact might be of just the conferences that we're no longer coming.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Here are the visitors who are no longer coming here. And now we recognize that with our restaurants and bars being closed, that will be a pretty significant impact on our revenues. So I will I am 100% sure that we will be revising down the 2020 revenue assumptions, but we're still trying to understand with the severity and the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'length of this impact might be. So I don't have a good answer for you. Now, I am sure that we will have to to revise down our revenue and we'll be coming to you as soon as we have a better handle on that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. Thank you. And I can only imagine the position that you're in. I mean, the you know, the state just presented their budget analysis this afternoon. I didn't I didn't pay attention because we were focusing on local things.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But I can only imagine just the whirlwind that you were going through. And so I didn't expect you to have answers right now. But but people are asking questions. So so if you could consider that. Absolutely. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then. So one other question that I have that isn't related to budget is we want to extend until May 11th, not for seven days, but for the entire declaration for the mayors.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That right. So thank you for that question, Councilmember. You know, a lot of you know, as you have heard, there is new information coming in every second. And and there are a lot of opportunities hopefully potentially for funding open with this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So this was arrived at based on the latest from the CDC at the time this was drafted, which was suggesting that large events and gatherings of over 50 people, there's now possibly new recommendations coming out be canceled for the next eight weeks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we know that our citizens, our businesses are going to be dealing with some sort of restriction from the CDC that is going to be affecting them at least through then. And instead of putting it at a future date on a council meeting, again, if we arrive at a place where we'll talk about next, where there is'",
        "'speaker_0': 'a council meeting, where there is not immediate action that we need to take, that we may choose to cancel to avoid congregating. This gives us the flexibility of not having to constantly be up against that possible loss of of this when we know we're going to be feeling the effects of it, at least for the next eight'",
        "'speaker_0': 'weeks.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And it is possible for us to reconvene and rescind the balance of that of that order, as I. Correct?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, that is correct. So this now falls within our purview to to rescind or to further extend if there are new guidelines coming from the CDC.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Great. Thank you. Our budget office. And thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilmember. Seeing no other comments or questions on this item. Madam Secretary, roll call on resolution 281.'",

And I'll just start by saying, you know, again, as we enter uncharted territory and as there are new recommendations coming from the CDC and from our public health officials, every day, we have been trying to dove in and look at'",
        "'speaker_0': 'what might happen, what could happen and be prepared for those situations. One of the things that exists for us now is that even if we were to decide that it was in the best interest of public health, that this body not meet, and that is not something that we have decided as of yet or that is planned'",
        "'speaker_0': '. But in any situation that might lead to that. R And to still require that we come someone come down and open that meeting, take attendance, show that there is not a quorum of us here to conduct that meeting and then close the meeting, which has happened a couple of times over the course of the last four years'",
        "'speaker_0': 'before we, you know, fixed some of the weeks that we don't meet, the four weeks of the year that we don't meet. We had a couple of times where so many people were out of town on, you know, family stuff that we had to do just that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so as we're grappling with, you know, our open meeting rules with what's in the charter about how we conduct our business, this was one of the things that was identified that we can fix. It will take two readings.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we're introducing it today and we'll have it again next week. But that allows for in an emergency situation for the cancelation or suspension of a meeting without our secretary coming down here to do that often with, you know, any members who are available only to determine that there is no need for a meeting.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So that's kind of the crux of this as we move forward, you know, continue to identify ways and places where we can adapt. I think there's a broader conversation that this particular issue has shown a light on that we that that we need to look at, you know, from a code we participate not in this room.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And what does that look like from access to the public? Could the public participate in something that needed to move forward without being in this room? And, you know, other cities have taken action to amend their charter and allow for virtual participation or amend their open meeting rules.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think that's something that we need to take a good look at. Doing that quickly and on the fly as we're doing it is hard and we want to make sure that we get that right because there's a lot that goes into that beyond just the current situation that we're in.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But as we work through that, if we continue to identify places that can be fixed, that do make sense and can or couched in areas like during periods of emergency that give us some increased flexibility items like this that we can continue to bring forward.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You know, I also want to just thank some of our colleagues who were not here today as we continue to also heed the recommendations of our public health officials. And out of, you know, the phrase that I think we're all getting sick of hearing, but out of an abundance of caution, we have some members who are not'",
        "'speaker_0': 'here this evening. And I think we're going to have to continue to grapple with how do we conduct business and make sure that we are able to do that. And part of that is making sure that, you know, when someone feels that they should or should not be here, that enough of us are here to continue conducting'",
        "'speaker_0': 'that business. But one of the members who wasn't here, you know, really has some questions about how do we not just at this meeting, but get getting updates from the administration on stuff like we were just talking about about what kind of funding is coming through, what kind of programs are there, what needs legislative action and all'",
        "'speaker_0': 'of this? How can we help? How can we assist? How can we work as a team? So we'll continue to look at outside of the tight confines that we're in. From a charter perspective for this meeting, are there other opportunities for us to get updates, briefings that don't require people to be in the same room outside of'",
        "'speaker_0': 'this meeting? And how do we navigate that? So certainly the beginning of conversations to come, but this was one part that gives us some some flexibility under certain scenarios that we may or may not face in the coming weeks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right, Councilmember Sawyer.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. I couldn't have put it better. That was a great kind of summation of the conversations that we have had over the past week. And I think it's really important, you know, for the public who hasn't been able to be a part of those conversations as readily to kind of catch people up on on what is'",
        "'speaker_1': 'happening. So so, you know, because this is an emergency, because we are in an emergency that none of us expected to be a part of. You know, I think it's important that both of these rules be moved forward and be adopted tonight.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That said, I think that when we are no longer in an emergency, we need to go back and have some serious discussions about what these look like and how we move forward from here. Because I do think that we need to talk about things like remote participation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And if we had talked about remote participation before now, we would be able to remotely participate now, and that would be fantastic so that we wouldn't have to be here and having these conversations right now. We wouldn't have to all be in this in this room.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There are precedents across the state for remote participation. It's something we could be doing. And it's a shame that the that we've got members who can't be here tonight for various reasons and who, you know and and who should be able to participate.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If we had done this earlier and had these conversations previously, we they would be able to be here. So I am I am supportive of putting forth both of these rules this evening, both of these ordinances and establishing them.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I'm also suspicious of them. I think that they are they are being put in place fast. They are being put in place without the kind of full, broad spectrum discussion that we probably need to have around them.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think that we need to make sure that we go back and have that discussion and make some changes to these when we're no longer in an emergency. And I just want to make sure that that's on record.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank Councilmember Councilmember Gilmore.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, President Clark. I am in full support of of this bill tonight and putting it forward. I think that we do need to have more conversation about what the tools are at our fingertips fingertips now. And I have talked with Kirsten Crawford, our city attorney, and asked her to put together a legal memo, at least identifying'",
        "'speaker_6': 'the top two or three next steps that we could maybe evaluate, especially with our committee structure. Could we do some sort of remote committee structure so that at least there's transparency for the public to see what's happening within city government or what those other tools may be?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We don't need to speculate on what those are tonight, but if we're really looking at another eight weeks of restrictions, the public does deserve to know what is going on and have access to that. And I just want to be able to explore what our options are.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, President Clark.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think Councilmember. Councilmember Hines.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I've just learned from one of our colleagues who isn't here tonight that the CDC has revised its guidance once again and and says that there should be no more than ten people in a room at a time, which would make our meetings difficult just to and not violate the CDC guidelines.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Of course, this is a very fluid conversation since the CDC issued their other guidelines for 50 people, I think, on Friday or Thursday. So we're we're moving very, very quickly. And I want to recognize Councilperson Sawyers comments about we should think about this at some point in the future when we're not having we're not basically up against'",
        "'speaker_5': 'a wall. But I do have a question for Ms.. Crawford. Would it be possible for us to add a placeholder for open public virtual meetings for council and not have that defined since we're changing the ordinance with this build to 82?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I mean, should we amend it and add that tonight or should we wait?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I think I understand the question. Kirsten Crawford Legislative Council under three point to 3.3.2 of the Charter. There are very rigid requirements that apply to regular Monday meetings. So the only way we've been able to thread the needle to make less rigidity is to talk about the schedule.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The charter used to provide the council had to meet shall meet 52 weeks. We changed the charter to make observance. We to make accommodations through ordinance for observance of holidays. We are not alone with our rigidities. There are some other large cities both in Colorado and nationwide that have some of these rigidities.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I do think there is a possibility to go fairly quickly to virtual meetings when it comes to any other sort of body or council committee, for example. It's not without complications, but it can be done. It's a very large policy debate, but there we've become a little bit focused on one tool in the toolbox, virtual participation, when'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think there are many others that still need to be explored. And that's one of the conversations I've had with Councilwoman Gilmore. And those conversations are occurring throughout the city. So so we will be coming forward with more proposals to allow accommodations.'",
