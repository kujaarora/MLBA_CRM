        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I'm proud to read a proclamation. Three or three series of 2018 has to be three or three. This is old school Denver. This is proclaiming our solidarity with March for Our Lives efforts and with the survivors of gun violence at home and across the nation.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Whereas on the afternoon of the 14th of February 2018, a mass shooting occurred at Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, and 17 teachers and students lost their opportunity to ever live, laugh or love again. And. WHEREAS, the victims of Stoneman Douglas High School.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Were the most recent among the 406 496 victims of mass shootings in the past ten years. And with Parkland being the most recent school shooting. And. Whereas, here in Colorado, we intimately understand the painful and devastating the impact of mass shootings and gun violence in our communities.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And. Whereas on March 14th. School communities across this country, including tens of thousands of students right here in Denver and throughout Colorado, walked out of classrooms to send one message. Enough. And. WHEREAS, we are proud to see students leaning decisively in this country to protect themselves and their educators.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'As well as to honor the voices of our students and school communities. The collective strength of their voices will prevail. In the streets and in the voting booth. Demanding that all lives are defended. And. Whereas, 300 738 communities around the globe, including the Mile High City of Denver, will host a march for our Life, March for Our'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Lopez. Your motion to adopt.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I move that proclamation three or three series of 2018 be adopted.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It has been moved and seconded. Comments. Members Accounts. Guzman Lopez.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mr. President. It is with great pride. That I read this proclamation here tonight. I was contacted by students. They said that simply said, Can you please pass the proclamation? We said yes. Normally it takes a while kind to have a process, but this is something that is near and dear to our hearts.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This is something that. We believe in. This is something that so many students. From. I mean, I think almost. Almost every school that I can think of in my neighborhood. Walked out for. And you know, we've seen walkouts for political demonstrations and walkouts for expression.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So many different times for so many different causes. But this is the first time I've seen it like this. And we have to. Listen to our children. I've heard people say that, well, they're not old enough to vote.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Why they walk in and they should be in class. Social studies is best taught on the picket line, ladies and gentlemen. And we have to have the backs of our students, whether they're in elementary school or middle school or high school.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I want to make it loud and clear in these chambers and in this city that to be a constituent, to be. To have a voice in this city. You don't just have to be a voter. As a matter of fact, I mean, we don't encourage it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But you don't have to vote and you still have a voice. We still represent you. To be to be quite honest, you could be someone that goes to the polls every year, that goes to every single caucus and has have been for decades.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Or you can be a kindergartner. At Castro Elementary and in my district. And you have the same voice. And then when those voices are saying, help us, please enact legislation or do something, please help us elevate our voices so people can can hear our plea.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And that's to keep our schools safe. You know, I didn't put this I didn't put this passage in this proclamation because we have a process that we respect to move it to committee. And every time there's something that we ask of another or another government entity, we do bring it to committee.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But however, I'm going to do it right here on the podium. Because it's my free speech. We want the federal government to act. Congress needs to act. This president needs to act. Enough with the lip service and let's start acting.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Let's start taking. If we loved our kids just as much as we love our guns in this country, things would happen. And I've seen I saw a child that had just the cutest kid I've ever seen. I. Well next to my daughter.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Don't tell her that I said that. Had this little sign that said. Literally very simply written. Bear hugs, not arms. He's walking up and down, happy as can be. Dumped out by Carpenter Middle School. Powerful message. I couldn't be prouder to read this proclamation into the record.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And to ask my colleagues to support this proclamation moving forward. I urge people to attend these kind of rallies, these kind of actions. People need to see our action in mass, our demonstration in mass, and this does that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I understand we have guests who are here today who are survivors. We have students here today. We want to hear from you. I know you have an opportunity to come to the podium to receive this proclamation. But I just wanted to.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So my colleagues support this. Thank you for the time, Mr. President. Thank you for the consideration to file this proclamation late. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. Thank you, Councilman Love. First for bringing it forward. This is incredibly important, Councilman Cashman.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. President. And thank you, Councilman Lopez, for bringing it forward. I'd like to ask the secretary to add my name to the proclamation. You know, in all the discussion, especially over the past year or so, about these ongoing mass shootings in our schools, a light bulb suddenly went on for me that thinking of all of'",
        "'speaker_6': 'the kids who have been born since Columbine and that this is all they know. You know, when I was a kid, it was back in the days when we were afraid that Russia was going to drop a nuke.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we hid under our desk and that never happened. And pretty soon in the middle of our air raid drills, we'd be making jokes under our desks, and then we'd go back and play and everything was fine. But I was sitting at a family dinner recently talking with my grandkids who are 13 and 11.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And my granddaughter, the 13 year old is. Asher is a powerful young woman, and she started crying because she said she gets afraid. It's not every day, but she gets afraid that someone's coming into her school and she was crying because she was worried about her cousins who are eight and four, and that someone might go into'",
        "'speaker_6': 'their school. And so it just brought home to me the difference in my experience. I look at I look at the numbers and I think logically, as has been said, we have more work to do and there's more work we will do.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But I think of the numbers and the policies, and it just put me in touch with with the fear that our young people live with every day. So I'll echo Councilman Lopez's urging that our state leaders and our federal leaders join us in doing more to protect our children.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, thank you, Councilman Castro and Councilman Espinosa. Yeah. I'm going to give you the names at the Senate. And it was seven Senator Owen Hill, Senator Vicki Marbles and Senator Jerry Sonnenberg. That those three people, of all the representatives at the state House is is who prevented it from going from a vote for Denver representatives to opine'",
        "'speaker_0': 'on that? And so that is the politics of our country, politics of our state, politics at every scale. So I just want you to remember those names because they're the ones that are not letting your representatives speak to this issue at the state level.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thanks. Thank you, Councilman Espinosa. Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I just want to ask the council secretary to add my name. And I just wanted to make one comment. I can remember after the shooting in Aurora, my grandson, I can't remember, gosh, this has been a number of years now, but he was afraid to go to the movies.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And, you know, when we see our kids afraid to go to school for the same reasons, this is not the norm we should be accepting in the United States. You see, in other countries, they have taken care of this issue where gun violence is not prevalent and it's not the norm.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And we need to get to a place where everybody in our community feels safe. So, Councilman Lopez, thank you for bringing this forward to our youth, for your work in helping to bring this forward and the work that youth across our city have done in mobilizing the the walk out to make this message loud and clear that'",
        "'speaker_8': 'enough is enough. We hear you. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mr. President. There's a number of democratic kind of engagement democracy events on Saturday, so I will not be able to be at the march with you in person, but wanted you to know that I will be there in spirit.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I think for any of us who can't be there in person to express that will be important so that the voice is louder and more unified. So thank you for bringing this forward and good luck on Saturday.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Raising your voices.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilwoman, can each see no other comments? My, my my first work out of college, I was working with young people and man below high school, and it's it's it's the best work that I've ever done, because those young people taught me about life, leadership.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And, you know, Bishop, there's a reason Jesus chose disciples and they're all in high school. And one of the reasons is they don't have a mortgage, they don't have a job to to to report to. They don't care.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They're going to live their passion, their truth every day. And I think this is a special time in our history where we need to be following these young people. And so I'm 100% supportive of this. Councilman Lopez, thank you for bringing this forward.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'll be supportive. I'll be marching. I was I was with the principal who was helping diocese to call students organize. We got principals helping them organize to march out of school because they see the leadership and the passion and the intelligence from these young folks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so we as city council stand with you all. Thank you so much for what you all have done and getting us to to get to this level as adults. Right. We're following you. So thank you, Madam Secretary.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Raquel Lopez. I knew Ortega Sussman Black. Clark. All right. Espinosa.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Flynn, i.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Herndon. Cashman. Each. Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I. Police also very nice results. 1212 ise proclamation 303 has been adopted. Councilman lopez, anybody want to bring up to speak?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes, I do want to bring up some of the students. Mr. Anderson. And if you want to also introduce. Two of the speakers.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Mr. President. City Council words. I'm speechless that you were the first city in our state to publicly give your support towards this initiative and standing with so many thousands of young people that are going to march on Saturday and letting them know that you hear them and enough is enough.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have with us today somebody who has survived one of these school shootings here in our state. And so I just want to make sure that we all know in this chamber that we have victims right here in Colorado that have went through this same situation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And Martin Luther King always had a dream that we would reach the mountaintop. But members and and people in the audience, we haven't reached it. But us as young people are going to continue his dream. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I wanted to thank you all the city and Council of Denver. Every single council member that stands before me sits before me for doing this. Councilman Espinosa. Councilman Ortega, your comments earlier about the senators who did not pass.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We look at them as examples, but we don't have to worry as a young people and as a movement, because if they don't want to listen to us in office, they.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Don't have to because they.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Won't be in office. We will vote them out and we will not change.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We will work civically and we will make sure.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That our kids, our siblings, our family, our friends never have to worry about never coming home again. And I wanted to thank you, because as a young person, seeing my parents, my grandparents who have worked hard, who have tried and have been unsuccessful, it is daunting as an 18 year old to come before you and be working'",
        "'speaker_1': 'on this mission. But you give us hope. You drive the passion that we have because we see that our voices are being heard. And we know that we will not stop until we never have to worry about students never coming home, about teachers never coming home from their jobs, from their livelihoods ever again.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I wanted to thank you, all of you, from the bottom of my heart.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Council members. I'd just like to say that we've we've been saying among ourselves and in the public for a while that this isn't just a march and that this is a movement.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And at the heart of that movement.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Isn't just about reforming our gun laws. It's about ensuring the safety of our students and ensuring the well-being of the public. And I just got to say, from from the bottom of my heart to here, you all stand in solidarity with us that that just pulls.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In my heart. I just want to say thank you so much.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And absolutely, you know, this is a youth led movement.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But that doesn't mean it's youth exclusive. And just as my colleague Andre has said here, where we fully intend to make sure that, you know, we may have grown up in the school shooting generation, but we want to make sure that we're the last ones that have to do that and we're going to get there with your'",
        "'speaker_1': 'help. And just thank you all so much from the bottom of my heart.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I just wanted to express my thanks really quickly to Councilman Lopez for bringing this issue and helping us accelerate this issue and also to. Councilman Espinosa, it was great to have you in the Senate and testifying for these legislation that unfortunately did not pass but should have.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I just wanted to thank each and every one of you for your support and for supporting our cause. And I want you all to know that we will keep working because your support makes it so. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. All right. Thank you. Thanks again, Councilman Lopez. We're going to read the resolutions, Madam Secretary. Please read them.'"

    "A resolution approving a proposed Second Amendatory Agreement to Sublease Agreement between the City and County of Denver and DP Media Network LLC for the addition of 27,467 square feet on the 9th floor of 101 W. Colfax Avenue. Adds $9,629,641.85 to the sublease agreement with DP Media Network LLC for a new total of $31,319,346.69 for an additional 27,467 square feet of office space on the 9th floor of the Denver Post building at 101 West Colfax Avenue for City use (FINAN - 201626030-02). The last regularly scheduled Council meeting within the 30-day review period is on 4-9-18. The Committee approved filing this resolution at its meeting on 2-20-18.": [

We have nothing called out. Madam Secretary, please pull up the first item. 191. Councilman Flynn, we put resolution one on the floor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'When? 91 on the.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Floor. Sure, Mr. President. I move that council resolution 18 dash 191 be adopted.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. It has been moved and seconded comments by members of council. Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Mr. President, I ask that this be called out for a vote because I wanted to vote no on it. I understand the terms of the lease. It seems that we're paying less per square foot than we did for the last sublease we did with the Denver Post over at 101 West Colfax.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But when I reviewed the agenda over the weekend, again, I just couldn't I just couldn't vote yes to pay $9 million plus to to the parent company of The Denver Post after they laid off 30 journalists in this town, one third of their staff.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And it's just. Mr. President, just something I couldn't I couldn't do. So I wanted to have it out for a separate vote. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you. Councilman Flynn, any other comments by members of Council Councilman Ortega?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Mr. President. So one of the the important things that I have requested is to see an overall. Real estate master plan. And what I learned from our real estate office is that every agency has their own real estate plan.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But somebody has to have that comprehensive look in where we go with as a city in looking at future needs. You know, we own a property that was purchased by the city that we ended up not utilizing that could have been used for office space over in southwest Denver.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It would be far cheaper to renovate that and utilize that facility than to be utilizing the Denver Post building where we already have two floors of that building. Some of the more expensive real estate. We don't have to have every agency concentrated downtown.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We have a variety of agencies that have historically been scattered across the city. You know, we have our Rosslyn office out in northeast Denver. We have our wastewater department in southwest Denver. You know, this is part of how our city has functioned.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I just think it doesn't make sense to be spending this much money for downtown real estate when we own property elsewhere. So I will be voting no tonight on this as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilman Ortega, Councilman Lopez.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I think Councilman Flynn. There's some solidarity on that when I'm. I'll be voting.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No as well, too. Yeah. All right. Any other comments from members of council? Got questions on this or this? Okay. You didn't log in, but Councilman Nu, you got a question for real?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think you called me.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. Real estate. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Is someone here from Lisa?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Good evening. Lisa Lemley, Division of Real Estate.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Lisa, thank you.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Can you go over some of the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Costs associated with this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That we've commented on and how.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Long is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This agreement this sublease?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I am going to apologize because the term I did not bring with me, i believe it goes through 2028, which is consistent with The Denver Post. So these are Subleases from The Denver Post. So we stay within that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It's to give us the expansion and contraction ability right now that we need with the overflow that we have in Webb. I can't address that. Actually, the building that Councilwoman Ortega is mentioning, we have been looking at some other internal city uses that we may be utilizing that building for what has made the Denver Post building a'",
        "'speaker_8': 'worthwhile one to have the discussion for. Is that it? Especially this ninth floor? We need to be clear. The Denver Post was not on this floor. It was another tenant. And Denver Post had the lease with the other tenant.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The tenant was downsizing. We stepped in, which is why the lease rate is also less than the other sublet release that we have in place. And it was just backfilling their space, so we were not moving any Denver Post agency employees out of that floor.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But it does allow us to have efficiencies with the agencies that are already in the building, the technology that is already in the building, and the proximity to web not for our employees so much as for other clients or public that comes that needs to go sometimes between a couple of different agencies.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And what is the cost per square foot for?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'For this one, it's $28.20.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And for.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Me and you know, in.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The DAMION dollars, you know, it's about.'",
        "'speaker_10': '$350.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'A square foot that we could use to build a facility. Sound like for that kind of money you could you could possibly build a are used to renovate another space would more cheaply or do you think is.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well I think time well I don't know that we could do it any that's a hard one to answer because we're comparing different things. What I would say is timing is an issue for us though, as we've had the new fees for the last few years that have continued to increase up around 250 is a year.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Where we've got about you owed about 13,000.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Employees.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Permanent in.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Temporary.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Positions. And so I think.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Councilwoman.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Ortega brought up a good point. We need to plan out the total real estate.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I mean, there's this is a very large workforce, a.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Huge employer base.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so it would be nice to know how we're going to be able to manage the office.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Space and work.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And we could sit with you. Absolutely. As Councilwoman Ortega referenced, and I believe I mentioned it at one of the a previous city council meeting, we do look, especially for our major agencies, we look at the master planning efforts so that we understand how they are growing, what their business function is, so we can prepare for that'",
        "'speaker_8': '. Within that, then we take it and apply it as well as some of the other plans, the overall looking at the overall portfolio of the city. So we are looking down the road at a three and five year plan.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And if we did not approve this tonight, what would the impact would that be on?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It would be very significant in terms of some other moves that are there's it's almost a domino effect for us to be able to address some of the other issues that we're trying to find space for within web so that we can bring those and allow those hires to happen.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank very much. Thank you. Yeah, just piggyback on that. Can you name the agency that's to be moved to for.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The ninth floor? It's Parks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So this would is it fair to say that it would impact our new employee, FTE, that we have hired for 2018?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It would as it impacts the ones that have not been able to be hired yet. Got it. That's the key.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Espinosa. So we have 30 to 50 FTE coming to Parks.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I don't have those numbers in front of me. I'm sorry. I can certainly confirm that for you tomorrow.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That would just be huge increase over what I know. So that's. That's. That would be worth knowing. The. Yeah. Yeah, no, that was Councilman President Brooks. That was the question I had. So thank you very much. Yeah. Thank you, Councilman Espinosa.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Seen? No, Dr. Sussman.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That reminded me of a question. Thank you, Mr. President. Isn't the plan also to include the number of employees that we may be hiring with the bond project? That we are expecting quite a number of new fees. And and even the council has requested there be even extra employees for things like traffic and transportation.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Yes, this includes when we look at this overall plan again for Webb, for the expansion that would go into the Denver Post, building other locations as well. It takes in the approved of TS. That also includes our Bond team that will be coming on and growing as the projects grow, as well as other consultants'",
        "'speaker_8': '. So other agencies, tech services, one also hire consultants that are not in that FTE number that we work for. So this.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Is part of a planning correct face that you all are doing for the city and for office.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Use. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Just comments from Councilman Espinosa. Yeah. I think at some point I'm going to want to sort of understanding I mean, since for three years we've been asking for that real estate master plan and some sort of long me and wide, wide scope vision of of of real estate and space and and space planning and all this'",
        "'speaker_0': 'stuff. We keep doing this incremental thing. Bonds are not new weeds. We just got out of the ten year bond. Somehow we did it. We went through a recession and cut down FTE. So without, you know. So I would like to understand how many square footage did we how many square feet did we get rid of when'",

        "'speaker_8': 'But I think it's also important to know that when the city had passed our jail bond issue and moved to construct our justice center, there was a lot of work that went into looking at what kind of programs were being offered within our jail system.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And there was a lot of restructuring that was done to ensure that we had a comprehensive approach to how those services were being offered.

You know, we have one with the Rocky Mountain Human Services that has been in place with the city since its inception.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And that goes all the way back to, I want to say, 2003. It may even be before that. And we've never talked about putting that one out to bid.

        "'speaker_8': '. And I just think that this was one that was doing a great job.

        "'speaker_8': 'And I had the opportunity to be directly involved with that when I worked at the Denver Department of Human Services with our homeless community, which is a big part of that same population. And I just didn't understand the reason for the need to put it out to bid.'",

We know that there's plenty of work to be done. We always talk about other doom preventing folks from from being in a facility, the facility, or from being in jail'",
        "'speaker_7': ', preventing recidivism. We know that caseloads grow. We know it's difficult work. We know folks who are that are not paid enough that do this kind of work. So why is this only a short term? $500,000 contract. When the need in our city is so much more.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'It's very common in our council in the way we do business in our city that you don't bring something last minute expecting it to just pass on a rush. There are very valid questions and in it I didn't like the position that we were put in a city council to say, you either do this or there's going'",

        "'speaker_7': 'These are folks lives. And I think very, very carefully about that. This contract to me is divisive. It is not sensitive of the. The challenges that we have in our community, the politics in the community. The fact that some of these organizations.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We're now fighting for this. Just two years ago. Less than a year ago. We're stripped of its workforce dollars. And we went to bat when that happened, saying, you do not privatize those dollars. This organization deserves those dollars.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'They've been working in the community from day one. And we saw those dollars stripped away. Third party, only to be done terribly worse. And we said, I told you so. The same fight. For the same cause. It did not have to be a contract that said either or.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Especially given the times that we're in, i. I made a proposal. It's easy for someone to be a critic. It's easy for someone to say, I'm not going to vote for this and this is my out. This is not easy.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There are folks who I respect dearly in this room. I'm here to be a steward of your public dollars and to make sure that the work that we contract for it gets done and is done in a way that that gets more people involved in it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'A contract like this should unite our community, not divide it over $550,000 for less than a year now. I'm not here to watch a contract of ours with the intent. Of the people that's supposed to help be thrown at us across the fence and we fight over it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I don't like that in our community. I don't like. The politics involved in it. So why not a proposal that lasts for more than three years? Why not go back and do a budget supplemental? This is what I asked.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Let's double it. If we truly wanted to reduce recidivism and we wanted to have all hands on deck and the resources that we truly need. And it really. It's not what we truly need, but. Why don't we make it a million?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Why don't we give these organizations the opportunity? To. To do it together. Not fighting over one little piece. But let's get it done. And. This is something that I intend to bring to if this doesn't. This moves forward tonight.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You. Mark my word. Come budget season. This is what I'm going to ask for. I do not like seeing our community divided. Especially. When is our contract in the city that's doing it? I don't like that. And I hope you understand why I cast my novel community.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's on principle. Has nothing to do with personalities. Has everything to do. Right here in this house. This is where it needs to be fixed. So, Mr. President, I will not be supporting this contract. It is not a fair contract.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And it. It doesn't recognize the bigger picture. This community cannot not be divided anymore.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, Councilman. Councilman Cashman.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I'm nothing but respect for my. Colleagues. Comments. Councilman Lopez. Councilwoman Ortega. This contract process. I have my own questions and concerns for the way it's rolled out and whatnot. For me, it just comes down simply.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'To. We have inmates every day. Rolling out of our downtown detention center, our county jail, that need services that haven't had them now for going on three months. I will stand with Councilman Lopez if you want to increase the level of service.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's 100% needed. Our jail system, the entire system is woefully underfunded. We don't have the staffing in it now that we need. As has been mentioned at committee, a number of us went out to California to look at the Las Colinas jail and the staffing levels there far surpass what we've got, the the environment that they've got'",
        "'speaker_6': 'to execute a corrections system that has something real to do about rehabilitation. It far exceeds what we've got here. But we have the system that we have and we have inmates now that need services. I heard it suggested that we could kill this and that the jail staff could just fill in.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I don't believe that to be true. I believe that the previous vendor, CERP, was doing important work at the jail. That our understaffed jail staff. Was not able to do. And I believe that work was important. As has been mentioned, I asked our our human resources people what was their.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Denver. Denver Human Services. Was there any problem with the previous vendor where they notified of and they weren't doing the job? And I was told no, that was never stated. So I have some issues as to why this was put out to bid when it was put out to bid.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But we need services in our jail. Our inmates deserve those services. And I believe that it needs to be done by an organization that is is focused on that as their primary work, not overburdened jail staff. Asked to fill in on overtime or in a different capacity when we don't have the staff we need to adequately supervise'",
        "'speaker_6': 'are inmates as it is. So with that, Mr. President, I will be. Somewhat hesitantly, but recognizing the need supporting this contract moving forward.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilman. Councilman Espinosa. Yeah, I am. I actually believe this is going to be the finest year in transition services we're ever going to have. Why do I believe that? Because the contractors have almost no choice but to do that right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I've already articulated in committee clearly my concerns about how this contract came about and the situation we find ourselves in. But with a one year contract, we'll be here this time next year with now an embattled mayor. Well, under this question that that that my colleagues are speaking to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so it sort of compels the providers to not only meet the level of service that we were obtaining before, but to exceed it. I think they've committed to that and I don't I think they're going to try in earnest, but now they're really in that between a rock and a hard place.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I do think that you've got three, three capable entities where you had one. So I think the work is cut out for them, and I think they intend every bit of them intend to deliver on those outcomes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So while I still have those questions that I articulated in committee, you know, I am I'm committed to our inmates, committed to getting this new contract in place and seeing seeing those organizations not only meet, but exceed expectations.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so that we can come back, hopefully in a year's time and wonder what this was all about. So thank you all for for enduring this process. Good luck. And I hope that is the case. Thanks. All right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Espinosa. There are probably many people watching try and maybe if you just came in and you're trying to figure out what's going on here. This is a reentry contract for one year, $550,000. And it's Council Bill 145.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Our our call our evaluation here is to look and see if the current proposers can do the work. This is what I'll tell you, the majority of the people in that jail over there. Our African-American Latino. And homeless.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What we have before us is a resource de la Raza. Who is just a Stallworth in the community who I can point to people who've been through and gone and gotten their services, both in the African-American and Latino community.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Colorado Coalition for the Homeless continues to transform people's lives all throughout District nine and the entire city. An Urban League has been transforming folk's lives. The wind program RTD since I've been in Denver for the last 20 years and even longer than that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so what we're evaluating is can an organization do the work that is called out in the scope of work in this contract? And I 100% say, yes, I'll be supporting this, you know, and also support. And I'll also support not only talk about a budget amendment, but there's, you know, the Crime Prevention Control Commission, which I'",
        "'speaker_0': 'sit on, which Councilman Lopez sits on, which Councilman Herndon sits on. We haven't been attending those. And that's actually where the work gets done. And if we want to increase the contract, that's where we increase the contract. And so we're as much to blame as anybody else.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so if we want to go back and tell stories of what's happened, we can. But what's before us today is this contract here. And if we want to have a larger conversation with those members on that commission about increasing this contract, let's do it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Because Lord knows, as Councilman Cashman said, there's more work that needs to be done and I will 100% support increase in this contract, doubling the size of this contract. My request to these three organizations. Southwest Denver, near northeast Denver and far northeast Denver.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Need you. Please do the outreach in those communities. That's where folks are going into reentry, right? That's where folks are going back into and even now into Aurora and other folks outside of Denver. And so I just would ask that your outreach, that you would really turn that up so that we can really, really serve our community'",
        "'speaker_0': '. Councilman Lopez, I see you back up.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes, thank you, Mr. President. I didn't know that was going to be brought up. That communication was sent to us by the mayor's office in terms of this, the CPS, the Crime Prevention Control Commission. It's not where the contract originates.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Those weren't the CPK folks that were in my meeting. Those were other folks that are higher up. In our agencies if this contract was going to be more and would have more juice. And it would. Let's not kid ourselves or sell stuff short.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You don't rob Peter to pay Paul and call it progress. You just don't. Progress is when you increase. You raise the bar, not move it from one bean to another. If we really wanted to see progress, we'd raise it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You know, the CPC does serve its role. It has. It continues to. It is exactly what we got because a lot of us didn't want a new jail because we knew if there was going to be a new jail, we'd have to fill the beds.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I. My critique is with this contract from before it even came to the P.C.C. There's decision making that happens. It's divisive. I don't like it. I don't like my community being played. That's plain and simple. I hope folks who were at the table thinking about this contract, unaware about what divisions it can create, how it would look'",
        "'speaker_7': 'in the in the public realm, how it would make normal folks who are doing like work, working together separate. That's the problem. I don't like it and I want folks to know I don't like it. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. President. And Council Scott Robinson with Community Planning and Development. This is a request to rezone 680 Sheridan Boulevard from PD number one to E Annex three properties located in Council District three in the Villa Park neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's at the northeast corner of Sheridan Boulevard and Sixth Avenue. It's at the west edge of the city. Lakewood is across Sheridan Boulevard to the west. Property is about six acres in size. It's currently a self-storage facility with mostly one story buildings a few two story buildings.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The applicant is requesting the rezoning to allow it to redevelop as a new modern mini storage facility. As I mentioned, it's currently zoned PD number one and PD was approved in 1977, limits the uses to mini storage and limits the development on there basically to what exists right now.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The proposed zoned district is E Annex three. That's urban edge neighborhood context. Mixed use three storey maximum height. Around the property. The zoning to the north is C Annex five, which is a mixed use. Five storey maximum height to the east and northeast is old code.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Residential and multi-unit zoning are two to the south and southeast. Across sixth avenue is single unit zoning and south on Sheraton Boulevard is old code commercial zoning. Across Sheridan Boulevard in Lakewood is a mix of light, industrial and mixed use zoning.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They're used to surrounding the property to the north and south, along in our commercial uses to the east. Our residential multi-unit north of Sixth Avenue and single unit south of Sixth Avenue, across shared in Lakewood, is a mix of office and light industrial uses.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You can see the storage facility, the main office building there in the center. The Sixth Avenue bridge up above the site there in the bottom right picture. And then some of the surrounding development in the other photos. This went to the planning board on January 17th, got a unanimous recommendation of approval from the board.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There was no public comment. We've not received any other public comment on this application. As you know, in order to prove a rezoning, the city must find that these five criteria have been met. The first criterion is consistency with adopted plans.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There are three plans that apply to this property, the first being Comprehensive Plan 2000. As described in the staff report, staff has found that the proposed rezoning is consistent with these four strategies from comp plan 2000, mostly relating to infill development and mixed use development.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The second plan is Blueprint Denver from 2000 to the concept of land use for this property is single family duplex, which calls for moderately dense areas, primarily residential, but with some small scale commercial uses. So the proposal is to go to Mxr three, which is mixed use zoning at seven acres.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This is a fairly large site, larger than we typically see with these small scale commercial uses. But when looking at the local park neighborhood as a whole, it doesn't have a lot of the sort of embedded commercial uses we see in a lot of other neighborhoods in Denver.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's really concentrated on the edges. So staff feels that site of this size going to a mixed use is appropriate in the single family duplex in the Villa Park neighborhood. It's also an area of stability blueprint. Denver calls for rezoning in area of stability to allow redevelopment of a consistent character.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Steph believes that the rezoning would do so, and then a certain boulevard is a mixed use arterial and which calls for mixed use at a greater intensity, which is consistent with the Annex three proposed zoning. And then the Sixth Avenue Surface Road is designated local, intended to provide that local access to the site.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The third plan is the Villa Park neighborhood plan from 1991. It calls for improving the neighborhood arterials, discouraging higher density development, but allowing development that is consistent and compatible with the neighborhood, supporting more commercial activities and increasing retail activity in the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The Annex three would allow development consistent with the character of the surrounding area and with the existing use on the property that it's already a commercial use and allow redevelopment to improve and enhance that commercial activity. Staff finds that the proposed rezoning is consistent with the adopted plans and the first criterion is met.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The second criterion is uniformity of district regulations. Staff finds that the proposed rezoning would result in a uniform application of the Annex three zone district. The third criterion is to further the public health, safety and general welfare of the city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Staff finds that the proposed rezoning would do so by implementing the city's adopted plans and facilitating the reinvestment in an existing business. The fourth criterion is justifying circumstances. Staff finds that there are changed conditions in the neighborhood since the previous zoning was put in place, which was 1977.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So quite a while ago. There's been significant changes in in the city and in the area and in the site and that with the restrictive PD that the changes justify a rezoning to facilitate facilitate redevelopment of the site.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The fifth criterion is consistency with neighborhood context, zone, district purpose and intent. Staff finds that the proposed rezoning would allow development consistent with the urban edge, neighborhood context and the purpose and intent of the annexed three zone district.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So with that, staff finds that all five criteria are met and recommends approval. I'll be happy to answer any questions.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'So I dearly love this city. And I, over a year ago was riding my bike around the neighborhood and went down Adams Street and saw this house. And I got off my bike and I looked and like, I have never seen this before and I've never seen it in Denver where there's a house that's on its original'",
        "'speaker_5': 'land and just kind of this. People have used the word pastoral and it is quite a marvel in how it is positioned and still there. And so I went to the next University Park Community Council meeting and said, Do you guys know about this?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This is really special. And then as everyone's described before me, the process went, but it is a very special place and our neighborhood has gone through profound transformation. So having this designated would be significant. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Feel good about this? Two reasons.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Number one, literally, this is an 89 year old woman who's.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Passing away and this is her dying wish. Let this house stay. Let this history say.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The second reason why is I think it sends the right message to this neighborhood at the right time regarding the importance of community and.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Preservation, especially in the University Park area houses. There's a lot of houses. Houses have people. People are a community and community needs things like this. Thank you. Thank you. Mr. Wester. Edward Doty.'",

I would like to thank you in advance for your perspective. Support to designate the only property in our neighborhood as a historic landmark.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Gormley is truly a neighborhood gem and deserving of such status. There is still much work to do to help us preserve more of our neighborhood and unique community.

Candidly, Condoleezza Rice, when she was at the You Morris, was also one of the founders of the Denver Botanic Gardens, played a pivotal role and in the plans to beautify Buchtel Boulevard on the north edge'",
        "'speaker_10': 'of University Park in such are the threads of history that we cherish in our neighborhood. Our community currently feels like it's under siege by real estate developers seeking to turn the neighborhood into just another suburb of look alike homes.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Among the first casualties are the beautiful tall trees cut down by the dozens, if not the hundreds, to make way for enlarged footprint foundations. As a banker, I understand the need for growth, but there can and should be more balance between development and preserving a great neighborhood such as University Park.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'My neighbors and I are here tonight to show our support for the formerly landmark designation and to let you know that we are organizing to do more to preserve the community we love. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'You for your consideration of making this a historic landmark. It is significant to the University Park neighborhood and to our community. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, thank you, Miss Myers. All right. We're done with our public comment and now into questions by members of council. Councilman Espinosa, I don't know if anybody can answer this, but hopefully you do, because my decision almost hinges on this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What is the name warmly mean? Where does it come from? What is that all about? I know it was on the house. I get that. But. Who stuck it up there and why.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think I can only partially so hopefully will still get your vote. Alberta Bloom Iliff, the first the wife of the first owner of the house, chose it all warmly. But we do not have a detailed explanation of why she chose it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. I dare everybody on council to Google the word armley. There is nothing out there and it's so oddball of a name that you can actually still buy. Wormley dot com. It's available. All right. Once you finish those on your comments.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thanks. All right. Any other questions for members of the council? All right. Public order for 215 is now closed. Councilman Cashman, start us off with comments, please.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'You know, I have not had the pleasure of meeting Miss Hill, but I feel like I have. And I especially like the stories. I don't know how many of my colleagues read the entire history, but apparently her husband, Robert, wasn't crazy about the house and she sold him on it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And it sounds like he fell in love with it equally along the way. It is a great history and I want to thank Rosemary Stafford for her ongoing efforts at guiding historic preservation in the University Park area. I believe it was an article that Rosemary wrote about a property that was lost that stimulated Miss Hill's attention once'",
        "'speaker_6': 'again to getting this property designated. I also loved the fact that this was not a a grand palace where huge social gatherings were the focus. This was a place where kids lived, where a family was raised. And I mean, virtually one short of a ball team, you know, one short of a baseball team through the years.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I just have wonderful images of what I'm sure were wonderful holidays and lots of good times on that property. Nine lots. Nine lots in one of the. Many lovely neighborhoods in Denver, but I would dare say was still one of the loveliest and most historic.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I hope read I hope you're listening because it was from her. Interview. I want to give it back in the same way. To ensure its preservation that this is a gift to to the community. Unlike many that that I've seen before and I want to extend my personal appreciation for that gift.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I mean, those who choose to to designate a historic property benefit from it in any number of ways, be it. The tax credits are available for renovations or maintenance and so on, but this will remain this large parcel in this gorgeous home will remain part of our community in perpetuity.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And, you know, we've I know my my friend, Councilman Flynn, in his attention to history, I think it would be awfully hard to find a place that better meets that criteria with the Isle of Family that, you know, I knew of their name attached to to do you and the School of Theology long before I became aware'",
        "'speaker_6': 'of the existence of this home. I'm just thrilled to death that this has come before council and. Oh, excuse me. I shall spend some time Googling grimly and hope to come with a few more hints of what it what it might mean.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But I will wholeheartedly support this and read. I hope you're having a good evening. I hope you're watching. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Cashman. Councilman Espinosa. Yeah. I'm thinking that it just goes down in Denver law and we may never know. And but now it's there, preserved for future generations to question in the same way and also never know the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I keep telling myself that maybe it was one of my losses in my district that maybe was the trigger. And maybe I'll still. I feel better about having endured that. I just want it. Since you said that Rita was watching Rita.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I just want to thank you. It's a wonderful house. You've been an incredible steward because we can tell it's self evident just looking at it. And so with its incredible history and your stewardship, it is here now for this act to make to make this act very easy.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Amazes me is we don't know the name of the architect. You know, it's such a beautiful, designed home. And, you know, you think of some prominent name would pop up immediately. Maybe you said name that's.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'On the house. We're trying to figure out maybe spelled backwards. Maybe that's his name.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Or something or something.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Unusual. Anyway, thank you for bringing this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Forward and.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Thanks, Councilman. New Councilman Cashman, back up.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. President. One one detail. I think one of the people I might have neglected to offer my thanks to the the Hill family, you know, the the the children. A piece of property like this comes up.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Apparently, there there were not. While not having been privy to intimate conversations sounds like the the the offspring wholeheartedly wholeheartedly support this as well. And it's a gift from them, hopefully for years to come. They'll be able to drive by the family home and remember many, many good times there as well.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We struggle with people with responsibility for pieces of property like this who chose nothing but pure profit over a sense of community responsibility and pride. So thanks again to the entire Hill family. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Anytime, Councilman Cashman. Anytime you want to talk about something in your district.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Can I go.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'On? Yes, please. We do have Councilman s. Okay. I typed it in wrong. Okay, great. In closing, I'll just say Ms.. Rita Hill, how you doing? Are you watching right now? We so glad that this is getting done.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'But I do believe that revitalization and preservation can coexist. And this is another splendid area of town that's changing. There's all kinds of stuff, but I love that there's preservation going on in this area as well. And so I'm wholeheartedly supportive.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And it's folks like you that make Denver great. So thank you for preserving your community. All right. And with that, Madam Secretary, Brokaw.'",
