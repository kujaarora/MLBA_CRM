Now when we're looking at the northeast downtown neighborhood plan, the subject properties are classified as a mixed zoning with a maximum height of eight stories'",
        "'speaker_8': ', which is consistent with this plan's recommendation. Um, uh. And then the plan further redefines height at this location by identifying it as part of the coarse field context area, where it is recommended that the building heights not be allowed to exceed the height of sports fields and to prevent use into the ballpark.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So as shown in this graphic provided by the applicant, a six foot tall person standing at the top of a 110 foot tall building across Lake Street would not be able to see Intercourse Field. So just wanted to show that illustration.'",

The downtown planner recommend that the ballpark sub a provide distinct ground floor retail and other active uses along the street edge and pedestrian improvements near 21st.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Madam President. Edson, could you help me out a little bit on the current zoning pdf? 329 I think it was. What? It's very unclear to me in the staff report what entitlements exist under that PD other than an Excel substation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'What are the other entitlements and how do they differ from the new zone district request?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So under the PD, commercial and residential uses are allowed and they do allow active uses but doesn't have great design standards like the CMC would. And in this instance they are at, I believe, the hours of to, but the maximum they can go up to here is five storeys.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That's why the applicant is trying to go up to eight. That would be consistent with the neighborhood plan as well. And so, um, those were some of the uses that would be allowed.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Make sure I understood correctly the FDR under the PD. Wow. That's the floor area ratio of.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Floor area.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Ratio. Unit development for those playing acronym bingo out there is 2 to 1. Did you say?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I am making sure right now 2.5 with the maximum of five stories.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Correct. Okay. So that would imply. Okay. I see. And then this would allow up to eight stories.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. This pod was in 1993.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's the same year the course field got under construction, if I recall.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Correctly. I am not sure.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That or slightly before that. Well, that's the year the Rockies came to town in 93. All right. Thank you. That helps put in a little context. Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilmember Flynn. Councilmember Hines.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Council President. Um, despite people the I was probably for the applicant. I am a strong proponent of the 50 to 80 trail. It's a 5.280 pedestrian and cyclist loop around the city center. I think it's a transformative project, and I think that it will significantly improve the public health, safety and welfare of our our city'",
        "'speaker_2': 'center. Um, I, I'm curious because this is along the route of the 50 to 80 trail. What your thoughts are for this development and its integration with the trail. Yes. We're extremely excited to potentially become another amenity along the trail.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We agree it's going to be an exciting asset to the city. This being a prominent corner will obviously require very thoughtful, pedestrian accessible design. We feel there's a real opportunity here with the Lake Street closure of Lake Street on 80 plus days a year to really create a vibrant pedestrian experience and create a landmark corner along the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'trail. I'm not sure if that answers your question or if there's something more specific for me to get into in terms of design work. We're still in the conceptual, conceptual stage, but this is absolutely top of mind for us due to the real asset.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sure. Well, thank you. I also think it's a huge asset. Um, so. And. Certainly understand why you might you might want a more specific question. The my thought with a 50 to 80 trail is, is just as you said, a place.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It is it is an opportunity to connect places like Coors Field or like the art museum or something, Gardens Park, where the kind of movement was centered in the, you know, a few decades ago. And and I see an amnesty capital and so many other locations that are that are along the trail.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I want to make sure that as as you say or as I said, public health, safety and welfare is preserved. And in the 81 game days. Outside of playoff games, I can understand that we want to make sure that that cyclists don't plow down pedestrians.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But in the other days I could see that. But it would definitely be beneficial to to make sure that the pedestrian and cyclist loop is preserved on the non-game days. And so I guess perhaps you mentioned it's in the conceptual phase.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I like what you're saying about having it be another destination along the trail. And I recognize that on game days, that MacGregor Square conversation that we had a few months ago brought that up as well. And on game days, I recognize that we don't want cyclists going, you know, in an unsafe fashion around pedestrians.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But in the non-game days, perhaps, have you considered the concept of of allowing cyclists to remain cyclists? And I'll mention one other thing, that the concept of the 50 to 80 trail and I believe this and want this to occur is for tourists speeds along the trail for for cyclists so the spandex riders that that bomb down'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Cherry Creek path great for them stick to the the jerky bike trail this is meant more as a as a community type type event. So with that context, perhaps you could tell a little bit about the your concepts.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Absolutely. I also agree that nobody was setting tires on on Blake Street during this timeframe. But, you know, our initial concept for the for the building is going to consist of two floors of commercial space at ground level, light and airy and open.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I mean, I think the idea of slowing traffic down, allowing cyclists, encouraging pedestrian traffic, I mean, that is that is what we're aiming for. I mean, we want this to be a destination where people don't just say, oh, that's a nice building and continue on, but this is a destination along the trail that we're going to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'make a stop at. And I think so. I think by design and use on those two ground floors, that's really going to be the draw. And I think that will lend itself to, you know, slowing cyclists and creating a real safe and friendly pedestrian and cyclist environment on the street.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So it's absolutely a priority for us. Okay, fair enough. I hope that you continue to to to follow the 50 to 80 trail as it goes through its discussion and implementation. And and if if I can be a resource, please let me know.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I like what your what you're suggesting. Thank you. Council President.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilmember Hines. Mr. Harrington, would you mind introducing yourself for the public record?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mike Harrington Fillmore Capital Partners.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Great. Thank you so much. Council pro tem to.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. I think my questions are probably for you and I'm just trying to understand I know that it was language in the neighborhood plan about not being able to see the field from surrounding buildings. Is that a legal requirement or is it a kind of a neighborhood preference based on that relationship with course field?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Is there something else behind that?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That's a great question. I don't think it's a legal requirement, but it is a recommendation from the plan specifically. In the northeast downtown neighborhood plan. It gives height recommendations, but then it has an awful context area limiting height no higher than the stands.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so it's a recommendation that's that's tied to height.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And this is different from the view plane that's down there, right?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Correct. And this site does not have a view plane.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It is not okay. Mm hmm. But there's a view playing near there. It doesn't. Yes, it doesn't. Okay. All right. I have a stadium in my district, so I'm just trying to make sure I understand what's going on.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. Thank you. Counsel pro tem tours and seeing no other questions from members of council. The public hearing is closed. Comments by members of Council on Council Bill 21, Dash 1455. Council Members State Abarca.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'All right.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I don't see anyone else in the queue. And so I will go ahead and finish up the comments. I do believe that this meets all of the rezoning criteria and we'll be supporting it tonight and asked my colleagues to do the same.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Okay, great. Just wanted to ask a question about the 1986 Highland Area plan. Is this part of the, uh, is that the West Area plan that it's happening right now? I'm just curious whether this is set to be updated sometime soon because I was eight when that plan was written.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Correct? Yes. It is part of the Near Northwest area plan. Okay. We are looking at the site.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. Great. Thank you. Really appreciate that. Thanks, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. Thank you. Councilmember Sawyer. Councilmember Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hey, Madam President. Edson, with the rezoning of these two parcels, that leaves one parcel. Let me get over to my map here. One parcel remaining at 3749 anchor just to the south of the other one that would still have the industrial, a zoning and sort of isolated.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There was are you aware was there any attempt to include that parcel? It seems kind of odd to have an industrial parcel the size of a small home lot six 200 square feet zoned industrial in an otherwise not industrial area.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That was probably better answered by the applicant. I believe they did try to reach out to that specific property owner, that applicant there. Maybe it can answer this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. It just leaving a remnant zoning in in an area that has changed and it just seemed I'm not saying that that's that they should have done that or or should not have done that. I just wondering if they had done that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So. Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right, great. We'll go ahead and get Michael McCartney moved in to the panelists. Okay. We've got Mr. Michael McCarty, one of the owners reps in the queue. And so, Mr. McCarty, did you hear Councilmember Flynn's question or would you like him to repose it?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I heard it. Can you hear me okay?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes, go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hi, Mike McCarty.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I live in Englewood, Colorado.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To answer your question.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, we did reach out to the neighbor to the south, and they they were not interested in combining or or rezoning at the time that we started this process.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you very much, Mr. Mack. And to the rest of the the rest of that block appears to be a two unit zoning. So I imagine we may see the other person at some future date. Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. Thank you, Councilmember Flynn. And seen no other questions from my colleagues on Council Bill 22, Dash 160. The public hearing is closed. Comments by members of Council on Council Bill 22, Dash 160. Council Member Sandoval.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Madam President. Although this parcel said and is called out the 41st and Fox station area plan, it is actually, as the crow flies, very easy to get to. But if you're walking in a pedestrian, absolutely challenging, which has left this parcel vacant and really, really hard to get to, it's a one way street.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So even as if you use the car wash, you are required to use the alley. And it's very complicated. I agree with this rezoning. I think that this is a good use of the zone district to have required commercial at the bottom and have co-living space.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'A lot of times, especially during the pandemic, people have changed the way that they live. Where you work below and but you want to live up top. The property owner met with the community and myself several different times, probably like three different times to talk about the esthetics of the building materials and other things that aren't necessarily'",
        "'speaker_6': 'taken into a rezoning application but are very important to my community. And with that, I would ask that my colleagues support this rezoning in Highland. And yes, thank you for calling that out, Councilwoman. So this is part of the neighborhood plan which will be coming forward in the next couple of years.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilmember Sandoval. And next up, we have Councilmember Flynn. Or was that a carryover from the last?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's a remnant.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. We got that remnant taken care of. I'll go ahead and chime in saying that this meets all of the rezoning criteria. I am happy to support it as well. Madam Secretary, roll call on Council Bill 22, Death 160.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'See the ball.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Sawyer, I.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Torres.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Black I. See tobacco.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Clark, I.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Herndon, I.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hines Cashman. All right. Kenny Ortega, I. Madam President, I.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Madam Secretary, close voting and announce the results.'",
        "'speaker_3': '13 Eyes.'",
        "'speaker_1': '13 Eyes Council Bill 20 2-1 60 has passed. Thank you again, edson and community member who testified on that bill. Our pre adjournment announcement on Monday, April 18th, 2022. Council will hold the required public hearing on Council Bill 20 2-168 changing the zoning classification for 4116 Decatur Street in Sunnyside and a required public hearing on Council Bill'"
