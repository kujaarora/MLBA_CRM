It is in close proximity to the University of Denver Station and just north of Interstate 25. The current zoning is ESU D x. It is surrounded primarily by that use, by that zoning and the land use is single unit residential and it's surrounded by'",

If the applicant elects to permit a basement unit in the future, then the code would not allow and one would not also permit a detached adu. So there is a lot of concern with people in the community that there was actually a unit in the basement'",

The comments of opposition were primarily related to the placement of the detached a new and detached adus following the detached 882 building form standards, as well as there is concerns around a third unit in the basement, which our records don't indicate that as'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well as there is owner occupancy, high parking and noise concerns. The Denver zoning code requires owners to live in and maintain the property. There are several review criteria that are analyzed for a rezoning. The first one is to see what the doctor plans.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And there are two plans that we are focusing on, which is comprehensive plan 2040 and Blueprint Denver, a land use and transportation plan 2019. The staff report specifies specific policies that are consistent within comprehensive plan 2040, and I will focus on Group and Denver in this presentation.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'I'm in favor of this rezoning tonight. We need more addus throughout the city and county of Denver. Despite what the opposition is saying, we still need these dwelling units. So I'm in full support of this rezoning to make good job Councilman Cash with.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Jesse. That concludes our speakers questions from members of Council on Council Bill 13. Council member, Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Madam President. Edson. Could you tell us how the city assured itself that there is not a second unit in the basement?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We looked through our solar permit permit records to see if there is any permit specifically for some sort of unit in that in the basement. And then not only that, but when they submit plans for a detached aide to you, they will also verify that when the zoning inspector will go out there as well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So currently there is no buy on records for a unit in the basement.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. So we didn't actually go and look at the basement.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Because I know just because it's not in the assessor's records doesn't necessarily mean that it doesn't. It could be an unpermitted second unit. The other question I have is the owner is listed as lioness, but in the assessor records, it's B.B. and L LLC.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I'm just curious if maybe the owner who is here that the individual could address that. Who actually owns this property?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Craig is the applicant and he can address this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Huh?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. We'll go ahead and get. Great promoted. All right, Greg, we have a question for you from Councilmember Flynn. And so wanted to give you an opportunity to respond or if you need him to restate his question.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'No, I heard I understand the question. Thank you so much. Thank you. I'm reformed being able because of my wife and I own the property together.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we just formed an LLC in order for both of us to own it together in that structure. That's all it is.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay, so who is Linus?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Linus. That's my wife's corporation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Oh, so that was a recent transfer. And is it on the application? So the change to BNL has been since you filed the application under Linus. Is that the.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Application for the permit? You mean?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm not sure which. The application for the rezoning. Yes. Well, actually, Bibiano was in there. It was right around the same time. So maybe you can catch up with it. But it is it is under BBN now, which is just 50% myself and my wife.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. And how long have you owned the property? Since before we started renovating it. We've owned it about a year. Okay. Are you related to Linda, by the way? I am. She's my cousin. Oh, hi. Nice to meet you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The why are the neighbors saying that you have a unit in your basement? No, we're not really sure. There's a back door that was.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Existing in the house when we bought it. There is no unit in the basement. There's just a bedroom and a bathroom and a big rec room.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'With no kitchen or anything like that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'No, there's nothing like.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That at all. Okay. Thank you. Edson. Maybe you could answer this in these two. The presentation, which was not. I could not find it in our granicus. I couldn't retain a copy of it. But one of your slides showed what I thought was the subject property, and it looked nothing at all like the one storey house that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'was in the staff report. What what what went on with that? It looked like a strange story, kind of a post-modern nightmare monstrosity. Showing and showing my my lack of taste, I guess.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. So when we create the staff report, we get a lot of times we get the images from Google Maps. And so they haven't been updated. And so. Or in order to have the presentation updated what? I asked the applicant to send me the most recent photo that they took.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So you can see the actual notice, like hearing notice in front of the photo I can set up. If everyone wants to see it again, I can put it up as well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. So the image that I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Pardon me isn't the image that was in the staff report then of the one story, brick looked like a maybe a forties ranch fifties rancher that's been scraped and replaced with this three story thingy.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Thank you. That's all I have. Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you. Councilmember Flynn, Councilmember Cashman.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Council President Edson, do you in one of the letters from the constituents, they speak about.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Property owner having sent out a letter stating that all the neighbors were in support. Do you do you have a letter like that in your file? I didn't see it in the packet that came online.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'No, I don't have a letter like that. What I included was a letter on the comments as an attachment in page 18, 19 and 23.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Right. That's the after the after CPD told the applicant that it was felt their outreach was insufficient. They sent out a second letter and I believe may have had communication with with some some neighbors. Is is that what.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You're referring to? Yeah. We always encourage them to do more public outreach.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I wonder, Greg, if you could speak. Did you send out a letter at one at some point in your communication indicating broad support from neighbors? When we first reverse this whole process has been a learning experience. What we first did is.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Contact all the immediate neighbors.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'To our left, right and.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In front of us. But what we did.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Not do was contact the neighbors behind us. And those are the neighbors that came forward and said, hey, we're not really thrilled about this because of the alley access and the traffic situations. It was after that that we canceled our meeting and decided we needed more community outreach.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Then we wrote a second letter with giving.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'People much more time to digest that and appear at the next meeting. And we canvased the.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Entire street of Josephine.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Between Iowa and Florida on both sides, and the complete west side of Columbine Street, which is the alley the backs up behind us.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Because we felt we had not really done a good job reaching out to all the neighbors. So to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Answer your question.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'In the beginning, we did reach out what we thought was substantial community outreach. But after hearing the feedback from the neighborhood, we decided it was and we postpone the meeting started again. Thank you. Greg Edson, what direction does CPD give neighbor give applicants about community outreach?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So in our application, we, we, we encourage them to submit a narrative explaining their community outreach. And then in the Pre-Application stage, we always encourage the applicants to reach out to as many neighbors, to talk to their council representative, to see how many neighbors they should be reaching out to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then we just leave it to the discretion of the applicants to reach out. But we always encourage you to try to reach within 200 feet. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Thank you. And just as a general question. You know, I hear a lot in these applications about the the roster of standard concerns is one especially.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Concerning.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'To two neighbors is that it might be.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Used for short term rental.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that is an option under under if an aid to you is approved. Correct.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It is correct.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And for any to have any aid, you approve the property owner, whether they have a relative living there or a short.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Term rental or a long term.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Rental, the property owner needs to reside on the premises in one of the structures. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Correct. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Is there.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is it legal.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Or is it possible or has it been done that a a property owner would make some sort of agreement? To limit how that property might be used. You know, a neighborhood agreement.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good neighbor agreement. I have not heard of one, but I believe it to be possible.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Is is there a city attorney on that? Could let me know whether or not it would be legal, say.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'For an applicant to make an agreement with their.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Neighbors that we won't use it for rental at all.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Or we won't use it for short term rental.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Is there a reason that wouldn't be legal?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Oh. Hearing, hearing person.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm looking for Nate Lucero. Up there he goes. We've got him moving over here for you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good deal.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I couldn't imagine they wouldn't be on the line.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. We've got made up there.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Nate.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Did you hear the question, sir? Yes, sir, I did. Thank you. I'm your assistant city attorney. So there. There. There's nothing that would prohibit two neighbors from entering into some sort of an agreement among themselves. It would be a private matter and not be involved in that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's what I thought. Just wanted to put.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That out there.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'In general, because I think that it's one area that concerns me just as a Denver resident and I in general have been supportive of that to use as an important addition to our housing stock. But I have no desire to have them use short term rentals.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That, to me is not what the short term rental program was developed.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'For, nor the.'",
        "'speaker_4': '80 new program. But that's kind of adjacent or tangential to this discussion. Nate, thank you for that. Let me see. What we're doing here. Oh, another thing I wanted to clarify that again, it's tangential, but since I have the owner here, Greg, you have a very large sort of spruce, blue spruce in your in your backyard that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'will have to come down, as I believe, if something is constructed in the back. Is that correct? We do have.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'A very large blue spruce of looking at it at the moment.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We are honestly torn about whether or not to tear it down or not because we do enjoy it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But it really depends on what a tree expert tells us in regards to even.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If we move the garage to the southwest corner.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Of the lot.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'With the effect where the TV affected. Sure. And have you have not had it evaluated as of yet?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'No, I have not. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'As again, in the torrent of conversation that I've seen fly by, I've seen comments this someone believe they heard it. They were told that it was not a healthy tree.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I drove by it again today and it sure looked like it was to me. But again.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's tangential to this discussion.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's all the questions I have. Council President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilperson Cashman. Up next, we have Councilmember Flynn, your backup in the questions, but I now see council member Sandoval. And so we're going to go ahead and go to Council Member Sandoval and then we'll come back to you, Councilmember Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I have a question.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'For the owner. Great. Hey, Greg, thanks for being here with us this evening. Do you currently live in the property or why do you have this property listed on? Hat Heights as an apartment rental.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We do not. We live in this property and we do not have anything was to dismantle it. I don't even know what hot spots is.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Just so you know, this rent, this property. Is listed as a rental property going for 1790 and insist it is four bedrooms and it's talking about 1850 a month with a security deposit. So you might want it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that sounds like a scam to me because we are not we're fully moved in and living here. So what's it what's sir. What. The name of the website is hot pots.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hot pad.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Peter.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And it's an apartment rental and it, and it's pretty expensive listing so someone has and there's even pictures of the inside of the house on the listing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. And it says it was just recently purchased within the last year and renovated on the listing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Interesting. You know, we're definitely not us, so I don't know what that is.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Sandoval. Councilmember Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Madam President. I was going to ask the same thing. I think the same people might be emailing both Councilman Sandoval and I at the same time. So I had one of its hot pads, I believe was was the website.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And in that listing, it also says that the owner is willing to rent only the upstairs if that were the case, if that were what the potential renter wanted. And perhaps that's why that's led folks to think that there are two units in the building.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So great. You said that this is not you didn't place that and you don't know anything about it. No, I did not. And, you know, to be quite.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Honest, I'm a little surprised, but also a little bit annoyed that somebody put it up there.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You know? Oh, yeah. Or whatever. I'd be alarmed, too, whatever reason for this hearing, because.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Now we are fully living in the house. We're not renting it to anybody. I trying to find it now to see what.'",

I'm Brandon Schaefer, senior city planner with CPD presenting an official map amendment application four 4410 North Fillmore Street. The request here is also for an 80 you going from SCADA to view as you see one the subject property is located in Council District nine in the various once used Cisco neighborhood.'",

It is a quarter acre and land area, currently a single unit residential structure.

Plan 2040 outlines a number of goals and strategies that are supported by this rezoning related to creating a greater mix of housing options. And offering a mix of housing types and promoting infill development for infrastructure and services are already in place.'",

These areas do have small multi-unit, residential and mixed use areas, but typically embedded in one and two unit residential areas, usually a regular block pattern and a high degree of walkability.'",

These are predominantly single and two unit uses where accessory dwelling units are appropriate and future street types.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Both East 44th Avenue and North Street are understated because when we have low residential guidance and we are looking to change the lot, size Blueprint says that it's typically only appropriate to allow for a smaller, lot sized in the existing zoned district if there is an established pattern.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And looking at the map on the screen, there is a clear pattern of flats that are between 50 507,000 square feet. As this is moving to the urban neighborhood context, the c lot size is the most appropriate using the lot size analysis for growth areas.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This is located in all other areas of the city where we expect 10% of jobs and 20% of housing growth by 2040. And then here again, you can see that additional land use policy and blueprint that encourages a to use in all residential areas and it's a city wide holistic approach is in place.'",

So allowing for an additional unit here would help correct and stabilize the neighborhood. Also, a city adopted plan serves as a justifying circumstance as this property was resound in 2010, as neighborhood plan was adopted in'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Hey, man. President Brandon, could you walk me through or walk all of us again through the reasoning for changing the context from urban edge to urban, it's just this little parcel. Why can it not be stay within the urban edge context and the zone for an aide to you?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm not quite understanding that because this is an urban context area and context means in relationship to its surroundings.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's a great question. And this is one of those, I guess, separate plants that we don't typically or something that we don't typically see a neighborhood plans. But this was a key recommendation from the 2015 plan as many of the residential areas already have a pattern in this area of detached sidewalks with tree lines and consistent alley'",
        "'speaker_1': 'access. So in changing the context, that would encourage the use of alleys and prohibit and limit new curb cuts and promote the construction of new detached sidewalks where possible. And then in some cases, I'm not this one. The change in the urban edge to urban eliminates the suburban house building form, so that would make sure that new'",
        "'speaker_1': 'development is complementary to the existing character of the neighborhood as well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. So is it fair to say then that the intent based on blueprint guidance is that at least this area, it's not obviously not all urban edge areas, but this area in particular. Eventually the context would be changed to urban.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's correct. And then the couple of rezonings that I think have come through in this neighborhood since the passing of the neighborhood plan in 2015 simply has been supportive of changing that neighborhood context. Update the actual character that's there today.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Thank you. That explains it. Oh. One other thing. Does it have any effect on the configuration of an ADU on the parcel? Does the change from urban edge to urban bring with it any differences in minimum lot size or setbacks?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Or are they relatively the same?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They are relatively the same between the urban, urban context and the detached accessory dwelling units form.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. All right. Thank you. Thanks, Brandon. Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you. Councilmember Flynn. Councilmember Sandoval.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Madam President. Thank you, Brandon. So, with the changing of the context, would they be able to split the zone and split this into two parcels and two single family homes and two detached accessory dwelling units?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That is correct. The minimum lot, say, is that there is going to is 5500 square feet. And I believe that the subject property is a little bit more than twice that. So that would be an option for them.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And is it correct in saying that because this is still excuse zoning, the property owner would have to live on site in order to if they wanted to do a short term rental for the accessory dwelling unit, detached or attached.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes, you're correct.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So one more question before Blueprint Denver. Before we updated Blueprint Denver in 2019, did we have guidance in the former Blueprint Denver 2002 to split zone lots like this through zoning rezonings because I don't remember them coming forward until we adopted the new newer blueprint.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Denver, 2018 Was that a recommendation or policy recommendation from the new blueprint?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Denver Can you clarify, is it more about is it splitting the lot because Omar Amendment or are you speaking to rezoning to a smaller what size is speaking?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, when you read zoned to a smaller that size, you're able to do a split. So because it's a it's a smaller minimum requirement, what I'm seeing is this is happening throughout council district nine, in Council District one, often times where you are having developers buy these bigger lots and then rezoning them to X to split the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'lots and to get two single family houses out of one former prior single family zone lot. So is that a recommendation out of the newer blueprint? Denver Because I don't remember that this happening prior to our update in 2018.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Does that make sense?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That makes sense now. Thank you for that. So what we do have in Denver and the updated version is we have guidance on what what the appropriate lot size is. And that's where we now conduct a lot, says analysis whenever an applicant is wanting to go to a smaller what size?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So in this case, the large size analysis shows us that there's generally a pattern of 6000 square foot lots, and this lot is about twice that size. So if rezoning to a smaller large size, we thought that to see what size is most appropriate to fit that pattern.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So in this case that it could result in two single unit residences with two detached aides.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you. Councilmember Sandoval. Councilmember. So you hear?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thinks when I'm president. Brandon, can you please just clarify for me then? So it's only in the ESU laws that the owner has to live on the property in order to build the ADA, is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's the restriction that's been placed on any avenue that's built in the city. Regardless of context. The property owner has either lived in the primary residence or in the accessory dwelling unit.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Okay. Great. Thanks for clarifying. I guess I'm a little bit confused because I thought that that was only for the sue zone lots or the zone lots. But you're the expert, so I will take your word for it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Or I can clarify. Are you speaking more to not the neighborhood context, but just the single unit aspect of the zone? All single unit districts that have any use have that restriction as well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Got it. Perfect. Thank you so much for clarifying. I really appreciate that.'",

But the process was disingenuous and information from the city was limited and controlled. This is very disappointing to me to be here again in front of all of you, to now ask why City Council is moving forward with voting on'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the Chapter 59 Bridge Amendment tonight. As you all know, a citizen led issue committee has been formed and is currently in process of securing signatures to place the group Living Amendment on in the hands of Denver voters on the November 21st ballot.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'During the past year. The most common questions that I and others in safe and sound Denver continuously heard was Why isn't the zoning amendment on the ballot? Why is City Council making this decision for us? Why hasn't City Council listened to our opposition letters when over 80% of the comments submitted consistently opposed the group Living Amendment?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Why isn't our city council listening? Will safe and sound? Denver Neighbors did listen. As you already know, those throughout the city involved in the grassroots endeavor over the past year filed a citizen led ballot initiative to offer all of Denver neighbors a voice and a choice.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Our filing was approved in March. Denver neighbors have been going into their communities to gather signatures, and Denver neighbors across the city are clicking on the website safe and sound. Denver dot com to learn more and to sign up to place their signature on the petition.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Let me go back to the the submitted comment letters. At the beginning of the February 8th meeting, Council released a statement that 619 comments were in favor of the group Living Amendment and that only 500 people were opposed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If you go over that is actually a you have some it's not open. No, this is related to the so there was actually final opposition was 4665 opposed. So Denver neighbors are angry and disappointed in the city council's vote in February.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we're disappointed that this is coming up to vote again. It seems premature to vote on this bridge amendment this evening. So I will leave you with my final question, which should be discussed tonight. Prior to the vote, when Denver neighbors place the group Living Amendment on the ballot and Denver voters decide in November 21 election to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'repeal the group Living Amendment. What will City Council do to unwind these approvals? Thank you for your time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Our next speaker up is Jesse Paris. And just a reminder, we ask that our speakers please speak to the bill that we have before us, which is the Chapter 59 Household Size Amendment. Go ahead, Jessie, please.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. Good evening. Member of the council. My name is just Tim Pearce and I'm represented for Black Star Accidents, Movement for Self-defense, Black Star Action Movie Self-defense, Positive Action Commitment, Social Change as well as the going to be party of Colorado in front line black nose.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I will be the next mayor of Denver in 2023 now. And with guards to this reasoning for this proposal tonight I'm in support of it. After hours of televised testimony from over a hundred and something, just two words that were mainly in favor of this proposal that Kennedy and others had drafted to alleviate our unhoused neighbor'",
        "'speaker_1': 'crisis or our lack of housing stock, affordable housing stock in the city and county of Denver. And to make it where, you know, people are being criminalized for trying to survive in the mile high income city where you have to have mile high income in order to survive or thrive and a fledgling, booming world class city and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'in the process, those that are not on those financial means. Cannot longer afford to live here. And that is a shame because I am a native. I grew up here. This city was affordable at one time, right after 2008, after the Democratic National Convention.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It is no longer. It's become the high income city. So I'm in full support of this, despite with everything an opposition was saying tonight, which is racism, white supremacy on full display for those watching at home. This is what this city needs.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have a housing crisis. We had the housing crisis before COVID. We still have a housing crisis during this. And as I've stated before, I've stayed at collective house such as these. On where it would be legal for the people to live in that dwelling, whereas prior to this rezoning change it was technically illegal.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I'm in support of this. I appreciate the council's, uh, due diligence and get in this past, despite what the opposition was saying. He did all the right things. So I will not be discouraged at all by any of the previous testimony.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This is what the city needs and going into 2023. I have to warn you, if you do not pass things like this, you will be swept out in 2023. Like you are sleeping on house neighbors each and every night.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So thank you, Carol, for please pass this to my.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Jesse. Our last speaker this evening is Samuel Hargraves. And you're going to have to unmute, Samuel. There you go. Yeah, you might have to. We can't really hear you. You might have to turn your volume up.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Maybe.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is that better?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mm hmm. Yeah. Go ahead, please.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Thank you. Let me do something here because my computer. Doesn't like to let me listen to sounds. All right, terrific. Can. Can you say something so I can make sure I hear you?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yep.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Great. All right. Thank you very much. Thanks for your patience. I'm Samuel Hargraves. I live in District nine, and I'm speaking to the so-called group Living Amendment, which this will now impose upon the remaining 20% of the city, which until this point had been sort of and kept from its terrible consequences.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thousands of Denver neighborhoods are disappointed that the GLA was passed in February. The trouble is that the City Council was conflating traditional residential housing with felony and rehab housing, which was and is disingenuous and misleading. I think that the City Council canceled its current contracts with the service riders before they had an alternative provider.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thus, the City Council created a crisis which they then used an excuse to ram the GLA down the throats of residents which are now imposing upon the final 20% of the city. The vast majority of these residents oppose this so-called group living arrangement.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'What city council should have done is severed the traditional residential rental portion from the felony rehab housing portion. They're completely different forms of housing. The people I've spoken to are fine with a small increase in residential rental occupied occupancy.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, the City Council falsely claimed that two was the maximum number of unrelated roommates allowed. It was actually three with an easily obtained waiver, not two, but three, which is 50% more than claimed. The other the other thing that's happened is that any opposition to this has been labeled racist, just as the prior commenter referenced.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'What white supremacy as as as a motive for opposing this. I object to that in the strongest possible terms. It's possible to object to this on the merits. An example is the response to any questions regarding parking. By this, increased occupancy was always reacted dismissively and deflected only racist or you care more about cars than people.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'More people and higher density equals more cars. You can try to racist your way out of this fact, but I have yet to hear a cogent answer to the simple, reasonable, practical question. I encourage everyone to go to safe and sound Denver and check out the ballot initiative we want to put on to rescind this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So-called Group Living Amendment. So that it can be implemented more, more, more practically and better and more and more appropriately sever the residential housing from the fell into rehab housing. They're completely different use.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Of care at the time we have allotted for your comments this evening. I appreciate our three speakers joining us. And that concludes our speakers questions from members of council. Councilmember Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Madam President. I wanted to ask Andrew if you can.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Add yourself and address the issue that Mr. Hargrove's just Hargraves just brought up about the fact that this particular proposal would create the opportunity for. What he referred to as felony rehab housing in residential neighborhoods and. So what was presented to us is just expanding.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'How many unrelated people can live in a single family structure, which is different from any of the other group living categories? So can you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Just clarify that?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Your Council want to take out? I don't want to put words in anyone's mouth, but I believe that the speaker was referring to that original set of group living amendments and and his concern that that but we addressed all the residential regulations in the zoning code as part of one project.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But just to clarify, these changes would only impact the household definition and regulations in areas under former Chapter 59 and the regulations for residential care uses, which are allowed in and in those zoned districts, would remain regulated by that former Chapter 59 code.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. I think that takes care of that. The question about parking and concerns about how. Parking meters saturated neighborhood would be addressed based on.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'How many people may be in a house under these new regulations. Can you just speak to what the tools are that the city has to address that problem and that challenge? I know that came up many times during the planning process.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'When all of the parties who were involved in looking at the various provisions to assure folks that parking would not become. Overwhelming and problematic.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah. So thanks for that comes from our take a few a few ways to respond to that. First, I would just highlight that the data that we've shown in previous meetings and I have it in my slide deck today, I didn't bring it up with any, but it would like to see if it is the table that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'shows or cities that we looked at and the number of unrelated adults that they permit to live together and the number of there are in the state, the average household size in those places. And if you recall from that table, the average household size in cities that have allowed, you know, five or more unrelated adults to live'",
        "'speaker_1': 'together for decades, the average household sizes stay the same, suggesting that while allowing people to make more flexible choices about who comprises of a household and to live with, you know, chosen family, there's there is no indication from any of these cities that we looked at in circle where we actually talk to colleagues there, that there's actually'",
        "'speaker_1': 'a change in the in the actual household size on average of those places or that there's a sudden change in the way people live together. I would also just highlight that the zoning code does have regulations about the front set back that can be used for parking.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I know that in a lot of neighborhoods, parking in yards is a is a concern and ah, the zoning code, it varies by context but it's generally around 30%, only 30% of a front set back may be surfaced for parking and our code enforcement, zoning and Neighborhood Inspection Services Division does enforce on those regulations frequently.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's a that's a fairly common complaint that the city receives, and we do enforce that. And then I would also note that the municipal code and the zoning code have regulations about, you know, inoperable vehicles, vehicles parked that are inoperable in the street, the parking of work vehicles, nerves in the street and that sort of thing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So there are many regulations that address who can park what, where essentially. And then ultimately, if a neighborhood feels like there is a parking concern, typically driven by a a local attraction of some sort of a public a place that's popular with tourists or something like that, they can actually petition the city to have a resident only'",
        "'speaker_1': 'parking that would only go allowed a certain number of parking permits per household in some neighborhoods. And there are a few of those that exist around Denver today and that certainly exist as an option for neighborhoods that feel like they have a real concern with parking.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I don't know if.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have Greg Morrow on tonight. I know we did during the first provisions, but.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I just wanted to ask a question about what.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Would be the proposed minimum number of people that would be housed in a community correctional facility to basically ensure economies of scale are being met because.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Of the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Not only zoning restrictions, but the state requirements that are associated with the operations of any of the corrections facilities in our city. Do you? Do you know the answer?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah, I know that. I can't. So Greg isn't here tonight because this this particular amendment doesn't impact residential care or community corrections. But I think I can respond generally that there is not a minimum number of people who can be in a community corrections facility, but and that the state and city standards and statutes do have minimum'",
        "'speaker_1': 'space requirements and that sort of thing that would effectively determine if if a community corrections facility was looking at a particular building, how many people could could be housed in that particular facility. And I would also also just highlight and reiterate that based on the revisions made during the LUDI process to the group living amendments adopted in'",
        "'speaker_1': 'February, that particular use types, those residential care facilities serving non parole individuals would not be allowed in single unit two unit and row house 2.5 zone districts, the lowest intensity residential districts.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you for that additional clarification. I have no other questions. The President. Thank you. All right. Thank you. Councilmember Ortega. Councilmember Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Madam President. Andrew. You can go back to a neutral corner of Brennan. Make Lucero for a tag team in your need. It seems to me and correct me if I'm wrong, but this is kind of arcane.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But to address some of the points that were made by our speakers at the public hearing this this ordinance does not amend Chapter 59 of the old zoning code. It amends Section 59, dash two of the current Denver Revised Municipal Code, which refers to how we will treat the former Chapter 59, which you can only read in'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the archives at this point. And all it says, it doesn't say that in the Chapter 59 neighborhoods that still exist, we will apply these rules. What it says is that the rules that are in the Denver zoning code that we adopted in February will apply as far as household definition will apply in these circumstances.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Is that is that basically what we're looking at here? What I'm getting at is if if this initiative for repeal were to pass in November, it doesn't this what we're doing tonight doesn't really change anything. It simply means that what was repealed would no longer apply.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Is that is that how that works?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Naval Officer, Assistant City Attorney. I think I understand your question. I certainly understand your reading of what is happening this evening with with the request to amend the Denver Revised Municipal Code of Chapter 59.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Exactly.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But former chapter 59. So so if there were to be a referendum either for the ordinance that's going forward tonight or the ordinance that was passed in February, it would have to follow the typical referendum process or the actions.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Right. And the bill tonight amends the DRC. It does not in men in Chapter 59 or former, chapter 59. That's correct. Right. So if something were to happen in November to overturn that, it would simply follow that what we're passing tonight would be of no force or effect anyway.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We don't have to tear out root and branch and things like that. It seems to me is that. Would you agree with that?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah. I agree that, you know, former chapter 59 as it exists is is not being amended. So anything that happens with this bill does not. Amend former chapter 59.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Right. It's what we're doing. If I can just say it in plain English. We're simply applying the household definition consistently and uniformly across our households, no matter what zone they are in 2010 Code or Former Chapter 59.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes, that's correct. And that that was the impetus behind this bill was was to treat. Right. Correct.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. That's all, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Flynn. Councilmember Kenny.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Council President I just wanted to go back to something that you talked about and just make sure that I understand it. We got a number of letters today from folks who live in condos who seem to be under the impression maybe that there were more limits on their units than they were.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I just wanted to clarify. If you lived in a condo or a apartment in former Chapter 59 zoning, was there any limit under the number of human beings who could live in that condo where apartment in chapter 59.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Not in the zoning code.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. So so it's not that there was a prior limit. So. And how is that? People will say what? There was no limit. Just explain what the law was.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So the current regulation in former Chapter 59 is the same as what was allowed under the Denver zoning code prior to the February 8th adoption of the group Living Amendments. And it would allow up to four unrelated adults, plus any number of related adult or of adults related to those four people in in attached housing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So condos, duplexes, apartments.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I just want to clarify for the many letters we got from those living in condos and apartments. The change before us today allows a change from four unrelated to five unrelated individuals. I'm going to get to part two, but part one is it simply changes from 4 to 5?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's a change of one person, correct?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But secondly, it actually reduces the ability to have related people along with those. So in some regards it is more restrictive than what the law is in those condos and apartments today.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That is correct.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Thank you for clarifying that. The other question we got is, you know, our H-2A or our you know, a condo building doesn't allow for certain configurations renting out a unit, etc.. Does anything in our change require an owner to allow individuals of a certain number to live in a unit?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It would not.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So it doesn't create a legal obligation for a building to allow that. It's still up to the individual owners whether they want to allow additional individuals of a certain number up to the zoning code in their in their unit.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes, that's correct.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Thanks for making sure I understood all that. I appreciate it. No more questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilmember Canete. Councilmember Black. Of your media. You're muted, councilwoman.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Council President Gilmore Thank you. Andrew Webb. And thank you, Councilwoman Canete, for bringing up those letters. I was actually going to address them because every single one of them came from one place in my district, a very large condo complex called Morningside.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There are hundreds and hundreds of units there, and I have responded to every single person who has written me an email. There are management put fliers all throughout their buildings. I think there are seven buildings that range from 4 to 7 stories, and they had a lot of misinformation on there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I have followed up with the management company to point out their errors and to point out that this proposal is, in fact, more restrictive than what is currently allowed. And one person wrote me back today and said, Thank you for the clarification.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Too bad the management company put out incorrect information anyway. They were all sent from the same place and they were all due to misinformation that was put throughout these buildings on fliers. And I did respond to every single person individually, so.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Just wanted to make sure everyone knew that things.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Black. All right. Seen no other hands raised for questions. The public hearing is closed. Comments by members of Council on Council Bill 213. All right. Council member Sawyer.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thanks, Madam President. I mentioned the night of the group Living hearing that while residents of my district said they would have preferred to keep it for unrelated adults per households, council worked really hard to find a compromise that five and I can respect where we landed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I advocated for an amendment that would have allowed council to vote on the definition of households separately on the night of the group living vote so that I could vote yes on this portion of the ordinance. Unfortunately, I wasn't successful in convincing my colleagues to do that, and my concerns with the residential care side were too numerous'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to be able to fully support the zoning changes as a whole. Again, I talked about this on the night of the vote and also mentioned my concerns that this created an unfair situation with the group Living Amendments because specifically because they didn't apply to the city as a whole.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So and that's why I voted against those the first time. So I just wanted to kind of walk through that and say that I'm supportive of this change to apply the new definition of household in those regulations to the entire city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Recognizing that my concerns with Group Living were on the residential care side, not the side. So I think this is a fair application of these changes and I will be voting yes. Me too. Thanks, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Sawyer. Councilmember Canete.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Council President. I wanted to just thank you personally for sponsoring this bill, and I appreciate Councilman Sawyer's use of the word fair. I think that's what this bill is about. It's about treating our city fairly and not treating one area differently than another.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I also want to thank the community planning and development and their team because, you know, originally I think there was a thought that this process could take a really long time. And the truth is, it's not new policy.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It is just simply making it work fairly in across areas of the city. I just want to reiterate what came out in my last question and answer section, which is that nothing requires any owner of any property to rent or sell or allow occupants beyond what they are comfortable with.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The owner of a property will continue to have that control and I think that that is really important. And, you know, we see that in most cities with these types of allowances. Very few households may make use of it, but for those who do, it may be very important for them.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Right. So even if it's not needed by everyone for those it is needed for or buy, it can be a very important tool to helping to prevent displacement from your neighborhood, from your care provider, to your network of support, whatever that might look like.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And as we discussed extensively, that's not always related by blood, that there are many forms of relationship and care that we take in our communities for each other. So I just want to thank you and the Community Planning and development team and happy to support this tonight.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Kenny. Up next, we have council member Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Madam President. I want to wholeheartedly agree with Councilwoman Sawyer's remarks, because I was in the same position on the night of the hearing, and we voted the same way that evening. I supported the household definitions portion of the larger bill and just had continuing problems with, as the councilwoman said earlier, some of the residential care'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that I thought could have been more intentional had it been broken out, I too would have voted yes on this particular portion of it. But more fundamentally tonight, what we're faced with doing, as Councilwoman Kenyatta said, is is making a uniform and fair across the city because most people, when they if they look on the apartment listings'",
        "'speaker_4': 'or the rental listings and they move here or there, they don't know. They're moving into a former Chapter 59 site. They don't they don't think to look at that a good lord go. Some of the things we've seen in real estate that people were unaware of that this might be one of the the most obscure to walk'",
        "'speaker_4': 'into. I have chapter 59 former chapter 59 areas that immediately abut 2010 zoning code areas. So the house across the street I could have if we were not to pass this, the house across the street would have a different set of regulations as far as household than the ones on the other side of the street.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that's not right. And so for that reason, as stated by Councilwoman Sawyer, I'm going to vote yes on this as well tonight.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you. Councilmember Flynn, Councilmember Hines.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But thank you. Council President. I also will be voting in favor of this tonight. I think that the discussion that the discussion about plumbing was has already happened. And this is a discussion about making sure that we provide that vote equitably throughout the city.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I know that I've certainly had folks in District ten who wanted me to vote no on Group 14. Obviously I voted yes, but many of those who wanted me to vote no support this because one of the concerns that I heard from from member are my neighbors in District ten is that this Chapter 59 means that that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the group living vote even more disproportionately affects District ten, because we have a lot of multi-family homes in in our district. So so I think that certainly those who support group voting support this vote tonight, those many of those who opposed group living also support this vote tonight because they want to make sure that it is a'",
        "'speaker_1': 'fact it affects the entire city and not just certain portions of the city. Thank you. Council president.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In Council Member Hines and not seen in any other hands raised. I'm going to go ahead and weigh in with my comments as well. And, you know, I was really happy to initiate this bill to make the Denver zoning codes recently updated definition of household effective citywide, and it would include the approximately 20% of the city still'",
        "'speaker_0': 'under former Chapter 59 or old code. And as we've talked about tonight, the proposed legislation will allow up to five adults to live together citywide. I'd like to sincerely thank Andrew Webb, Sarah Chau, Walter Laura Ultra Th, Sarah Brennan, Stacy Samina, Melissa Sotelo and Megan Allen's Melissa and Megan from my council office for all their help on'",
        "'speaker_0': 'this. This was something that we didn't have within our work plan for 2021. And we very quickly, with CPD's help and assistance after city council vote after City Council voted to adopt the group Living Amendments on February eight, we immediately turned around and embarked on a community process that included two citywide town halls one on March six'",
        "'speaker_0': ', the other on March 10th, including CPD office hours. And it's simple. We need more housing for people in Denver. We've missed the over one year mark of the pandemic, and we continue to see the alarming effects it's had on housing security or our residents.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And when you look at my council district, specifically in District ten, District 11 excuse me, I have over almost 34% of my council district and District 11 were under the old Code zero nine, including my own home in Montebello.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I was really happy to lead this effort so we could create more equity and fairness across the city in regard to the household size and allowing five related or unrelated adults to now live together across the entire city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so this is something that we heard from our constituents loud and clear, and we made it a priority in the in the interest of equity. And I'm really pleased that we're voting on this so early. We were concerned that it might be mid-summer before we were able to get this work done.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I respectfully and humbly asked my colleagues to support this amendment.
