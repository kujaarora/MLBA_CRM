    "A resolution approving a proposed License Agreement between the City and County of Denver and Lyft Bikes and Scooters, LLC for operation of a citywide Shared Mobility/Micromobility program for electric bikes and scooters. Approves a non-financial license agreement with Lyft Bikes and Scooters, LLC for five years to operate micromobility services and install associated infrastructure in the public right of way, citywide (202158012). The last regularly scheduled Council meeting within the 30-day review period is on 5-24-21. The Committee approved filing this item at its meeting on 4-27-21.": [
        "'speaker_6': 'I believe bankability micro-mobility could also be an equivalent missing middle for transportation. I believe the government has the responsibility to represent the people. After all, if we don't do it, who will? Private sector for profit companies have a mandate to maximize shareholder value.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And just as housing developers won't install affordable housing at 60% AMI unless we documented in our code transportation network companies or micromobility transportation network companies who have subsidiaries or child companies like Uber and Lyft will focus on shareholder value instead of the city's residents unless we document it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I remain concerned about leaving out people with disabilities. This is a group that we continue to overlook as a society. As technology disrupts industries like transportation and lodging. As examples, taxis make accommodations and taxis do not because ADA requires taxis to do so.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yet taxis didn't exist in Colorado until 2014. TMC uses in transportation network companies like Uber and Lyft hotels make accommodations, yet short term rentals do not. Same reason all legacy auto manufacturers allow adaptive controls in their cars, but installing even a third party party controller into a Tesla will void the manufacturer warranty.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Again, the common thread is that regulation was around to regulate the legacy companies but not the disruptor companies in these contracts were now considering. The companies shall endeavor to provide some accommodation for people with disabilities within one year of the contract signing to endeavor a means to try.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We're going to request these companies try to make their offering for everyone within a year. And if they don't try hard enough. No, we do. We have seen what happens in each of these industries when we aren't clear about requiring full and closet inclusivity.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We have also seen what happens when these exact shareholders, when we don't require inclusivity. Unlike the contracts with Lyft and Line, our contractors and City Council's contracts with our constituencies that we either do or do not. There is no trust.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I trust that if we extend the same lesson we learn from area and disruptive technology. I'm concerned about a five year contract. Entering into that contract for five years means we provide regulation for the technologies that exist today and not for tomorrow.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That means cyber detection technology. Whether that exists in practice today or not is optional. I'm concerned when industries don't provide provisions for people with disabilities because they don't have to do that. They want to include additional technology for five years.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Cycle also did not innovate for the entirety of their ten year existence. We're only getting new technology because of a new contract to touch on another conversation we're having today. We've wrestled in the past with conversations about having private, for profit companies perform critical services for our city.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Once we entered into that sort of relationship, we faced lots of resistance in our attempt to disengage from those relationships. Next, I want to quote the public filings for these shareholders. They specifically list more micromobility as a threat to their ride share revenue.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Quote, We face the risk that our network network of shared bikes and scooters could reduce the use of our ride sharing offering. Additionally, from time to time, we may reevaluate our offerings on our multimodal platform and decide to discontinue an offering for certain features.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I've mentioned in committee that I am concerned that we'll have a private equity some. We'll have a private entity come into Denver, cannibalize our public transit and then choose to exit, leaving Denver us worse off than we are today.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's already happened with OFO and bicycles. I'm concerned about these relationships these stakeholders have to the workers. It's been well covered in the press, so I won't elaborate now just on some purpose. Finally, I want to point out that these are new concerns.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'These have been brought up multiple times in committee. I've asked them again this weekend, just like our conversation of private prisons. Excuse me, just like our conversation about private prisons in 2019. And today we asked for changes to the contract, also like private prisons.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There were no changes to support full inclusion to ensure we have contracts short enough to require continued technology innovation, to support public transportation, to support workers, and to encourage more dialog in future contract negotiation negotiations. I will be a no thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Council President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Hines. Councilmember CdeBaca.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. I echo many.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's sure. I also.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So. Just say that I don't.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Support you not to intervene when there are market failures. And in this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Case, I feel that it's inappropriate that we're essentially.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Creating a market failure here.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'With this duopoly that we're promoting and engaging in every other provider as a. He has no issues with transparency in fees with their ride share operations. What's to say that any of the benefits that we're extracting from these companies doesn't end up getting carried by other people in there?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They're shifting. I don't. The value we're capturing, but have yet to see a profit analysis. And I think that's incredibly problematic if we're calling this a public good or if this is something that we have a desire to shift into providing as a government.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I absolutely do not support this this contractor, the other one tonight, and I hope my colleagues will vote no. I've heard many concerns that I feel have still not been addressed, especially with enforcement. And our constituents are not asking us to create a duopoly.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Our constituents are asking us what? Do about scooters, gating a lack of access for people who need it. And for the public right of way that we're essentially giving away without having any kind of expectation that these companies pay for their existence in this city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I encourage you all to vote no as well. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember CdeBaca. Councilmember Sandoval.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Madam President. I also agree with my two colleagues, Councilman Hines and Councilman CdeBaca. I have several issues with this contract. I have several issues with the length of the contract. We asked for a shorter contract in committee, and we're not offered one.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The city councilman talked council and was asked if there were public works or duty. Sorry, I would consider having a third vendor. They were told no and I don't agree with the fact that we are backing car share.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And that's what the main purpose of Lift is. It's a car share and I don't think we're going to get the outcomes that we're seeking. And I have a problem with the fact that we are putting the onus of right away enforcement on eight people in committee.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It wasn't even told to us if it were eight people or another group of people. But we are actually asking our city employees to put right away inspections on their their scooters, on their to do list. And I have been working in my office on this sign ordinance because there's signs all left in our right of way'",
        "'speaker_3': '. I get complaints all the time in my office about signs after construction project signs after special events. And we were told last week that Dotty did not have the type of enforcement to actually move forward with any type of compliance with signs.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we can't comply with signs in our right of way. How are we supposed to comply with scooters in our right of way? And I made that very clear to Dotty, where my council aide made it very clear to daddy that we don't understand how we are supposed to be able to monitor all these scooters, yet we'",
        "'speaker_3': 'can't even monitor any of our signs. So I asked my colleagues to vote this down, and we can work with Dotty to come back with a better contract that will serve the people and bring the residents of the city and county of Denver.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Sandoval. Councilmember Sawyer.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thanks, Madam President. Just wanted to weigh in on these as well. The bottom line for me here is whether the contracts are going to lead to better outcomes for our residents. We know Scooter's work to reduce vehicle miles traveled and we have the data that proves it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There's a lot of concerns about these contracts to my colleagues have made some really good points on why they should potentially be voted down and sent back to the drawing board. But the question I think is, is that going to bring better outcomes for our people?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Scooters are here to stay. So whether it's two companies, three companies or ten companies operating in Denver, they will be operating in our city. And that means that these scooters will continue to litter our streets and block our sidewalk, access and inconvenience our residents unless we do something about it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Trying to regulate those issues with ten companies operating here hasn't worked, which means something needs to change. And if Daddy has the bandwidth to manage this issue better for our community with less operators, then I think that will probably lead to better outcomes for our residents.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I am hesitant, but I am willing to support this tonight. Thanks, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Council Member Sawyer. Council Pro Tem Torres.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Madam President. I will also be a reluctant.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No on both contracts this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Evening. While I do want to see the city region in, I think what is probably a difficult to manage environment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'With as many providers.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'As we have. I think we've got to move. Some swung the pendulum too far.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In the other direction and perhaps.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Made us poorly adaptable to changes as we've seen in.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'San Antonio.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Both companies withdraw at the last minute.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'When it's when it ceases to be.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Profitable to them. And I would like to see.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Daddy's adaptability be.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Covered by different types of scooter providers rather than.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Two that are that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Operate very similarly to each other. Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Council Pro-Tem Torres. Council member Clark.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Madam President. And thanks to all of the folks who have weighed in on this and all the folks who did hard work in committee on this. And thanks to Dottie for what has been a long road in a quickly evolving and changing landscape when it comes to Micromobility.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'At the end of the day, is this perfect? Probably not. If we could see into the future and see how this industry is going to evolve. Would we maybe make some some different choices? I don't know. It's it's a quickly evolving place.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I think that we, you know, learned with Cycle, which was a very different model, that that we were subsidizing that every year. And at a at a stiffer clip, we just kept upping how much we were paying for.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we weren't getting, you know, the latest technology. We weren't getting, you know, the the dockless we weren't getting in other parts of town. The more we subsidize, the fewer stations and the fewer bikes that we had. And it's time, you know, for us to really move forward into this space as it is today.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think the DOT has put a lot of work into that. You know, I would have loved to sit in and seeing all of the proposals that came back with the RFP. But that's that's Dottie's job. And if this does not go well, then Dottie is on the hook for the choices that they've made around this'",
        "'speaker_1': '. I think that they've done it with the right intentions, and I think they've done it, you know, given a complicated landscape, the best that they can. And this will get us back up and running with a solid plan for bikes and for scooters in our city.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And those are key to providing real options to people, getting people out of single occupancy vehicles. And so I think that the time has come for us to move forward with this. I will be a yes tonight in hopes that everything that Dottie saw in all of those proposals and believes will happen is the future that we'",
        "'speaker_1': 'will see and not some of the fears and concerns that we have. But I think that, you know, we have to get out there and try something. And I trust that the folks who are working on this put in that time to get us to the best place that we can be in.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I'm excited for us to to make this investment in Micro-Mobility for Denver, and I'll be supporting it today. Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilmember Clark. Councilmember Kinney.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Council President I. I find the arguments from colleagues on both sides of this compelling. And I would like to ask the Department of Transportation and Infrastructure referred to as Dottie. But I've gotten asked not to break down our acronyms, so I'm going to do that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'May I ask them a couple of questions? Council President. Sure. I'll ask until they're promoted because I know they can't hear during that process.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. I appreciate that. I was going to ask you to give us a moment. All right. We've got Nick Williams up in the queue. And Stephen, so go ahead, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Council president. So, Nick, or a member of your team, you know that my colleagues have raised a number of concerns that maybe I'd like to narrow it down to two. One, can you please describe what would happen if one of these players exited the scene or if both did within short order?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'What would be triggered? What would the steps be? What would the implications be?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah. So thank you for the question. If one of the players I know would continue operating with the other operator, I think in a situation where both would agree, we would reconsider, you know, how we can bring.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This mobility choice back to the market.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So if one exited, the other would have a monopoly. There would not be triggered going back to the table with other bidders or a new RFP for a second provider.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so when we certainly if that were to happen. Yeah, exactly. You know, our our stance on having two stands. And so and that was part of the reason we wanted to was to at least kind of smooth out some sort of transition.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But yeah, we would want to remain with two.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. So and then I, you know, this is a process question, but, you know, be patient with it. You know, we've had situations before where the administration is surprised by the feedback of counsel on a contract, you know, early in this council's tenure.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And, you know, we, you know, we shot something down and had to kind of, you know, clean up the damage after the fact. In this case, you did get lots of notice with lots of concerns from council members and did not make any changes decided to push forward.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'd like you to explain why, you know, whether you just vote counted to seven and stopped there or whether or not could we not have gotten to a little bit of a better outcome on some of the concerns that were raised by what I'm counting is now a large number of council members.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We'll see if it's a majority or not, but certainly it's a it's a sizable number of council members. So talk to me about why we're here with with so little response to the feedback.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah. So, you know, we provided the contracts and licenses and reached out for comment, not receiving really specific, you know, comments and changes to the to the contracts. We just, you know, provided clarifications, additional information to.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Contextualize that and, you know, felt that the the licenses, rather, would remain as is with those clarifications.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think, you know, the license is certainly worth the process or the product of some pretty intense negotiations with two separate operators. Over the course of many months on there, we felt that we really had got the best deal for the city, you know, felt that we really, truly tried to attempt to address and answer concerns'",
        "'speaker_1': 'as we could, valid concerns. I think Councilman Clark is a very fast changing industry and really tried to address it the best we could, but at this point have felt that we still have probably the best deal we could and then to go back would really reopen those negotiations and push us back probably an acceptable amount of'",
        "'speaker_1': 'time on that, while still remaining confident with the product that we presented to you all.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right. Before we open a can of worms and have a bunch of colleagues chime in, let me try to voice voice some representation of what I think they might say, which is respectfully, it sounds like pretty specific feedback to me to say that the term is too long and that, you know, that's feels pretty specific to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'me. The request for a greater investment in advertising and prevention, a request for a higher standard for who is responsible for monitoring those feel pretty specific to me. And so I get the idea that you felt like you struck the best balance you did.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But to have the contract come to this point with such a divided council, you know, I always say that there is legal authority for the administration in the charter to plow forward without even any input while you're negotiating contracts.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But that's not a requirement. You have the right to do it, but it's not an obligation. You certainly have the choice to collect feedback while you're negotiating and to take that feedback, frankly, to the negotiating table and use it to get better outcomes that might have clear support.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I just I want to ask about that. I have to because I don't know if this passes tonight, you know, seven, six or eight five. I don't know that we're in the best position as a city. And I just in not hearing that that iterative process on such a high profile public facing contract happened.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And it concerns me that, you know, your legal your legal minimum is not always the best practice for the people of Denver. And I just am struggling with this one here.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Understood. You know, I think part of the issue is that if we start to kind of pull on one string, we've talked about this before, that, you know, to to to address the question about the the the term if we reduce that term, that decreases the value for for the operators and would then start to decrease the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'value of the free and then subsidized rights that we were able to achieve through negotiation. And kind of with that, you know, of course, as we're making these kind of value balances, we felt that the the risk the potential risk of a longer term, you know, the fact that the city's not directly financially invested in this and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the reduced taking us off of our our goal of these free and subsidized rates in a really substantial amount, really kind of reconciling, you know, as we build out our our public micromobility or bicycle scooter infrastructure on there, that really those free rides are kind of that key to unlock a lot of a lot more additional people'",
        "'speaker_1': 'to get involved in. And so really that specific one feeling like that that to pull that string of the five year term would then start to collapse the value that we were receiving in free and subsidized rides and kind of based on that, that value proposition stayed with the five years so that we could maintain the value'",
        "'speaker_1': 'of those free rides. I think I may just jump.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'In to add that there's a lot of precedent for, you know, a.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Bike share contract similar to the.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'One we have being, you know, closer to ten years in a lot of cities because it provides that timeline for the private companies to invest in infrastructure and know that there'll be a return. We've seen in the shorter term permits, there was no investment in infrastructure.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so finding that balance between what makes sense for a license and contract in addition to how much we can extract from these operators, is definitely, you know, as you pointed out, a tricky Mickey Neal described there.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's a great point. Yeah, this. Sorry. Go ahead, Councilman.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah, my last question. So I asked on the one side, what happens if a provider exits? Let me just ask the reverse question. Just give me very briefly, what if this was a mistake? If we you know, what are some of the triggers by which we as a city can say we are not getting what we thought'",
        "'speaker_2': 'we were here? And so our ability to take action, particularly regarding issues that have been raised about, you know, blocking of sidewalks like chronic failure to really educate riders. If the education program, which is skinny, it's it's exists.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I did ask for it. I asked for it in cash and you did it, but it's skinny. So if it's if it's not working, frankly, what do we what's what what do we have to get out of this?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah. So, you know, these are revocable if they're in breach of the contract.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I think, you know, we anticipate to hold them to everything that has been inked.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In the licenses and.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Can always, you know, tell them that we don't want to do business anymore if they're not living up to those promises. You know, as we've discussed with the committee and some of the folks on this call right now, there are some, you know, penalties that ramp up to the tune of hundreds of thousands of dollars if they'",
        "'speaker_6': 'are not meeting the goals laid out in the license. So those are just a few of the quick triggers. Hopefully that answer your question.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah, ultimately, just like so this is a license, not a contract, but similarly to contracts, if they're in breach of that, we can revoke and that's that would be the expectation that if they're not meeting expectations, we move on.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilmember Canete.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilmember Herndon and our president. I will be brief because there are several other topics we're excited to talk about tonight. Here's the issue. The status quo is failing district date. And you can go back to any bicycles, micro-mobility scooter or electric bikes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's a conversation I had. There are portions of the city where you see little to none. All the providers that we have little to none.

This bill has been in committee I think three times now, and it's been very contentious and a matter of a matter of dispute and conflict among the parties that we're being audited and the auditor and it's hard for us to sit here and know exactly what what all the facts have been.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And and maybe with this amendment, that's not entirely necessary for us to sort out. It's just not comfortable to legislate in the dark. And so what this amendment does, it carves out a very narrow point. That proprietary and confidential information that is that is subject to an audit is entirely open to the auditor when there's a performance'",
        "'speaker_5': 'audit or a financial audit or an internal audit, entirely open to the auditor, but not the entity being audited does not have to make a physical or a digital copy and release it out the door. It would be inspected, subject to inspection onsite as audits have traditionally been done for decades.'",

That does not touch the auditor's other responsibilities for which he's seeking subpoena power and for rent, which I'm in full agreement, and that is enforcement of prevailing wage for our workers under city contract and for enforcement of minimum wage, which we have just acted on in the last several'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Council President I recognize that these conversations are iterative, and our goal of trying to discuss everything at committee is not always realistic or possible. But this is an example where this is a very big change. I would disagree with the characterization of it as narrow.'",

And so to suddenly change the entire access practice based on a concern about subpoena power, where there's a narrow dispute to me without will give examples of the questions I would have needed to investigate to get'",
        "'speaker_2': 'comfortable with this. And I'm not going to ask anyone to answer these questions tonight because I'm just going to vote no on the amendment. But examples of what we didn't explore is what are the general accounting principles in regard to analyzing information offsite?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'What are the cost implications of sending a multidisciplinary team on site versus being able to examine materials? What are the practices over decades that have been successful in terms of offsite materials and have not caused disputes and would now be terminated or prohibited under this amendment?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I feel concerned that businesses have basically taken a conversation about subpoenas and used it to try to blunt the auditing tool. And frankly, these are the contracts where the auditing tool is most important to us because we as council members don't get to see those kinds of books.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We can see most of the city's books directly, but we don't get to see the books of contractors that do involve proprietary information. And it is only the auditor who's kind of the eyes of the people on that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We can't serve that role. So to blunt that tool without analysis of what states and cities that have similar powers are doing with regard to this, to me really potentially undermines our ability to protect the taxpayers interests and make sure that those audits are done well.'",

I appreciate that this amendment keeps the preservation of the powers on the wage issues.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'We'll get it right there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening, Council members. Kirsten Crawford Legislative Council. If there is proposed language.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It it could happen logistically.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Solutions, but I do think.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's possible. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And this is a bill we can use our council member discretion to push a week. Right? This is right. Okay. Just make it sure. So may I ask Councilmember, will you repeat your proposal? It's something like if a subpoenas actually issued, then then onsite can be requested.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Council President. Thank you, Councilman Hinds, for your question. This is my. This is not the amendment as drafted is not a guardrail on the subpoena power. I just want to be really clear. Councilman Flynn, I shared my feedback with him.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It is a limit for all audits forever. For all time can only be conducted on site period. That's what this is I want. This is not a guardrail on the subpoena. It prohibits the auditor ever taking anything considered confidential or proprietary off site ever again.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's why I consider this is a humongous change in practice. My suggestion to Councilman Flynn, which he did respectfully he considered and did not take, was that the language could be limited to say, you know, the process in the bill right now is about a subpoena where item has been requested and the party does not provide it'",
        "'speaker_2': '. Then there is a notice and then if there's failure to comply, the subpoena shall issue. You could write in the guardrail at that point where and the court shall decide whether or not. So if the Court is deciding whether or not you get the information, the court can also decide whether or not a guardrail is needed for'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the review of the materials. That was my suggestion. It is a guardrail on the subpoena where there is a dispute. That is a guardrail on the subpoena. That is not how it was drafted. So, you know, and I will just say, this is first reading tonight, correct?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. I believe no is the second. Okay. Sorry. Thank you. Losing track. Well, all right. So so anyway. Yes, thank you. I hope that answers your question.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. Councilmember Teenage boy. So I'll defer. I think Councilmember Flynn maybe has some comments, maybe he can address. Councilmember, can you just concern and I would like to understand that the difference here, so I'll just leave it at that for now.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. Council President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilmember Hines. Councilmember Flynn, do you would you like to clarify? Because I know that there were some statements made and then Councilmember Herndon will get you right in. But I don't want to get too far out without some clarification from Councilmember Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Sure. Thank you, Madam President. I thank you. Councilwoman Nature, respectfully, I disagree with with your characterization of the amendment does not mean that never again with the auditor be able to take information off site, even if the third party deems it confidential or proprietary.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It just says the third party may, in lieu of ask that it be done on site. They can still provide copies if they choose if there is an agreement of some sort. Subpoena power, as the auditor said in committee, would probably be used extremely sparingly in the first place.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'If there is a dispute over whether the the auditor wants that information and doesn't believe it's confidential or proprietary, then they can always go to court under this new subpoena power that we're establishing. That's always been true. So the auditor will have the ability to get information off site if there is an agreement or if he takes'",
        "'speaker_5': 'the subpoena to court and the judge says, no, this is not I don't deem this confidential. You can have this you can have it offsite. So that's why I'm saying that it is very narrow. So I do disagree with your characterization.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I understand your I understand your argument for. But I just disagree. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you. Councilmember Flynn, Councilmember Herndon.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Amen. President. This bill bothers me for four reasons I'm not going to get into now. I think that my colleagues did a really good job of having these conversations at committee, but I appreciate an attempt to try to remedy some of the concerns that multiple members of council have, though not the perfect amendment.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I hear what Councilman King need to say. I don't I don't believe that will occur. And this is something that I would like to I will be voting yes, but my colleagues will as well. And then we can see whether the bill as as amended hopefully get the vote, because I still have issues with it, but I'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Vote?'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Most gentrified city in the nation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Displacing vulnerable communities such as my bipoc community, also low.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Income white families.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And what is proven fact is how much dark.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Money has been.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Poured into campaigns of current politicians.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'By many developers.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Taxes of the homes and.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'And to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'A wide range of liberties. And so I ask you to think about.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The following one. It gives them legally enforceable.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Agreement with a guarantee for the developer site plan.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That does not include community.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening. I'm Donna Reed. 4830 West Colorado Avenue. I'm a representative of the South Mali, at which you're in Park Reno. And I served as my neighborhood's backup on the official Loretta Hyde steering committee. My neighborhood unanimously voted.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To approve the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Small area plan, which was developed in partnership with the community. And we continue to support this project. I can't stress enough how much from then to now this developer.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Has involved the community in the visionary process.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's undeniable that Loreto Heights is a gem, truly a landmark. So when the sale of the 72 acres happened, it created a sense of doubt.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In the community about what would happen next.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'At the time of the sale, the current zoning allowed for heights of up to 15 storeys. So the creation of an inclusive steering.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Committee meant that any future development would have to wait.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'At the very least a whole year until the community could properly weigh in. So that was encouraging news to the community because the pause button was pushed by none other than the developer. In sure. West Side.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Listen to the community.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This is actually a down zone in each. R.A. appointed their own representatives to serve their neighborhoods on the committee and in the end to gather. We came up with an area plan reflective of that year long, inclusive process.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Communication flowed freely to and from West Side, Denver staff and the community. And the process has always been one in which the developer actively created a space for the community to weigh in. I've never been allowed to wander freely onto Loretto Heights because it's been private property.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So for the first time ever, Loreto Heights will be accessible to all people to enjoy. Remember, the vision of the steering committee has always been for Loreto Heights to have a village like feel keeping the wonderful spirit of Loreto in its character.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We asked for affordable housing with a mix of other price points available. Very little traffic pedestrian and cyclist friendly. A sustainable place that fosters inclusion. This is what the community wants and is asking for. So when the developer announced that Pan Croatia Hall would be used for affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I thought, he gets it. It was a perfect first move based on the community driven process. My neighborhood association is in full support of this proposed.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Rezoning.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And personally I support it too. Please approve the rezoning request. So the legacy of Loreto Heights can continue to impact the Southwest Denver community in positive ways. Loreto Heights needs new life and love breathed back into this wonderful place.'",

And so I just, you know, I feel like a lot of these zoning decisions that I sit through and that we here are just not centering the people who have been silenced for the longest. And so I also I don't think that depending on Arnaud's as the only voice in the city for public input is is'",
        "'speaker_2': 'appropriate. We know that Arnaud's do not represent equitably the neighborhoods. They just don't. So I just would ask that you keep that in mind because there are so many decisions that are being made that are not centering people, people of color, low income people.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They're not centering people who, you know, with disabilities. So I just it's I, I just am kind of really frustrated by some of the conversations that are not asking the right people the right questions. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Tess. Our next speaker is Brad Billingsley.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I may. Can you hear me?'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Brad Billingsley. 3940. East Wesley Avenue. Denver. 802. No. And I just want to speak to the character of West Side Development as a leader in our community. I volunteer with Food for Thought, which is a local nonprofit that addresses childhood food insecurity.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We were started by local businessman Bob Bell nine years ago when he realized that many kids in Denver public schools don't have food to eat from Friday, hot lunch told the following Monday morning free breakfast at school. So back then, we started attacking stacks of foods for every student in two schools.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Today we're delivering to 75 schools that are 90% or better free and reduced lunch. Many of those are in the immediate area around Loretto Heights, including College View, August Gottesman and Schmitt Elementaries. Our organization approached West Side Development two years ago with a need to create a new food packing site.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We asked if we could use one of the buildings that's on Loreto Heights once they learned about what we do. They said not only yes and gave us a place to operate out of, but they also volunteered to pack food and even went so far as to buy us a forklift to help move the many pallets of'",

They've just demonstrated their commitment to our community quietly and consistently.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They're an organization built of character that is walking the walk to help give Loreto Heights a future we can all be proud of. We've reviewed what they're asking for in terms of this development. Encourage City Council to approve the rezoning of this campus.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Our next speaker this evening is Mark. With kids. With kids. I'm sorry, Mark. I'm going to let you go ahead and pronounce your last name. Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Madam President, members of the City Council. My name is Mark White Cabbage. I am speaking as the applicant tonight. Here I am, a principal at West Side Investment Partners. Our address is 4100 East Mississippi Avenue, Glendale 80246.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Our goal, Loreto Heights, was to seek to understand together as a community. As a community, we have come together to plan the next great chapter at Loretta Heights. We are very proud as to what we have accomplished together.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Preservation, housing of all types. Open spaces. Community spaces, significant down zoning at the community's request. Just to name a few. We look forward to the next great chapter of Loretta Heights. And we thank you. And I'm happy to answer any questions, which I'll begin with one tonight that I heard earlier to address the comments from historic Denver'",
        "'speaker_1': '. We are fully committed to finalizing the negotiations of the easement, as we have promised before. For further clarity, the property is protected. Even without the easement, it's not to say that we won't have a final easement, but the property is protected with an existing covenant for non demolition.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There is very specific language with the side of the Peabody and there's also the development agreement. We do understand the importance of the conservation easement that the community and historic Denver has asked for and we are a stone's throw away from having that finalized.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Again, I appreciate your time tonight, and I am here to answer any questions that you may have. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Major concern. Number one, we're concerned about the effects of gentrification and displacement in our community. We recommend that the city and all developers take into consideration anti displacement measures such as rent subsidies, a city living wage, utilizing a localized area, median income and increased services and supports.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'For example, we recognize that the aim for affordable housing units is set at the regional rate of $100,000 for a family of four.

Number two, a community services center should be formally included on the campus to provide essential community services to the local area related and unrelated to the redevelopment.'",

City Council should require that adequate time be provided for community review of the finalized traffic impact study before the rezoning request is approved.

        "'speaker_6': 'And I don't know why, but the city continues never, ever provide that or when they do it, very limited. Um, I think that we need that just in general. There needs to be a little bit more transparency. Well, I mean, a lot more transparency of what the city's got going on when it comes to stuff like this'",

We solicit your cooperation in expressing this concern to the Department of Transportation and Infrastructure, the mayor's office, and other appropriate city agencies.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Also, we solicit cooperation from city and elected officials that there be an ongoing monitoring of traffic volumes in our neighborhood in appropriate intervals.

My name is John Joseph Nieman, 2786 South Wall Street, Denver, Colorado. 802 36 A good agreement is one that stands the test of time, and I would say that we now need to add that a good agreement stands the test of code with the the community involvement and outreach efforts for this property.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It was comprehensive for the Lauretta Heights small area plan creation. It contained input from neighbors that belong to many affected neighborhoods around the campus. It contained experts and novice members of our community. This down zoning is good for the community and for meeting the intention of the small area plan.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Meeting I. The meetings I attended showed that this developer is taking an inclusive and deliberate approach that will maximize the value of the Denver gains through its redevelopment. There are many community and government inputs that have made this plan better, and we should never let the desire of perfection be the enemy of doing good.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But this plan is good and the process that has been undertaken is great. I think having multiple zoning districts allows for residential representation in your district is the correct district for the reasons mentioned earlier. Also, the New Plains will be maintained for the surrounding area with the New Zone District six, which I think is important.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It also allows for the save our theater effort for the Avon Boundaries Center to continue and still be possible, which is a really big positive for the neighborhood and for the development. Yeah, certainly this plan is not perfect.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Certainly we're going to see more stipulations maybe around energy efficiency and improvements of water quality, but that may just be a discussion for another time that we can address some of the more detailed pieces.

        "'speaker_1': 'my family safe from COVID over the last year. And so maybe we all haven't been as active as we used to be, but the training, the effort that we invested in, we wanted to see that small area plan come to fruition.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think I like so many of my other neighbors, we just know that this needs proper zoning and a well-structured funding source to make the Loretta Heights vision a reality like active, alive and functional space that many neighbors can enjoy.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So with that, I would just like to say the possibilities for this redevelopment become possible because of this down zoning. So I ask for your support.'",

Thank you very much for giving us the opportunity. As background and a common owner of many of the investments for as an architect and as a redevelopment specialist over the last 40 years.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm also speaking tonight as a member and a manager of Pan Christian Hall Partners. We have a very large team that is currently redeveloping and increasing the hall, Eldorado Heights, creating 74 affordable homes for families. And I'd like to stress that the families are going to have large, unique units.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Over 50% of our homes. There will be two, three and four bedroom apartments. Not the small ones, not the efficiencies in the one bedroom that you often see. And it will offer deep affordability. 30% Army units, 60%, as well as 80%.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have a very large team. PNC Bank is our major investor grant vantage of proximity. Green is our other development partner, and the city's affordable housing office host has generously provided some essential funding to our efforts. I'd like to say a little bit how we got involved in the red lights.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That was over four years ago when City Councilwoman Sally Daigle from Sheridan inviting invited us to attend a community meeting. And we've listened to the community speak for four years now, and it's been really rewarding to hear how much the liberal arts community cares about this campus and these historic buildings and open spaces.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'd also like to echo Jean Myers's comments about Councilman Flynn. He truly cares. And Denver is very fortunate to have his effort at the advocacy level that he's taken to make this campus a beautiful place. I'm really impressed by the land plan.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I've been involved in design review committees at Lowry Air Force Base and other places in Denver, and the design standards that have been promoted and will be adhered to and the needs of our community are outstanding. These buildings change buildings.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I've seen some preliminary versions and they're good. It's going to be very nicely done. Buildings. They complement our pancreas, the hall and some of the other buildings there, maintaining the views, integrating walkable communities and pedestrian oriented features. All of that is really commendable.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's really about our heights. So my conclusion from all of this is that city council, I really hope that you support and vote yes tonight of heights is going to be a better place for Denver. If you approve this rezoning.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Jim. Our next speaker is Preston Dial. And see. I had seen Preston in the queue here. I don't know if we. Lost Preston, but we'll go ahead and try to get Preston back up into the queue.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'mayor of Denver in 2023. I am torn with this redevelopment to me because on one side they try to make it seem like it's a good thing. And then the people from the community, the Bipoc community, are saying it's a bad thing and I have to go with the Bipoc community on this because.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This is not affordable. Houses affordable. Uh, I heard something recently. About 30%. And my. How many units out of all the underserved calls for the site are going to actually be at 30%? At my level, even that's not affordable.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We need housing that is below the 30% across the board. But every last one of these rezonings, every last one of these proposals, there needs.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To be.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Uh, 0 to 30%. Ami across the board, whenever you're talking about any kind of redevelopment with housing involved, if you're really trying to solve this housing crisis that we've had for at least the past four years and. This notion that the community was outreach was sufficient enough.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That is not good enough there. At previous hearings on the same campus, about the same campus. We heard numerous speakers say that they were not outreach to. So somebody is not telling the truth here. And I'm not going to sit up here and try to decipher who is not or not, who is or who isn't.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The fact remains that 30% A-minus was needed, not 60%. Am I not 80% am I? So I would like the ACC or West Side Development to answer the question how many units are actually going to be at 30%?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Am I. If this traffic study has been completely done and. Will be implemented. And also who is benefiting? It's definitely not benefiting black. Indigenous people of color. It is a it is benefiting whites, affluent developers and residents. And the people that I spoke with tonight, majority of which have been white, affluent, rich developers and the residents of'",
        "'speaker_6': 'this area that have been in favor of this have no idea of the unintended consequences that are going to come from this rezoning. So we asked you. To not pass this tonight. If you pass it tonight, the voters will know that developers run this town and have the money and the time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have a lot of this evening. Our last speaker this evening is Preston Dial.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hi. Good evening, counsel. Thank you for having me. I know it's been a long night, so I'll try to be brief. My name is Preston Down, the vice president of acquisitions for Getty Realty, a commercial real estate development company based in Nashville, Tennessee.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'First, I'm here in favor as a potential partner of the applicant. I represent my client, which is an organic grocer. Two quick things. One, I wanted to commend the applicant and the representatives of the community for preserving the soul of this pretty sweet place.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To hear the non-speaking, to hear excuse me, the sister speak and other people, it was it's very special to potentially be a part of this. You know, the big thing that several people have said is the due diligence at West Side is done.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm here to echo that. There's two things that continued to show up and research. One was affordable housing. We've heard a lot about that. The other was basically this community is a food desert. This place is starving for fresh food, for options with food, for affordable food, for food.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm here and hopes to partner with West Side in my client, which is a national organic grocer, and hopes to solve that. Here at the Loretta Heights Development. I'll stay on for any questions. Thank you guys very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Preston. That concludes our speakers questions from members of Council on Council Bill three, three, three and or 352. Oh, right. Okay. There we go. I knew I needed to pause for a second. Council member can each.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I believe your muted.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sorry. Changing headphones. Thank you. So what an amazing testimony, but just a couple questions. So the first one is for either host or Jean Myers. So if we can promote them. And then the other one is for Nate Lucero or whoever the attorney is representing community planning and development.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So let me switch views so I can.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'See who's joined. All right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We've got Gene up here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Gene, I might have missed this. Sorry I had to eat a bite of food. We have a long night. I am so excited about the 99 year affordability as I read it. It applies to the for sale as well, is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I am again so excited. Now, in my experience, I've only ever seen 99 year affordability on for sale in the land trust environment. So I just wanted to check on, you know, the the agreement doesn't have a lot of details on the mechanism, but I understand that when you get to that long of affordability in a'",
        "'speaker_2': 'land trust, sometimes the land trust has to kind of infuse a little cash to keep the price within the ambit limits while still allowing families to build a little equity over time. Not like spikes in equity like we have in this boom market right now, but just a little bit of equity over time for them to build'",
        "'speaker_2': 'wealth. I just wondered how you'd be handling that issue in this particular approach. You know, if you're going to be continuing to anyway, I don't think you have a land trust here. So why don't you figure out correct credibility with without one?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, as you know, we have quite a bit of experience with the deed.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Restriction and we understand when it fails and when it succeeds. And we've had a good track record in our work in Central Park, not having lost a single unit, just by properly setting it up with the title company at the beginning.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so that's our plan.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Got it. Can I just clarify, you don't have any concern about the price going up a little bit for owners and then going to high to stay within the 80% of EMI. At the point of transfer, you don't feel like you need any infusion of capital or reset to to do that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Like 50, 70 years out.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, it's our our plan to just use the the city's structure for ensuring that 80% of EMI remains in place.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Got it. I mean, follow up offline on the mechanism. That's great. I just wanted to ask then for Brad. We had a few speakers and I know I cannot see the slide deck through the the website, the council portal.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I don't know if the public has it either. But can you just refresh folks on the 30% of AMA and 60% of AMA housing that this is not this site is not just 80% of I said it, 80% of your median income.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Can you just clarify those other affordability levels real quick?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. Happy to thank you, Councilwoman Kinney, so that the agreement with the West Side and all of their developer partners is to incorporate 12% of all the units that created on site as affordable writ large. Among that level, 14 for sale units will be built at a minimum, half of them affordable at 80%, and my half of'",
        "'speaker_1': 'them are affordable 100% my on the rental side. 40% of the units that are that to create on the rental side have to be affordable at or below 60% of AMI and 30% of those need to be restricted at or below 30% of a BMI.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I say these things in percentages because it's based on the total number of units that are that are to be developed. The last number that I'm familiar with is roughly 1200 across all various phases, which results in 144 total affordable units.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All of those percentages applied thereunder. And in addition to that, I should add that Mr. Harvey made this point within his development. But a good chunk of the units have to be two plus bedroom units as well, trying to make sure that we have larger format, family style units to support lower income families as well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thanks. And just one quick follow up question on that. Can you describe a little bit sometimes people like to focus just on that percentage of units that are affordable. Can you just describe, in your opinion, how there might be tradeoffs between some of the things you just described and the overall percentage?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm not sure I understand the question, but I think what you're asking is, is why maybe the overall affordability percentage of the total product product development isn't higher, and that is because it does take more resources, more capital, more support and or, you know, more difficult economic modeling to ensure that larger units are created.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That lower AMI 30 even 6% units are difficult to to create and given the costs and sort of development materials, labor, etc., land. And so, you know, it takes a little bit off of the overall economics of the entire property to be able to to accommodate identified needs lower down at my spectrum into larger units.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is that what you were asking?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah. So there are some tradeoffs here. If you might have had 20% of units at 80% of I and said we have 12% of units, including much lower median incomes for families and more family units. So those are all negotiated.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Great. My last question for the attorney, who might that be?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have Nate Lucero. He's in the queue here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Oh, I'm sorry. Okay. I just couldn't see him on my screen. We're on two screens now. Sorry. Thank you. So neat. I wanted to ask about the requirement to have a historic easement not being completed while council tonight is voting on the development agreement.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And can you just walk us through what it means to execute the city's agreement and to make sure that we're in compliance with that piece that requires that to be that that separate agreement. It sounds like they're working on, but they're not quite done with yet.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I just want to want to clarify that, please.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you so much. Nate Lucero, assistant city attorney.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening, members of council. So I'm just going to try to walk you through the process practically how it would work. So if council approves the bill this evening. Then the bill will need to be or the it will need to be published.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that usually occurs on Friday. So once once that's taken care of, then the city attorney's office will begin circulating the contract for signatures. And that process usually takes about two weeks. And it's not until all city's signatures are obtained that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That the contract is considered fully executed.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So it's possible that the easement gets negotiated.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And signed between now and then. I guess.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Alternatively, there's a possibility where the city could sort of slow their signature process to kind of see if the easement catches up or if the development agreement is fully executed and there is no easement then. We could consider using the.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Default provisions that are provided in the development agreement.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you for that answer. And I don't know if this is for you or for this CPD staffer who who negotiated the agreement. But I just want to hear from from from someone who represents the city that if the if this party does not execute any easement for this property, that either we will not be signing or'",
        "'speaker_2': 'we will be proceeding to some other mechanism that there is no scenario by which they don't get this easement and everything else goes forward. This is the last bite at the apple for the council, but the city has another bite at the apple.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we won't take it unless we we have an executed easement. I want that assurance, please.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Jason Morrison That is correct. I also have a Jenni button work available if you have any more specific questions about what went into that agreement.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm going to do council pencil and manage. The easement provision was placed in there for two reasons one, to provide short term protection to the Administrative Administration Building and Chapel prior to its designation as a Denver landmark, but also because easements are held in perpetuity.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So they actually provide a higher level of protection for a building or buildings, even more so than local designation, which could unlikely but could in the future actually be changed to remove protections from a building. So we do find that this is a very important provision to keep within the day, and we would support it being included'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and being a part of this signing process moving forward. Got it. Thank you very much. Thanks. Council president.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilmember Canete. Up next, we have council member Sandoval.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Council President. I just have one question for you, Jason. How how did you come to the conclusion that you wanted to based the PWDS on C MP, the campus and district growth?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I appreciate the question, Councilman Sandoval. You know, again, a lot of this came out of the small area plan process. And, you know, we we learned very often that while this this campus is a very special place, it no longer serve that purpose.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so that being said, a nod to kind of the past of the previous life of the campus and the community wanted to see over swaths of open space, remained on plazas, trails integrated within the redevelopment, and staff felt that the most appropriate bases of district would to be to keep the zone district available and then of'",
        "'speaker_6': 'course add some modifications to allow for different uses to allow for the protections of those buildings as well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. And then in the period 24 and 25, they have different citing security or setbacks. And you know me, I'm totally looking at your first me application. So they have different side interior setbacks like the PD, I think 25 have 0 to 10 and then the other one has zero.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So is that based on the topography and what you wanted to see an open space with with the book plane inside? That's how you got from the based on district to the waivers or down to the PD.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And just to clarify you, I just pulled up my staff bracelet to make sure I was answering your question correctly. You're speaking to the G 25, is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So they can be pretty G 24 has a ten side that intercept that great and then PD G 25 had 0 to 5. So they're not the same. So PD 24 and PD 25 have different side interiors effects and different type of other just building coverages and maxes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I just was wondering how those comparison charts were created, where they created based on the topography and what this small area plan recommended, recommended. Does that make sense?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It does, yes. So thank you for clarifying. So it actually has less to do with the topography and more of kind of the feel of the area. So it's a big reason why we have superfoods in the campus study, which is pretty g 24 is is more of kind of a, you know, a quieter kind of, you'",
        "'speaker_6': 'know, residential office type type setting and versus kind of some of those mixed use contexts as well. And so a lot of it is a nod to kind of the the open space in the area. And so the residential pretty does have setbacks and the campus community doesn't have setbacks.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So it is kind of that that, you know, distinguishing between the two kind of like fields of the buildings and kind of what the community wanted to see between the two different areas of the site.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Perfect. Thank you, Jason. Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Sandoval. All right. Giving it one last moment here. The public hearing is closed. Comments by members of Council on Council Bill 333. Council Member Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Oh, thank you. Thank you, Madam President. You're hearing Sister Mary. Inspired me to open my remarks with something very special about this place. This is a this has been a four year journey that's been instrumental in reconnecting the Sisters of Loreto and the Loreto community to this sacred and beautiful space.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They have been gone from the ownership and management of Loreto Heights for 30 years since they completed To Regis. And then. And we won't go into the. The Jesuits will leave the Jesuits at peace for right now, sister.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They flipped it over to the Tokyo group out of Japan who ran taking on Loreto Heights for the next 30 years. And so the Loreto, the sisters and the Loreto community really have been connected to the campus for those 30 years and is one of the most beautiful things about this process, Madam President, is the fact that'",
        "'speaker_5': 'they are now once again an integral part of the fabric of the hides. And maybe if I could just take one moment. To disclose a thing that something that just happened today and that is the Department of Transportation and Infrastructure has agreed with our request, my request from my office and the Sisters of Loreto to use legacy'",
        "'speaker_5': 'naming for some of the streets that are contained entirely within the campus, rather than having them have the names from the surrounding grid to which they don't connect anywhere. We were faced. Some of you I mentioned, as we were faced with a prospect, if we followed the grid that this former Catholic Women's College would have a street'",
        "'speaker_5': 'on it named Hooker Street. And I have to commend Sister Mary now for a nun. She's got a great sense of humor. She said, well, if we have to have a hooker street, there has to be a street intersecting with that that's named Mary Magdalene.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I just thought that was a great, great sense of humor, sister. I really appreciate the broad support that the community, including the City of Sheridan, by the way, which closely borders a campus, as well as ten southwest Denver registered neighborhood organizations that supported the area plan two years ago and the seven that support this rezoning, one'",
        "'speaker_5': 'of them conditionally. I want to mention especially for thanks Jason Morrison, who was the lead is from Tennessee and the rest of the CBD team Jenny Button board from the Landmarking Office, Deirdre Oates who came in to to work with us tirelessly on this as well as the department heads, primarily Laura Andretti.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Julia's likely from Dottie, a lawyer from CBD, Abbey Hanes from Parks and Recreation. But I think the most thanks goes to our neighborhood leaders and our residents who spent years hard hours hammering out a consensus that, while not unanimous, represents the top of the curve of what the community wants.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thanks, Sister Mary. Now in particular for constant involvement due to Annie Levinsky in historic Denver, our neighborhood leaders. Claire Harris. Tara Durham. Cassandra Cornelius. Donna Rip. Aaron Manhart. Richard Sides. Adriana Pena. Tony Hernandez. Others I'm sure to mystify.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'If I kept going, I'd leave some folks out. Madam President and colleagues, this site in Southwest Denver presents us in our part of town with our first major development project in a quarter century, which was Grant Ranch back in the nineties.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This presents us with the opportunity to create the kind of community we've always said we want diverse in population, in household incomes, to combat displacement and gentrification, income, restricted, affordable rental and for sale housing, including, as you heard, required deep affordability levels of 60% and below and 30% and below multi bedroom units because we are a family'",
        "'speaker_5': 'neighborhood. Dedication of another parcel for and another affordable housing a project still to be selected. In fact, this is the approach to combating displacement and gentrification. Embedding permanently affordable income restricted units, along with Gene Myers could have mentioned this.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I didn't hear it specifically, but some of the market affordable units that thrive will be building will be priced for less than some of the housing, some of the homes already in the existing neighborhood. So double the amount of open space that's required a revitalizing and landmarking the iconic destroyed buildings.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This is the first housing development to use the Denver Green Code preservation of key view corridors both to and from the site height restriction so no building can ever overwhelm that beautiful Frank Ed Brooke, 1890 Loreto Academy Building Preservation of the cemetery where 62 sisters of Loreto have their eternal rest.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Vision zero centered street design that places people first. One of the key things to know and that I quickly learned about this, Madam President, college going into a complicated and diverse issues such as the future of Loreto Heights, is that with so many competing needs and desires coming to the table, no one.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Going gets everything they want, but everyone gets something they need. It takes a lot of intentional work for every party to this site to see how their specialized interests necessarily intersect with impact and affect the other parties. And that takes a lot of coordination and really, really wasn't easy.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This was the first LDR project to go to. That first project, you go through that LDR process. My Southwest Denver community has been engaged with the potential changes on this campus since shortly after the college announced more than four years ago that it was closing and selling the land.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Excuse me. Now, I hope that's not my time running out. That's my clock at the top of the hour. Long before the current owner came on the scene, we learned a lot about what the stakeholder group said, what they want to see, but more importantly, what they don't want to happen on the campus, too.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'With the first potential buyer that came along was a California developer who didn't even want a zoning change at all. He simply wanted to use the existing campus environments to match out nothing but residential. The campus zoning would have allowed around 10 million square feet of residential in buildings, up to 12 storeys, covering up to 60% of'",
        "'speaker_5': 'the land area compared to what could have been. What we have in front of us now is a clear path to a truly diverse, multi income, multi housing form, integrated community parks and trails, historic landmark preservation, deeply affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It will give my district four new landmark buildings. Joining are Fort Logan Field Officers quarters as the only Denver landmark buildings in Denver, west of the Platte and south of Sixth Avenue, a situation that I hope we work intentionally to change as time goes on.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This hasn't been easy. The community came together to create the first specific neighborhood small area plan. In my district, the participation by the public was extraordinary 1300 unique participants over nearly a year. My office led the effort to increase that involvement by repeating the initial public meeting as a monolingual Spanish meeting that attracted 30 participants canvasing the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Latinos serving businesses in the neighborhood. My office paid to leaflet for each meeting hanging fliers on one at one one occasion up to 13,000 doors throughout the Southwest and into Sheridan. The overwhelming community consensus was for a unique place that preserves the feel of the campus far into the future.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'As a result, many of the housing units, if you look at the residential building, many of those units face onto parts, puzzles or open spaces, as you might find on a campus in the summer of 2019, West Side allowed one of the RINO's to hold their summer picnic in the quadrangle.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And as my wife and I sat there watching 5060 people enjoying a barbecue, the Denver Municipal Band Brass Quintet playing some yard games and whatnot. That place really came alive again, and if you had been there, you would have seen what the future of this special place can be when you come to Loreto Heights to live, work'",

So building on the great respect for the past, to fulfill the spirit of Loreto that Mother Pan Croatia bought brought to this hilltop in 1918 88.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Council President My kudos to this community for coming together to hear a lot of testimony where there's consensus. Sometimes it's about convincing the council, but other times you can tell it's about the community celebrating what they've been through.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I understand it might not have been universal, but it was overwhelming. And I just want to acknowledge that and just say how great it was. My kudos to Councilman Flynn and to the staff. My staff probably Kyle monitored much of this process and participated for my office and helped us answer questions and respond.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But, you know, several times these negotiations over this development agreement hit impasse. And I just have to say to the developer team for stretching and staying at the table and hearing the feedback and understanding how important this was.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Even the price differences between when you started negotiating this agreement and what they are today is is notable. And I hopefully, hopefully you feel like you understand more why the city pushed as hard as it did and to the city for continuing to advocate for for these high standards.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Anyway, there were a lot of staff involved in this, and you are typically the unsung heroes. But I just want to sing you for a minute. This this was kind of a test project for a lot of things.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we had a developer who hadn't done a ton of affordable housing before. And so, you know, bringing in the partners and etc.. So, so to everybody who had to stretch to get to these outcomes. Thank you. And just stay at the table and get that easement done.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right. Thanks. The historic easement, that is. All right. Thank you, everyone, and congratulations. Thank you. I'll be supporting it tonight.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'So I have heard all about this development from my mom and the numerous sisters that she works with, and they have had nothing but positive feedback to say. And as I was thinking about what to say, I'll just take a quote from their website.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It says The Laredo community works for justice and peace as it educates the young and or serves the poor and marginalized, protects the environment and advocates for the voiceless. And I really believe that that's what this project does, and I really believe that's what this process has been.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so thank you. Councilman Flynn, I know we don't have very many rezonings in District two, so congratulations on a job well done. And me, I love the zoning code. And as I was digging through the application and seeing all of the details, it was really beautiful to see.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You have requirements that I would like to see in school and tourist in my district where you don't have open, can you have back doors to the open space? You have front doors to the open space and you have requirements in these parties that I'll probably piece apart and make into another overlay in my council district.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So thank you for leading that because that's exciting. That's something I've been saying I would like to do along the Platte River, along Lakewood Gulch and all the gotchas. So thank you for being a leader in that and creating new tools.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'What the heck? And it was. You were doing your thing, Councilman Flynn. You were big and down into the details. You were making sure that this would be a development, that you could be proud of, that the community could be proud of.'",

I can tell the work initially out of a repurposed Parker and Studebaker showroom and building that they converted into a studio in 1969, and they built a purpose built communication center, which is what we see here at the corner sphere.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so that was part of a nationwide trend that you were seeing throughout the country and new stations building purpose built studios. And this particular one serves as a physical representation of the television industry's explosive growth here in Denver and a representation of what was happening nationwide.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The property is also significant for its direct and substantial association with a recognized person with influence on society. Cube Terry was the president and GM of Kiehl's. He was initially a part owner of Kiehl's radio and then helped it transition from radio to television.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The Rocky Mountain News said that he was so impressive in his pursuit of the FCC licenses that he was characterized as Mr. Denver, and it was largely due to his strenuous efforts. The county was granted a license to broadcast television.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The station. He oversaw the station from 1953 when it first began televising a through 1974 when he retired. During that time, he oversaw the transition to the new building and he was instrumental in a variety of different. Ways for the television industry.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'He worked not only as president of KLC, but also was promoted to the Western region. While his time working as filming it was limited to only a few years in duration of the association is important factor in determining significance.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The original warehouse was converted was converted to the TV station is no longer standing. So this makes this building the best remaining structure associated with the influential work of Hugh Terry and his productive life at KLC. The building is also significant as it embodies the distinctive physical characteristics of an architectural style, and that would be the brutalist'",
        "'speaker_3': 'style, which is actually French for concrete that is raw or unfinished. It came into the usage in the 1950s and it celebrated raw materials. The shape that this decorations and presented honest architectural expressions, which basically means that its structural and mechanical components were often open to view.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Architectural historian and clinical marathon man said that there were three things that really defined brutalist style memorability as an image clear exhibition of structure and valuation of materials as found. Here in this building, you can see more multiple areas of brutalist style.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So brutalist style typically has monumental steel exposed concrete structure, a cantilevered mass or a monumental first floor, geometric forms and windows that are insets or slits in the walls. And you can see from the intentional siting here on the corner of Sphere that it had a very monumental setting, that it is cantilevered on the first floor.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There is the octagon tower and then the square buildings behind at the rear of the tower. But it has a combination of cast in place and pre-formed concrete with contrasting gray with with the Colorado aggregate and then deeply recessed windows.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so it has the defining characteristics of the brutalist style. The application also put forward that it was that the building is a significant example of the work of a recognized architect. It was designed by a former and Bowers designed communication buildings nationwide for smaller markets and virtual markets.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And they designed, as most architects do, for the purpose of meeting their clients using the architectural styles that were popular at the time. They showed a mastery of pushing modern design styles in a variety of their communication centers, internationalism through formalism and in the brutalist structure here in Denver.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This building was one of the last television studios that they designed. It is one of the only brutalist styles, and it's the only example in Colorado. So it is a significant example of the work of a recognized architect.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The designation application also stated that it is a significant as an example of a master builder. It was built by Energy Tea Tree Construction Company. While the application demonstrated the scope of their work. Both staff and the Landmark Preservation Commission found that additional contextual information and a comparative analysis was needed to really study modern, large scale construction'",
        "'speaker_3': 'companies and whether those qualify as master builders. So the LPC found that it was significant for former employers, but not for the construction company. The property also represents an established and familiar feature of the contemporary city. Due to its prominent location or physical characteristics.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So this is a distinctive octagonal building. It was sited on a prominent corner at the confluence of Sphere Lincoln and seventh with visibility from Broadway. And six, the architects intentionally considering the site. And that, coupled with the building's arresting design, has created an iconic building that has been well known and prominent along Speer Boulevard for over 50'",
        "'speaker_3': 'years. And finally, the building promotes an understanding and appreciation of the urban environment by means of rarity. It is one of only two older historic buildings that are associated with Denver television stations or Denver's oldest stations are located within about a mile of each other along Lincoln Street and Speer Boulevard.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And this is one of only two in all the historic buildings. And then also it is a rare example of brutalist architecture in Denver. There are approximately 160,000 primary structures in Denver, and this is one of only a small handful of buildings that are in the brutalist style.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Here are a few examples of some of the previous buildings in Denver. The two buildings on the outer edge of the site are both a combination of custom placed and pre-formed concrete. And then the complex, the jail complex in the middle, well, it has brutalist forms, is actually made entirely of brick.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so brutalism can look it can be made up of different materials. But these are some of one of the few highlights of brutalist buildings in Denver. And so this property because there are you know, only a handful is significant for its rarity.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then finally, the landmark ordinance requires that a property retain its integrity, which is basically if the property looked like what it used to look like. And in this instance, there are minimum alterations there. Screens and satellites that were recently added would be considered non contributing to the building so they could be changed over time if needed'",
        "'speaker_3': 'if it's designated. There were also smaller changes to the rear garage doors and your alter, but overall the property maintains all aspects of integrity. And so the LPC considered the historic context and the period of significance for this property, that it reflects the history of the development of television, that it was developed under President MGM and Terry'",
        "'speaker_3': ', that it was designed by a well-known firm with extensive experience designing purpose built television stations. And it was designed, this style of style popular at the time, the historic context and the designation application adds significant detail to all of those areas.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The period of significance extends from construction. In 1969 to 1972, when the station was sold in the call, letters were changed to Cam g. H. This is the public comment that we have received at CPD. By May six that 11 a.m. we had received 23 comments in support and 92 in opposition.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then in the LPC public hearing there were two members of the community who spoke in support and one in opposition. And all of that was forwarded to you in your packets. So in my view, the Preservation Commission in CPD staff found that it met the criteria.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It is over 30 years of age. The application that at least three out of the ten criteria the building retains integrity and the OPC considered the historic context. I was watching him once and I will answer any questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you very much for the presentation. And tonight, counsel has received 51 written comments on Council Bill 437. There are five submitted comments in favor of the application and there are 46 submitted comments in opposition of the application.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All members of Council that are present have certified that they have read each of the submitted written comments. Do any members need more time in order to read all of the written testimony that was submitted? All right, scene one.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Council secretary, let the record reflect that all written testimony, both in favor and in opposition of Council Bill 437 have been read by each member of council and all written testimony will be submitted to the official record of the hearing.'",

We've been able to protect our employees and their livelihoods at a time of need while actually adding quality jobs. Journalism. It's our journalism that has driven our staff growth of 30% over the past few years.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And all that growth has been squeezed into this purpose built structure for a 1970s TV news operation. That's what led to our staff driven initiative to improve our workspace by reinvesting in Denver. We disagree with the advocates position that our building is exceptionally historic or that the architecture rises to the level of permanent landmark designation over the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'wishes of the staff that work here and the owners, the community overwhelmingly agrees with us. Between the public comments submitted to landmark preservation staff and those delivered to the City Council, by our count, more than 122 Denver residents and business owners have taken the time to indicate their opposition to designation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But now with this application, we feel like we've been pushed into a corner. If our building is designated, it severely impacts or prevents us from moving and reinvesting in the more modern facility our team needs. If we stay, we're tied to a purpose built building that no longer serves the purpose for which it was built.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The situation we're in right now, I'm delivering this message to you tonight was never the outcome that I saw it. From the first meeting with the applicants, I was hopeful we could find a compromise. We've had numerous conversations with the applicants, the city and the neighbors over the.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Last five.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Months. The conversation with city council members that the Rudy committee was helpful to. We were challenged in that meeting to go back and look harder for compromises. We did. We dug deeper into adaptive reuse and rezoning options for the site, and today none of those ideas is proven to be feasible.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The team doing this analysis is the same team behind 17th and Pearl and many other landmark and adaptive reuse projects in Denver. I trust their guidance. While we're why we were looking harder for compromise or purchase or PMG was able to work out an email u with the adjacent R.A. that keeps.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sorry. Here we go. But that keeps important issues and options on the table for future collaboration. So that brings us to tonight. What started as a simple idea to relocate and reinvest in better work environment for our employees has led to this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm asking for your understanding. Please give me the opportunity to finish what we've started. Give our 200 local journalists and staff the facility they need to better serve the people of Denver. Thank you.'",

We've been working with both KMG and PMG on this important issue. As architects, we share a responsibility to shape our city and each site appropriately so that they can be places of interaction and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'equity and connection. Our challenge, all of us together, regardless of the outcome tonight, is how to make this important gateway site a community connector for the Capitol Hill neighborhood and our city. Our firm has been privileged to work on some of the city's most prominent adaptive reuse projects.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The Tavern at 17th and Pearl a few years ago, and currently at Colfax and Franklin. Interestingly, these projects were accomplished without there being landmark. The challenges at one, two or three Speer, however, are significantly more complex. Adapting a building is no simple task.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Adaptively reusing a building with brutalist characteristics, an assemblage of imposing austere and opaque elements which does not connect with the neighborhood is a far greater challenge. Nonetheless, from the moment we heard that there were plans to apply for landmark status.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We set about understanding this possibility in all respects. We spoke with numerous developers and architects who have extensive experience in adaptive reuse. We reached surged through brutalist buildings, both nationally and internationally. And not surprisingly, an overwhelming number of them are municipal, institutional, government and school buildings, and they therefore have no intention of changing their use.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But we learned more about the brutalist style than we ever would have. So after countless hours of research and debate, we had a significant number of our peers in the architectural community, many of whom have written letters to you and staff, believe that 123 Speer is not a building of true historic significance, and it doesn't meet the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'high standard for preservation. Regardless, DMG asked that we search for a way to keep and reuse all or a portion of 1 to 3 Speer in the development. We did a thorough assessment of the existing building and we identified the need to completely overhaul all of its internal systems.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The stairs and elevators don't meet current codes. Its life safety, mechanical and utilities systems are antiquated, and its exterior envelope, with its single glazed windows throughout, is extremely under-performing. Even so, before the threat back in February 10th, all the way up through last week, we've explored many, many options for adaptive reuse and I'm happy to provide more'",
        "'speaker_1': 'detail on the question and answer period. In conclusion, this building does not need to be landmarked, but our team remains deeply committed to working with CPD staff and the neighborhood to continue to sincerely and professionally explore all options for a successful outcome.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The chances of doing so are part of the.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Evening. Thank you, Madam President. Brian Connolly with the law firm of art and Johnson Robinson, Neff and Reagan. Nettie. I had the privilege of being here representing the landowner team on this application. And I'll just note, I'll be very brief in my comments.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'll just note that our firm submitted a number of things for your packet this evening, including a memo on your approval criteria, a summary of public outreach that's been done, and some written responses to some of the questions that we received at the committee hearing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So hopefully you've had an opportunity to review those. I'm here to answer your question. To the extent you have any about.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The materials that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We submitted or quite frankly, anything else and look forward to doing so, I will preemptively answer one question because I know Councilman Flynn at.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The first reading asked us to address.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'First Amendment issues associated with this designation. We had not really had the.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'I will say.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That one of the bases of the application.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Is obviously the fact that this building has been used.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'By a journalistic organization and its history associated with journalism. So clearly, it's our position that Channel Seven would be penalized.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Designation of this.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Property. And obviously that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Penalty is related in part to the fact that it has been engaged in journalism. And, of course, the First Amendment protects the freedom of the press. I'm happy to go into more legal detail to the extent anyone has any questions about that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I will say from a big picture perspective, I think we can probably all agree that good local journalism is a public good. And certainly the designation of this property would require Channel Seven to devote a lot of its resources to maintaining the existing building and would limit Channel Seven's ability to grow its staff.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Whereas allowing Channel Seven.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Historic Denver did not initiate this designation effort, but we were invited to engage in two of the early dialog sessions with the property owner and the involved community members who want to historically designate the building. In these instances, we seek to bring options to the table.'",

We've seen parties come together around these values before, but in the case of one, two, three sphere, the mediated discussions did not provide a clear path forward.

        "'speaker_1': 'It would be a shame for it to be demolished and erased from our collective experience as a city. It has been categorized as belonging to the architectural style of brutalism. But regardless of what category the building is in, there is no denying its extreme modernism.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Back in 1969, Hugh Terry and Raymond Bowers both wanted to make a statement with the monumental building, and they succeeded. But while its modernism is what attracts many of us, that is also what seems to repel others. Critics tell us things like, I don't like brutalism.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's ugly. It's cold. The last one cold surprises me the most with its beautiful red color, especially in Colorado's sunshine. It is anything but cold, gray, concrete. It is not. People's reaction to it is much like reactions to modern art.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Some like it, some don't. But our society would be much less diverse and stimulating without it. Now, from the very beginning with scripts, we said we were open to compromise. We made clear that land not marketing, was not the only way to accomplish the goal of preservation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Adaptive reuse has always been our mantra and not necessarily within the context of the Landmark Preservation Ordinance. Win win was the goal. As mentioned before, for about a six week period back in January and February, we zoomed in numerous times with the Scripps team, an attempt to find common ground.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We asked, could something be done similar to what was successful up at 17th Avenue and Pearl Street, where for a little bit of additional density and no additional height weight was found to save the Uptown Tower. Their answer to that was no.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We asked, why did the tower have to be converted to residential? Couldn't it be reused as office space its current use? Again, the answer was no. We talked about various available tracks, tax credits. Could any of those be used to bridge the financial gap?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Again, no, those wouldn't work. The message was very clear 100% demolition. So when it came time, we took a deep breath. And we filed our application hoping that some type of win win would emerge. We were hopeful when CBD came up with Andrew Webb's discussions, but it didn't bear fruit.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So here we are tonight. Please designate the Channel seven building as a Denver landmark. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Our next speaker is Steven Benishek.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Hi. My name is Steven Benishek. I live in just six, specifically University Park, and I'm speaking to ACOs. So this council and everyone here who's speaking are well aware of Denver's housing shortage and the homelessness crisis. That's cause in the city, the council has appropriated millions of dollars and the people have approved the new sales tax in'",
        "'speaker_6': 'November specifically to deal with this problem. And this tells me that when the council talks about taking action against homelessness, those are empty words. And that's something they very much care about. Well, the thing is, you can only put so many Band-Aids over bullet holes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And at the end of the day, the city has to address its housing shortage. I. Creating more housing. The council has a chance to do that. They can send a message that Denver is open to everyone and they can tell people that a business being successful enough to outgrow its building moved to another one, something to be'",
        "'speaker_6': 'celebrated and incentivized. And they shouldn't be punished for that success. They can show that they share the concerns of those who can't be here tonight because they're working their second or third job. And they still have to spend 50, 60, 70% of their monthly income on rent.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But at the same time, they can do the opposite. They can send a message about the whims of a privileged few with little connection to this building are more important than the needs of people in the city for housing.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Designation, quite frankly, is meritless and hostile. Serves no legitimate purpose. What will become of this building if it's landmarked? It's in too much of a state of disrepair to be used for really anything. So it's just going to continue to stand there as an eyesore.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And we'll have this monument to just how much we do not want to build new housing. Allowing this demolition will allow new housing to be built near transit, helping the city fix this housing shortage, meet its vision zero goals and cut down on air pollution through fewer car trips.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'All of this, not to mention allowing Channel Seven to do what they want with what's their property. Quite frankly, are the reasons why I am. Please implore you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Stand up.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'For the people being forced onto the streets by the cost of living in the city. And please vote. No. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Our next speaker is Carla McConnell.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Evening and thank you for listening to my comments. I'm a Denver resident and I urge tonight that you vote in favor of landmark designation for the Channel seven structures. Unlike the Landmark Preservation Commission, Council has the ability to consider other community goals in your deliberation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I'd like to focus on two of those other goals. Neighborhood Goals. The draft Golden Triangle Neighborhood Plan references how the district's eclectic character is enhanced through having a diversity of architecture, historic and contemporary. This site can allow for the historic and contemporary development to occur on this important gateway location.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The Golden Triangle neighborhood has long as a strong association with arts and culture. Surely a tower that was purpose built for television could continue to serve creative businesses needing production space. Sustainability Goals. The Denver Office of Climate Action states that 40% of waste heading to a landfill is generated by construction.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The National Trust for Historic Preservation states that it can take up to 60 years for new energy efficient buildings to overcome the climate impacts of demolition and associated new construction. Adaptive reuse of existing structures is a sustainable strategy.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Any new development will require parking. Why not use the existing parking structure? The tower, in addition to being a tangible symbol of our history, can continue to serve new companies for many decades. While working as an urban design architect in Denver's planning office.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Serving two terms on the Landmarks Commission and serving on historic Denver's board, I have seen how development teams can rise to the challenge of meeting community goals instead of insisting on a vacant site. The resulting projects are always more interesting and often much more profitable.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I listened with interest to the discussion about Loreto Heights and heard how many times the inclusion of preservation was going to enrich that whole project. Landmark designation of Channel seven structures will result in a win win for both gender and the development team.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There is no downside. These structures meet landmark designation requirements. Designation brings benefits for the developer, and Denver will be a richer community with these structures continuing to serve for many decades. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Karla. Our next speaker is Travis Leiker.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Greetings. Denver City Council. Travis Leiker, president and chief executive director of Capitol Hill Neighborhoods. And we are one of Denver's largest and oldest registered neighborhood organizations. And 1 to 3 sphere is located within our boundaries. Capitol Hill United Neighborhoods has been monitoring the conversation and the debate concerning the landmark application of one, two, three year boulevard.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And while the organization has not taken a formal position on the matter, we have been concerned with the discourse and we share Councilwoman Sandoval's perspectives as expressed that the recent land use Transportation Infrastructure Committee, that compromise is essential.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'With an estimated eight large scale development projects underway for the government park neighborhood. Working together will be important for the future of the immediate surrounding neighborhood and good for the city over the long term. And to that end, Tron was approached early on by both KMG and PMG just to engage our organization in a conversation.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And just last week, Capitol Hill United Neighborhoods entered into an MSU Memorandum of Understanding to better guide the future of the property, ranging from assembling a neighborhood working group to actively exploring the myriad opportunities for this area. And some of the elements of the milieu include conceptualizing opportunities for PMG to incorporate public art and amenities.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Pocket Park to the final project. DMG will provide a transportation demand, management and multimodal transportation plan that prioritizes bike, pedestrians, transit opportunities and access. We're actually going to explore historically sensitive design possibilities that recognize the importance of TMG and pay homage to the history of the site.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And we're going to tackle our colleagues at Historic Denver consider opportunities for adaptive reuse and preservation for the existing structures.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we're going to engage in affordable.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Housing advocates and pursue partnership opportunities for attainable and affordable housing. And in addition to this, we'll be looking at conducting a traffic and mobility study prior to the site development plan. Absent another approach, as we have called for in previous communications with council and city leadership of something like a neighborhood design review committee or something similar, we'",
        "'speaker_6': 'need to refrain from absolutes and we need to establish a framework that could be a better standard for city planning and development and site specific collaboration. This is a unique and unprecedented approach from our perspective. It's one of the few times that we've been able to proactively engage in a memorandum of understanding and an agreement with the'",
        "'speaker_6': 'developer to custom craft opportunities for the neighborhood. So we remain committed to working with the neighborhood to get the city moving forward and and to collaborate further with Denver residents to shape the future of this site in a thoughtful and constructive way.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Our next speaker is Kathleen Wells. Go ahead, Kathleen.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I thank you. Good evening. Council president and council members. I'm Kathleen Wells. I'm a Denver resident and I live in District ten. I'm here to support the designation of the Channel seven building. I'm a Denver native. The building is a prominent part of the cityscape.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's widely recognized by the public, and it has been for over 50 years. It should be preserved as part of Denver's commitment to preserving its past. The building should also be designated due to its historical link to figures in Denver who should be honored, especially Hugh Cherry, the President and general manager of KLC.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Mr. Terry referred to as Mr. Denver, due to his commitment to Denver, assembled a first rate news staff, one National Awards, and was considered one of the most respected broadcasting executives of his generation.

        "'speaker_4': 'Madison Street, and I'm.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Environmental policy and sustainability. The thing about this building being sustainable and having a 60 year payback.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That is a concept known as embodied carbon.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that is.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Very unusual especially and it's location dependent. And in this location where it's near transit, near bike lanes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That payback period.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Probably not more than ten. That being said, what I really want to talk about tonight was basically about, you know, we we still hear a lot about how new market rate building is causing rents to go up, especially considering all the academic literature that points in the opposite direction.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But as Emily Hamilton, who's a senior fellow at the Brookings Center, has written.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There are a couple of.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Urban land uses that have been shown to increase land values and lead to economic displacement. The first is you should all by now. Now know by now is having lots of land dedicated to single unit detached buildings. And the other, as we've seen in cities in New York.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Chicago, Baltimore, San Francisco.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Are historic districts or places where historic designations have been made remarkably easy. Now, that doesn't mean that all historic designation is bad, but it comes with trade offs. A study in the Journal of Urban Economics found that properties near newly designated historic districts and buildings see price increases.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It also found that a disproportionate use of historic designations by high income residents is especially concerning as high income is correlated to greater political resistance. And I'll just quote this part directly. Political resistance is defined as the amount of community organization or feedback against a change in zoning when new historic designations effectively halt any zoning changes or'",
        "'speaker_4': 'new development in a wealthy neighborhood with political influence. And this affects less wealthy or politically connected areas or less politically connected areas outside the historic district that are impacted. So I ask, is this building worth the tradeoff? And I think that should answer itself.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We're still trying to solve the housing crisis, a single building and a single rezoning at a time. And that's not going to work. I just want to finish off by saying.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That we've.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Created a non resilient and non adaptable housing system in an era where adaptability and resilience should be traits that we should be pursuing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There was a.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Of steady and predictable water flows are over and there is no sign of them coming back in our lifetimes. This is it. We have to build, thank heaven.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's the time allotted we have. Thank you. Our next speaker is Greg Hulme.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. My name is Greg home. I live in the West Force Park neighborhood. And I'm speaking in opposition to the proposed hostile landmark designation 123 Speer Boulevard. The starting point for any land use decision made by city council should be the impact of their decision on the people of Denver.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'People are more important than buildings after food and water. Housing is humanity's most pressing need. Denver is in a major housing crisis. Housing is inaccessible and unaffordable. Homelessness is exploding, as is displacement of residents in low income communities.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Use proposed for 123 Speer Boulevard is attainable multifamily housing, which should have a much higher priority than preserving preserving a building. Dubious significance. 123 Speer is neither historic or architecturally important. It is a squat, ugly, special purpose building constructed as a television studio, an associated office building made of concrete which is expensive and difficult to modify.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The authors of the staff report, as well as the applicants and supporters in their letters, practically stand on their heads in their attempt to conflate this unremarkable building with an architectural masterpiece. Any ordinary observer reading the descriptions and looking at the building would be challenged to reconcile the descriptions with reality.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The construction type for pint sized lack of windows and other factors make 123 Speer terrible candidate for adaptive reuse. Denver deserves better from its built environment. Pursuit of landmark designations are too often used by a privileged elite as an anti-development tool to stop construction of housing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This is an abuse of the landmark designation process, which is not in the best interests of the city or its residents. Blueprint Denver helps us aspire towards a city that is equitable, affordable and inclusive. This aspiration cannot be realized unless we build more units of multifamily housing in our neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The benefits of density extend beyond supporting more affordable living to include everything from lowered greenhouse gas emissions to support for transit, local businesses and more walkable neighborhoods. City Council should vote unanimously to deny this ill advised attempt by privileged elites to use the landmark designation process to stop or delay the construction of housing desperately needed for Denver's'",
        "'speaker_1': 'current and future residents. Thank you. Appreciate your time.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening, members of council. My name is Michael Henry. I'm one of three applicants for a landmark designation of the Channel seven headquarters at Lincoln Street in Speer Boulevard. As you know, after the landowner filed an application. In late December for demolition eligibility.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Landmarks have reported that the building has potential for a landmark designation and sent a report as required by the Landmark Ordinance to registered native organizations and historic preservation organizations. Bird, Cameron, David Wise and myself. I have lived and worked in greater capital health for many years and have worked on many historic preservation projects and we are thrilled'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and submitted the application for this designation. We reached out to the building owner and and the prospect to purchase her home and had several Zoom discussions with them both before and after we filed the application. We were unable to reach any compromise solution.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We filed our application because we. We're convinced in our. The building and its history meet several of the criteria set forth by the ordinance. It's true, I think. We have been told in Turkish, like you mentioned. That a memorandum of understanding.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Oh. That are critical. Recording the property to reach a compromise between. The relevant parties regarding our application. However, it is important that Council carefully review this so-called compromise. First, the students were never invited by the landowner or the property purchaser to sign such a memorandum of understanding.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'In addition to meeting the criteria being in question. This building, at an important gateway intersection.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'In Denver is among Denver's ugliest and most embarrassing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Buildings. It is a walk on our skyline.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Will create a new, a unique opportunity for Denver to improve our built environment.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'An important attribute as a Denver zoning code is that it prohibits a lifeless, monolithic structure like this building from being built. Instead, it can be replaced by a well-designed building that addresses the public realm and engages as a community.'",

My interest in Denver's architecture is still important, even though I have seen too many tears in Denver's urban fabric and the loss of history. What stands before us is a large corporation ready to demolish the Denver Seven Building at 123 Speer Boulevard.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The office tower is the building that has had much attention. But when gone, the land will leave a blank slate for an apartment building. This is no surprise because Denver has allowed many neighborhoods that have changed and not necessarily for the better.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The three men who have worked to save the tower from the beginning have sought adaptive reuse. Denver may talk a lot about being green, but apparently that does not apply to this. Ours owners. Excuse me. We know the city will change and evolve.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But the past decade has been like a tornado tearing down buildings that we'll never see again. At some point, only Victorians can survive in Denver. The application to the city by Scripps Media Inc sought the approval for the total demolition of buildings on that land.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They had three ideas. No distinct. No distinguished architect. No appreciable appreciation for the architectural style. And no understanding of a tower that is highly visible. I must disagree. Scripts Media made a list of the items that meant to them, ignoring the reality about the architect, the style and the towers visibility.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Their goal was to receive a certificate of demolition eligibility. That's all. The style and the word brutalism have often been tarnished because of the imposing buildings that rely on concrete and weighty massing. Denver is a few examples of this style in terms of the office tower.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The monumental building offers a balance. It covers above a smaller base. The loss of this tower would be a loss for Denver's evolving architectural history. Finally, there has been a resurgence of interest in bearded brutalism across the country, but not in Denver.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Instead, my fear is that the city has turned Denver into anywhere U.S.A.. Thank you for your time.'",

So I'm the general manager and future owner of Turn Bicycles at 700 Lincoln Street, which is directly across seventh Avenue from the 123 Speer Building 12 When I want to simply state my opinion that the assertion that the 123 Speer building represents a high quality example of the architectural style known as Brutalism is'",
        "'speaker_1': 'dubious when compared to examples like the anchor building or the Pikes Peak Center for the Performing Arts. I also agree with prior remarks that many other examples of this architectural style are public buildings that will remain and never see a reimagining of their use.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I believe, though, that it is in my experience as a general manager and future owner of Turn Bicycles that carries more weight in this issue. Myself, my customers, my staff and my staff are the ones who look at this building every day.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I will tell you it is not an inviting building and certainly does not add to the area that has grown into a true neighborhood over my 21 years on this corner. That neighborhood is now inhabited by people who patronize local retailers and restaurants and take pride in their neighborhood, as opposed to the current inhabitants of 123'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Speer, who simply drive into and out of the imposing chain link parking lot without a thought for the surrounding neighborhood. 21 years ago, I never saw groups of friends or couples walking arm in arm to visit local restaurants after dark where they are the norm today.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I see redevelopment of the Channel seven building as an opportunity to further this transformation, and the prospective residents of a responsibly designed, mixed residential and commercial building represent the perspective represent perspective business to myself and other local businesses.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I don't think I speak for myself when I say that business will be greatly appreciated in the current climate of flight from the office buildings in the area and the idea that it could be repurposed to even more office space seems inaccurate.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Furthermore, if we intend to focus on improving the esthetic of the city, I don't believe disincentivizing land owners to work with well-known designers achieves that purpose. In my opinion, the best way to realize a more milquetoast development is to tell land owners they can't do as they choose with the property that they've owned for decades, even after'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that building's original intended use has long been outgrown. Redevelopment of 121 23 Speer Boulevard represents an opportunity to invest in a neighborhood on the rise, not protect and outgrown, underutilized and frankly, unattractive building. So I ask the council, the city council, to reject the proposed landmark status.'",

And so tonight, though, because we're talking about people who want new development and they're saying that it's going to be for affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Affordable housing in this city does not mean what people think it does. Affordable housing, according to this council and the planning board does not mean what people think it does. So don't be fooled by the fact that you think that they're going to be, but that this is going to help the housing problem.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This is going to help further gentrify. This city. Just like every other development that has been allowed. This is a developer's playground. Denver's. Developers have just been allowed to come in and build high rises and it does not.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'I'm speaking out in opposition of of this initiative and primarily because we we do need more housing. It's been reiterated many times. There's a few things that haven't really been touched on that it could reduce traffic congestion considerably.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Most of the people that would move there would likely logically work downtown. So it's going to be more walkable. That would reduce emissions. Emissions would be, you know, these things are important for the future of our city. And perhaps most importantly is this property is the southern gateway to downtown Denver.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So many wonderful things can be done there. And it is not that I don't appreciate. Historic buildings and property. Quite the contrary. I just think that it demolishes real historic buildings and property. To consider this to be one.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I have a long history of real estate experience in Denver. Both in my career, I've served on the Broadway Partnership District and many other boards, including the Homeless Coalition. I care deeply about Denver real estate. I oppose this, and I hope you consider that when you make your final deliberation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And once again, thanks for your hard work.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Jeff. Our next speaker is David Pardo.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Uh, City Councilor, can you hear me? Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. So I feel like a lot of people have already spoken to a lot of the points that I care about. I'm speaking in opposition to this designation, things about the fact that it could reduce our ability to produce more housing in units that the city desperately needs.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To me, one thing that people haven't really made mention of is that plenty of people who spoke out against this designation called the Building Ugly. Nobody spoke out for this designation. Thought it was a it seems to think it's a pretty building.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Because it's not. Plenty of people do not like Brutalism as an architectural style for good reason. It's it's not the easiest to enjoy. It tends to be a little rough and all of that. But there are some absolutely incredible examples around the world, and there are some not bad examples in Denmark.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This building is not one of them. It's kind of a is about to use something that I shouldn't use on a zoom call in front of 120 people. But it's bad. It's not a pretty building. It should not be saved.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It is it is an eyesore in my mind every time that I've ever rode past it on the cherry tree trail or driven by it on spear, I have gone, wow, why is that there? And I think that is worth taking into account, even if it meets some of the requirements to be a historically designated building.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Do we want to use that tool to save something that looks like this and that will, with a historic designation, continue to look like this after we're all gone? And that's really all I have to say about that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you for your time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, David. Our next speaker is Jonathan Patoka.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes. Good evening. Hello. Good evening. As West Colfax residents over on Newton Street, I understand the importance of history and the benefits that come with the appropriate and thoughtful use of landmark designations. It is for this reason that I speak to oppose this landmark application.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I do commend those who directed discussion seeking adaptive reuse of this building. As adaptive reuse can result in exemplary results in some cases, and that pressure did result in an MRU that will enhance the next life of this lot through superior design and community benefit offerings.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'However, this building does not rise to the level of designation in the landmark criteria, and the claims in the application lacked the exceptional nature warranting designation over the objection of the property owner. The 1970s television studio was notably constructed at the end of, or arguably after the Hugh Terry period that city staff presented on tonight.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Even the staff report notes that this building was designed by a company that specialized nationally in communications buildings just like it. It was effectively a mass production design in its time. You need no more than a quick perusal of reader comments in Westword and other publications regarding this application to understand that the broader public does not consider'",
        "'speaker_6': 'this building to be so exceptional as to be worth preserving. In contrast to notable structures such as the Molly Brown House, the Diana Tower, or the Brown Palace. We want our historic districts and landmark structures to thrive and have active and successful uses.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This building is not a good starting point. It is not well-positioned to thrive. Even the use that it was purpose built for a television studio cannot sustain operations within the claim that a television studio should be designated as a historic landmark.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Because the news was broadcast from that building is a stretch. By this measure, the presence of any business in any building more than 30 years ago could merit landmarking. There are better ways to celebrate the news media than landmarking a single studio.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This holds particularly true given that the landmarking this building would do damage to the future business prospects of that very same news organization trying to survive in today's difficult media landscape. How does landmarking this building do them honor?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If we know, it will hurt them. Additionally, the developer of the site seeks to replace it with housing, which is desperately needed in our city as it faces a crisis of housing supply. And this site is particularly well positioned for sustainable transportation options.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Denver's network. Again, I urge the City Council tonight to vote this landmark application down. I also encourage City Council to consider this application a clear example of why our city's rules for landmark preservation should differ for hostile designations.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We should, at a minimum, require a council supermajority for such designations or the bar. The criteria that have to be matched should be clearly met, not questionably met. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And our last speaker this evening is Kevin McCrossin. We'll have to have you go ahead and unmute, Kevin. All right. There you go. Go ahead, Kevin.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hello. So my name is Kevin McCrossin. I own counterculture brewing group. We are right there.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'On the edge at 205.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'East Seventh Avenue. And we. We're going to have to go ahead and oppose the designation as well, because we believe that there. The neighborhood will do well. If we could redevelop that area where the building resides. Which is.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'As we've discussed. Not the most beautiful thing. And thank you for your time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Very good. Thank you, Kevin. That concludes our speakers this evening. Thank you, everybody, for staying with with us, questions from members of Council on Council Bill 437. Council member can each.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Council presidents. I have some questions about the criteria, so I know for sure that I'm going to have questions for Kara, but I may have questions for I think the she was Adkins architect as well. So I'm just going to dove in.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so the first one is the period of significance. Kara I'm a little confused. The slide reference, 1953, and it referenced the second half of the century and the fall of print media and the rise of television. But this building didn't open until 1969.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I'm a little concerned about the citation of, you know, a change that happened 15, 16 years ago when that's not the period of significance. So can you help me understand why we're referencing things that weren't part of the period of significance when describing the significance of the building?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah. So we're talking a little bit about the historic context of like, what is that? When did these changes occur? Understanding what happened before helps understand how this building came to be. So the period of significance for this building is 1969 to 1970.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Two or three, I apologize. All of a sudden it dropped out of my head. But it's talking about basically how it was media and television really transformed enough to. Decided to build a whole new studio for it that they had been using only for the studio.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then because it was so successful, it led to the development of this new purpose built studio. And so leading up to it is just an important part of the history and talking about the importance of Hugh Terry and some of his work.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so that that, that, that was the purpose of the designation application narrowing the period of significance, providing greater historic context.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I just want to clarify, the rise of television did not occur during this period of significance. It happened in the 1950s. It did not happen during this period.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. The second question you mentioned, Hugh Terry, I want to ask about. I'm going to try to get my wording right here, the significance association with the significant person. I'm going to say it wrong anyway. An important person associated with the building.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So, you know, I'm familiar with buildings that were lived in by significant people. I'm familiar with buildings built by or owned by significant people. This person just worked there. So can you give me is that is that a common I don't recall other applications coming before me with someone who just passed through a building for a couple'",
        "'speaker_2': 'of years being associated with that building for a designation criteria. So can you help me out if if I'm not remembering.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There aren't necessarily a lot of buildings that have been designated for in the preservation term. It's called their productive life, but for works of where they have worked. But occasionally because their work is so significant and the building itself is what's left to represent that work that is sometimes done in Denver.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We haven't done it a lot, but it is part of an established preservation practice to do that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Anyone else with this short of a period. On the overlap in the building like this is not a person who worked in the building for 30 years. They pass through for 2 to 3. I'm sorry my math might be off too at this hour, but anyway, I mean, I just it it seems short to me.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It is short. And one of the things that was we considered our staff as well as was put forward in the application was that because the other building had been torn down, that this was the last remaining building that was associated with this productive life?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If the other building was still standing, that would be more representative of his work. But because it wasn't and because it has been demolished, it's the building that's most associated with his productive life.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right. I question whether the criteria allow us to consider a building that's already gone in comparison. I don't know that I question. That is something that I don't read in the ordinance. But the. I want to talk about brutalism for a second.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And this is where I might need to ask the serious Atkins folks to chime in. But there is conflicting testimony or information in the record about whether or how much of this building was cast in place versus I forget the other prefabricated and it's significant piece of that brutalism is this cast in place.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So can someone clarify for me definitively how much of this building was cast in place?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think we need to get Andy Rock more promoted.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you for your help identifying who to ask for.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Amy Unger, who also wrote the designation application, may be able to answer that. I could I could take a stab at it that you have the the gray pieces, the ribs that you see are the cast in place.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Would it be accurate to describe that as a minority of the building? Yes. Okay. And so I guess I would just ask maybe, Kara, you wrote, you know, the staff report if that's a significant feature of brutalism and it's a minor minority of this building, how is it that you determine it as in, you know, I'm going'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to say the wrong word again, but the an exemplary, you know. Anyway, do you get the question? It's very I have no vocabulary right now.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I understand at 11:00, I'm sure my answer is coherent because they would be at an earlier time. So losing can be a combination of brutalism can also have different materials like the example of the jail.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It is a.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Brutalist style, but it is a brick material. So it can be cast in place, it can be pre-formed concrete, it can be a mixture of both. A lot of the examples in Denver are mixtures of both, so it doesn't have to be just one or the other, but it's its form and its use of concrete, whether it's'",
        "'speaker_3': 'free form or casting place.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Can I have Andy chime in on that question as well, please?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sure. I'd love to. Thank you. I think the the challenge that we found in describing this building as brutalist is that brutalist style is really known for its integrity, for for its rigorous application of karst concrete. There's there's really no sort of gray area with a brutalist building.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And in in almost all brutalist buildings, precast concrete is used either for ornament or maybe sunshades. So here I agree that it's in this building. It's almost flipped. The precast is by far the significant material, save the columns and a few exterior elements.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's this building lacks integrity, in our opinion. For that reason.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Got it. One more question on the brutalism. Are there? Did anyone who researched this building, either the applicants or the owners? Were there contemporary descriptions of it as brutalist when it was built? Did the media say, Hey, Denver has a great new brutalist building, you know, etc., etc. Where was that term applied to it?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In contemporary contemporaneously to its creation?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This is the I'm the prepare the of the nomination. I did not find any. In my research, I did not find any references that were specifically noting it as its request building when it was first open. But that's not unusual for this type, I would say.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I would also, just to hearken back to your question about past concrete sources, precast panels that I would agree with Terry's interpretation and Brutalism is a. Type of architecture that is often tried to be defined by very narrow, just a few boxes that you pick off.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It has to with cars.com. It has to be colored concrete, things like that. When brutalism, when it was first described as it first emerged, was really about principles, a set of principles. And one of those principles was the honest use of material especially and concrete being the primary material that was over building buildings.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so the honest use of concrete is really what is most. Indicative of brutalism as opposed to what it is, how it's put in place, whether it's passing plays. What? Pre-Cast panels are then installed. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. That's really helpful. My last question is for Cara again. I want to understand a distinction between how I have become accustomed to hearing recognized architects described and this recognized architect that you guys identified in the staff report as recognized.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I guess, you know, I'm used to you all saying this architect was known for their clean ends or this architect was known for like developing half the post-World War two. You know, I don't recall another architect that was just famous for doing a lot of buildings nationally.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I guess I want to ask you this. Of major architecture firms who are in in business nationally who would not be recognized based on value. I guess I'm curious about I did you know, Walmart does a lot of volume, but they may not be known for, you know, the particular value that they bring to retail.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I don't know. I'm just trying to use a bad analogy, forgive me, but I guess the fact that this architect does a lot of buildings, is that enough for it to be recognized under our criteria? Because I just I don't see that they have a record from the testimony of me in the record that they have, you'",
        "'speaker_2': 'know, that they're known especially for Brutalism. I don't see that they're known, especially that they have other dedicated buildings. It just seems like they do a lot of buildings. So I who wouldn't qualify under that criteria.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so the LPC actually had a discussion of like what does recognize me? And that it's a known architect, it named architect, someone that has a body of work. And in this particular instance, the Fuller and Bower, Fulmer and Bowers designed a variety of different types of buildings, but they were known for doing purpose built television stations'",
        "'speaker_3': '. And so that's part of what they were recognized for, is that television studios would hire them because they knew how to do purpose built. It was sort of this national trend, sort of postwar in the fifties, late fifties and sixties of television studios having their own kind of figured out how to do studios.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so they're nationally known for doing television studios. And so that's why they're recognized for that. And so that's why we found that they were a recognized architect and that this was significant for them. As one of the early realists in only one, it was.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Aware of.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Where any of those other television studios designated.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I don't know. I don't know the answer to that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. All right. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I can answer that question. None of their studios have been designated. But I would argue that that does not mean that they're not sick. They would not be eligible for designation. And certainly one of their finer works has been already demolished, and that certainly would have been eligible for National Register designation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But didn't get a chance to. So just because something hasn't been.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Designated to date doesn't mean that it's not necessarily eligible.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Amy. And thank you, council member Mitch. Next up, we have council member Black.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And thank you to all of our speakers who came tonight. Appreciate your passion. I have a question about. The discussions that the owners.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Had.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'With the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Capitol Hill United Neighbors. I know in 2019, when.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We updated our.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Landmark ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There was a. A specific effort to bring applicants.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And owners together to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Try and find a compromise. But I'm curious about this agreement.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Because the Capitol Hill United Neighbors are not the applicant.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But Travis Leiker spoke and he sent us a letter with all the details. And so I'm.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Curious how that came.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'About.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I'd like to hear more from the applicant.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'About their commitments to.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The Capitol Hill, your neighbors and what.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Might go in that spot.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilwoman Black, I think we should have been Littleton promoted as well.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'He's the general manager of Channel Seven, and perhaps he and Evan SHAPIRO can answer questions about interactions with John.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Great.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. We've got Evan promoting and theme. So please go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You have. Thank you. The memo you is is actually with with PMG and Shawn. We had a number of conversations with with John as part of our community outreach. So, Evan, maybe you want to touch a little bit on the on the IMO you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sure. So throughout the process.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We we've approached a number of neighbors and stakeholders who obviously have what goes on this site in their interest. And over the past several months, we've had conversations with Sean. And certainly and this is in many ways thanks to what happened at the at the.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Rudy hearing a.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Few weeks ago. We recognize that now is an opportunity to continue to reengage.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We did offer a good neighbor agreement to.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The applicants for this designation, which didn't gain any traction. And that Sean.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Group was aware of that. And discussions began about, is there a way.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'For us to work together? You know, if if we're still going to be interested in this, even if, you know, the applicants aren't interested necessarily in any sort of agreement like that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is there an opportunity for other stakeholders.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'In the neighborhood to engage with us in that sort of conversation? And so a number of.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The of the key issues that Sean has.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Happened to be exactly the things that we care about ourselves. And so we're looking forward to the opportunity going forward to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Have those working sessions with them, hopefully starting as soon as within.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The next 30 days, about things like engaging local businesses, about sustainable building materials and practices, about public art, about the opportunity to see if.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If there are ways that we can pay homage to to the history of this site, that I think is completely understandable, that there is so much passion about it by the neighborhood. And then.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You know, attainable housing is a core principle.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Of what we're doing.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And clearly.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The housing crisis in Denver is real. And so an opportunity to engage with many.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Stakeholders in the neighborhood about how do we like to solve that problem, but also what are your ideas for it and.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'See if there are overlapping opportunities there.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Is is such a testament to what we're trying to do anyway, that there's no reason for us to not have that sort of M.O. in place.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so the email you is with John.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And you PMG as.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The potential.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Owner.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's right.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I and without.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Going too much into the specifics.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The working group is supposed to include more than just China in its first include a number of other stakeholders that showing, you know.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To their credit insisted should be involved in the process. And so I think the idea is because there is not an.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Existing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Methodology in the planning process.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Of getting stakeholder.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Input, that this is a way to work together to do that anyway.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And the applicants declined to work with you on some kind of.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Agreement like this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sure. I mean, of course they're on there.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I'll let them speak to, you know, how they feel about the process. You know, they are focused on landmarking this building. And so we made an offer. They they can explain the reasons why they didn't feel it was appropriate.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But, yes, they are.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Not a party.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To the M.O. You know, we have negotiated with China. We not.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Participate.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm sorry. I.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The the entire process is predicated on demolition. And we have not been invited to participate in any discussion of adaptive reuse.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so back to you, Evan, that the.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Ammo you is not. There's nothing legally binding about it, is there?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, I'll let Andy I'm sorry, Bryan, speak to that. My understanding is that it is a legally.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Binding document.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Of we must work in good faith to to go through the the bullet points that are in there. And I think that the vast majority of them are things we will do anyway. I'll let Brian speak to, you know.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Whether or not I said that correctly, Councilwoman Black It is a legally.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Binding document and what it binds.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'PMG and John two is.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Is a process. And so it creates a community working group. It requires certain.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Meetings of the community working group.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And the types of things that Evan was listing off are set forth in the memo.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You as topics that the Community Working Group.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Is going to work on as this project progresses. Obviously, because of this process, the project has not been fully designed.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'By any means.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's sort of dependent on the outcome of this process. But, you know, as Evan indicated, that the intent is that assuming we receive a favorable vote this evening, then Gavin and his team and Sean will work together to begin those conversations and to begin to develop those plans.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Thanks, Brian. And I see that one of the points in that agreement or the MRU is to consider opportunities for adaptive reuse or preservation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah. I think the idea with that is.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That throughout.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This process we've been open. We've held designs for us with the applicants, with historic Denver, and we are open to to ideas that we perhaps haven't.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Considered, even in.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Just the past two weeks, since alluding we've you know, we've met with the Landmark and.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Planning.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Group at the city of Denver to understand what.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Our our firm was founded in the first ten years of of a 30 year company was all about adaptive reuse. And so we haven't been able to find a workable solution yet. But if something is put to us that is clearly going to work, then it's something that we will consider.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Some people are concerned with density, some people are concerned with height, some people are concerned with preservation. And certainly we need to do our best to weigh all of those. And there's not always a perfect solution, but we want to do our best.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And in my view and our view, we think we've come up with.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'A way that can help us do.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That. Is it perfect?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I you know, I don't know. But but I think it's a it's a I think it's a good attempt, certainly.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'All that and. There's a lot happening in.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Denver right now. And you you heard all sides of it with our hours.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Long public comment.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Yes, Denver's crowded.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But we also fear ugly apartment buildings and we're getting an awful lot of them in our city. And so I think a lot of what we're hearing is about that. So I'm really glad that you're working with that neighborhood group to really talk about those.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Kinds of things. And that's all I have for now.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'We did. Thank you, Councilman Flint. I appreciate the question. We've explored myriad options on this site, as you're I'm.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sure aware that the the issue that we looked at with regard to making this move, we this is an.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Employee driven initiative based on how much we've grown and figuring out this, you know, addressing the structural limitations of this building.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'By adding.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Space does not necessarily address the needs that we have, which are the fact that the majority of our staff is in the five storey tower. Adding space off to the side keeps us even more spread out from where we are now.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Adding more space.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Elsewhere and then further spreading our teams out on the site. That was the reason that we went to screw ups and asked for their help to make this happen.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Brian, can you help with that or Diem Maybe you could talk a little bit more, not just about the functionality of expanding onto that site, but about the cost. Did you explore costs or did you not get that far?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, we didn't we did not get that far.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Simply because it didn't address the needs and the problems that we had with the site. That's what led us outside.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We really need to.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Local journalism somewhere else here in Denver.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. Could you briefly describe functional issues that caused you to want to move and get out of that building? And I've been in that building many times. I know the constraints that it has. So I'm just curious why that East Side parking lot, why could that not be designed to create the functionality that you're looking for?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sure. The the issue that we got.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Is the fact that, for instance, I have I have three newsrooms and that's just.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Not oh, my God, it sounds horrible.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There's so many people in our building now we've had to scatter them all about. So adding another building elsewhere to scatters.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And further, that's sort of at the core of the functional issues that we've got in the building. I need those teams that work together. Yeah. Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Is that due to the two changes in broadcast media in Denver or nationally, that the old style doesn't work anymore, just like many other industries? And explain that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's more so because of the small four plates in the five story arc.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Address that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. I believe that's all I needed to hear from you. Thank you. Now, that's why. Madam President.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'That was right after we started. We received comments from all over the U.S. and beyond about Tom's Diner. Our vote was ultimately not needed because at the effectively at the last minute, various parties came to an agreement. The second was an owner sponsored historic designation, and that passed with little fanfare, unless, of course, you are the owner'",
        "'speaker_6': 'of that newly designated property. So congratulations again to the owners of 1272, followed by that this third application is once again owner opposed. I want to disclose that I'm a fan of brutalist architecture. I don't know what that says about who I am or what is going on in my soul.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But but I like the I like the style. I enjoy viewing the clyfford still the the Federal Reserve and other brutalist buildings in Denver, that center of land. The landmark process isn't about what is.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Pretty or not.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It is about what embodies the characteristic of an architectural style or type. So I think some of some of the comments and questions really encapsulate that, that a lot of this conversation and what we've heard in District ten office is that a lot of the people who supported landmarking discussed the rapid development in in the metro area'",
        "'speaker_6': '. And a lot of the people who were opposed discussed our housing shortage. So, you know, just in this area, there's Racine's, there's Frank BONANOS restaurants. There's the park. The park, too. There are 15 projects that CBRE is tracking that's underway in the Golden Triangle and six more projects in Pre-Application that CPD is currently aware of.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And this is in Golden Triangle. So, you know, this this one, two, three. Spirit isn't even in that list of 21 current and Pro's proposed developments. Same with the recedes in sight and in Mr. Bananas restaurants. Those are also outside the Golden Triangle designated the proposed text amendment and a statistical neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So put another. Or to put another way. There's an incredible amount of development all around 1 to 3 spirit. And I feel the pain expressed by so many who have lived in this area for decades and who feel the pressure of all this construction.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'To quote Caroline Sharp, the fear is another massive, undistinguished luxury apartment. But let's move beyond a proxy battle between those who discussed our housing shortage and those who resist rapid development. This application is about landmark preservation. We've heard from CBRE staff and other architects in support of landmark preservation.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We've also learned or heard from numerous other architects, many with deep backgrounds in historic dwellings and opposition to this preservation. What's also at stake is the protection of landmark of all landmark structures in Denver in the process. If we approve a landmark such as this that has division among architects, it calls into question the other buildings that'",
        "'speaker_6': 'have already been through the process without controversy. Our landmark buildings and process should be beyond reproach, just as our current process is so that we retain the reputation of being a national model for historic preservation. We have architects who are who have presented tonight.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We have architects who have not presented tonight. You are on the national stage and they report that we are a model here in Denver and how we preserve buildings. We, as in the city of Denver, recently made tweaks to the process to help facilitate decisions because neighbors didn't feel they had a voice.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'd suggest that this process says we should.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Take another look.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And and make sure that the conversations that you mentioned before, that proxy battle have the space to occur. Ultimately, the quasi judicial nature of this conversation kept me from sharing a lot of thoughts before now. And so I'm glad that that that the conversation continued in other and other ways and added, for example, to the conversation, the'",
        "'speaker_6': 'M.O. between Capitol Hill, United neighbors and and the proposed developer. What what I will say is I challenge the developer that whatever comes next, we don't want as much as another massive, undistinguished luxury development. We already have enough essence as as I think Councilmember Black has said as well.'",

It's full of public comment from neighbors all around. What you three square. Should this not pass, please listen to the neighbors and create something that is exceptional and provide honor, dignity and homage to the history of'",
        "'speaker_6': 'this location. I will vote no and I hope you do as well. Thank you. Council President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Hines, Councilmember Black.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Madam President. And thank you, Councilman Hines. You said everything I was thinking, but you said it very, very well. Even though we're all so tired.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It is a really, really.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Important corner for.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Our city. And it's really important that no matter what happens tonight, that. We improve.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Corner and make it a.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Welcoming point in our city. I am a fan of historic designation. I am a historian. I'm a Denver native. A lot of beautiful historic buildings have been torn down and it is a huge loss for our city. I will not be supporting the preservation of this building.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And one of the main reasons why is I believe that owner opposed designation should.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Have a higher bar.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I thought that for.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'All of my time on council.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And in 2019 I asked council members if we could talk about it some more, but you all did not want to do it. But Councilman Sawyer and I are going to reopen that conversation. So hopefully we can have some more discussions down the road and we're going to engage some experts and get their opinion, too.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So thanks again to everyone who is so passionate about our city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And again, I will not be supporting the designation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilmember Black. Councilmember Kenny.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Council President I have not been shy about taking bold votes to preserve some of the character of our city, even when controversy is involved. And so I start with that assumption that it's critical to preserve some of our character in our city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I also take seriously the criteria, and I will just say thematically, my feedback to the commission, the Landmark Preservation Commission and to the staff is that the adjectives matter. It's not just that history was happening, it's that there was a significant event, right?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And there was a significant role. It's not just that there's an association with a recognized person. It has to be substantial. And I do find that even though I couldn't find each of those words because I couldn't look at both screens at once.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'A few minutes ago, I've been thinking a lot about those adjectives, and I really don't find that those things were weighed. There was a person who was known. There was you know, it's not just that there was an architectural an architect who is known.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It has to be a significant example. And you have to be able to distinguish why every other building made by that architect wouldn't count as significant. Right. If everything they do is a significant example, then it's not significant.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's just an example. And here's why I think this matters. I'm going to find tonight that this designation does not meet the criteria in our code. But I'm deeply concerned about the fact that both some I think less than rigorous evaluation and also, frankly, attempts to to designate some marginal buildings might weaken the overall regime that we'",
        "'speaker_2': 'need to preserve really important examples that really meet high standards. That's what concerns me about this report. So I respectfully I have so much respect for the staff of Landmark and for the Landmark Commission. And I have worked with you side by side for years, frankly, to try to save this ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I see this with loving kindness, that it is important to apply the adjectives rigorously in the analysis, because only if you can make the case that only some buildings qualify, not every building. Can we then really justify the standards that we have?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I'm nervous about, you know, my colleagues, well-intentioned effort to evaluate whether higher standards should apply. And I'm fearful that we could lose the Molly Brown house or we could lose a low doe if we have unrealistically high standards.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I also understand that the failure to rigorously distinguish between rate significant, embodied, distinctive and substantial things from those that are just kind of like there while history was happening that I understand that that's why we've ended up opening in this conversation again.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I hope that those watching from historic Denver, from the Landmark Commission have some conversation about this and really reflect on it. And I hope that we can save these standards that we really might need to save some really critical things.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The one last thing I'll say is, if for any reason this building didn't meet the standards, I would also find that the inability to adapt it for residential and commercial use because of the concrete materials would make it economically less viable and therefore also not warranting a rare circumstance.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We don't have that with your average church or your average building, but all this concrete does make a difference. So thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember. Councilmember Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Madam President. I thank Councilwoman Kimmich again for her comments. I fully agree with them. And I would add on to this that the code, as we amended it a couple of years ago, specifically directs us to look at factors beyond the criteria such as the views of the owner.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I am very concerned about the financial implications to scripts and to their expansion and their ability to continue to compete with their other media challengers in the city. I say that even knowing having worked for Scripps for 27 years before they closed the Rocky Mountain News, how how it's not really prudent to trust all their financial'",
        "'speaker_5': 'statements. Okay. I mean, when I was hired, Al Knight, the Prince of Darkness, who hired me, said, Why do you want to work here? I said, Well, Times Mirror had just bought the L.A. Times. It just bought the Denver Post.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There's going to be a great newspaper, War and Times. America's got deep pockets. And Al said to me, Well, scripts, scripts has deep pockets, too. Problem is, they are tiny little arms. So I'm naturally suspicious of the financial projections.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'However, I do also believe that the implications of tying a landmark designation that severely restricts the possibilities as a councilwoman can each set for adaptive reuse. The recessed windows and and the lack of any windows on four of the four of the eight sides entirely is problematic.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so I would also I would join my colleagues in voting no on this. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilmember Flynn. And likewise, I do not believe that this meets the criteria and I will also be voting no against this. Madam Secretary, roll call on Council Bill 437, please write a.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Cashman No.'",
