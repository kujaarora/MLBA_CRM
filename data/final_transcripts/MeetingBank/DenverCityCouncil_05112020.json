        "'speaker_4': 'Do we know how many units are being proposed? So 10% of what is it, 10% of maybe ten units or a thousand units? Do we know?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm not aware of the project specific numbers. The applicant as president might have that information.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Applicant, please come up. Thank you. Can you introduce yourself?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And yes, I'm Chase Hill with Cypress Real Estate Advisors, the developer and applicant for this for this reason. Okay. We anticipate actually having two buildings on this 3.8 acre site. 650 units in the aggregate. So 65 affordable units.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Thank you. Very good. Brandon, one last question, and that is and I think I know the answer to this, but I just want to make have it out so that I know it. So I understand it correctly.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Member We will get back to you during the comment section.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Councilmember Hines Thank you, Mr. President. I also am interested in affordable housing with the 10%. Was that just volunteered by the borough applicant or was there something that was given to to obtain the 10%? That is a voluntary housing agreement that was worked out with the Department of Housing instability.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Customer and customer, we are taking you sitting here for another question or just for comment. Common question. Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So, Brandon, do you know if the commitment is for both rental and for sale housing?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I believe this is a rental.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So if they do for sale, we're not holding their feet to the fire. I'm for sale. Just on rental. So let me ask the applicant if he would mind coming forward. If you could tell us if you're just doing rental or if you're planning to do any for sale housing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah. Again, Chase Hill with Cypress Real Estate Advisors, it's all it's kind of to be 100% for rent. Okay. That's what we've done across the street. We've never developed condos. It's a good question. I believe the agreement that we've negotiated and signed authority housing stipulates that it's, I believe is actually residential of any free.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So whether it be for sale or for rent, the 10% would apply.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Are you looking to access like tech funding or any other city housing resources to help offset the cost of the affordable?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We are not we're proposing that that is our cost.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. Can I ask you a question about the adjacency to rail while you're up there? Is this something that you all looked at? Did you review the report that was handed out about railroad safety, adjacent development adjacent to railroad addressing safety issues?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah, we have we've actually looked at extensively with Union Pacific, who had some building restrictions related to residential in particular. And we've negotiated to have those restrictions removed on account that the most proximate line that's at grade behind us is actually a spur that is extremely rarely used as a turnaround point.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There's an elevated line farther back up above, but the lines that are at grade adjacent, the site aren't really used. And furthermore, we have to have a perimeter fire access road on the back end side anyway. So our building will be stepped back 40 feet from the existing real spur.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay, that's good to know. I appreciate you sharing that. Thank you. I have no further questions at this time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember. All right. I don't see any other questions. The public hearing for Council Bill 105 is closed. Comments by members of Council member state advocate. This one's in your district. Did you want to go first?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. Thank you, Mr. President. I strongly encourage my colleagues to not support this rezoning tonight. I do not believe that it meets the criteria, because I do not believe it is consistent with our our plan goals, especially around equity and housing and health and safety and connectivity.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think that there are some major issues to overcome and to address, including with some of the real issues that Councilwoman Ortega brought up this evening. But I also think that this process for public engagement was cut short by COVID.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I have two letters of support in here, neither from residents, both are from business associations and the art district. And so and I also have been talking to the neighborhood and residents in the neighborhood who have been participating in the development of an equity plan, that they reached out to this developer and requested to meet with this'",
        "'speaker_3': 'developer, shared equity plan goals with the developer. And so to see a 10% commitment to housing in the context of one of our most vulnerable neighborhoods, and looking at that Reno plan that has less than a fourth of it designated for housing, and this project itself is about a 16th of that fourth, and it's still only 10%'",
        "'speaker_3': '. That doesn't feel like it's consistent with what we're trying to do in this area. This is also a couple it's just steps away from our crossroads shelter. And we've been concerned about how development that area is going to honor, support, connect that project, which is a city owned project now.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so we haven't heard any responses. I don't believe there is a development agreement, am I correct? Is there can you nod your head? Is there a development agreement there? There's no there is not a development agreement and so on.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'On principle, I do not think this is consistent with the plan and does not meet all of the indicators required to support this tonight. So I will not be supporting and I hope that my colleagues can respect that this is in my district and nobody knows our constituents more than we do.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And follow suit. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Councilmember Cashman.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Yeah. So another development, 650 units. So 595 market rate units in 65, slightly below market rate. I don't have a problem with a developer trying to make a profit. That's what a developer's goal is in the course of doing business.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But I have a problem that we keep taking this 10% number like it's it comes from the sky, from God. And I know other jurisdictions are being more demanding in their requirements to meet their housing goals. And I think we need to do that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah, ten, 10% is not going to get us where we need to go. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Councilmember Hines.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I am troubled by the comments that Councilmember CdeBaca had mentioned. In some ways, our process doesn't really afford us. I can't ask questions anymore because questions are over. I would say I would agree with Councilmember excuse me, Councilmember Cashman.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We have turned down or not turned down. Sorry. We've pushed back on projects with 10% affordable housing in District ten. And. And while I hate it, what am I trying to say? Celebrate that this is a voluntary commitment.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I know that that we have a lot of need for affordable housing in the city. And and as we continue to take up real estate that is of in historically underserved neighborhoods, that that makes it even more difficult to.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We only have so much land. We're landlocked. So I just want to put those thoughts on the on the record. Thank you, Mr. President.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Can come to the make.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'On check with legal. We did closed the hearing for questions and we were in the comment section. So I just want to double check before we start bringing people back up for questions. What? Remind me, we haven't had one of these for a little while.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Are we clear? There are, because the hearings aren't even closed and we're just in the comments. Is it too late for that? Jonathan Griffin, Deputy Legislative Counsel I believe that's fine. Okay. Thank you. And so, Councilman Hines, since you also referenced that, I wanted to make sure that we had clearance on that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. What's your can you respond to that issue around some of the neighborhood interests in an equity plan and what your recollection on that was?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah. So we reached out to all the people nose spent the most time. Some of them were unresponsive. Those who did respond we met with on multiple occasions for the most amount of time with the River North Art District here in their thoughts and concerns, several people within that organization at their office.'",

It's not adjacent to single family. It's not casting shadows on any people's backyards or having an impact on any residents in the immediate area.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In fact, our only neighbors on all sides or other apartment complexes of the similar size and scale as far as what we're proposing. So that's why we feel in talking with River North, our district and other organizations that issue letters of support that they wanted to steer growth and density here.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we did not meet a lot of opposition. Candidly. Respectfully, of course, Candy did mention some concerns and voiced opposition, but it seemed that the organizations and individuals we reached out to, if they were going to have to steer the development and growth of Rhino, it was better here than the other side of the tracks is what'",
        "'speaker_5': 'we kept hearing. So I'm not sure if I answered your question, but that's that's the conversations we had with the various stakeholders.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'You don't recall.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That. Can you can you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That that is the communication that I've had with the Globeville Swansea residents. They've reached out and CPD is well aware because they're a partner with us in the equity development plan. And so that has been something that's come up.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We've mentioned that and that they have stated goals in there and I recognize you don't have a development agreement yet, but this the 10% is a slap in the face to the goals that they've outlined. And this project, the size of it impacts the whole ecosystem, even if it's on the other side of the tracks, if that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'makes sense.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We addressed whatever was asked of us with the organizations we met with in order to get their letter of support they wouldn't have issued. I would have ignored their requests. 10% at 80% might not be perceived as enough to some, but to the organizations we discussed, they saw it as a voluntary gesture.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And if the city was to mandate more than we would, we would have to do more. We just thought, given that our competition across the street on all sides has none, that was probably the most we could bear to have this project come to fruition, which is still challenging in this environment.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'We keep building and building right next to rail, not always addressing the access issues so that if there is an incident with the various types of material, mostly flammable liquid that are on the tracks, the railroads need to be able to have access to the tracks, and so do our emergency responders, because they're also expected to show'",
        "'speaker_7': 'up and contain a situation. These are also adjacent to storage yards. Not only is it close to where some of the trains turn around, but it's very close to where a lot of the trains are staged, meaning they sit in the you know, in these areas.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I don't know if this particular development is anything like some of the others in the area that have roll up windows like garage doors where they can sit and overlook the train tracks. That's an accident waiting to happen.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I am not sure, you know, if this developer, even with a 40 foot setback, is looking at any additional kind of buffering. But. Those are some of the details that we want to make sure are being addressed by our agencies as well as by the developers of these projects.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And when we tried to pool data to find out what kind of input we had from the agencies and what actual improvements or how they were addressed by the developers, there was no data. We could not find any information.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so what that says to me, and in the conversations with CPD, basically they said they didn't have anything that holds the agencies feet to the fire to make sure that these issues are being addressed. So what that means is when you let it be done voluntarily, it doesn't happen.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I think we need we're at the stage where it's been two and a half years since we did this study and have had very clear recommendations for trying to see that these issues are being addressed. And I you know, in pulling the data, there's there's nothing to be seen.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so I think we're at a stage where we have to do an ordinance which we're working towards. I don't think 40 feet is is adequate in protecting life, but I'd have to see the development plan and the fact that there is no development agreement.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I don't know how we as a city hold feet to the fire on ensuring that the 80%, the 10% at 80%, which you know anymore, that's not addressing the affordability needs in our city. And I don't know why our city keeps negotiating so high instead of trying to get more affordable, truly attainable units for so many people'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Yes, thank you. Council President. So in the plan, in our packets, it talks about one of the adopted plans being an affordable Denver. And I think that we could all read that plan and pick and choose pieces that would go with any rezoning.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so today I got a very thoughtful text message and it said there can be no equity of opportunity in the United States so long as poor children are segregated in neighborhoods. And there is only one viable solution building affordable housing in affluent neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And Reno has turned into a very affluent neighborhood since I was born. So with that, I think that we can pick and choose any adopted plan and we can make pros and cons. And I would say that if I looked at building an affordable Denver that are 10%, although it is somewhat generous during this time of COVID'",
        "'speaker_3': ', I think all bets are off. I think everything needs to be reevaluated. I think our entire infrastructure needs to be reevaluated. I think housing projects that were once moving forward before Monday, March 16th, need to be evaluated because we will be getting out of COVID on the backs of my grandchildren.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so with that, I cannot support this rezoning and do so for public record. I do know someone who represents this neighborhood and the applicant did meet with them and they did give them their equity plan. And this is someone who I trust and I have worked with since 2012, and they recommended 30 units at MMI and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the applicant disregarded them. And this person has worked and represented this community and fought for global variance frontier for as long as I can remember. So with that, I will not be supporting this application. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. President. And I absolutely agree with everyone's comments about our great need for more housing and more attention paid to our equity plans of our neighborhoods. Unfortunately, we don't have the tools to require this now. We all know there was an.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Offered at the state legislature to pass a bill that would allow municipalities to require developers to put in a certain number of affordable units. But we don't have that law right now. It it didn't make its way through the state legislature before they temporarily adjourned.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so we actually don't have the tools to do that. I look forward to it coming back next year and hopefully it will pass. Our job is to look at the criteria, and I believe that.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Get it going. All right. May I ask the applicant to come forward? I just want to. I have one question about. You had mentioned the I think it was about the Reno Arts District. I think the comment was it is better to have it here than on the other side of the tracks.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'What's on the other side of the tracks? Yeah, let me address it. That I thought you might mean the tracks right behind the site. Well, we heard time and again from a number of constituents in the district was that if we're going to concentrate development, it's better here where you're surrounded by raw land and other apartments than'",
        "'speaker_5': 'went out to the other side of tracks. I mean, Blake Wilton, Larimer, the other side of Reno, where there's been rapid gentrification, as there has on our side as well. But on that other side is where you have a little more history.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There's historic buildings that maybe they're not deemed historic, but it could be argued they should be in here with a self-storage facility. We just kept hearing time and again that, well, where where is it in Reno? And we'd have to explain where exactly it was.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Honestly, some of the constituents were not fully aware this is within Reno. And so that's what they meant when they said it's better that you concentrate on development and growth in this high residential area as part of the 2040 plan than others.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. Thank you. I'm glad I misunderstood my I when I was growing up. I grew up poor and I literally grew up on the other side of the railroad tracks. And so I was like, he couldn't be saying what I did.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. There's no requirement because one of the criteria is that 2 to 1 of our goals is to increase home ownership. There's is there a commitment that the owner will move back and occupy this as an owner occupied site?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Is there a requirement to do that?'",

But is that not one of the express reasons why we should have to use or why we should allow or why we would allow it to use?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah. So typically in order to if you want to preserve buildings, usually our route is a conservation overlay or something of that nature. 80 use, I think are a better way to allow people to stay in their homes and that could be an existing home or stay on their property.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'So we asked him to reach out to his neighbors. And we got one letter of opposition, because the area around Sloan's Lake has changed from one unit to two unit on the South Side, and redevelopment really occurred. So people were are nervous about accessory dwelling units going in there.'",

And I've mentioned it before, but I'll go on record again saying that I'm going to be rezoning an entire neighborhood, 1400 doors coming up soon to allow accessory dwelling units and now systematically go through all northwest Denver doing that'",

I use a wheelchair obviously, for mobility. And and so I totally recognize that it is hard to find a unit that is wheelchair accessible unless it is purpose built for accessibility.'",

If you want to go after that neighborhood in 1400 units and and legalize it use citywide I'm on board I've said that every other time that we've had any ADA discussion and I was wondering if there was something different'",
        "'speaker_5': 'in this discussion that was additional information. But but that doesn't affect my consideration. I believe the area should be legalized citywide. This is yet another example of where I'll be supporting it. Thank you. Thank you. Council Member Sandoval.'",

Denver and then Housing and Inclusive Denver. So the rezoning is consistent with several of the strategies in the comprehensive plan.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's consistent with the strategy for equitable, affordable and inclusive by creating a greater mix of housing options in every neighborhood for all individuals and families. And it will promote an environmentally resilient Denver by promoting infill development or services and infrastructure already exist.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And Blueprint. Denver The future neighborhood context is urban. This is small multi-unit and a mixed use area is embedded in mostly one unit and two unit residential areas. The block patterns are regular with alley access and there's a high degree of walkability.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The future place type blueprint is low residential. This is predominantly single and two unit uses with accessory dwelling units are appropriate. The future street type for Julian is Local Street, which is mostly residential uses, and then 26th Avenue is a residential collector.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The growth area strategy and blueprint is all other areas of the city. This is where we anticipate to see 10% of jobs and 20% of housing by 2040. And it also meets policy for which encourages diversifying housing choice through the expansion of accessory dwelling units throughout all of residential areas in the city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then in housing an inclusive Denver that encourages expanding the development of accessory dwelling units to incentivize affordable and mixed use housing as a wealth building tool for low and moderate income homeowners. So the proposed rezoning is consistent with the recommendations in the Comprehensive Plan Blueprint Denver and Housing and Inclusive Denver because it will expand housing options'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and allow the development of an accessory dwelling unit. Staff also finds that the requested zoning means meets the next two criteria. The rezoning will result in uniformity of district regulations, and it will further the public health, safety and welfare of the city by implementing adopted plans last year.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The staff finds there is a justifying circumstance for this MAP amendment, but the newly adopted vision and blueprint Denver for accessory dwelling units in all residential areas. Lastly, the proposed zoning is consistent with the urban neighborhood context residential districts and the USC to be one zoned district.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So therefore staff recommends approval based on the review criteria. And that concludes the staff presentation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. We have not received any written comments on Council Bill 107, but we do have one individual signed up to speak this evening. Jesse Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Good evening, members of council. Those in the audience. Those watching at home. My name is Jesse Paris and I ran for city council at large last year, got almost 15,000 votes with no money. And I'll be running to be your next mayor in 2023.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And so system is just for the poor people of a profit. And I'm representing for Denver homeless out low black star action movie for self-defense, positive action camera for Social Change, as well as the Unity Party of Colorado and Mile-High News.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'This one is pretty cut and dry. I'm thinking about this. I would like to know, is the occupant going to continue to reside at this residence or is this going to be another scraped unit like the previous rezoning?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And also, is this for elderly or disabled person? If someone could please answer those questions are greatly appreciated. This already meets all the criteria, so there's nothing I can say that's going to change that. So I know you're going to approve this.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So go right ahead. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you. That concludes our speakers on this item. Are there any questions from members of Council on 107 over here? Oh, Count. Thank you. Club member can each.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Hi. Thank you. I wanted to actually.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Ask a clarifying question.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's relevant to this one, but something you said. You mentioned that the owner had to be living in the house to file the permit. So I have never seen that in the zoning code. I'm aware that there is a requirement for it to be owner occupied.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If you want a short.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Term rental license on the ADU, I'm aware that there's an owner occupied building permit. I was just looking that up, but I have never heard a zoning requirement. In fact, there are, I believe, in Denver today, situations where both the front house and the 82 are being rented.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I wanted to give you a chance to clarify why that would be a requirement for permitting, because you mentioned in the prior one that the owner had to attest that they lived there to get the permit. And that is not my understanding of the zoning code.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So help correct.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Me. Yeah. So I believe it's in the limitation section of the zoning code. I don't know the exact section off the top of my head, but I'd be happy to get it for you and send you that section later.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah. If you can do that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And is that universal to all zone districts?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. Yep. It's it's applicable to if someone has an accessory dwelling unit on their property.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Any other question on this item? Doesn't look like it. The public hearing for Council Bill 107 is now closed. Comments by members of Council Council members. And while this one is in your district again, did you want to go first?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. So I will start off by once again. The owner, Liz had a pre-application with CPD in late July, shortly after I took office and we had a meeting with them August 6th, and Liz and her husband were expecting their first child and wanted to stay within the neighborhood and their last configuration was they could not'",
        "'speaker_3': 'expand, so they wanted to do an accessory drawing unit. I asked them to do outreach to their block and find out if anybody else would be interested because as I mentioned, I am tired of these one offs, so I would like to do it in a more holistic fashion if we could do it block by block if'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I have to. And unfortunately, at that time, no one was interested in adding to this application. So with that, we have not gotten have received any comments or feedback from them. They did come back, circle around and showed us that they had garnered support from all of their neighbors.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And normally I don't ask the neighbors across the street. I asked them specifically to talk to the neighbors in the alley who will be impacted by the construction of the ADA, because it's really the alley neighbors who are going to be impacted.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And they did. And they showed proof of that. So with that, I would ask that all of you support this application this evening. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Anybody that I missed, I want to say thank you to staff for putting this together. I think this clearly meets the criteria and we'll be supporting this evening. Madam Secretary, roll call.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sandoval Black. See the burqa.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Eye for.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'An eye.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Gilmore. I heard it. Hi. Hi. Cashman. I can ask Ortega. I saw you. I Torres. I council president.'"

Adopts the amended Future Places 2020 Plan Map in Blueprint Denver 2019, a supplement to Comprehensive Plan 2040, to reflect a change in the Overland Park Neighborhood in Council District 7. The Committee approved filing this item at its meeting on 3-10-20.": [
        "'speaker_0': 'Hi, Madam Secretary. Please close voting. Announce the results. 3939 as comfortable 107 has passed Council member say debacle you please put council bill 228 on the.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Floor I move that council bill 20 dash 22 to 28 be placed upon final consideration and do pass.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. It has been moved and second in the required public hearing for council bill 2 to 8 is now open. May we have the staff reports?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. Thank you. Got the president council members Dave Gaspar, who's principal city planner with community planning and Development. Let me just switch out our presentation here quickly. With a blueprint. Denver Future Places 2020 Plan Map Amendment. And so with the new blueprint, Denver, there's two major ways to update and evolve the plan.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Neighborhood Context and Future Places Map. And so one of them is how we're typically more familiar with, I would say, and that's with a small area plan such as an MPI plan like for Northeast or a master plan like the Stadium District or Lateral Heights.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Those are three small area plans that were adopted Post Blueprint Denver in 2019. And we typically see slight map changes when we do a small area plan, such as those with the new blueprint. Denver We did propose this consolidated updates approach, which directs CPD to exploring it and approach to update the Future Places map on a regular'",
        "'speaker_11': 'basis. And so that's found on page 59. And in fact, we had an opportunity to do that right away here in 2020 with this proposal, which is in District seven. And so this could either be a CPD led process where we identify something that is amiss with the map and want to make a change, or could also'",
        "'speaker_11': 'be brought to our attention by city council. And they could lead the process to to update that, that map. And so I'll run through the city. The Council district led process will be very similar, of course, with the city, except the responsibilities more rely upon the council district office itself to engage the community.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And so in this instance, District seven identified a possible map change in Overland Park. And I think this could be brought to this attention through neighborhood groups, business districts, property owners, etc., in this case. District seven really noticed it somewhat on their own.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It was little bit too late in the Blueprint Denver adoption process, but they had heard for several years that property owners and residents in the area that may be that a more mixed use industrial designation made more sense.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We just didn't catch it in the initial adoption of Blueprint Denver. So District seven brought that to CBD attention and we were able to utilize that as a pilot program to develop the process to do this annual update of the map outside of a small area plan.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So what we have in front of you tonight here is this Future Places Map Amendment proposal in Overland Park, generally bounded by west Louisiana on the north and west, Colorado to the south, the right of the railroad, right of way to the west and Broadway Acoma Alley to the east.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And it is a change from value manufacturing in the future. Places map to innovation flex in the future. Places map critical here. This is not a zoning case like you, just the last three cases in front of you.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'This is just a change to the map in Blueprint. Denver Right. So there's no entitlement that is attached to this directly. And you'll notice there on the slide that the change from value manufacturing to innovation flex is there both in the district, uh, column there and are adjacent.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It's a relatively minor change. There is an important difference there, though. The Innovation Flex does allow residential component, which the value manufacturing currently does not. And so CPD has developed some considerations to to review a proposal such as this.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'First of all, the timing of future and recent small area planning in the neighborhood, very important that we're not trying to kind of circumnavigate the need for a small area plan. And timing is the first thing we want to review there.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So there has been no recent plans done in this area and it is not identified in any of the near-term next NPI phases. Secondly, as I mentioned, you shouldn't circumnavigate that need first malaria plane. So we want to look at the scale and complexity of the request that is in front of us in this situation to maintaining'",
        "'speaker_11': 'the manufacturing uses that are in it. But it does not add additional places. So it's a it's a simple one for one designation, right? We're not multiplying and and making it more complex. The geography is about five blocks in size, which is not typically the size and scale that a small area plan would would require and appropriateness'",
        "'speaker_11': 'to adjacent future places. There is adjacent community corridor and center places that allow the mixed use residential development, which would be the new component of the innovation flex. Also when look at the overall impact on completing creating complete neighborhoods, meeting the equity concepts and citywide population employment projections in Blueprint Denver And so with complete neighborhoods, this does'",
        "'speaker_11': 'allow the residential component, the key equity concepts, the scoring is in the middle essentially across all of those different categories. Of course, any large scale rezoning zoning would be subject to a full equity evaluation and the growth strategy.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'There's new jobs in housing could be directed to this location, which is not included in a manufacturing preservation area. That's another key aspect here. This is a manufacturing district, but it was not included in the manufacturing preservation areas identified in Blueprint Denver.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The third step is engaging the community on the proposed future place map change. So District seven hosted two community meetings back in November. Written notice was done consistent with the larger development review process. We had around 40 attendees at those two meetings and overall comments were very supportive.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We did have an accompanying online survey, 19 responses strongly supported the survey. There was no dissenting responses and neighbor outreach district seven flier the area and in your packet Overland Park Neighborhood Association did send a letter of support.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So at that point when we have that engagement process and we feel like we can move forward with this council, District seven submitted the future place map change to CPD officially and we incorporated it into our process of the annual report, which we are in front of the Ludy subcommittee in early March.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So staff does find that that the blueprint Denver 2020 future places map amendment using an inclusive public process is consistent with comprehensive plan 2040 and the plan takes a long term view and staff recommends approval.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. We did not receive any written comments this evening, but we do have one individual signed up to speak in person. So if you would, David, create a little space there. And Jesse Pearce, you are a.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Oh, good evening. Members of council, those in the audience also watching at home. My name is Jessie, the sound person. I ran for city council at large last year and I got almost 15,000 votes with no money. And I'll be running again in 2023 to be your next mayor.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I'm representing for Denver Homeless out loud, black star action movies for Self Defense, Positive Action for Member for Social Change, as well as the Unity Party of Colorado and Mile-High News. So all this is. A change in what is being displayed.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'For the Overland Park in reference to this comprehensive plan 2040. I guess I can support this. I see now that it's an opposition and I didn't see anything that made me want to question this so much. My question is what?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Why is this so essential? And if this doesn't pass down, where. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. That concludes our speakers this evening. Are there any questions from members of council? Councilmember Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yeah. Dave, would you mind coming back up? How many property owners are within that five block area?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I don't have an exact number on that. And Council District seven may have a better estimate. I'm not for certain.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You know, we fly every single place, but I don't have that number right in front of me. It has been many months since we fired all of that, so I apologize.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Are there any single family homes in the area or is it all strictly.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Know it is. It's a fascinating part of Denver that looks like it. It sprung up before there were any rules. And so you have single family homes, you have warehouses, you have everything you could kind of imagine happening all in that area.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And sometimes one of one single family homes, sometimes a row of four or five. Okay. But that yeah, that was one of the things that came up at the community meetings was people were people who owned the single family home saying, hey, we're not even allowed to do this technically under this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And this mapping does, you know, provide some residential options, not just industrial options.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yeah, I know. One of the challenges is if you're in an industrial area and you want to get a mortgage loan to do some upgrades on your home, your bank typically is not as excited to loan you money.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We had that problem along the 13th Avenue corridor sometime ago before they had part of their area resold. So I guess I was just trying to understand what percentage of the property owners are actually on board. It sounds like you did an extensive outreach effort of the two meetings, generated 40 people, but just not knowing exactly how'",
        "'speaker_7': 'many of, you know, property owners are within that area, it's it's hard to really gauge what that yeah. The participation rate was.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And there are also there are lots of parcels. There are some large landowners who own lots of different stuff over there. And, you know, I think that the it's always hard to get people to engage, especially in something that doesn't actually change anything on the ground.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There's no change in zoning. There's no change in current uses. It does not change anything for them today on what they have at all. And so most of them got the information they wanted and then were like, This doesn't actually change anything for me.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So, so didn't provide a lot of feedback beyond that. But again, we were satisfied that everyone who we could get to provide comments that we didn't have anyone saying that they were opposed to it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And it sounds like it just creates the opportunity for more flexibility in what can happen in the future by changing the the designation for this area.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, the only thing that changes is on the future places map. So it is only things that could happen in the future and only with further action from this body for those things to even occur. So this is like a precursor that still, again, doesn't change a thing on the ground for any of these property owners today'",
        "'speaker_0': 'other than what they might come in front of us for someday. As this area continues to develop with the light rail stations and in the light rail plans that have been adopted, this is the space that was in the gap between the Evan's Light Rail Station area plan and the Broadway stationary plan, which had robust engagement of'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the community of what they wanted and built a vision that just had a gap because that wasn't an overland plan. It was two different stationary plans.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. The only other thing I want to just suggest is that if and when you get to that next phase of talking about changes in the actual zoning that allow something different to happen, that the railroad conversation and the safety issue is front and center in all of that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Because what happens is as the development occurs and abuts adjacent to the tracks, you start seeing all this density and those neighbors start screaming about what happens, what's in place if something happens to make sure our safety is being addressed.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So it is our responsibility as a city to make sure we're addressing that by the sheer fact that we're approving zoning changes that allow high density to go next to the tracks. So.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Absolutely. All right. Thank you, Councilmember. Are there any other questions? I don't see anybody. All right. The public hearing for Council Bill 2 to 8 is closed. Comments. Oh, did I miss you, Councilman Flynn? Yes, you did. I apologize.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We will reopen the hearing so that you can ask your questions and do it appropriately this time. Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. I just want to clarify the way I understand in reading through the staff report. David, that the primary change that we're looking at here is to include among the future places in this area, the possibility of residential mixed in with the industrial.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The light industrial.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That I just wanna make sure I'm clear on that.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That is correct. The value manufacturing right. That's today does not allow that. The zoning today does not allow that. And so change would allow a potential support for rezoning.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Until if this were not changed, if the mapping stayed the same, if someone came in and wanted to include a residential component in a rezoning application, we would have to say that that does not conform. Correct. So this is correct.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Now, any other questions before I close? All right. Public hearing for 228 is now closed again. Comments by members of council. This one's in my district and I talked to some of it during the questions. But again, just as a reminder, there are no this is no zoning change.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There are no new entitlements that come with this. This was something that as we were going through Blueprint, which was a multi-year process, we got to the 11th hour and look down at the map and in the office and we said, wait, that's not right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so we checked in with the neighborhood association with some of the business owners, and they all said, Yeah, that's not right. But at that point, it was too late to go back in to see Betty's credit. They said, Hey, if we're going to go back, we get that you guys are all saying that it's wrong and'",
        "'speaker_0': 'maybe it is, but let's have that conversation and let's have a robust process and give people the opportunity. And we don't feel like we have that time to do that now. So even if we get it wrong, let's get it wrong and then do it right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And and I appreciate your your, you know, walking us through the first of these, hey, we might have got something wrong. What do we do about that? The neighborhood association has been supportive. Again, no property owners who were opposed to this money and in strong support and many just wanted to know what was going on and got'",
        "'speaker_0': 'their information and then went on their way. And again, this is just an area that the default because when there wasn't a small area plan that specifically called that out, the default was to stick with what the zoning currently is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What the zoning currently is is not reflective of what is actually on the ground right now and certainly not reflective of the community vision that's been built in this area around the ovens and the Broadway stationery plan. This doesn't get us to the point where that vision starts to spring out of the ground, but that vision is'",
        "'speaker_0': 'closed without this change, at least to allow the framework that someday we might be able to see that vision come out of the ground. So I will be supporting this this evening, and I would ask all of you to support it as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Hines.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I want to thank Mr. Jaspers for your work on this. You are one of the many Denver city employees that I have worked with in your capacity before I was even a candidate. So you and I conversed about Blueprint and who better to fix up the little guessing errors on Blueprint than you?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Who was the principal liaison between the Blueprint Committee and the city of Denver? So thank you for all your work. Again, thanks to the city attorney's office as well. And thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember. And I will say amen to that. And if anyone else finds a problem on their map there, there was a lot of hand-hold it needed. And you were very gracious in holding my hand through this process and helping figure it out.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So thank you for all your work and your whole team who helped out with this. So I'm missing anybody. I don't see it. So, Madam Secretary, roll call on 228.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Black. See the broker. Friends. I feel more. Herndon High five Cashmere High Kinney Ortega High Sandoval High Sawyer Torres High Council President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'High I'm secretary Please close voting announce the results.'"
