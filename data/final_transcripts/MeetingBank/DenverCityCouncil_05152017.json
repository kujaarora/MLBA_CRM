        "'speaker_4': 'Absolutely. I'd like to welcome back up to the counselor podium and Nancy Steinfurth, who is the E.D., the executive director of the Liver Health Connection, which has a great announcement that we're participating in. Right. So go for it.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'That means baby boomers, Vietnam veterans, health care workers, police, fire, all those police officers who were here before, EMT responders, people who were transfused with blood plasma or RH factor. People who.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Received tattoos in unregulated settings.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Or people who shared needles or works while injecting. Let's face it, the list includes almost.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'All of us. I'm happy to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Say that there is hope for anyone with the virus, and that's because we have a cure that is up to 99% effective. So there's a lots of conditions, you know, this and that and the other 99%. They're very close to a treatment that is 100% effective.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So it's amazing the cure is cheaper than when they first were launched three years ago thanks to competition. So they're five different treatments and they vary by genotype.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We can help with.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Figuring out genotype, which one's the right one, etc. but it's amazing that they're now about $30,000 where originally the first drug was launched at.'",
        "'speaker_3': '84,000. So.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It was a lot of hard work. There are financial resources to help with co-insurance payments. So a lot of times under the ACA, people might have a co-insurance amount of $6,000. We know of some foundations that will help be able to pay that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So someone might end up paying $50 or $100 per month for their treatment. So when you think of 84,000 down to $150, it's worth it. And then Colorado Medicaid in October 2016 reduced their restrictions so that many more people can access treatment.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I can tell you that our colleagues at Denver Health are very busy, very, very busy. But they like that. They like being kept busy. The action that I offer is this liver health connection will be offering free hepatitis C testing in the web building on May 19th between the hours of nine and 3 p.m..'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So that's this Friday. We encourage everyone to come get tested if you've not already been so. Also, there is testing in four other Denver locations and that's at D cap 6260 East Colfax Avenue on a walk in basis.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's their new office. So it's three other locations. Hey, Denver, 1720, Pearl Street from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.. And then the Denver Indian Health and Family Service, 1633 Fillmore. From 830 to 4:30 p.m.. If this doesn't work for your schedule, you can call it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Contact us will test you at any time. Well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Not at midnight. Don't call then.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But it's. It's free and we will honor that. So whatever the risk factor is at our organization will test you for free. And then we will work with you on what the next steps are.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The test is simple.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's a little finger prick. So even Councilman Lopez can handle this. We can give results in 20 minutes, and then we'll walk you through. And all of these testing sites can walk you through what the next steps are, because this is diagnosing or coming up with antibodies.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that is not the final test in all of this. It's also possible to call a liver health connection 800 5224372 to find a treating physician actually anywhere in the country. But we'll focus on Denver right now. Financial assistance or to understand test results, we are available to help people along every step in the path to being'",

        "'speaker_1': 'The story of your grandfather and all of the council members for advocacy on behalf of this important issue. So for World Hepatitis Day, we're also doing a testing event on the 16th Street Mall, and I believe it's from 10 to 1 or two.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Yes. Thank you, Mr. President. So on 320, I just wanted to make this comment. For the past couple of years, the Colorado Coalition for the Homeless Association has wanted to receive funding directly from the funder as a grant moneys instead of through Denver Human Services.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So DHS has decided to permit the entire funding amount of the grant to go directly to state CCH instead of DHS keeping 2% of the grant funding for administration and processing. So this amount must now be used by CCH for direct client services.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'I will. Thank you, Mr. President. This raises a couple of questions in my mind, because when this went through committee, I believe it was about consent. Chairman Mr. Chairman.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I believe so strongly.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So usually when the amount of the contract changes, there has to be a new filing number and we have to do an amendment. But the way I understand this, we didn't actually change the amount in the contract. It was just incorrect in the description we were given.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And, Mr. President, it's a problem for me when we when we're looking at things on consent and looking at the descriptions and we don't have the full body of the contract yet to understand that that's not the amount of money that we approved.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I do have a couple of questions on this, but I don't know if anybody is here from Human Services who can.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh, yeah. We have Ron here.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Hello. Way in the back.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Hi, Ron. Why why are we changing the policy and how how long is that 2% been in place?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Well, that 2% has been in place for quite some time. I don't have the exact number of years, but traditionally we have taken about 2% out. It's often been a little bit less than that to administer that the grant and that means the processing of it as well as the monitoring of it that we do that the'",
        "'speaker_9': 'time that it went to Mayor Council, there were negotiations essentially underway to make a determination of what we should do with the Housing First grant should it go entirely to the vendor who has been receiving the vast majority of it, which is Colorado Coalition for the Homeless, or should the city retain it?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And the decision ultimately was made that the city would retain that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So the question I have is why then was it a mayor council if we were still negotiating it, why we put the cart before the horse?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Well, part of that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Would have been nice if we had known this.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes, Councilman, part of that is that there have been sometimes delays and being able to reimburse some of our vendors with these federal contracts or the federal grants, rather, the federal grants do allow backdating so that we can catch up.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so they actually because they are really inconsistent about delivering the funds. And so part of that was that the contract administrator wanted to try to move that through. What I had failed to do as one set negotiation had terminated was to update you all with the changes that were were made this afternoon.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes. The contract administrator noticed that the amount was different than what was in the contract.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay, I'm glad you caught it right before our meeting. But who is going to pay the processing fees and administration now? Are they not do we not have costs on this contract or are we going to have to cover that elsewhere?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Otherwise we do have to cover it. Essentially, we are going to have expenses associated with the contract, obviously with processing it and monitoring it. But the decision was made that to pass those funds through so that there was more service dollars available in the contract to the vendor.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So are we changing this for all such contracts now?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Not at this point.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Why this one?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'This one came to the attention of, I believe, council some of the council members that were approached by Colorado Coalition for the Homeless. And they had they had been advocating for at least a couple of years to receive the grant directly.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And my understanding is that it was basically a negotiation that that did allow the city to retain the grant so that we can ensure that those funds are directed how we want them directed in line with our goals around Denver's Road Home and the Office of Hope.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Mm hmm. And did we also change the scope of services? Did we add to the scope?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Only in as much as the 2% was now passed through directly to them with again, not having them use those funds for administration of of the grant of the funds. But but to go to direct services. So that was the in negotiation.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So is this a one time decision.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'For this for this grant? This is expected to be ongoing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'For this grant. Right. But for other providers, will we be doing the same thing?'",

I did want to chime in, because this is a contract that I did ask some questions about. And I think that like many contracts, it's not I mean, I don't want to throw the administration under the bus, but they often file'",
        "'speaker_3': 'audience requests while they're still finishing the text of the contract. It happens all the time. So that's actually not unique to this contract. We can debate another day whether that's a good or bad practice, but the goal is to keep things moving often so that either services continue occurring without interruption in work so that small businesses, nonprofits'",
        "'speaker_3': 'aren't expected to operate without being paid. So those are the the trade offs that we have. And, you know, I, for one, understand that there's a public interest in keeping things moving and not waiting until all of the ink is dry and every provision to file.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But but I hear the concerns about this coming down to the wire. So the two things I guess I want to add is I think this this grant is a little different. You mentioned that they get the vast majority of the funds, but there are no other subcontractors and there haven't been any subcontractors for many years.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Right now, this is an example of where in the past it's my understanding that this grant had to go to local government. It couldn't go to nonprofits. Is that is that accurate? So but the federal government changed that rule.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So here's the question. What if. You know, we we talk a lot about efficiency in our city, you know, so sometimes we have to accept money from the government and pass it on to providers, because that's the rule in this case.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There is a very clear set of criteria for this grant. There is one applicant who does who does that work, who manages these tenant vouchers. It has been the same contractor for many years, and they could, in theory, get this directly.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'They could, yes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So the question becomes, how do we justify to the public that it's running through us and that we're taking money off the top that isn't going to rental vouchers? So that's that's one compelling public interest question, right. In terms of the substance of the change.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The second thing I would say in terms of why I think it you know, I support the administration's decision to proceed rather than killing the bill and starting over is because it's my understanding we've had some concerns with timeliness of our own processing of payments.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It hasn't just been federal payments. That's correct. Okay. And so when that happens, we have a nonprofit who's left trying to cover the costs. And in perhaps cases, we might be in violation of some federal standards.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes, we when these grants come in again, they often, especially in the last 5 to 7 years, have become and very inconsistently ever since the Great Recession. And what we're able to do is, is we have some funds that the city council has approved of that allows us to cover those costs for vendors and to pay their'",
        "'speaker_9': 'invoices prior to actually receiving the federal funds this year, the grant came in more timely than before, but that that has been an issue for many of our nonprofits. And so with City Council's permission, we've been able to keep those services flowing, as you had mentioned, without interruption, by having a special fund that covers those costs until'",
        "'speaker_9': 'the federal funding comes in.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah, and I don't want to call the vendor out because again, I think this is one of those sensitive topics, but I think that the vendor would state that they are still not receiving timely payments in many cases.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So there is there is a genuine dispute here between parties and I think so. So I guess to just narrow it down, this is more my comment than my question, which is that two things. One, where there is no argument as to the fact that this is the sole provider of these services, it's not appropriate for us'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to carve money off the top just for it to flow through us. The money should go to the folks who need it, which in this case are homeless individuals who need rental vouchers. And so to the extent that we may incur some administrative costs in passing that money through, I think that that's a fair trade for the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'fact that we've had some timeliness of payment issues, which I'm sure has cost the vendor on the other side. So if you consider that any good contract involves, you know, something on each side, we may be eating a few administrative costs for passing through, but they've been eating costs for our delays.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So in the in this case, I will just close by saying this. I'm going to support this contract this year. At this time, I think it's a you know, it's a tough confluence of factors. But I think it's important that we look at, again, what the compelling policy cases for not just allowing this grant to flow directly'",
        "'speaker_3': '. It is a very defined scope of services. We couldn't use these funds to build housing. We couldn't use these funds to do other things. So there's a very limited scope the federal government provides. And so the case that we have to pass through them, I think bears more discussion.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I hope that I hope that the city and the department and the and the partners. I can talk more about that so that next year you can kind of make a good case to us. If it's this narrow scope and we don't really have any say over how it's done, what's the justification for for all of'",
        "'speaker_3': 'this? Because it does cause delays in terms of clients getting their their services. So with that, I'll be supporting it today. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Flint. You wanna.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you? Yes, my friend. Just a quick follow up, then. Councilwoman, are there other raises the question this this contract went through on consent eight weeks ago. And so there's been a lot of time elapsed. And to have a change like this on the floor or actually about an hour before is disconcerting.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I'm wondering if it might be time to sit down, maybe in council and Chair Lopez's committee in Safety and housing. And homelessness prevention to discuss the process and try to keep it more linear. Instead of reaching back and making changes and and telling us about them here, it might work out a little better.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So. So, Councilman Flynn, are you proposing that we pass this bill and we for it and we go back and we have a conversation about future bills?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes, I do. I have no I have no desire to hold it up. Yeah. Today, I'm just trying to understand when. When I'm.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In last.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Minute pitches come at.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Us. Yeah, I'm in favor of that. I think the public it's important. The public should know this is for 240 units. Right. Rental assistance for homeless individuals. So we want to get this money on the street as soon as possible.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I'm glad I'm in favor of that. Councilwoman.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I just want to say I support the bill, but I also support the conversation about the fact that we really do need to have a broader conversation, not just on human services, but on contracts in general, because all too often we don't get complete information.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And, you know, when we look at the the documents that are filed there, the contracts aren't there. We don't see the level of detail that we get only when we ask questions. And so I think it's important for us and in I'll remind you that our procedures were changed that basically removed one week out of our process'",
        "'speaker_6': 'to be able to review documents. So we moved contracts now to two resolutions where we get to see them just one time. And so the fact that we're not getting complete information at the last minute, we're having to make scrambled phone calls to agency staff.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think it's a bigger conversation that we need to have. I would suggest maybe we do it in an operations meeting to figure out what, you know, where do we want to go with that?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, it sounds like two different issues. This this contract in particular in the future, which Councilman Lopez, I'm sure you're okay to bring in your committee and then operations. We can have a conversation around in general the information that we're receiving in all these contracts.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Okay. Councilman Espinosa. Yeah, I just want to sort of chime in. Wherever that ends up the subsequent conversation, I don't I think that whether the money can go or he can or cannot, I mean, it can go directly, but there's always an avenue for government oversight or something.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I mean, again, we're not talking specifically to that fund. I don't think in general we should be afraid of taking on some level of responsibility, considering how many funds go to this particular provider and all of our providers.'"

        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. I can just tell you, when I was there, it was done every year because you get annual allocations and there are certain categories. So for me it would be helpful to know what are we funding and who are the providers we've been funding.'",

    "AS AMENDED a bill for an ordinance amending the Denver Retail Marijuana Code and the Denver Medical Marijuana Code to provide for a waiting period before new applications can be received or acted upon within a 1,000-foot radius of a location where a license has been denied or an application has been withdrawn following scheduling of a hearing. Establishes a waiting period for re-application for a license for certain marijuana businesses that are denied an application or in certain cases when applicants withdraw.  The Committee approved filing this bill at its meeting on 5-1-17.  Amended 05-15-17 to clarify that the one-year waiting period for reapplication for medical marijuana center license or a retail marijuana store license in circumstances where a prior application was withdrawn after the setting of a public hearing on the application but prior to a final decision by the Director of Excise and License is measured solely from the date the prior application was withdrawn.": [

This amendment to clarify some wording that created a little bit of ambiguity as to when the clock started on that one year.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The intent is that the clock starts from the date of the withdrawal of the application and not any prior trigger as well. And so I ask that the folks, my colleagues on the council here support that that one technical change that changes nothing of of substance in the bill itself.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening, counsel. I appreciate being given the opportunity to make comment. I know this is Councilman Flynn's bill. My interpretation of that of that bill and of course, defer to Councilman Flynn is that any other applicant that wants to go into either that particular location or within 1000 feet, it doesn't have to be related to the original'",

        "'speaker_3': 'All right. The other question I had is, when I look at this, it says, if the applicant has withdrawn, they've set they've set a time for a hearing, but they withdraw it prior to the final action of the director.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'What if they set and set a hearing and then withdraw and. And suppose that the hearing, the neighborhood was in support of it.

        "'speaker_3': 'Sure. Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Councilwoman. The there are many options available to an appeal. If an applicant only merely has to has a construction delay or some other factor. Withdrawal usually isn't the option. What they would do is ask for a a continuation or a postponement of the hearing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There's plenty of other avenues available to do that. Usually you wouldn't see a person withdraw. The intent of this, though, as to provide a quiet period for the neighborhoods of one year. Unlike in the liquor code where there's two years for a denial because the neighborhood already will have gone through the stress, the conflict, sometimes the tension'",
        "'speaker_5': ', the effort, all volunteer of canvasing if an applicant withdrawals and then reapply a month or two later. All of that neighborhood effort, all of that neighborhood expense and volunteering is down the drain and they have to do it again.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So that's why this bill asks for a one year wait before they can reapply. But in the event that there's an issue with construction, the the avenue of recourse would be to ask for a postponement, which is something that's up to the director's discretion.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm sure it's happened before. I know it's happened. I know it's happened before.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's correct. It has occurred as an applicant. Ask for a postponement if the neighborhood was favorable.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Towards the location.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Oh, am I asking the wrong.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No, I just. Yeah, just wanted to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Is it? Is it? It could a could an applicant withdraw? Even though they had I mean, can they ask for a postponement if they had an unfavorable needs and desires hearing? They and Councilman Brooks thinks that David is the person to answer that.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I'm going to continue to defer to the sponsor on the answers, but I'd be happy to take a stab as well. The the in the situation you're describing, I think, Councilwoman, it's is probably very much in line with what Councilman Flint is anticipating.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'If someone has gone through having a hearing said it's a it's a contentious hearing, he's facing the possibility of denial. But the executive the director of excise license hasn't acted yet and then just suddenly withdraws it. Right. The councilman's intent in proposing this entire approach is kind of having put the neighborhood through the meat grinder for there'",
        "'speaker_5': 'to be a period of time before someone can reapply. In precisely that scenario, when there's.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Been an adverse experience at the at the at.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The public hearing. But the director hasn't quite acted yet. And again, I would defer to the sponsor if he he would like to add to that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I completely understand the reason for, you know, a delay of this kind to right the year delay. But what I've just heard that the applicant has a way to postpone if there's a construction delay or something like that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So he doesn't have to withdraw. Is that postponement option also available to the applicant who has received an unfavorable response from the neighborhood? And if it's if it's an option, isn't everybody allowed that option before the before the director makes a ruling.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And to clarify before kicking it back tomorrow. This bill doesn't address the postponement options that may exist under current rules and procedures and so forth. And Marley can address what those rules and ground rules are, but just how this bill doesn't affect postponement scenarios at all.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Marlee And I can say, just from having handled these types of hearings and worked with exiles for four years, that that never happens. For starters, once they go through the hearing, they don't try to withdraw an application. However, if if someone went through the actual hearing and went through that headache and then wanted to withdraw, we would'",
        "'speaker_3': 'recommend a decision would still be issued by the hearing officer and the executive director would still issue a final decision. So we would be back into the scenario of the two year cooling off period.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They did go through a hearing and were.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Either denied or, you know, in this scenario they would have been denied. It's the same law that we have for liquor, liquor as a two year cooling off period for a withdrawal. Correct. No. There is no no such cooling off period for withdrawal, only.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If after.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'A unfavorable hearing. Okay. So this is an additional obligation on a marijuana shot or contender, I guess it's not like the liquor law. That particular portion of it is not like the liquor law. Also, liquor is a 500 foot perimeter around the location.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So that's not like a liquor law either. Correct. Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you, Counselor Lopez.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, more of a comment, so I don't know.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilwoman Ortega, do you have a question?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Come mine is a comment on customer Lopez.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. President. You know, I. I do understand the line of thinking, and I do appreciate that the questions I mean, I'm only chiming in to speak because I'm very familiar with the with the hearing process when and when it comes to liquor licenses and liquor stores.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And and when you compare those with actual retail or retail marijuana code and and obligations that we have set, well, the regulatory obligations that they have set for them in front of them and have seen both hearings. This is definitely something that I support only because and there's a lot of ways that this is worked out.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And, you know, when when we said it was regulated marijuana like alcohol, there's a lot of things that are and there are a lot of things that don't to the benefit of the industry. And so as what what I've come to experience is that, you know what, we've we've we're actually regulating it, right?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We're regulating a substance, right. When we do it with marijuana. I mean, it's the liquor code is antiquated and there's a lot of problems there. But, you know, here we have a direct impact and we're able to count to 13 and and become more efficient.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I love my folks over here at the on the other side of the Civic Center Park. But. And try passing a bill over there to modify anything like this. And it's a three ring circus sometimes. And good luck if you can do it in that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I just wanted to say, this is good legislation. It's the right thing to do. Seeing an application get defeated.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Or.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Something like this, it takes a lot of work in the community. It takes a lot of work from the applicant, a lot of resources on their end. Think about it. They have somebody representing them at that. You know, it's it's a heck of an effort.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that cooldown, I think, is is a good nuance. It's a good opportunity for folks to, you know, recalibrate. And then it also allows any applicant and community to work together because for most of the part, most of the time, they're just little disagreements that people have kind of drawing themselves in their corner over.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And they really didn't have the ample time or the trust or the good faith on both sides to actually meet and confer and say, hey, look, this is something that we'd actually would like to work out and reach before it even comes to a hearing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So what this does is it allows folks to recalibrate. And in that recalibration, you actually have a better dispensary, a better license, and a community that actually has ownership over that process as well to it. And that's what the whole community process was designed for, is to improve where we lack on the liquor code.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Unfortunately, it takes a heck of a lot more over there to change. So being that I do support this moving forward, this is one of those times where I think this regulation is a lot better than what we do with alcohol.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilman Lopez. Councilman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I'm just making comments. I don't have questions, but I was at the agency meeting this Saturday. This topic came up. They took a vote in support of the amendment that Councilman Flynn was working on, including a discussion about this very point.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And they referenced an application in the Sunnyside neighborhood. This one was for liquor. It wasn't for marijuana, where an applicant actually withdrew their application as they were going through the hearing process and then turned around and refiled a new one.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And the concern is that the neighborhoods don't have the same resources that many of these industry folks do. And to scramble and get the signatures that are required to request a public hearing to organize the community, it takes, you know, a huge undertaking and particularly in neighborhoods that don't have the.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The organization that others have. And so I think this is a reasonable request, the fact that there is no cooling off period at all for marijuana. And knowing that we do have one for. For liquor only make sense and knowing the one for liquor is two years.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I don't know why we wouldn't support the same, but the request is for a year. So I'll be supporting this tonight. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This borrower.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Again, I would defer to Councilman Flynn if he wishes to comment. But let me just be clear that this has exact parallelism to the liquor code. On the issue of a case where the application went to a hearing and was denied based upon a finding of lack of needs and desires, from the standpoint that that does create'",
        "'speaker_5': 'a two year blackout, as Ms.. Budowsky indicated.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It is for a larger.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Radius than the liquor code, but it still has that same element.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'In cases where the application went to a denial. The the new element in this.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Bill is the other scenario where the application is simply withdrawn. That's only.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'A one year waiting period.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And only for the property in question, not for a larger radius. So again, I want to be really clear about the contents of the bill. Some of it is parallel to the liquor code and some of it is not.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And by the way, a good time to also say that under state law, you have a lot more discretion to set marijuana policy. A lot of what we live with in liquor policy is prescribed by state law, is immutable at the local government level.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But thank goodness on the end, on the marijuana side, we do have more policy flexibility to kind of blaze our own trail, as this bill illustrates.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Just a quick note. Amendment 64 that legalized retail marijuana said that it should be regulated similar to liquor, but it didn't say identical. So I wanted to point out that the differences are 1000 feet and 1000 feet was used in my bill, because a thousand feet is consistent with the separation from prohibited locations'",
        "'speaker_5': 'simply to be more consistent within the marijuana section of the code in the liquor code. The distance from of separation from prohibited locations, meaning schools, daycares, etc. is only 500 feet. Therefore, the cooling off period is but 500 feet in liquor.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I wanted to keep it consistent within the marijuana code and use the thousand feet basically on South Broadway. Councilman Clarke It's the difference between three quarters of a block and a block and a half. And I also want to point out that this provision, although it's not in the liquor code for a quiet period when one withdrawals'",
        "'speaker_5': ', I wanted to thank Councilman Lopez I'm sorry, Councilwoman Ortega, for bringing up the Sunnyside example. The prohibition on reapplying applies only to that location, not within a larger radius. And. And. Well, that. So that's it? Yes. It only applies to that particular location.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Another applicant can come in at that same address. The same applicant can't can come in at that same address. My hope and intent is that we will see what many of us up here have asked for and primarily Councilman Herndon have asked for more genuine community outreach and engagement and having cooling off periods where we do not'",
        "'speaker_5': 'have any right now. My firm belief is that this will encourage the industry to reach out in a more genuine fashion to neighborhoods so that they don't have to run the risk of incurring these waiting periods. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you. It has been moved and seconded. Madam Secretary, roll call on the amendment.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Flynn. Hi, Gilmore. I heard in Cashman. Kenny Lopez. I knew, uh. Ortega, I.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I'm sorry I came in a little late. I wanted to comment on the bill as a whole. Not the amendment. But I just wanted to quickly thank Councilman Flynn for bringing this forward, for finding this hole, for helping close this gap, having just gone through with the community of mine, petitioning and canvasing effort'",
        "'speaker_4': 'on a license, I, I did not realize or could not imagine what would have happened had this loophole been taken advantage of. But I'm very I'm thrilled that we're closing it. And thank you, Councilman Flynn, for bringing this word.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Happy to support it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Espinosa. I, too, want to thank Councilman Flynn for finding this and bring it forward, I think is evidenced by the support for extended hours that we just recently passed in my district and citywide. You know, the industry has proven to to sort of be capable of taking whatever we throw at it, being adapting to'",
        "'speaker_0': 'it and coming up with a better way forward. I think in those rare instances where you can't fine strike a balance and compromise the community, I do think it's a bit taxing to sort of have that ability to just keep trying it different ways.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'd much rather have a sort of negotiated compromise or this quiet period, so I think I'd rather see it two years, but one year is great. So with that, I'll be I'll be supportive. Thanks. All right. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. The president, just real quickly, a finding that there is no need or desire in the surrounding neighborhood for a liquor store or for a marijuana store needs to have a shelf life. You can't suddenly have a need or desire for a marijuana center two days after it was just found that you do not.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And that is the entire basis behind matching the liquor code with this quiet period, cooling off period. Thank you. And asked for yes votes.'",

We are reviewing this application for consistency against four adopted plans. Comprehensive Plan 2000 Blueprint Denver, the 41st and Fox Stationary Plan and the Globeville Neighborhood Plan.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The request is consistent with several strategies in Comprehensive Plan 2000, which is detailed further in your staff report, but it's primarily related to quality infill development, encouraging mixed use in transit oriented development, and identify areas where density and new uses are desirable.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Blueprint. Denver identifies this area as transit oriented development, which is described as a balanced mix of land uses with compact mid to high density development and walkable with active street edges. It is also identified as an area of change and the requested CMCs 20 zone district has provisions that provide for all of the things that are called'",
        "'speaker_1': 'for in the transit oriented development description of Blueprint Denver. Additionally blueprint Denver's Future Street Classifications. The site is directly adjacent to 39th and Gallup PAYGO streets, which are on designated local, but it will be primarily served by Fox Street, which is a mixed use arterial.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The Globeville Neighborhood Plan also has land use concepts in it. The subject site is outlined in the green box on your slide, and it is identified as transit oriented development. Again, it has descriptions very similar to a blueprint has in terms of mixed uses and mid to high density, walkable, pedestrian friendly areas.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The Global Neighborhood Plan also identifies recommended maximum heights and the subject site is outlined in the blue box on your side and is in an area that is called for it to be 20 storeys. So therefore the 20 zone district is consistent with the recommendations in the global neighborhood plan.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The 41st and Fox stationary plan also has land use and building height recommendations. The site is outlined in red on your screen and it is identified as a mixed use office slash residential use with heights of up to 20 stories.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This land use calls for employment services and residential uses within walking distance of the station. The CRM x 20 zone district would provide for the allowance for this type of development, and the 20 storey maximum height is consistent with the heights called for in the 41st and Fox stationary plan.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Therefore, the recommendation is consistent with the 41st and Fox stationary plan recommendations. Therefore, CPD finds that the rezoning is consistent with adopted plans. Do you require recommended? Rezoning would result in a uniform application of the CMC's toe zoned district and it would further the public health, safety and welfare primarily through the implementation of adopted plans, but also'",
        "'speaker_1': 'because the requested zone district would allow for pedestrian friendly development within areas close to transit, making transit more accessible, which contributes to the public health, safety and welfare. The justifying circumstances identified in this application are changed or changing conditions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And given the opening of the 41st and Fox station station area and other rezonings to similar zone districts in the area, we do find that there are change conditions to justify a rezoning. And the request is consistent with the neighborhood context and CMCs 20 zone district purpose and intent.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Therefore, CPD recommends approval based on finding that all review criteria have been met. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening. My name is Tim Schlichting with LCP Development. Our business address is 2150 West 29th Avenue in Denver. My private residence is in Aurora. Thank you for the opportunity to speak and for considering our application this evening.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Schlichting. All right. Questions by members of Council Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So my question first is for staff. I'm sorry. Your name? Sarah. Sarah. Sarah. Has there been conversation with this applicant and other applicants on Fox Street about any expectation from the city to participate in helping address the 38th Avenue Fox, a 25 Park Avenue interchange?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And if not, what are we doing as a city as we continue to? Be asked to approve high densities in this area, to look at that interchange and not wait until all of the development happens. And then we're stuck dealing with a mess that we can't, you know, we have to deal with.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So can you is that something that comes up either with the applicants? And I was going to ask the application applicant the same question. If you've had this conversation with CPD as you've talked with them.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sure. And I can let the applicant say if they've had any discussions, but I can speak to some of the area wide mobility concerns in this. So the 40 person block stationary plan does have mobility and infrastructure recommendations in it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Recommendations in the plan that have already been implemented include a pedestrian and bike bridge over the rail at 41st Avenue, the anchor street pedestrian bike bridge over 38, the Anchor Street Multi-Use path from 30th 45th and the 38th AV underpass improvements.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You know, when additional development increases, demand mobility projects will be constructed in accordance with the stationary plan as funding is available and several mobility projects in this station area are being considered for the geo band process that's going through right now.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So that's what I have to answer the question more specifically about the interchange. I don't have anything specific related to that one.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I know we have a lot of folks who live at the Regency that move back and forth to downtown. I don't know how many of them are trying to walk through Park Avenue, but that interchange, as we see it built out, as we see Fox Street built out with the projects that have come through here and requested'",
        "'speaker_6': 'very high densities. I'm concerned about pedestrian safety for more and more people who were selling it as a TOD site. We're going to encourage people to walk. I think to get to the west will be great because you do have the bridges, you've got the 30th Avenue underpass for people that want to go up to Highlands or'",
        "'speaker_6': 'any of the businesses on 38th Avenue. But for traffic that's wanting to move across under I-25 and into downtown, I think it's going to be a nightmare of an interchange. And so I'm just concerned that we're approving all or we're being asked to approve all of these applications without having any context of what's happening or what we'",
        "'speaker_6': 'will create to happen as a result of our actions. And so I'm. I just think it's important to be raising this so that we don't wait until it's a problem. And to my knowledge, that intersection is not in the bond issue.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I can remember when the Regency Hotel was used as a nightclub, and it used to cause traffic to back up on I-25 on a on a weekend basis every weekend. And so when you start adding the volume of traffic and yes, it's a TOD site, but many of those developments are going to have parking and people will'",
        "'speaker_6': 'still have their cars until we become a true, multi-modal city. And so I'm just a little concerned about that. So I just wanted to ask that question and make sure that we're being very cognizant of what we are creating.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I know that at this particular location we've got the the buffer of the RTD train from the cargo traffic. So the issue of, you know, how do we address proximity to rail and ensure that we're protecting life and property, I think is.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Will be addressed as a result of, you know, the buffering that's already there. But I just wanted to raise that issue because I think it's something we're going to be dealing with and just want to ensure that CPD is having this conversation with the applicants that are coming into the area, that are requesting huge densities and want'",
        "'speaker_6': ', you know, and yeah, it's what was planned for in the community engagement process. But so I just want to ask the applicant if you want to add anything further.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Sure. I don't I know I don't have an explicit answer to your question about what the impact on the, you know, that interchange will be. I do share your concern. When we're you know, we're still evaluating different, you know, development alternatives.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So when we come forth the site development plan at that time, we would have a traffic study done and see how that, you know, based on the density that we'd be bringing at that time, how, you know, what the impact would be on that and that intersection.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I will I will tell you, you know, I can't make any promises along these lines, but I would tell you that as an initial project in that location is a first, you know, kind of a first mover, if you will, to to really bring a significant amount of private developments.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That location. I don't think that the first project out of the ground will be 20 stories. There is precedent already with the property, the north, there's 12 on two sides, as Sara pointed out. But I would certainly if we're developing it, it wouldn't be a 20 story project.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And and we're in some talks with some folks that may either acquired from us or a joint venture with us. And those folks are also thinking along the lines that we are that is the first project in that location.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It wouldn't be 20 stories, but would would an eight story project have an impact on that intersection? It sure would. And until we know what we're doing, we haven't, you know, hired a traffic engineer to really, you know, kind of evaluate that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So but but definitely duly noted. We our concern as well.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. I appreciate your input. Can you just clarify that this is the same corner property that has the liquor store and the new pizza shop.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So that that is on the heart corner of 39th and Fox. Right. And then just to the west. Just to the west is what word still has a sign that's called power rental.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So you're immediately west of that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Immediately west. And then further west of us is Wagner Rentals. That's not the property. And then our property actually wraps and fronts on the it's definitely adjacent to the the RTD station. So it's kind of L-shaped a little bit.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. You. Councilman Ortega, Councilman Espinosa and the applicant, Tim could and I apologize because there's some redundancy in your your last answer. But I did have three questions and they sort of are linked. So are you familiar with the Gold, the Globeville small area plan?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And how do you intend to fulfill those plan recommendations?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The Globeville small area plan or the neighborhood plan?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The Neighborhood Plan, 2015.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah, I can't you know, I can't cited chapter and verse, but as far as I think, I think Sara touched on a number of the, you know, objectives of that to create a walkable, mixed use community. I think it calls for density around transit, which is why we think this is appropriate.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Our thought is that it probably would be a combination of of multifamily, residential housing and some street level retail. It doesn't benefit from some of the frontage on Fox Street that that the the crafty fox that was that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Councilwoman Ortega just asked about it is a little bit embedded there. So as far as a a retail type of a location, you know, it it probably doesn't have a it would have to be a destination type retail.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I don't know if we'd see a lot of you know, could be in street level retail but some I mean, certainly there is a really cool building in there. A lot of what we do is repurposing old buildings.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There's that there's one that we've really looked at as far as repurposing we think it'd be, you know, there's a lot of this happen in the city, but we think it'd be a really cool brewery and taproom. You know, no promises there.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But we're we're very interested in that type of a use. So we like to bring some kind of retail that would activate the street. We'd like to be very sensitive to pedestrian connections. There are a couple of vacated gallery both Galapagos and 40th alignments have been have been were vacated and are part of our property.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We're looking at bringing the street cred back through the property and dedicating that back to the city or make them private drives or private pedestrian ways. So we're you know, we're trying to to be very sensitive to what the plan calls for.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Maybe not specifically, but do you know what the different the differences in a closed developer, developable square footage both today with the existing use zoning and after the rezoning.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'What would. How much square footage would be allowable under the new zoning? We've had you know, we've had what density study done by an arc by Shiraz Atkinson Rockmore in an architecture firm here in Denver. And, you know, we kind of had them look at the low, medium and high kind of scenarios.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Not to scare anyone, but the high was up to upwards of a million square feet. And that assumed with some reasonable setbacks and some, again, would bring in some bringing back in through some streets. I don't I think that is the unlikely scenario.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I mean, I would I would probably put the density if I if I had to guess, if I you know, if I were betting today, I would say a full build out the density would probably be on the order of half that it might be a half a million square feet between multi-family, residential and commercial.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But until we've really nailed down a specific plan, you know, I can't I can't tell you exactly what that would be. I mean, where it is today under industrial I mean, kind of a right now, it's there's a lot of yard area, so there's not a lot of structures on it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But, you know, a typical density on an industrial project is maybe 0.3, 2.4 air. So I'd have to do that math what it would be, take the land area, times that ratio and then that's what. Not much. Yeah, right.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Not much. So.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then the fee that the city charges for rezoning is based on the square feet of the parcel. Do you know what the fee the city charged was in this case?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm sorry that you're talking about the linkage fee or the or the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The fee to you with your application.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Oh, I don't know offhand. We wrote that check a while ago.'",
        "'speaker_0': '60,000 or.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, it's a thousand for the first acre and 500 for any portion afterwards. And this is about two and a half, so, uh, 2500, roughly, maybe 3000.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. No further questions. All right. This concludes our speakers from four members of council public hearing of Council Bill 362 is now closed. Comments from Members of Council. Gentlemen. That's one other. Yeah, I might as well connect the dots.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm pretty sure you all sort of did the same math. But the fee, there's a certain amount of development right in industrial land that isn't a whole lot of a new development. And when we rezone to 20 storeys and we go somewhere upwards of 500000 to 1000000 acre feet, the city only charges a fee of 2500 K'",
        "'speaker_0': 'for that additional development rights. And in the case since I've been on council, we've done several of these rezonings in Globeville. And the problem is, is Globeville is an area with definite infrastructure needs, as Councilwoman Ortega was expressing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And, um, and if we don't have a way to sort of address that through the development process that falls back on the taxpayers to then pay for that infrastructure in a different way. And so I just want us to be cognizant because we haven't seen massive redevelopment, even though we've given granted massive redevelopment potential over there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There was a definite vision that was laid out in the Globeville plan, and it's sort of like everyone is. I've said it before. I'll say it again. It's a mexican standoff. Everyone's sort of waiting for that developer to sort of take that leap of faith first.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Um, and, and, and so it's just that what worries me is that when we do this, we grant this additional development, right? For 2500 square feet. That's more marketable land. And that money goes to the speculator that put the money down on the industrial land and then paid this fee, and then they hired consultants or did it'",
        "'speaker_0': 'themselves. But it's not a very rigorous process. Right. You just make the case the stationary plan lays it out for you. You just go in and ask and prove that it meets that intent and then you get this far.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so if the then property changes hands and it gets resold, that value gets sucked out of Globeville. And it could be in infrastructure, it could be in built environment, better architecture, better materials, or a flexible space down on the grade level or a grocery store that, heaven forbid, that we keep asking for.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so it's not this developer's fault. It's not it's our policies. It's our policies that create this sort of grant this this maximum flexibility with little to ask for in return. And it's just wanted to be cognizant because this is one of those things that I've been harping on, and I've tried to make the case in different'",
        "'speaker_0': 'ways, but I thought I finally realized, let's just let the normal course play out. And you see what that is, 2500 bucks, $1,000 per half acre or acre, anything less than an acre, thousand dollars. All you got to do with the application fee and then in the neighborhood plan and say, look, it supports 20 storeys.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's what I want. And and, you know, and so with that said, you know, you know, I'm not going to oppose this rezoning because I've supported many in Globeville. I have opposed mining Globeville as well. But I hope for the best.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I hope that you guys actually start giving us both buildings and infrastructure that are much, much needed over there. But to date, it hasn't happened except for the Salazar's small little the brewery and stuff that have gone in already.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'there and in review of the key, this is a total station area where we're intending to encourage both the vertical as well as well as horizontal mix of land uses for this area, encouraging housing that meets the needs of families, young professionals, students, housing, the elderly, etc..'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This is all in alignment with what Mercy Housing already does and wants to continue operating on the site as well. In addition to the land use recommendations, we also have urban design recommendations of which are including the maximum building height for the subject property.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'As indicated in this map, the subject property is recommended as a five storey maximum building height and as such the recommended or the proposed zone district of the Max five is consistent with this recommendation. So in moving along through the review criteria, CPD has found that this application is consistent with the adopted plans.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We also find that this furthers the regulation uniformity of district regulations. There's no customization occurring here. We're also finding that it is furthering the public health, safety and welfare. This is primarily done through the plan implementation as intended, but also we're enabling for some additional community serving needs to operate within the tot station area that are of'",
        "'speaker_1': 'need and also were able to improve the pedestrian environment by introducing a cmcs zone district that has different building standards such as transparency, pedestrian entries, all of these great features that enhance the pedestrian environment that the current beauty does not speak to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'With regard to the justifying circumstances, we find that not only the planning and construction and that a greater federal station area plan has justified this rezoning. We are also seeing many of the properties in the surrounding area pursuing rezonings and redevelopment in alignment with the station area plan.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And as such we find that the mixed use zone district is consistent with the neighborhood context zone district purpose Intent Office. Finally, CPD recommends approval on this rezoning, finding that all criteria have been met. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you. We have two speakers this evening from a column to the front here, Caroline Pirtle and Joe Levi. It's Pearl. You have 3 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening, everybody. Thanks for having us. We're just here to answer any questions that you might have.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Great. Thank you. I'm Joe. I'm going to I'm going to have to state your name and you know where you're from. Yeah. Just for the record.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sir Carolyn Pirtle. And I'm a senior asset.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Manager at Mercy Housing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I'm representing the ownership of Decatur Place Apartments where we're talking about right now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Sir. Levi.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. I'm Joe Levi with Azar Architecture.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Where we office on Larimer Street. And I just think we've heard all the the nice and how it's compatible in the planning sense. But really we're.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Providing a compatible use for the neighborhood. And there was no neighborhood opposition whatsoever. In fact, people welcomed that. So I just wanted you to know that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I'm here to answer any questions. Thank you. And you said. You said us architecture is okay. It's in the fine district nine. Okay, great. Thank you. All right, let me see. Are there any questions for members of council?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Just wanted to say that Oz was in District six for a good long time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, great. Councilman Cashman, you weren't called on in. This was all right. As you know, we've been going around tonight. The council, about three, six, eight public hearing is now closed. Comments by members of council. Councilman Lopez.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I do appreciate your time. I wanted to thank folks who are coming tonight and in presenting you know, we've seen this in we had the opportunity to ask questions, learn about the use that we're wanting to see at the at the mercy housing site out here.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Problem is, when they wanted to open up, move in, provide the service. They ran into this old stegosaurus that is a poodle. And we run into this so often. It's something out of the Jurassic period is this is just like we run into these little pods all over the place.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And, you know, the most embarrassing thing is this as opposed to the city as opposed as well, too. And so when we look at, you know, eliminating these pods and putting them right in the most appropriate zone district, this is one of them.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But this is also what this about. Yes. Tonight we're moving this, from what I'm understanding, moving this rezoning, adopting this rezoning would actually allow those services to be rendered. And, you know, the one thing standing in the way between health care for those residents in Sun Valley and us or in.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well. Is us basically tonight. This rezoning, this allows it to happen. The next eight weeks will see imx five and I said see a max eight. This IMX five allows this to happen, but it matches what's in the neighborhood as well too.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If you if you recall, not too long ago we had the Sun Valley neighborhood plan move through. We were able to implement a big part of it down here. And it does call for these heights. It does call for this particular use.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And in an area that is going to see a lot of change and but in an area that's also going to be able to keep these services here. Right. And so without further ado, I mean, I do support this rezoning.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I do appreciate all of your work. And Elise, who is now an expert in the West Side zoning affairs, totally gets it. So thank you. I do support this rezoning moving forward.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Lopez. Councilman Espinosa, just because I can contrast this to my other concerns about Globeville. This rezoning is occurring in a location where we already have the infrastructure or where it got definite plans to change it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Everything. All the reinvestment that's going in is Sun Valley. But we already have Rudy Rec Center, which is a fine regional rec center right across the street next to that Lakewood Gulch, which is a wonderful water quality slash flood protection class, 100 year dump into the Platte River sort of scenario.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we have a transit station right across the new court facility, a rail station and access to busses on a high frequency corridor on federal. And we're going five stories. And so I just wanted to complain people think that I'm against density and development or whatever.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This is a place that should be going to rezone. I mean, getting higher density than what we're doing. I am I know what we're doing in this case. And, you know, we're just capturing the correcting issue with the underlying PD and and correcting this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I just it illustrates sort of the disconnect between where we're having going from industrial to 20 storey without infrastructure and and not all the amenities that we have in this location and how we've prescribed a different sort of model this close to downtown, this close to our trail network, this close to our everything.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And it's just who's in charge of that sort of thinking of this city is is an organism in a water balloon and figuring out where we squeeze here and where we allow things here, there. I mean, you could argue that it's the market, but we're not our zoning is is just all over the place.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I mean, we're granting development rights where no one's building and we're we're making tweaks like this in areas where that should be that are getting they're already being targeted for earmarks. I mean, investment, the $30 million from HUD right across the street, the investment we've already done in that Platte Valley River Valley area.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And it's just it's just frustrating. But I'm happy to support this because it is the right zoning for this situation. But I do wish we were thinking bigger in the Sun Valley area because it's such a opportunity once we do that waterfront and everything else that we plan on the realignment of 12th and 13th and what have'",
        "'speaker_0': 'you. So just because of good things. Councilor LOPEZ Well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think that's an important point. Here's the thing. Part of the reason that this stuff can take place is because of those neighborhood plans. And I think that's what's critical. That's it's not just some plan that goes on a shelf and collects stars and say, oh, look how pretty this plan was.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We paid like $100,000 for this plan. No, actually, these plans are what allows this this design to take place. Right. That and that's exactly what we were pushing in that area. I mean, the good thing about Sun Valley, it's a valley.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So, you know, when you're looking down into the valley, those buildings don't look like they're five stories. They don't look it doesn't look like a Cinemax A.T.M. experience in this area. And you're going to be able to actually take a look at this and be like, oh, that's perfect.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Perfect height, doesn't block any views, doesn't impede sun. It's just it is. What is the the best thing about this site is that it already has been there. And you can chalk that one up to saw Carpio. You could chalk it up to Debbie Ortega, you could chalk it up to Julie Monteiro, all the folks that had'",
        "'speaker_4': 'been there representing that in Sun Valley, even Ramona martinez at one point, you know, that's what that neighborhood has been designed for and it's been decades in the making. So it is no walk in the park. It's just it is easier now because it was harder than the envision.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so that's that's why I started also thinking, I don't want to prolong anything.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Lopez. And I want to thank you all for mercy. You've done amazing stuff all over the city, so I appreciate you. And with that, Madam Secretary, roll call.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'LOPEZ All.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'New yes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'ORTEGA Hi.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Clark.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hi.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Espinosa.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'FLYNN Hi.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Gilmore, I. Herndon, I. Cashman can eat. Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I please close voting in US results. Lebanese Lebanese Council Bill 368 has passed. Congratulations. All right. On Monday, June 12th, 2017, the Council will hold a required public hearing for Council Bill 435 Changes on classification. 442 zero 140 203 4211 and 4221 Brighton in Elyria.'"
