        "'speaker_3': 'And. WHEREAS, the incidence of hepatitis C disproportionately affects minority communities. And. WHEREAS, 75% of infected persons do not show any signs or symptoms leading to the Hep C virus to cause poor health outcomes and be labeled as the silent epidemic.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And. Whereas, new drugs were approved that significantly increase the cure rate among hep C patients seeking treatment and even more effective treatments are on the horizon. And. Whereas, risk factors can be evaluated, evaluated, hep C can be prevented.'",

Whereas, Hep C connection is available as a local resource for education testing, linkage to care and support. Now therefore being proclaimed by the Council of the City and County of Denver.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Section one. The Denver City Council agrees that preventing and treating Hep C is an important public health initiative that will improve the quality of life for all Denver residents affected by the virus. Section two of the Denver City Council proclaimed proclaims the month of May as Hepatitis Awareness Month and recognizes July 28, 2014 as World Hepatitis Day'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. It's been moved and seconded. Comments by Council. Councilman Lopez.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Madam President. I have the honor, like I said earlier, to carry this proclamation every year. I think almost since for the last six years, I think six or seven years. The first year was traditionally Councilmember Garcia used to read this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'He was not here that day. So I took it up and it was his last. So I get to revisit this really cool proclamation. And I read this proclamation because hep-C is preventable. This is something that with education, with outreach, with access to the resources, we can prevent it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This is something that is a serious viral infection. This is something that kills a lot of people every year. And I read this proclamation because it killed my grandfather. My grandfather was a World War Two vet, served in Germany.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Born and raised in Colorado. And called Denver home every year after his after that, when he came back from the service, he was injured as the jeep that they were in when over a landmine, killed his buddies and injured him.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'He came to the hospital, needed a transfusion, a transfusion. And because he didn't screen then, he was infected by the virus and didn't show up until later and until they figured out that he had hepatitis C and just a few years after he was diagnosed with with liver cancer.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And my grandfather would be here today and my grandfather was like my father, he was the guy and man showed me how to be a man. He was a very honorable person. He grew up in Barton, lived in Barnum.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And if it were not for if it weren't for this disease, he'd be here. He'd get to see his great granddaughter and get a you know, perhaps maybe it stopped in at my campaign celebration when I was elected or when I walked across the stage at the University of Colorado to get my diploma.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Folks who were infected with Hep C and folks who are at risk need to have access to the resources, need to have access to education. We need to spread the word because like my grandfather, there are other people's grandfathers and other people's dads and mothers and daughters and brothers and sisters.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This is this does not discriminate. If we do not be careful, we don't pass the word around, it's going to be somebody else's grandfather or father or mother that's not going to be in the crowd when you get your diploma.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Right. So it is is a. Very seriously. I'm very happy to have sponsored this proclamation every year so that we can raise awareness about it. The Hep C connection has done a great job of getting the word out and more people to the clinic and more people to get tested.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's best to know your status is absolutely preventable. And so, Madam President, with no doubt belaboring the the point in the moment, I just wanted to thank folks for this proclamation and urge my colleagues to support it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Councilman Lopez. Councilman Leavitt.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Madam President. Councilman Lopez, I want to thank you for sponsoring this proclamation not just once, but every year, because after about the fifth or sixth year of you sponsoring this proclamation, I thought to myself, well, I was born between 1945 and 1965, and I've spent a bunch of time overseas, and I wonder if I've ever'",
        "'speaker_3': 'been screened for hepatitis C. So I went to my doctor and I said, if I have been screened for hepatitis C and my doctor said, no. I said, Can I see? Yeah. It's just part of ordinary blood work.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Got screened for hepatitis C and I don't have it. But nonetheless, I could have had it and I was in the risk group and so I don't have it. I'm happier for it. And if I did have it, I wouldn't have shown any symptoms.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But it could have been a big problem down the road. So thank you for doing this. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman Leavitt. And I just want to mention that the news about the cure for this is very exciting and glad to hear that and all the progress that they're making on this disease. I see no other comments.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So, Madam Secretary, roll call Lopez.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hi, Montero. I never.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I Ortega. I Rob. Shepherd. Brooks. High fat.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hi, Herndon. I can eat.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I lemon. Hi, Madam President. Hi.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilwoman. Thank you very much, Madam Secretary. Close a voting not so. Results 12 eyes. 12 eyes. The proclamation is adopted. Is there somebody you'd like to come up to? The bring up to the podium?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes, Madam President, I'd like to invite Nancy Steinfort, the executive director of the AFC Connection to the podium and whoever else I should introduce the folks who are here from the AFC connection as well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much. I am honored to once again speak to City Council about the importance of hepatitis C testing, especially among baby boomers. I'm also grateful to Councilman Lopez for being our champion and to the council members who co-sponsored today's bill, voted for it, and then were also able to include information in their e-newsletter about testing'",
        "'speaker_1': 'day. We tested approximately 40 people at the web building. In addition to that, I had conversations with at least five people. Two of homes. Husband had just finished treatment within the last couple of months and successfully cleared it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Someone else who had done treatment prior last year or so cleared it. And two other folks that are waiting for that opportunity and so still living with that virus. I'm hoping that our other ten testing partners have the same great results that we did.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That would be 400 people. I'd be I'd be really happy. Last year was our highest number of testing years. We tested 592 people. As you might imagine, baby boomers are kind of, I don't know, stubborn and don't feel that this necessarily applies to them.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So when you're trying to twist arms, it does get a little challenging. This group you most like most likely have heard that the latest treatment for HCV has a really hefty price tag. Even so, the cure rate is 90% and those results are amazing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We know that new treatments are going to be approved. Well, all right. I don't have a crystal ball with the FDA, but we think that they're going to be approved in November of this year and those results are going to be even better.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We also hope that the price will come down a bit so that they can give some competition, too, to the current drug maker. As baby boomers age, it will become more difficult to treat them because of the to the of the damage to their liver over decades of undiagnosed disease.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's why there's urgency and more and more initiatives. In fact, Governor Hickenlooper signed legislation today that strongly encourages medical providers to test boomers for the virus. Thank you very much for working with us to increase awareness about hepatitis C through this resolution and for facilitating our testing in the web building.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And now I'd like to ask Dr. Sarah Rowan to update us on her testing results at the Eastside Clinic.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Madam Chair. So I'm a physician at Denver Health. I work at the Eastside Clinic and Five Points Eastside is predominantly lower income and higher percentage African-American than the majority of Denver. We're funded through the CDC to do hepatitis C testing and linkage to care at Eastside.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we focus on the baby boomer cohort. We had a successful first year of our grant activities, so we expanded our grant activities to Parkhill Clinic, which has a similar demographic. In a year and a half, we tested over 2000 baby boomers.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's people born between 1945 and 1965 for hepatitis C, and 8% of the people that we tested had newly diagnosed chronic hepatitis C. It's a much higher percentage than almost anything else that we screened for in primary care except for possibly diabetes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Of those we screened, 171 people were newly diagnosed with chronic hep C. Most none of them knew that they had Hep C, 159 people had a post-test counseling session, and that's important for alcohol cessation counseling, for review of other vaccines to see if people need hepatitis A and B, vaccines and other healthy living tips for living with'",
        "'speaker_4': 'hepatitis C, we also refer people.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To their primary care.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Provider to get an evaluation for a.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Cold liver disease.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And after that, the primary care provider can refer them to a Hep C treatment specialist. So none of this is possible if you don't know that you have hep C treatments been limited because Hep C treatment's very expensive right now.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But as Nancy said, it's really promising. So we're very excited about the future for Hep C treatment. I think that concludes my responses or my remarks. I would also mention that of the 171 people at East Side in Park Hill Clinic who are newly diagnosed, it was a majority African-American, majority low income.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So this is a disease that disproportionately affects certain subgroups within Denver and I think gives us even more reason to focus on it. So thank you.'"

        "'speaker_3': 'Well, I'll live with it. I got to say, Jim McIntyre has been a pillar of integrity and rigor in the purchasing department, and that has stood the city and county in very good stead, because the the the purchasing process, particularly for big high dollar contracts, can be very fraught.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'People get very excited about it. A lot of money is at stake. And the process, the processes that Jim McIntyre has put together have withstood all the slings and arrows that could be thrown at it from all of the disgruntled bidders, and they've always stood up.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Well, I guess it could be worse, Jim. You could be moving to Seattle and then we'd really resent it. I think you were one of the first people I worked with in the city and county of Denver on process.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I knew very little bit very little about the city's RFP process and even less about purchasing. And I don't know if I should even mention what we were working on. But just for those of you are curious. Parking kiosk at the time.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening. My name is Adrian Benevides, and I am the executive director of the Department of General Services. And if I may speak for a couple of minutes before Jim comes up and and talks to you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You know, this is one of those things that it's.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Wonderful for Jim and his family who are here with him tonight. And I'm sure he will.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Introduce everybody to you. But it's also bittersweet.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'For us.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Because we are losing a strong leader in our department and for the city.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You know, I met Jim nearly three years ago when I came to the city and we hit it off right away. And I thought, you know, I'm not going to come here and talk to you about all of the great things he's done in purchasing and and read statistics to you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I will mention that he and I had very similar procurement philosophies. He really had an emphasis, as do I, on doing things better, not just being happy with the status quo, but looking at how we can do this better, how we can serve our customer better.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'He has done several things with changing the process as you guys are aware of couple of ordinances on changing the processes. Just this past year, he did a reorganization within his division that provided much better opportunities for his staff.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And as you all also know, the city has been very devoid of any procurement scandals. And that really speaks to Jim's leadership and his emphasis on ethical behavior at excuse me, and the training.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That he provides to his staff. One of the things he also did.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That I strongly embrace was his emphasis on his staff. If you look.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'At and I'm sure you guys have worked.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'With many of our buyers, you see a lot of them are my children's age because he does something different than other procurement directors. He invests in people. He brings them in and he teaches.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Them.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'How to be procurement professionals. And.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You know, he doesn't do it just from the philosophy that we can develop these young people and we can provide a career for them. But he looks at it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'As How can we learn from them with the expertize, particularly with social media.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And computers.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And everything else? And just a fresh perspective at procurement has made a huge difference in our department, and it comes from.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Jim and his investment in his staff. He also has.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'A huge concentration on vendors. He meets with vendors all the time where he will explain our processes, explain how they can take advantage of opportunities within our city. As you know, we initiated a major Mwb program for goods and services this past April.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But even prior to that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I can tell you from the last couple of years, he has made that a major emphasis working on contracts to have minority and women's participate in minority and women owned businesses, participate in city contract opportunities.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So he has.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Done that and with this new program, we'll be able to even do more. He has also added immensely to our department's leadership. He works very well with all of our with his peers, our other division leaders, has been supportive of them and teaching them and helping work through processes with them and actually makes for some fun meetings'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that we have at our staff meetings. One of the other things that he does, which really endeared him to me, is that some of the things that are very important to me are.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Also.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Extremely important to him. One of those that he.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Places high priority on.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is his family. Like I said, they're here tonight. But I know you made some comments about Chicago, and I'll let him explain that to you. But that was a sacrifice he made for his family in going to Chicago.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'One of the other things he does is, you know, he wears his culture on his sleeve. You won't know how much we talk about Irish culture and the importance that it has to him. And that's important to me because my culture is also important as well as traditions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And of course, there's something I don't know a lot about, but I've learned a lot, which is also important. And that's golf, you know, and.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'He can talk your ear off about that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But finally, the way this came forward with that was not anything I did. But it was his. Staff. His staff that put this together and the proclamation and many of them are here tonight, and I wanted them to stand so you can recognize how endeared he has become to all of them.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So if his staff members could stand. Hey. So with that, I will just say that he will be very missed by our department.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But by the city as well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. Benevides. Mr. McIntyre.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Madam President, members of City Council, thank you so much for taking time out of your busy schedule and your work to do tonight. I'll try to make this brief. I do have my family here. I'd like to introduce my lovely wife, Tammy, who's not only beautiful, but she's also very talented and has a great opportunity in Chicago'",
        "'speaker_5': '. So I'm following the money. And my daughter Amanda, my son Matt and my new son in law, Brandon Eriksen, they're getting married in December. Thanks for being here, guys. I really appreciate you coming. I was going to say that Denver's just too tame.'",

To my colleagues around the city, you know, at this point of your career, it really gets down to relationships and the friendships and the mentors I've had.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The people that have allowed me to mentor them means so much to me. It's been very gratifying and it's meant a lot to me in my career, to my staff. I think you all know that for me, it's it's hard to find John McIntyre, the guy, and Jimmy Carter, the purchasing director.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You know, it is kind of who I am. And you folks are such a big part in my life. We spend a lot of time together every day. I absolutely love this department. And that's of course not because of what we do, but because of what we've meant to each other and what we've built together.'",

Nobody, you know, gets excited about, you know, the whatever the hell is on the bottom of the food pyramid, but nobody gets excited about it.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'They did it in a district that I represent. And for 25 years. Some people may laugh about it, but for 25 years nobody had touched it. And because of the leadership in public works, because of the men and women in public works, you won't find a pothole in Villa Park.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You won't find a pothole in some parts of Westwood now. And instead, you find neighborhoods that look built right, that are created right and that are built to last. And you see bike lanes on Morrison Road and Knox Core, right?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You see different things that are just happening in our city. And this is all done by the hands of the people who call the city home, who happen to work in their public works. I happened to work on West Alaska Place in the Westwood neighborhood while we were paving.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We go out every year and think folks are paying pass out Gatorade and and water. And lo and behold, one of the people who was paving the street actually lived on that street and grew up on that street.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's what makes this department so special, right? This year we may talk trash once in a while, but a manager got an AHA. You run a very good shop with a great manager at his helm. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman Lopez, Councilwoman Monteiro.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And thank you, Madam President. I also want to take the opportunity to extend my appreciation. I wish I knew all 1100 employees. But here's what I do know that public works does everything from Keep Denver Beautiful this far as graffiti, graffiti removal all the way to major projects.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm very mindful of the role that Public Works played in the redevelopment of Denver Union Station and the work that you're doing currently regarding I-70 and the National Western Stock Show. And we couldn't we couldn't do wouldn't be responsive if we didn't have the help of solid waste.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Also, permitting and enforcement have worked with a lot of people, their street maintenance. And then of course, Nancy, I have an inbox of a lot of emails that you and I have, so I'm going to have to start deleting some of those.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I also want to extend my thank you to host Cornell for all of the work that you do and that and for your steadfast, steadfast leadership. And also to George Delaney, who you're there when Jose is away from the helm.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I really appreciate that. So congratulations again. Let me see if I got these names right. Jason, Chloe, Adrian, Luis, Jeremy, Cindy, Patrick and Ron. So I hope I got everybody's name. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Counselor Monteiro. All right. Looks like we're ready for the vote.'",

        "'speaker_1': '11 eyes.'",
        "'speaker_2': '11 eyes. The proclamation is adopted, Councilman Roberts or somebody would like to call up to the podium.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes, Madam President, I expected my colleagues to support this, but I hope no one out there was sort of insulted with some of the comments. I would like to call up the interesting, sexy, cool and strong executive director of the Public Works Department, which is an interesting, sexy, cool and strong department.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Somebody says, I was reading this book the other day. Somebody says that the public space is the the visible face of society. And I do believe that. I think that that's how we judge cities when we go around the world and come back.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I like to talk a little bit, spend a little bit of time talking about the ten employees that we're honoring tonight, because I think it's very important to mention exactly what these employees have been working and being part of.'",
