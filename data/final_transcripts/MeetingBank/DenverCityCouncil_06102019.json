    "A bill for an ordinance changing the zoning classification of 1683, 1685, 1687, 1691, 1693, 1695, and 1699 Cedar Avenue in Washington Park. Approves an official map amendment to rezone properties from PUD-G 5 to PUD-G 22 (changing the footprint and floor area limitations), for properties located at 1683, 1685, 1687, 1691, 1693, 1695, and 1699 Cedar Avenue in Council District 6. The Committee approved filing this item at its meeting on 4-30-19.": [
        "'speaker_0': 'Their names and cities of residence, and if they feel comfortable doing so, their home addresses. If you're here to answer questions only when your name is called, come to the podium. State your name and note that you're available for questions of counsel.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Speakers will have 3 minutes. There will be no yielding of time on the presentation monitor. On the wall, you will see your time counting down. Speakers must stay on the topic of the hearing. Must direct their comments to the council members.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Please refrain from profane or obscene speech. Direct your comments to council as a whole and please refrain from individual or personal attacks. Councilman Herndon, will you please put Council Bill 403 on the floor?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes, Madam President, I move that council bill 19 0403 be placed upon final consideration and do pass.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It has been moved and seconded. The required public hearing for Council Bill 403 is open. May we have the staff report? We have Scott Robinson for the Community Planning and Development.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Madam President and Council Scott Robinson with Community Planning and Development. This is a request to rezone 1683, 1685, 1687, 1691, 1693, 1695 and 1699. Cedar Avenue from Pdg five to Pdg 22 property is located in Council District six in the Washington Park neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It is just south of the Denver Country Club and it is a sort of flag lot accessed off of Cedar Avenue with the majority of the lot set behind another house. The property is about two and a half acres and there are currently six single unit houses on the property.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Request, as I said, is to rezone from Pdg five to Pdg 22. The intent in changing the PUD is to mostly to loosen some restrictions on the size of the houses that can be built. I'll go into more detail on that in a minute.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'As I mentioned, the zoning is Pdg five. The zoning to the north is OSB, where the country club is, and then adjoining the property is assumed zoning. That's suburban single unit zoning. And then to the south, across Cedar is U.S. You see that suburban neighborhood context, single unit zoning.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The current PD, PD G5 was adopted in 2013, but there's a bit of a history with this one. This property was initially developed in the 1980s, and when it was split off from the large house in front of it, the zoning did not allow more than one primary structure on a single zone lot without a what's called'",
        "'speaker_7': 'a planned building group or a PUBG. So that PUBG was put in place to allow up to seven houses on the property. Six of those houses were built when we adopted the citywide rezoning in 2010. The intent was to leave all PGS in place and not rezone those.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Leave those in the old code zoning. Somehow we missed this one. The fact that it was in a PUBG and we re zoned it to SCD a couple of years later we realized we'd made a mistake in that and so created PD five.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That basically replicates the old PUBG from the 1980s, once again allowing up to seven houses on the single zone lot and is based on the assumed zoning and it includes some limits that were found in that original PUBG to the building pad or footprint of the house.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There can be no longer than no larger than 2000 square feet and the total floor area of each house that can be no larger than 6000 square feet. And those are two of the items requested to be changed.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The current land use, as I said, is single unit houses and it is surrounded by other single unit uses except for a golf course to the north and east. And then there's some denser housing to the southwest of you to unit and multi-unit in the Walsh Park neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You can see the subject property in the bottom right photo. In that photo, north is to the left. So Cedar Avenue is on the right. And you can see the flag lot with the six houses that exist there now.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The photo next to that to the left is the house that's in front of it along Cedar Avenue and then some of the other surrounding properties. So as I mentioned, Pdg 22 is the proposed new pad carries forward almost all of the regulations from the existing Pdg five with just a few changes.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It, as I mentioned, removes those building pad and floor area limits. It also clarifies where the front setback and rear setbacks are measured from. That was a little vague in the original PD, so not changing the setbacks, but just clarifying what's front and what's rear.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It also allows amendment by sub area. So if in the future an individual property owner wanted to amend the PD as it applies to their property, they could do that without amending the entire PD. And then it also introduces some standard language that we have developed over the last few years that wasn't included in 2013.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But now, six years later, we've developed language that we want, including all parties. So it includes that as well. This went to a planning board on April 17th, 2019, received unanimous approval and there was no public comment at that meeting.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Went to the Land Use Transportation and Infrastructure Committee on April 30th. There is one public comment letter in your packet from the Washington Park East Neighborhood Organization stating they do not object to the proposed rezoning. In order to approve a rezoning, the city must find that these five criteria have been met.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In addition to these five, there are also additional criteria that apply to PD rezonings. So I'll go over these five and then I'll go over the PD criteria. First criterion is consistency with adopted plans. There are only two plans that apply to this property, the two citywide plans.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There's no neighborhood plan for this property. So the first plan is comprehensive plan 2040. As described in a staff report, staff finds the proposed rezoning consistent with these three goals from Plan 2040, mostly relating to preserving and enhancing neighborhood character and also more efficient use of land, allowing more types of housing.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'As I said, the property for the PD would allow up to seven houses on a lot that would otherwise only be allowed to have one. The second plan is Blueprint Denver, 2019. This property is in the suburban neighborhood context.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'As I mentioned, the underlying base zone district for the PD is assumed, which is in that suburban neighborhood context. So it's consistent with that. And the. Land or the place designation is low residential, which calls for predominantly single unit uses on larger lots, which is again consistent with what the Peabody would allow.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Cedar is an UN designated local street intended to provide local access to houses, and it is in the all other areas of the city. In our growth strategy, which of course calls for moderate new housing and jobs, staff finds the first criterion, and that the second criterion is uniform, even district regulations.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Staff finds the proposed zone district will result in the uniform application of the PUD to the property, to the structures within the property. The third criterion is to further the public health, safety and general welfare of city staff finds the proposed rezoning would do so by implementing the city's adopted plans and helping to maintain the existing character'",
        "'speaker_7': 'of the Washington Park neighborhood. The fourth criterion is justifying circumstances. Staff finds the proposed rezoning is justified by changed or changing conditions in the area. There's been a fair number of scrapes and rebuilds or additions in the watch park.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Neighborhood houses in the area are getting larger. These houses are currently capped at their existing size and not allowed to grow in a way that's consistent with the neighborhood character and the way the neighborhood is changing. And so this period would allow that incremental change, again, consistent with the existing neighborhood character.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And the fifth criterion is consistency with neighborhood context, zone, district purpose and intent. The purpose and intent of the underlying assumed zone district is for single unit residential consistent with this area. And then this also gets into the approval criteria, as I mentioned.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So the first criterion is that the district is consistent with the intent and purpose of such districts stated in the code. This is described further in your staff report, but staff finds that it is consistent with the intent and purpose by bringing the PD in to closer conformance with the underlying zone district.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The underlying study does not include limits to building footprint or building floor area. So by removing those limits, it actually brings it closer to the underlying this study, which has a maximum or a minimum open space area of 50%, which is also found in the party.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So that is consistent and this change would bring it closer to being consistent. But while this does bring it closer, there are still several variances or waivers that would be required to the underlying study for this development to work.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so it's also justified by that and allows for a more efficient use of land, as I mentioned, allowing up to seven structures where otherwise only one would be allowed. And it is a development pattern that's consistent and compatible with the existing neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The second criterion is that the PD is consistent with the technical standards found in the zoning code, which staff has found that it is. The third criterion is that the proposed development is not feasible under another existing zone district without an excessive number of variances or waivers.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'As I said, our staff has found that's true in this case. The fourth criterion is that the hub establishes uses that are consistent with the existing land uses in the area. As I mentioned, it allows single residential in an area that is predominantly single unit residential.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And the last criterion is that it establishes building forms that are compatible with the existing building forms and development. So the few would allow the suburban house building form, which is consistent with the surrounding sub zoned district. So staff finds that all criteria are met and recommends approval.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'll be happy to answer any questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you. We have three individuals signed up to speak this evening. If you could all come join us up in the front right here. We have Philip Steffan, us, Andrew Peters and Jessie Parrish. And we have Mr. Safana.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Your first.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening. Thank you, Madam President. I appreciate the opportunity to speak to you. I'm Philip Stefanos. I live in one of the residences that is affected by the pad. I represent the six homeowners in the H-2A, and there's not much for me to add to the presentation that Mr. Robinson gave other than to say we're not seeking'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to change the character of the area or the development at all. We're just seeking to clean up these couple of dormant provisions that were discovered and if they were enforced, would make all six houses non-conforming. So that's that's really the nature of our request.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next up, we have Andrew Peters.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening, members of Council. Andrew Peters My address is 950 17th Street, Denver. 80202 I'm here as a representative of the applicant. I'm just here to answer any questions you might have.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you. Next up, we have Jesse Parrish.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Jesse Paris and I represent for Denver Homicide, a low black star action movement for self-defense and positive action commitment for social change. And I was on top of the ballot for at large this past May 2019 election, and I got 15,000 votes with no money.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I was neither for or against this. I just wanted to know what it was all and in the previous speakers have already answered my question. So I have nothing to say. You going to approve this anywhere? Because it already me saw the criteria.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. That concludes our speakers questions from members of council. The public hearing for Council Bill 403 is closed. Comments by members of Council. Councilman Cashman.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah. Thank you, Madam President. I appreciate the work done by staff to clean up the conflicts in the PD and bring it into today's standards. It's a lovely part of our neighborhood and I would ask my colleagues to join me in approving this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Cashman. I also from the presentation. It meets all five of the review criteria and I will be voting in favor of this as well. Madam Secretary, roll call.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Cashman I.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Flynn All right. Herndon I.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Can eat. Right. Lopez. New.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Ortega assessment. Right.'",

Sharing the presentation duties with me tonight will be Eugene Howard, also with community planning and development. And we're really pleased to bring the far northeast area plan forward for your consideration tonight.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So just as a reminder, we have the Neighborhood Planning Initiative as our broader neighborhood planning program within the city. This was launched a couple of years ago with the development of the NPI strategic plan. And far northeast was the first area out the gate.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Under the new NPI program. It's in phase one of NPI, along with two other areas currently in process to east, central and east that are highlighted in red here in this graphic. As we finish up these plans this year, and we do intend to complete all three of them before the end of the year.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'So the far northeast plan area includes the neighborhood, statistical areas of Monticello, Gateway, Green Valley Ranch, the DIA statistical neighborhood. That's something that's confusing to a lot of people because we do have a neighborhood that's named after Diane.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'People think we're talking about the airport, but in the plan document, we refer to the airport as done to help distinguish it from the neighborhood. This is what we refer to as our plan on a page. It's sort of like a visual table of contents of the structure of the document.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Over here on the left hand side, highlighted in the orange box are the six vision elements from Comprehensive Plan 2014. We started with with those vision elements as a starting point in our work in far northeast and worked with the community and our steering committee to develop specific vision statements within each of the six states to ensure'",
        "'speaker_3': 'a high level of consistency between citywide guidance and the more specific guidance that was being developed for the far northeast area. So that's the first section of the plan contains the vision for the far northeast area as a whole.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The next section of the plan we refer to as our framework plan. The three main sections in there are land use and built form, mobility and quality of life infrastructure. Those will sound familiar because they're also the elements of a complete neighborhood as identified by blueprint Denver land use in built form, quality life, infrastructure and mobility coming'",
        "'speaker_3': 'together to form complete neighborhoods. It's one of the main objectives of the Neighborhood Planning Initiative to figure out how to create more complete neighborhoods all throughout the city. That ends up being an organizing element for the main body of the plan.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Each of those areas or topics end up being a chapter in the plan. And then there's a lot more detail listed here in each of the sections on this slide. We we go topic by topic within these larger and broader themes, addressing each specific one as it applies to the far northeast neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The next section of the plan is the neighborhood chapters themselves. Each neighborhood statistical area within the broader study area gets its own chapter within the plan. And then we follow a similar structure for each providing an introduction to that neighborhood, some demographic information for the neighborhood, identifying trends and issues, identifying opportunity areas within each neighborhood that we'",

        "'speaker_3': 'which vision elements it helps to support responsible parties, timelines for implementation, that sort of thing, as well as a page of metrics to help track plan progress over time. So that's my very quick overview of the document. I'll hand it over now to Eugene, who will present the information specific to the staff report.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Great. Thank you, Cortland, and thank you City Council and it's a pleasure to be here with you this evening to talk about the far northeast area plan. So I'm going to review the review criteria that is to be considered when making supplements or updating our comprehensive plan 2040, as well as making updates to Blueprint.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Denver As it relates to the Neighborhood Planning Initiative, the three criteria that we ask you to consider, number one, that the planning process was inclusive in developing the plan. That the plan is consistent with the vision and goals and strategies outlined in comprehensive plan 2040.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then finally, the third criterion the plan demonstrates a long term view for the residents. So starting first with the inclusive community process, this plan being the first of 19, we did utilize the full 24 month time frame outlined by the Neighborhood Planning Initiative Strategic Plan.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In this process, we were able to engage with citizens, residents of the far northeast, really from the very beginning of this planning effort, including the months leading up to officially launching this project. We had great response and communication and participation by the members of the community, which I'll go over here in just a second.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So first we convened a 20 person stakeholder committee. This committee was made up of members from the far northeast area, presidents of the registered neighborhood organizations, nonprofit organizations, long term residents from the community and our city council representatives also participated in this process with us.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We held monthly meetings. We conducted 20 of these monthly meetings to make sure that the community was engaged and guiding this process. We held five public meetings throughout the duration of this planning effort, with well over 500 participants from the community coming to provide their input and feedback.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We tracked demographics by asking a few simple questions at the beginning of each meeting. So we feel confident that this plan reflects those that live in the community and who are from the community. A diversity of backgrounds, ages, races, ethnicities participated in the development of this part of this plan.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We provided interpretation. We had all of our materials translated into Spanish. We had child care. We provided food at our meetings to really make them fun and and make it so that folks could participate in-person if they could.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We were fortunate to leverage the support of the American Institute of Architects Colorado chapter, who worked with the community members in helping bring their ideas and their thoughts to life on paper. Those design concepts helped inform the plan and helped us throughout the planning process.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And in addition to all of the project related meetings, staff participated in well over 50 community events in separate meetings to make sure that we were present and that we were hearing firsthand from the community what their issues and challenges and what the opportunities were to help inform this planning effort.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This is just a small sample of the type of events that we attended. We went to back to school events to engage with parents and children. We engaged in culturally relevant celebrations like The Taste of Ethiopia. We were there during the summer to make sure that we were hearing from youth and getting the youth perspective in our'",
        "'speaker_3': 'planning effort. We attended Council District Eleven's Day of Beauty, I think, to really engage with the volunteers that came out for that event. We also and this is one that's kind of personally a little exciting for me, and that is working on the walking audits.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'One of the key members of the Belo community is Pam Joyner. I believe she's here tonight. And she at the very first meeting that she saw me at said, Eugene, you're going on a walk with me. And she just she was great.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I learned so much not only from all of our interactions with the public, but from really, truly walking in their footsteps. Seeing what they experience every single day firsthand was just crucial to this effort. And I really appreciate the effort of Girl Trek Montebello 2020 and all of the organizations that we had the privilege of working with'",
        "'speaker_3': '. They just were were great. So, you know, for that, thinking about the public process and our online engagement, we wanted to make sure that we had an opportunity for people to engage with us virtually if they could not be there in person.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We created our materials in a way so that they translated one for one online so that we could continue to collect, like for like information. One of the key things with the slide is it's really demonstrating the involvement, even virtually, of this community.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The the open rates of newsletters, the click through rates are double what we normally see and what our communication staff tells us that they typically see through those types of communication tools. We had five online surveys that replicated those in-person meetings.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We had over 500 downloads of our draft plan, which again illustrates the level of involvement from this community about the work that they helped us create. We had social media touchpoints over 91 different posts related to this planning effort, and without fail, the council officers and their staff really, truly were crucial in getting the word out and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'helping communicate that this plan was out, that it was for the community. And they really encouraged the community to come out and to participate. So with all of that involvement from the community staff signs at the far northeast area plan was developed through an inclusive public process.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Planned consistency. One of the criteria is to make sure that this plan is consistent with the goals and objectives of comprehensive plan 2040 and the Far Northeast Plan addresses or touches 29 individual goals found in Plan 2040, as well as 63 individual strategies found in that plan.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They touch on the topics of affordable housing, intentional growth and development, complete, vibrant, culturally rich and inclusive communities, multi-modal connectivity parks and open space, health, safety, and economic vitality of the people and the residents in the far northeast.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thinking of consistency with Blueprint. Denver The Far North East plan is consistent with 21 individual policies found in Blueprint Denver as well as 51 individual strategies found in the document covering the topics of zoning and land use, form and function of the built environment, transportation and mobility and overall quality of life.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Because the Neighborhood Planning Initiative is meant to be a tool to further calibrate and make updates to blueprint Denver. There are a few updates that if you adopt this plan this evening, will go to Update Blueprint. They touch on neighborhood contexts through our interactions with the community, we heard that we could tweak the context in a few'",
        "'speaker_3': 'places. They helped us calibrate the future places that will help guide growth and development. The overall growth strategy. When new streets are created, what types of streets they should be, what their priorities should be, as well as equitable planning throughout the far northeast area.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So with regard to criteria and number to plan consistency, staff finds that the far north east area plan is consistent with comprehensive plan 2040 as well as Blueprint Denver. And then finally, looking at the long term view, given the amount of input and feedback and work and collaboration with the community, staff has found that we believe the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Far Northeast Area Plan does establish a long term vision that helps maintain the character and the development patterns established in the residential areas of the far northeast helps support the industrial areas in the far northeast while directing the majority of growth to new centers and corridors in the area and particularly in the undeveloped portions of the plan'",
        "'speaker_3': 'area. This vision will take many years to achieve, but we do believe that does contain the long term view of the residents. Therefore, staff finds that the far northeast area plan has an appropriate long term view and perspective.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Following through with the adoption process, we did go before a planning board on May 15th where we did receive a unanimous vote to proceed this plan to you for consideration. We went to the Land Use Transportation and Infrastructure Committee on May 21st, who felt that this plan was ready to be heard by you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Last week was the first reading and tonight we are before you for the public hearing. So with all of that, the staff asks that you consider adopting the far northeast area plan as a supplement to comprehensive plan 2040 and as an update tool for Blueprint Denver.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you both. We have nine individuals signed up to speak tonight. I'm going to call the first five. If you could come up to the first row. Here we have William Thomas Rose, Thomas, Jessie Parrish, Megan L'anse and Vernon York.'",

It was a two year effort and meeting after meeting. There never was a shortage of participation and there was a great cross section from the community.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We had a lot of lively discussions and I also want to say kudos to the planning committee because they helped keep everything structured and organized so that we made progress but allowed enough open space and area so that true, authentic feedback and concerns could be heard and incorporated to truly make this plan.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'I was speaking I'm speaking against this just like I spoke against the comprehensive plan 2040. I don't think we really gave them enough time to people to actually read this. It's actually 228 pages. How many people have actually read all?'",
        "'speaker_8': '228 pages of that? Oh, that's a shock. Okay. Well, most people that are not in this room have not read this and have no clue what this all entails. Honestly, nothing in here about affordable housing, honestly, nothing in here about am I levels for Montebello, Green Valley Ranch or Gateway?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I don't see anything about that. So if somebody could put further consider not consideration, further detail on what that all entails. If you are actually looking at that or if this is just where you're pushing us to because northeast all parts of this town are being gentrified and we're being moved along displace.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening. Council members Megan Allen's and unfortunately a constituent couldn't be here tonight, so I'm going to read their comments. Tom Carlin of Green Valley Ranch. Nowhere in the far north east neighborhood plan is there a reference to oil and gas development.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There should be. Newly signed legislation by Governor Polis puts environmental and health considerations before fostering oil development. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has been clear about the calamitous effects of pumping carbon dioxide into the Earth's atmosphere. Yet the oil and gas industry continues its relentless advance to horizontally drill under my Green Valley Ranch neighborhood lands.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The latest assault is from Access Exploration LLC. Access wants to horizontally drill and frack under Denver properties of the high point and wild horse condominium neighborhoods, which are few which within a few hundred feet of Green Valley Ranch where I live.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'See Docket number 190600442 before the Oil and Gas Conservation Commission. Also in the Green Valley Ranch neighborhood of Denver, where I live, we've got a plan in 2017 that would have possibly allowed drilling or development of mineral rights west of Tower Road by the Ivy Garrett, Dennis and Regis Groff DPS campuses and as close to my home'",
        "'speaker_2': 'as allowed by regulations. We won. But the threat remains with the state land board retaining mineral rights after sale to commercial interests of the surface rights. The far northeast neighbor neighborhood plan should not be approved with in recognition of the role that Denver needs to play in mitigating climate change.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Our neighborhood plan must recognize its role in protecting the environment and health of not only Denver, but all people of Colorado and and the nation. My neighborhood plan must be bold, not timid in addressing climate change. Denver has the opportunity to play a leading role in addressing climate change.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The neighborhood plan needs to be greatly strengthened. Each well site and far northeast member should be noted for potential development and neighborhood neighbors quickly notified of oil and gas industry plans. Likewise, Denver officials must be vigilant in monitoring activities of our neighbors in the East, Adams County in Aurora, and that may affect Denver by horizontal drilling and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'fracking efforts. Respectfully submitted. Tom Carlin, thanks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Vernon York.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'To the council. Vernon, York. I live with my bill, and I'm for the plan.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, sir. Next up, we'll call the next. I think we have for folks, we have Mr. Lawrence Murray, Pam Joyner, Donna Garnett and Myra Gonzalez. So Mr. Murray. And we can go ahead and have you come up to the front and it'll speed things up a little bit.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mr. Murray Then we have Pam Joyner, Donna Garnett and Myra Gonzales. So, Mr. Murray, you're up.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening. My name is Lawrence Murray. I'm a resident of Montebello and have been since 1982. My my main issue about this proposal and it's a huge one, I would like to make sure that the residents are made aware of all the changes as the project proceeds.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We should be informed. It shouldn't be something that's a little off to the side. The project is very important to us in knowing what's happening when it happens and keeping to the keystone marks that you said. We're going to do it at this time.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We'll be finishing at that time. I think that's very, very important for the residents to know. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Next up, we have Pam Joyner. Hello, counsel. My name is Pam Jane. Or one, two, two, one, one is 52nd, placed in my Belo, a 45 year resident of Montello. And I'm very, very concerned about my community's health.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I represent Girl Trek, which is a national health movement for women of color. I represent my Bel-Air Walks, which is a community initiative to encourage my entire community to be more active and to get outside and live healthier lives.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I also am co-chair of my fellow 2020, the registered neighborhood organization, and I have been very, very, very, very happy with all of the opportunities that the planning and Planning Department has allowed our community to participate and to add our input and help us develop our visions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I believe that the last two years we have all worked very, very hard. And yes, I have encouraged a lot of the members to take walks with me only because, you know, I think they need a break from behind those computers and the developments and the office stuff, but they also need to feel what they're creating.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I am very concerned that all the developments are pedestrian friendly, developing bigger areas, busy areas. If they're not pedestrian friendly, it's not going to be a benefit to our community. It's good for business, but it's not good for the health of our community.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I'd just like to reiterate that these developments must have access for pedestrians that are not along automobile lines. We shouldn't have to walk a mile to turn into a shopping center when there are multiple areas where pedestrians could have access.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I will be watching for that. City planners and I am for the plan. Thank you very much. Next up, we have Donna Garnett. Thank you, Madam President. And thank you to the body of all the council members.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'My name is Donna Garnett. I have lived in far northeast for 26 years. I am the executive director of the Mont Organizing Committee and the editor of the Montebello Urban Spectrum Edition. It has really been my privilege to be a part of this process that has gone lasted for almost two years or maybe even over two years'",
        "'speaker_2': '. I was pleased to serve on the steering committee for the planning process, and I have to say that I participated in every single community meeting and read every page of the plan at every draft.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Level and read.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It multiple times. What I really want to say, because I do a lot of work in the community, that this process really exemplifies what it means to have community informed and community led initiatives at the at the neighborhood level.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I did a story in the Muse a few months ago that showed that there were 12 planning efforts going on at the same time that this process was going on. And the thing that makes this process so unique is that the amazing people in the Planning Department somehow managed to fold all of those things together and heard'",
        "'speaker_2': 'everybody mock my organization at the same time was hosting.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'A.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Process that involved over 2000 people. And I'm happy to say that the work from that is included in this plan and this neighborhood plan puts in place policies and and recommendations that will enable Marc and the partners in the community to bring to life the transformative initiative that one of them in the plan.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Called the fresh love.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Fresh and local. And it will bring a grocery anchored cultural hub with 120 units of affordable housing that does address AMI at 30% to 80%. Am I? So we really hope that you're going to pass this plan so we can get on with the work because we plan to break ground in January 2020.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I hope you pass it and I hope you pass it unanimously. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next up, we have Mayra Gonzalez and then we have William Thomas.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening. Members of city council, staff of the Community Planning and Development Department. My name is Myra Gonzalez. I am a lifelong resident of the Marbella neighborhood and project manager of the Mahalo, Fresh, Low, Walkable Loop and Hub.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I am proud to testify in favor of the far northeast area plan. I would like to share a fun fact before proceeding. The current mom Barlow neighborhood plan is as old as I am and I'm 27 years old and so this is really needed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I would like to thank CPD for their extensive neighborhood planning process and the far northeast neighborhoods. They began working with us two years ago, and as Eugene mentioned, 550 residents were able to attend the five community planning meetings and provide feedback online.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'What I am the most proud of was the staff's efforts to make this a truly equitable process. They provided Spanish language interpretation and made sure that all of their materials were translated for us. In Marbella, this is particularly important because 67% of our residents are Latino and monolingual Spanish speakers.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so this ensured that our residents were able to fully engage and be part of the process and give their feedback. I am particularly proud of the inclusion of the Monticello Fresh, Low Cultural Hub, which is the community's response to our food desert designation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so this plan is truly representative of community voices. And with that, I urge you all, as everybody has mentioned, to please pass this unanimously so that we can get on going.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And last up, we have William Thomas.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening. William Thomas 19190, East 43rd Avenue, Denver, Colorado. I participated in just a few of the meetings for this planning committee, but I will say I am impressed. I'm very proud as a long time resident of Green Valley Ranch to have been able to, even for a small time, participate in some of these planning meetings.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I really enjoy and very again, very proud of the fact that the city and the communities have come together to actually look and work together to make an area that had been underserved for quite a long time and ignored bring to the top of list and bring the importance of it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I don't think I need to repeat probably what everyone else has said. Please pass it unanimously and we can move on with the next phase of it. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you. That concludes our speakers questions from members of council. Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Uh, thank you, Madam Pro-Tem. Eugene, I had a question. If I can pull this up again on your on the PowerPoint on slide 28, where reference the planning board adoption and the two notes in red. Can you tell me how they were addressed?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sure. So a general statement for clarity and correctness is that I understand. I'm sorry. I'm more interested in the second one. Sure I did. Did you clarify the community interest in the general development plan and large development review?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. There were some questions about the the amount of undeveloped land in the far northeast and what tools are at our disposal here at the city and before you all to to help guide development on such large parcels.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Currently, we have a general development plan process in place. There's some conversations that you might all either know about or that is coming before you soon to calibrate that tool to be more of a large development review, a process.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And there was a request to have some additional clarity around the use of that large development review tool should it become a part of our toolkit. Okay. And so that was was that added or was it augmented or how was it it was a modification to the language to further clarify how that tool might be used and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to what degree Cortland is or anything you'd like to add to that? Sure. I just can give you the specific location of the new content. It's on page 57. Great. We added a new sidebar. It's titled Regulatory and Policy Tools for Large Scale Development.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Great. I'll pull that up here. Okay. I see it here. Well, thank you very much. That's all.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you, Councilman Cashman.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah, thank you, Madam President. Pro tem either Cortland or Eugene. So I'm my understanding is this process went a bit longer than it might have been envisioned at the beginning. I'm just wondering what what you had learned about the process.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I mean, 20 monthly meetings is fantastic. It seems like a tremendous amount of engagement. So I compliment the city on that. I compliment the neighbors for showing up and participating if there's anything a neighborhood should show up for.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's this particular process that really gives you the chance to sculpt the future of your community. And I would just before I let your answer, say that I miss Consigliere so that my neighborhood of Virginia Village is one of the neighborhoods in the next planning process.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And our plan was written 46 years ago in 19 and 1973. So I hate to one better you, but I think think we've got that done. Please. Sure. Okay. We got we got a similar question when we went to a planning board about what we had learned.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think the short version of my answer is that the the planning process does work. I think that this one is the first out of the gate. This is a new planning model for the city. The most typical plans that we'd produce previously would do one neighborhood at a time.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And part of the justification for changing that model was that over a 15, 20 year period, we only covered about 20% of the city with those plans. And this allows us to cover the entire city because we're doing groupings of larger areas there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There are a few other examples nationwide. Philadelphia is one of them. San Antonio is another of other large cities that are doing a similar approach of large areas bigger than a single neighborhood. You know, we've got our own version of it here under NPI and it works.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We've produced a plan that's supported by many members in the community, and we're able to not lose anything in terms of level of detail by having those specific neighborhood chapters as well as material that applies to the whole area.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And with regard to the timeline for this first plan, because it is meant to help understand and calibrate Blueprint Denver We wanted to make sure that blueprint Denver went through that adoption process and since it came before you approximately six weeks ago, that meant that we could not come any earlier than that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So that did add additional time to our original timeline, and it really helped us hit that 24 month mark. Great. Well, I can congratulate the planning staff, but mainly want to thank the community for getting these guys warmed up.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So when they hit near southeast Denver, they're working at full capacity. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, councilman. Councilwoman are. HAGER Thank you. Pro Tem. I wanted to follow up on the statement that was read by Megan from Tom Carlin regarding the issue of fracking and how that was addressed in the plan. I can remember when I first got elected back to the Council in 2011, there were concerns from the Green Valley'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Ranch community about fracking that was happening in Adams County, but could be impacting some of the homes in Denver County. And so I think it's a real concern. I mean, I think the changes that happened at the state are good.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It makes the situation much better than it was before. But it doesn't mean that we're completely immune. And, you know, right now, the only place we have drilling or fracking is at the airport. But it doesn't mean that it couldn't impact some of these neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I know. Sometime last year, I believe it was, there was an application from someone that wanted to drill on land just north of 56th Avenue. There were three sites, I believe, that they had applied for, and the Stapleton community came out of the woodworks and wrote letters.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They learned about it on the day before it was supposed to go before the land board, but they were able to mobilize a lot of opposition, and the land board ended up not moving forward with that particular request.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So how was that addressed in the in the plan?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so say it's a valid criticism to say that the plan doesn't, you know, directly address the fracking issue. You know, that's true. There isn't material or specific recommendations in the plan on that topic. The MPA planning model is that we have a list of always topics, things that are at the core that plans address, that you'",
        "'speaker_3': 'can reliably expect every NPI plan to hit. That's to provide consistency, you know, from one planning area to the next, a consistent level of guidance. And then there's also focus topics, which are things that you address if you need to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And if raised by the community is a high priority. And so what we heard a lot more about in this area was access to retail food, access walkability. Those are the things that we focused on, as, you know, focused topics in this community.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So it's not entirely comprehensive in that, you know, we don't touch on every every single issue that affects the community. And so it is it's valid to say that the plan doesn't do enough on that topic.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The one thing I do want to add is that that particular incident with that application that came to Stapleton drew attention to the fact that any application that would come to the city was going to delay and the process changed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Now, so if there is an application for anything, any place other than DIA, the notices will go to the mayor's office and then they'll make sure the neighborhoods are notified so that we don't have this last minute situation that occurred in the Stapleton neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So thank you for addressing that question. Thank you. The public hearing for Council Bill 477 is closed. Do we have comments by members of council?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Councilman herndon thinking i'm president? Well, we are. We are finally here. I remember I remember when this started. Let me let me first say, I believe the criteria have been met. And I'm excited about the progress of reform because.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But the work is not yet done. I mean, this is actually where people can say the hard work begins. And now that the vision is place, the vision is in place. It's about making sure we execute properly. But you have to take a moment to acknowledge the people that made this possible because it's really hard being first'",
        "'speaker_5': '. But let me say, the bar is very high. You can say several things about this plan, but you cannot say that the community wasn't involved. Because I remember the meetings at the evidence campus where that place was packed.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We're making sure that everyone has opportunities to come to the table no matter what language you were speaking. We had monolingual on our steering committee, Spanish speakers, who can make sure that their voices were heard as a part of that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So to say that this was not a community driven effort is just just unequivocally false. And to the team that was in place because we disagreed on things, but we weren't disagreeable. Because when you have people that have diverse opinions about moving forward, we created a space where you could give your opinion if it was differing and'",
        "'speaker_5': 'we just had a conversation about it. And that model, I hope, will carry forward for the remainder of the neighborhood plans. And everyone wants their plan to go first. But you recognize as this growth and change is coming, the communities that are going to be impacted before others is the far northeast is the east area, which is'",
        "'speaker_5': 'why those are the ones that were the first two that we're doing because that's where the change is coming. So applauding everyone that has been a part of it. Yes. We didn't get into the nuances of environmental resilience.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But if you look at plan 2040, that is one of our six pillars that talks about being environmentally resilient. So we are making sure that we're taking care of that for our city. So I think that is fair.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But recognize, this is one of many plans that we have now that are we are now moving forward through this council process. So I think we're checking all the bases to make sure that we're touching the things that are very important.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So and I want to acknowledge, Councilwoman Gilmore, because a huge part of this is in District 11. I had a small part in District eight. So her leadership and this as well cannot be understated. So thank you, Councilwoman Gilmore, for this.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I urge my colleagues to support this. And I look forward to making this vision become a reality. Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Herndon, and see no other council members chiming in. I will go ahead and speak as well. And it's been a great partnership, Councilman Herndon and all of the community meetings that that we turned out, you know, Eugene Courtland, Lily, Val, you really are part of the far northeast family and you'll continue getting invites to'",
        "'speaker_0': 'everything because it's important we keep you involved. And, you know, this was a crucial time for us as a community because with the changes that we have throughout the city and folks really being concerned about gentrification and involuntary displacement, but that we didn't want to have to make that hard decision, that we weren't going to get the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'grocery stores that we wanted or the entertainment or retail options that we need and deserve in our neighborhood. And so it was the perfect time for this plan. And, you know, Senate Bill 181 did open up a lot of different conversations for us as a neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so, you know, there is not any fracking happening in our residential areas in Denver. I want to be very clear about that. It the only wells that exist are at the airport at Denver International Airport, and they have not been active since May of 2018 because Anadarko shut down their pipeline.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so currently there is no activity. But we know that our surrounding municipalities and counties are very active and we want to be aware if there is any sort of horizontal drilling or any environmental concerns or health and safety.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We now within our community, I believe, have organized ourselves in a really, really strong way. And so when there are opportunities through the rulemaking at the state, we are going to be present and be part of those conversations.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I'm glad that that was read into the record, but that, you know, more work to be done. And we've got grocery stores, we've got different amenities that are now very interested in our neighborhood, you know, May eight, the day after.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Our election, we had an announcement that Natural Grocers is locating at the corner of Green Valley Ranch Boulevard and Tower Road. And so things are happening, and we've now created that framework to make sure that we have the most comprehensive and complete neighborhood that we possibly can have.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So thank you so much for for your work on this, the CPD staff and to my community, to my neighbors and folks in the far northeast. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for always being there, showing up and being part of the conversation because that's really what makes our neighborhoods so great.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so thank you again, seeing no other comments. Madam Secretary, roll call.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Black Eye Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Herndon I.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Cashman.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Kenny.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Ortega I assessment i Madam President, I Madam Secretary, please close the voting and announce the results. Eight Guys eight Eyes Council Bill 477 has passed. All right, wonderful. We have one pre adjournment announcement on Monday, June 17th, 2019.'"
