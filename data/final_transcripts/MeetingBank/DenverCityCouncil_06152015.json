        "'speaker_6': 'I remember working with him on numerous occasions when I represented District nine, and then when I got reelected, he reached out to me and said, If you have any community event, you'd let me know and we'll be there to play for you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And on numerous occasions he did that. And when I heard that he had passed, it just, you know, just left a hole in my heart because he was just such a an incredible human being. And I can't imagine to his family how much he's he's missed.'",

Often the ones you remember are either the difficult ones or the humorous ones. And it was a particularly difficult time when we broke ground on the improvements to Fillmore Plaza one January or February.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And but the the Business Improvement District knew that I loved the municipal band, so they invited the municipal band brass group out to play. The only problem was it was below zero degrees and their hands, their mouths were freezing to the instruments.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'A follow up to that is the community so valued the municipal band that they decided they would start having concerts in Pulaski Park if they couldn't always have them on Fillmore Plaza? And I think this year will be the sixth annual Pulaski Park concert that has really grown.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The neighborhood brings in food trucks. And then finally, after doing annual concerts in Cheesman Park with the Cheeseman Park advocacy group in my office, Jerry Ensley and I kept talking about, wouldn't it be great to have people dancing on the pavilion?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So for the last several years, he had the municipal band Jazz Ensemble playing there, and we had actually behind the pavilion in the Rose Gardens, looking out at the mountains and at the downtown skylight in the setting sun.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I don't think there's really a more visually beautiful experience that I had the whole time I was in office. And of course, it was shared with the whole community. So it's great. Remembering Jerry.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilman Rob. Councilman Lopez.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilman Monteiro. It was very sad. I did not get the news until well more than a month and a half after he had passed. Two months after he had passed, it was very, very, very sad because he always sent me a message to see if there was anything going on in the district that they can'",
        "'speaker_3': 'come and play and. And he was always really happy to do it. And every so every year what they did for us for the last eight years was I said, Well, there's only one time I need you to do it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And occasional occasionally other other events we did too. But he and the band would come 7:00 in the morning, set up on those Saturdays in December to do the Sam Santo's Christmas Basket event. And they would sit up right in the middle of this whole assembly area as everybody's assembling Christmas baskets, and they'd bring that that small'",
        "'speaker_3': 'little jazz ensemble, and they'd be playing Christmas carols. Christmas music. And that really made the event. And if you can imagine these boxes of bread and turkey and potatoes and carrots being assembled, and these are boxes that are delivered to folks in need throughout the city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then listening to the Christmas carols, it wasn't for the last eight years. Christmas really didn't make sense until those moments combined together. And it was. And they will always be a part of it, even though he's not here with us.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I will always remember that. And those are images that will never leave my mind and understanding that spirit. So it's solemn to talk about. Is it sad? Is he just so full of life and so full of music to share with all of us?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we I'm glad that we all had an opportunity to actually listen to his spirit.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Thank you so much, Councilman Lopez. Are there any other comments I would like to also express to your family? I think you're. I would also like to express to you that it must have been a blast growing up with your dad because he was music.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'He was a bundle of expression and and music. And the idea that he would come to any event at any given time playing more than one role, he would be playing the long trumpets for an opening, and then he would drop that and change character and go and be part of the larger ensemble.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And he was so flexible and. And he just cared so much. Many of us serve in public service because we love the city and we care about it. And your father chose to express his civic mindedness and his spirit through his music and through the Denver Municipal Municipal Band.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so there was never a time when I asked Gerald if he would help in any way. He never, ever said, no, I don't think it was in his vocabulary, and I would have to dial it back and understand this is a human being that can only has so much energy to do all of these different things'",
        "'speaker_1': '. But can you imagine just the idea of having live music by live musicians, going to some of the neighborhoods that maybe otherwise wouldn't have ever been able to experience a jazz band or the larger band. So I just want you to know that he was amazing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And my only regret is that I should have sent him more thank you notes and should have said thank you more often. You just never expect that you know they won't be here anymore and they're gone in a heartbeat.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I want to thank you so much for for being here tonight and also allowing for us to be able to express to you how much we loved your dad and the municipal band and that his spirit will live on.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Madam Secretary, roll call, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Liman. I Lopez. I Ortega. I Rob. I Shepherd. I'm brown. I fought i. Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I. Madam Secretary, please close the voting and announce the results.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You need to press your.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Did I forget to vote?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Nope. We got it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Shall we limit.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The eight eyes?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. Eight I's proclamation 403 has been adopted. Councilwoman Lehman, is there someone that you would like to invite up to the podium?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I would like to invite the family up to the podium and kind of introduce yourselves and. Just accept the proclamation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah. I'm Pamela.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Ensley.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm Gerald's wife.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And thank you for sending that card. And thank you for your kind words about Jerry and the band.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I'm Marguerite Ansley, a daughter. And we really appreciate everything that you've said about him and his hard work, and we definitely see that. So thank you so much for doing this proclamation and sharing it with us. I really appreciate it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. And thank you for joining us this evening. Health one. Rob, will you please read proclamation 428.'"
