    "A resolution approving a proposed Agreement between the City and County of Denver, on behalf of itself and the Denver Workforce Development Board and Eckerd Youth Alternatives, Inc. to provide one-stop operator and comprehensive services specific to employment and training as required under Denvers Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) funding. Approves a contract with Eckerd Connects for $2,500,000 and through 6-30-21 to provide one-stop operator and comprehensive services specific to employment and training as required under Denvers Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) funding and other special state revenue or grant-funded workforce initiatives, citywide (OEDEV-202054623-00). The last regularly scheduled Council meeting within the 30-day review period is on 6-29-20. The Committee approved filing this item at its meeting on 6-3-20. Pursuant to Council Rule 3.7, Councilmember Herndon called out this item at the 6-15-20 meeting for a one-week postponement to 6-22-20.": [
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember CdeBaca has called out Bill 508 for questions under Bill's for final consideration. No items have been called out and under pending. No items have been called out. Did I miss anything? Okay. Looks like we got them all.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So, Madam Secretary, will you please put the first item on our screens? And, Councilmember Ortega, will you please put resolution 488 on the floor?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Mr. President, I moved the council resolution 488 be adopted.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Council member has been moved. Can I get a second? It has been moved and seconded. Thank you. Questions or comments by members of Council Council Member CdeBaca.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I called this one out for a vote, as it was mentioned in public comment. We're looking to an agency in Clearwater, Florida, to do what many of our nonprofits here in Denver could be doing, should be doing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I speak from experience when I say this because I ran a youth development program that utilized we have funds every single summer to pay our students to serve our students. And it's interesting to me that we would contract with an agency that in 2018, in in in Florida was basically threatened.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They have a $77 million contract with the state of Florida. And there were issues with one of the components of their work related to foster youth. And the state of Florida actually threatened to pull their contract because of their lack of performance in Florida.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I'm wondering why we don't investigate these things and why we even allow this to be considered and come this far, this late in the game for summer when there are known issues in the place of origin.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I would like to encourage my colleagues to vote no on this, especially because right now we have so many youth programs that are struggling to stay alive in the city of Denver. They need our support. And $2.5 million is definitely some support that could be reallocated in different ways.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Councilmember each.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate my colleague raising an important question. Is there someone here who can speak to this contract tonight?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilwoman. I'm going to sound like a broken record every week. But we get these call outs about half an hour or 45 minutes for the meeting. So I don't have anyone here. I'm happy to try and answer what I can.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. I first want to ask, I understand the word youth is in the title of the entity that this contact is related to. But is this particular contract for youth employment services? Can you just clarify because I see another one on the agenda for 89 that says that it is for services to out-of-school youth.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This one I read, it says one stop operator, which appears to me to be the adult service provider. So I just want to make sure we're all on the same page about which contract is which. Can you clarify?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah, that's correct, Councilwoman. This one is the contract for services to adults and dislocated workers.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. And so there is a separate contract for youth. Correct. Do you know if either of the contracts and if the president may allow me if I can just ask a question about the other one. So that is that for efficiency?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Is that okay, Mr. President?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yup. Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Do either of these contracts, the adult contract or the separate youth, one which is not on the floor right now, do either of those contracts have subcontracts to local providers within them? Do we know?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know, I don't know the answer to that. We can certainly follow up and get you that information.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There are, if I might, there are a couple of other contracts that are lower dollar value not coming through the council process. There's a $100,000 contract for a center for employment opportunities to serve out-of-school youth and $115,000 contract with Urban Peak to provide services to out-of-school youth for youth experiencing homelessness.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Those who just are not coming through the council process.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. So if I may follow up, Mr. President. So it's in the past, sometimes we have the prime subcontract. In this case, the community is being directly contracted by the city in separate contracts.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I believe that is correct if I am reading this correctly.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Can I add to that real quick.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To that to that point?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Now, just to clarify for Robin, go ahead. And each councilman can each based on the committee explanation of this there and when you do summer programing, the city of Denver used to do the the training part prior to placing students into nonprofit agencies.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so there was a required core curriculum. And from the safety committee, this is the provider of the online core curriculum. And the other one was for youth with disabilities.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. And I will apologize because this one was called out by our deadline. And so I will look into why that didn't get communicated over in time. And also look at it. Or maybe we can have a brief discussion about our deadline.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I know in COVID times trying to avoid having as many people over, and I appreciate that to keep everybody as safe as possible. But and so I apologize. Something on this one was called out by our deadline. And I don't know how we missed getting everything over to you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we should discuss some efficiencies on that. So you don't have to keep any up being up at the microphone answering when we could have somebody else.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So. Sounds great. Thanks. And the reason I really bring it up is I don't want anyone to think the agencies don't care enough to have somebody down here. It really is about managing the number of bodies in the room and the quick turnaround time to get people who are working from home here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So that's why I keep raising it. I just don't want anybody. I appreciate that and I think doesn't want to be here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, let's work on on both ends on how we make that work better. And I apologize for that. Councilmember Torres.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I have a few numbers that I got. I think it's a valid question. And I, I would have like to hear from Dito about the questions that Councilwoman CdeBaca brought up. But I do want to make sure that folks understand what the 2.5 million is going forward.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And for adults in 2019.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They had 23,000 unique contacts in the workforce centers so far. In 2020, they've had 35,000 contacts in workforce centers. So it's to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Manage all of those through the.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Folks looking for work. So it's the youth component. There are two segments, one for out-of-school youth, one for in-school youth, out-of-school youth. We will see the $550,000 contract to ability connection Colorado. They are also contracting, though we will not see 100,000 for Center for Youth Employment I'm sorry, Center for Employment Opportunity Opportunities and 115,000 for Urban.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Peak for.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In-School youth, a collection of $945,000 in contracts for DPS. So it's it's more multifaceted than the 2.5 million for adults seeking work. But I think that would have been a helpful thing to demonstrate even in chambers so that we have a good understanding of what's happening with the money and where is it going to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I will be voting in favor of this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember. Councilmember heard it. Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I want to as I was looking at this, this contract is through June 30th of 2021. So I'm.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Assuming that the contract.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Ends June 30th of this year. It is going for one year. So I was going to suggest since Dito.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Was did.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Not have the opportunity and this is a.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'One reading resolution, a utilize my ability as a council member to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Request a delay for one week so we can have consideration so Dito can come speak to any question council members have will have the ability to vote and still should be able to meet the timing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Deadline, if that's actually true, that the contract ends at.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The end of this month. Sorry. I apologize. I was double checking the order here. So you were proposing that we hold this? Yes. Okay. Amenable. Councilmember, you said if I could call it out for a vote tonight, are you amenable to that as an alternative?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That would be helpful, Mr. President. And I think that the specific question about contracting with agencies that are being threatened to have their contracts pulled in their state of origin, I think that is a question that must be answered as we get more information about this particular contract.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So before I ask our Secretary procedurally how we might do that, since you're amenable. Councilmember Hines, you had buzzed in also on this item. Are you amenable to the new plan? Can we go to that or did you want to jump in at this point?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I wanted is the only thing I wanted to say is that I have in the past made one controversial decision that delayed a consideration for a week. So I wanted to be on the record as supporting Councilmember Herndon's delay for a week.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, Madam Secretary, how would you like us to unwind having something on the floor to vote on so that we do this right for the delay instead?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If we can just please have Councilmember Ortega withdraw the motion and council member can each second that withdraw term.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's very official. Thank you. Excellent. All right, Madam Secretary. Now, what. What do we need for the postponement?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Just for the record, we will be postponing Counsel Council Resolution 2488 for one week to June 22nd pursuant to Rule 3.7.'"

And so I will be voting no, because I think that we need to do a much better job with our appointments to boards and commissions.

Our zoning code right now actually codifies the fact that people can't be in beds in some cases because a shelter might lose its, quote unquote, emergency overflow status.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Those are some of the back flips our current zoning code requires of providers. So I just want to say that if these issues are important, it is about money. It's about our budget conversation, it's about the safety conversation, but it's also about zoning.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. President. This one is up for first reading. But I do have a question. I have a few questions to list for you to take back. But my main question here is the dates. So we're adding $75,807 and six months for a new end date of 630, 2020.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Can you explain the the contract change and the date and what exactly this is funding?'",

        "'speaker_2': 'And so what is the half fund?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So the half is for two FTE positions with our Colorado State Judicial Department. Two positions. One is for our great program and the second is for our state judicial gun probation. So there are two FTE for probation officers that do work in our schools.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Our great program to date has served over 9000 students and our successful rates of kids who enter into the school and maybe they're possessing a gun. The success rates for Denver County are around 57% approval rate compared to about 46% across the state.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we see a lot of success.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hang on. Hold on. Walk me through that again. Yeah. Metric for success.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah. So great question. So we are pulling out my notes. So the state of Colorado, we have the juvenile intensive supervision program. And for Denver, for individuals, young people who have handgun cases, the success rate for our individuals was 57%.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'For those outside or statewide, the success rate was 43%.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But what is the success like? What is.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes, yes, yeah, great question. So when we do our intervention services, it's it's basically administered to Sean Combs, who's our chief probation officer. And it's several different tactics that they use. It's one is supervision, and then they do prevention and they do suppression work.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And it's in tandem with our grant network and our grant network. They provide family counseling. They also provide partnerships with community organizations to help with food. And so they walk or they track a young person making sure that they're in class, they're completing their class, that they're in home at a certain period of time, and that they're'",
        "'speaker_4': 'completing all of the necessary requirements from the state.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So is this funding the gun pilot that we had been discussing and safety?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'No, that's a separate request. And that's a that was the handgun that was a program out of Mobile, Alabama, that our state our state partners were pursuing. But that that's not a part of this. And I forget what that's called.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It was the hip program, handgun intervention program.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So this gun probation officer is a Denver thing. Is this something that we've always had or what makes this gun prevention or what makes this probation officer different than all the rest of them?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah, this program has been in effect since 2011. And what's different about our program is that we we are and this is what the Grant Network is really in partnership with community partners. So for folks who are unfamiliar with Grant, it's, it's, it's a program that's, that's based on three, three tools, prevention, intervention and suppression.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we have grid networks struggle them on below. We have the Dream Center that serves Southwest Denver. And then we have impact empowerment. That's in Councilman Herndon's district. And these three providers, they work with our probation officer, probation chief probation officer Sean Cone.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so once an individual or young person is has been identified as being either gang involved or has some gun case, they they work in partnership to identify what the needs are. Because understanding that and it's a great question with the struggles and not being in schools anymore.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And while we're advocating for new safety programs and grit to take a more elevated role in our schools is because we are actually looking at the whole system or looking at the whole the whole person, rather. And so that's what makes it unique is that it's in partnership with the community and we do wraparound services with the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'entire family.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So this is just on first reading, but some of the questions that I'm looking for answers for is a specific breakdown on how the dollars are going to be used. Can you give us some numbers about success and metrics and a fully, fully formed definition of success and where we can get information publicly?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Because on the Denver Gov website, there are some drop downs, but there's no downloadable data about the impact of this program since 2011. And as we move officers out of schools, I think it's important for us to be very conscious of how the city uses officers with young people, and this is one of those contracts that does'",
        "'speaker_2': 'deals directly with our young people. So I want us to scrutinize this one a little bit more heavily than we have in the past.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah, these are probation officers. They're more like. Officers. But yeah, I got two or three questions. Let me just repeat them. Breakdown at dollars, breakdown of what success looks like. And then just from a transparency perspective, where can you find this effort or these programs happy to provide us.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And the explanation on how we're operating in a time of COVID without the access to the schools that the great program relies on?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah. So these contracts come to an end on 630 this this month. And so we were considering bringing or separating these two contracts after July 1st and doing an RFP process, given that we've been operating these contracts since 2011 of actually doing a competitive bidding process and looking at other community partners that could come in and do'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the work in partnership with the state. And so that was the goal to separate the great contract and the gun court probation manager, and we were planning on doing that after July 1st. So I think your question.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'As long as we get a breakdown of where $75,000 is going within two weeks, that would be helpful.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We have that information.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, there are a couple other in the queue, so you might stay there. Councilmember Gilmore.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. President Clark. Michael, following Councilwoman say to Bucky's questions and follow up, you said that this would cover two FTE positions. So is the 75,087 specifically to cover those two full time positions. So so when you mentioned Struggle of Love or other community organizations, none of the 75,087 and $0.82 is going to struggle, love or community'",
        "'speaker_2': 'organizations?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's correct. There. Those three providers are paid out of our professional services and that's around $600,000 for struggle of impact, empowerment and the Dream Center.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. And then so this is going to go towards paying for two FTE positions. And are the probation officers if if we weren't in a COVID situation, are those individuals actually in the physical school building?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes, they they are. And they work with the they work with the principal to make sure that there is supervision inside the school and outside the school.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Is there a reason that that happens during the school day? Wouldn't it make more sense for the student to be in class?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah, so great question. So typically what they do is they'll meet with the principal beforehand and they'll they'll recommend time like gym or lunch will they'll do a check in, but that it just depends on the case and the severity of the incident.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And if a young person has a gun or is seriously involved in a crime, then that would potentially require some level of supervision inside of the school.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So as a follow up, I would like a little bit more information about exactly how these two FTE positions interface with both Denver public school students and the school personnel. And, you know, when we're talking about community organizations, this is almost $1,000,000.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If the 75,000 is added in and to councilwoman say to Baca's earlier question about the 2.5 million that was possibly going to Eckerd, that adds up to almost $3.5 million, both through workforce and through this agreement with the Colorado State Judicial Department.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And those are dollars that we would like to now keep in specifically black communities and figure out how we work that and how we expedite that and saying that people might not have the.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Capacity to do that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'As small organizations. I think there's a lot of support in the community to make sure that organizations can build that capacity as we begin to phase out old systems and asking new questions about that. And so I'd really like to get a little bit more information because as much work as the GRID program does in our community'",
        "'speaker_2': ', since I was elected in 2015, I have attended seven vigils in the Montebello and our community specifically. And so I don't know how well this is working. It's clearly not working for some of our families and students. And I just want to make sure that we're evaluating it fully and that you're providing all that information to counsel'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so that we can ask good questions.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And appreciate that. And I appreciate the honest assessment.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Great. Thank you. Thank you, President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Clerk. Thank Councilmember Councilmember.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. Great questions from my colleagues. I was just looking up because I wanted to refresh myself. We had a great presentation on the full program back on 531 2018, and so I just found the presentation in Granicus.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So, you know, it's helpful as I'm looking at it, some of my questions were asked about dollars that are going to community groups from other budget items. So I know that councilwoman back box request was for how this 75,000 is being spent, but it's helpful actually to see the whole picture since this is just one grant.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yep. It sounds like we also might need the exact language on what these funds are eligible for and what the rules are under the state. To Councilwoman Gilmore's question, it sounds like this money's already spent. Truthfully, this contract is the work is already ending.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I think this is more about looking to the future than, yeah, you know, this is going to be done. But the other question I had was, you know, in terms of other prevention efforts, you know, grasp or other community based organizations, I believe we are funding as well.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If you have a quick answer on that tonight, that's great. But if you're not adding that in, well, even both, if you have a quick answer, but then adding that information to what you provide to us, because it's hard to look at one piece of the picture and understand what we're doing.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I'd like to see kind of that whole picture. And again, this PowerPoint from, you know, it's now a little outdated, but it does have kind of that whole picture in it. But maybe something's changed since then. So we are we still funding grasp from the city and if so, from what budget is that being funded?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah, we are funding grass through the Department of Public Health and Environment Excellence.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we're doing some of our gaming. So and I just can I ask a naive question, is the difference that this particular program we're here to talk about tonight is for youth who are already justice involved. Okay. So this is more about preventing the occurrence reoccurrence.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then we have other funding streams that are about prevention, for lack of a better word, further upstream before someone's just started.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That is correct. This is more on the intervention side.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Thank you. That's helpful.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Councilmember Hines.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. Wyatt speaking to take Councilmember. Can you just wonderful words yet again to ask a naive question, why are we paying more to exit sooner?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's just because we got to fill. We're if we're we're filling the fault but half of the half of the half of the year so is from is from start date of January to June 30th.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So what was this? Was this for a full year?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This is for half the year.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But the but we're so we're changing the end date to six 3020. What was the original end date?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The original. End date was scheduled for December. And we're we're amending that to cut it short on the 30th of this month.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So the so the original total was for December for $999,000.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'No, no, no, no. That's okay. I know that that dollar amount is reflective of the full contract since 2011.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. Thank you. That that that answers my question. Thank you for and and indulging me. The other question I have is you this is ending this contract but you also mentioned our of PS and whatnot. Denver public schools just unanimously voted to exit.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Sorrows out of our schools. What have. I'm assuming you're in consultation with TPS. And if so, what are their thoughts about any sort of future program that are along these lines?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, school board members T Anderson and Jennifer Bacon, they passed that resolution on last Thursday. And they've tasked Superintendent Suzanne Cordova with putting together a strategy to have before the board in August. And what we've communicated to the Board of Education to Superintendent Suzanne Cordova, is that we want to be a partner.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We have Denver youth safety programs that is in schools today or currently they do pre-arrest diversion programs. They're there at North High School, they're at West Campus. And that these are programs that are designed to in that school to gyp school to prison pipeline.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so if we're going to remove SRO as out, then could we look at these type of restorative justice practices inside of our schools with community partners because you safety programs, they have community partners that they do work with as well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so can we have these conversations? And the answer to that question is yes. And so we're going to start we're a part of that stakeholder gathering process that Suzanne Cordova is going to be working with to kind of provide some expertize and also to begin to look at what's the future of of our relationship.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think it could be a great one. I think I stand and supportive of argue safety programs office. The work that they did at North High School and West Campus were phenomenal. I was I did the version when I was at my Bell High School.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I know Councilwoman CdeBaca did the version as well. And we both landed in really good positions. So I believe in that program, and I think that that can help replace that SRO role that historically was in school.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember. All right. See no other questions or comments on this one. We're going to move on. And that was our last one. So that concludes the item to be called out this evening. Our bills for introduction are ordered published and council members remember that this is a consent or block vote and you will need to'"
