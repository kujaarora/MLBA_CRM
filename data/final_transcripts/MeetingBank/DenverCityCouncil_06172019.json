        "'speaker_11': 'provide that sort of those opportunities that we were talking about talked about in the importance we also heard throughout the process was for for something that created a variety of building shapes and there was a variety of building heights as being important that the building step backs and the shaping and the massing and sort of the ground'",
        "'speaker_11': 'access to to light and to sky views being important and would work in conjunction with other sort of design standards and guidelines. And and here we're showing kind of an area in the distance with a height above 20 storeys to about 30 storeys to a maximum height of 30 storeys.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And those from the 20 to 3 storey allows even greater step backs, greater affordability. And sort of in the area that's just south of the stadium, primarily, we've mapped the map to be allowed to actually get up to that height.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The waterways are a valuable component to creating a thriving neighborhood as a gateway into the project, as a front door to an active river edge and the introduction. And then in the design guidelines section, there is a river vision and design recommendations for the buildings on and facing the river and the gulch, including pedestrian access.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The idea that if you're going to be entering or if you're going to be on balconies and other things like that, you can be on the river, facing the river. It's it's something to be at instead of something to ignore and be on your side.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And there are sort of additional parts of this are talked to about some additional transition elements that we want to be seen kind of at those edges, particularly the river, but also Old West Colfax and some other places in the plan.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'You can see this maps here with these additional discussions and with the nearby neighborhood and community input, it was important for us to make sure we had a good map, clear map of where the 20 story recommendations would be with those additional requirements for for transitions and the hatched and the kind of area south of the stadium'",
        "'speaker_11': 'that will have that 30 story height available there is mapped on this and is really important for particularly Jefferson Parks, the mother and some other places to actually understand what they were able to see to and see through in the space.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Lastly, on the land use some built form. Additional street sections are shown here that shows sort of the suite of strategies. We know that one thing is going to make a great neighborhood, but things need to work together.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'These additional strategies, design standards and guidelines create that people first that pedestrian first guidance. And so we have a section in the plan related design standards and guidelines. I will now transition to, of course, as we move on to mobility recommendations.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hello. I'm Sarah, of course, the city planner with community planning and development. So the next section in the plan is mobility. The current plan area lacks a cohesive, multimodal street network, and so the plan recommends to create this multimodal street network and to provide new vehicular pedestrian and bicyclists connections.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'd also like to point out that this diagram, as well as other diagrams within the plan, just show one scenario that can implement the plans, goals and strategies. The plan also recommends a very important A-grade intersection with West Colfax Avenue and a future North-South connection within the plan area.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This is a very important intersection to further connect the plan area, but also to further the functionality of the stadium's operations. In addition to that, I want to point out that all the plan, recommendations and strategies apply to the Federal Boulevard and West Colfax Cloverleaf Interchange Area.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This includes the mobility, land use and quality of life infrastructure recommendations. In addition to creating a connected multimodal street network, this plan recommends prioritizing pedestrians, creating a complete network of high ease of use, bicycle facilities, and increasing access to multi-use trails and pathways, especially prioritizing connections to the South Platte River.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This plan includes a bike network diagram, and it includes recommendations that recommend a variety of bicycle facilities, including bicycle facilities that are grade separated or protected bike lanes. Throughout the planning process, we heard there should be a variety of street types, so this plan recommends several different street types.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We explored these street types and included images within the plan that sort of portray how these three types might be built out or what they might accommodate. Mixed use streets could accommodate wider pedestrian and amenity zones, and they should also incorporate high ease of use bicycle facilities.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Main Street should accommodate high quality pedestrian and amenity zones and festival streets which are shared. Streets should accommodate high levels of pedestrian activity and especially events.

        "'speaker_0': 'incorporated within them. The plan also recommends implementing an area wide transportation demand management plan and to utilize the strategies to improve every day and game day area wide circulation. There's also a spread within the plan that further explains transfer transportation demand management strategies and outlines what these strategies are, including programmatic design, transit, parking and commute trip reduction'",
        "'speaker_0': 'strategies. This plan and this section also identifies some recommendations to retrofit or replace the Cloverleaf at Federal Boulevard and West Colfax Avenue, and that we should continue to collaborate to explore a transformation of the Cloverleaf Interchange that builds upon past planning efforts and studies.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The most recent effort has been done by the West Colfax Business Improvement District, and they have identified an alternative that could be potentially implemented in the future. And this alternative is portrayed in the three images below. The last section within this chapter is Quality of Life Infrastructure.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The plan recommends incorporating a variety of parks and public spaces across the planned area, and that these public spaces should be publicly accessible, including the parks and facilities associated with this plan area, and that they should also incorporate a variety of activities for people of all ages, abilities and incomes to enjoy year round.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In addition to that, we recognize all of the projects and efforts going on right now and that we should continue to look to coordinate our efforts between other plans, projects and future development. In addition to that, we want to recommend that there should be a variety of amenities included within these public spaces, especially active and passive users'",
        "'speaker_0': ', and that we should utilize best practices for stormwater management and to expand upon the tree canopy across the plant area. This plan also includes a matrix that further identifies what parks and public spaces should accommodate potential sizes, their distribution and location, and also potential amenities and elements that could be incorporated within these spaces.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Last but not least, this plan recommend recommends prioritizing the South Platte River and to enhance the public space adjacent to it. It includes strategies to foster an interactive relationship with the river, to transform the public space adjacent the river, and to utilize the river as a very important connecting link between existing and future development.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The last section of the plan is moving forward, which includes implementation strategies. These strategies include regulatory policy, public investment and partnership strategies. In addition to that, this plan includes a summary of community benefit priorities, including items that may be addressed in a community benefits agreement between the developer and the community.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There are three criteria that have been established in the comprehensive plan 2040 that this plan must meet or be consistent with to be adopted. The first criteria is an inclusive community process. As Jason outlines before me, there has been quite an inclusive community process with a variety of community outreach and community engagement.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we have found that the Stadium District Master Plan was developed through an inclusive community process. The second criteria is plan consistency. This plan utilizes the comprehensive plan 2046 vision elements and builds upon them. In addition to that, it also utilizes the blueprint.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Denver Three elements of a complete neighborhood and the Decatur Federal Station Area Plan is there and provides guidance while this plan builds upon it and provides further detailed guidance for this plan area. Given that we have found that the Stadium District Master Plan is consistent with the Denver Comprehensive Plan 2040 and other city plans, the last criteria'",
        "'speaker_0': 'is long term view. The Stadium District Master Plan establishes goals, recommendations and strategies that will guide change in the plan area for the next 20 plus years. It also recognizes that plan implementation takes place over the course of many years and may take shape in multiple phases, including short term and long term phases.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Given that the Stadium District Master Plan encompasses a long term view, so finally, based on the findings that the applicable review criteria has been met. Staff recommends adoption of the Stadium District Master Plan as a supplement to the Comprehensive Plan 2040.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you. We have 17 individuals signed up to speak this evening. I'm going to. Call the first five speakers. If you could please make your way to the bench here in the front, that will help speed up our proceedings.'",

My name is Hosea Butera, the co-owner of Rice's brewing company, a Latinxs LGBTQ veteran, immigrant and woman owned business located at 26 West Colfax Avenue in the Sun Valley neighborhood. I'm here today to speak in support of the creation of the Stadium District Master Plan.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I believe the plan has been well thought out and participated by the community. Thanks to the leadership of Jason Whitlock and his staff. My support isn't without any caveats. As a former Chamber of Commerce President, Commissioner for the City of Boulder and Community and Cultural Broker, it was my responsibility as a member of the Steering Committee to'",
        "'speaker_10': 'make sure that progress is with our public benefit. A key point on this plan calls for the conservation of Sun Valley's diversity. Diversity and inclusion needs to be maintained by making sure that affordable housing, affordable commercial rentals and businesses owned by underserved groups becomes a priority and don't get lost in the process.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Local employment and access to training opportunities should also be a priority. Sun Valley is made up of mostly women and kids, so those considerations need emphasis as well. Furthermore, the inclusion of the businesses wedged between the Platte River and I-25 but immediately next to the district is a must.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Steam on the Platte Mile High Station still works near Wolf Lift Rice is Brewing Company and many other businesses need to be taken into consideration since they represent businesses that are have been there or will already be there even before the district happens.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I thank you for your time in considering the topics brought before you and the signing of a neighborhood benefits agreement drafted by the community to go along with this plan to make sure that our most vulnerable and needed do not get forgotten.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'This is an opportunity for our city to serve as a model and say, yes, we can be progressive while putting people first. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_10': 'Resident of Sun.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Valley.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And my address is 2727 West Holden Place.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think that the stadium district plan will pass. I don't believe that it's ready yet because from History Stadium District has not acted in good faith to complete the parts that impact the surrounding community. They may do community work across the city, but they don't do what it takes in their own community to mitigate the impacts.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So one of the things that needs to be excluded.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Is that there will never be any aviation uses at that site on top of any of those buildings. We don't need a friends of.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Mach heliport up on top of one of those buildings. It's happened before.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We don't need it again. When we had then first.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This stadium built under the plan that.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Built it into in.'",
        "'speaker_6': '98 the we ended up with a traffic problem that was studied by fears.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And peers and their conclusion was you would be hard pressed in North America to find a residential use street that has the volume, speed and character of the traffic that we have on Decatur. They recommended closing the street.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'To eliminate the traffic. Now we're going to increase the traffic.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'When in this plan.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Is the traffic through a community that has the highest percentage of children known in the nation. Nobody has ever matched it or found one. It runs from 54% to 66% over the last 20 years, and they're.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Mostly.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Under 14. I mean, they're mostly kids. We cannot absorb the traffic. The original plan had mitigate. It was supposed to plan to make the changes on their footprint to attached to the full facts. What in the 98 plan has informed this plan?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I think it's not ready to be passed. I think these questions need to be addressed and amendments need to be made before.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This plan moves forward. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Derek Friedman.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Hi. My name's Tarik Friedman. I am a Denver entrepreneur. I own two retail concepts sports fan and soccer, and I employ dozens of people in the city and one of my stores is immediately adjacent to this project. I was a steering team member and was really amazed by the content and rigor of the process.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There are so many opportunities for the public to get involved and I was just really impressed by all of the thoughts that were shared. Immediately after buying a sports fan, I traveled around the country to look for other places to expand, and I was looking particularly close to other stadiums, and I was surprised to find the contrast'",
        "'speaker_6': 'between places like Detroit and Cleveland and Minneapolis. Um, I choose to live near Denver. In Denver. And I was surprised at the sharp contrast between the environments around those stadiums and the one that we have. And so what I love about this plan and why I'm so enthusiastic about it is because it transforms the stadium from an'",
        "'speaker_6': 'island that's separated from its surrounding communities to something that's integrated fully and brings all those neighborhoods together. It transforms empty lots into a vibrant, mixed use community with designation for affordable housing. I hope that this plan has your support and I'm really excited for the transformation to start.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Next up, we have Jeanne Granville.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening. My name is Jean Granville, 2715 West told in place. I am speaking here tonight as president of the Sun Valley Community Coalition. I was also a member of the steering committee representing the coalition and I am also a member of the West Side Stadium Community Coalition that has an interest in really ensuring that community benefits'",
        "'speaker_2': 'are addressed within the plan as and on an ongoing basis. So I really want to thank you for everyone's support and inclusion of all of us in the process. We're really excited about the vision for a mixed use everyday neighborhood that will really transform the northern part of our Sun Valley neighborhood giving, providing housing, jobs and amenities'",
        "'speaker_2': 'along with an exciting gameday, cultural and entertainment experiences. I want to thank you for expanding the plan to include some of the work and efforts that are already underway, both east of the river, as you've just heard, as well as in regards to the Cloverleaf and what that future may be.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We did have some concerns, I think, as you've heard about traffic management plan and particularly impact of construction and ongoing and density that will be developed, its impact on the southern part in particular where there are so many children and residents.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I want to thank Councilman Lopez and his office for really taking the initiative to go ahead and start that conversation with public works to see if we can't do some things to mitigate some of the immediate concerns of already unsafe conditions as well as going forward.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So thank you for that. I also want to thank and really recognize the Stadium District and the Broncos for really their openness in inviting the community to envision a neighborhood in the northern part of our neighborhood far beyond what we could have ever imagined in the Decatur Federal Station area plan.'",

And I was on top of the ballot for at large this past May election.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I got over 15,000 votes with no money. We are against this. I keep hearing all this talk about inclusivity, but from the photos that I've just seen displayed in front of me, I have seen nothing inclusive about any of it.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I see nothing but white people. I honestly know people of color and historically people of color. A neighborhood, an area that has the most children of color in one area. And we are refugees. And there's all kinds of people of color in this neighborhood to say nothing of that represented in these pictures.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So I had several questions. I want to know what was the AMA level for this affordable housing I keep hearing about? What were the wages for these commercial developments? Because you say that you're going to put the people in a community to work.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'How much are you going to pay them an hour? Is it going to be a livable wage? And just so you know, a livable wage is 25 plus an hour to afford a one or two bedroom in downtown or decent Denver proper.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I agree with Phillip with the traffic study. I have partnered with West Denver United during this whole campaign season. I worked with them and I've seen exactly how neglected this Sun Valley is. And my good friend David Roybal, who ran for office, too, is a native.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And he's told me on numerous occasions that he was not in approval of this, and I am not in approval of it as well. I was not in approval of the comprehensive plan either because I didn't believe it was given enough ample giving people ample enough time to read and review it and to actually come up with'",
        "'speaker_10': 'their own conclusions with it. So I want to know what is the AMA level for this sustainable housing? What are the wages for the employment? And is there going to be a traffic study done for this area? Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Next up, we have Chris Roller son.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening, Chris Roller said. And I'm representing the Sun Valley Youth Center and all the kids of Sun Valley. So we are in our 20th year. It's our birthday this year and so we are in support of this with the concern around safety and kids.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So a lot of the times the trails and the streets are designed for people who know how to ride bicycles, but not necessarily the youth. And Sun Valley had 335 units previous. There will be upwards of 4000 and more with the new development.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I'm assuming there would also be more children coming into some of those newer high rise properties. So assuming those kids want to come and access services at the youth center, how do we have safe transport from the new areas and the new spaces to us?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The plat trail is not safe for kids. It's great for commuting and it's great for folks who are grown. But a lot of our kids don't have parents going back and forth with them. So I just want to continue the conversation together and say, how can we work together to make sure that we have safe transportation back'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and forth from the stadium? The stadium district has been amazing getting the kids in there. We rode our bikes to one of the stadium district meetings. We took 65 kids by bike up to one of the meetings just to go and experience it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We ate up all the pizza, had a blast, but I just want to make sure that that can continue to be a partnership and not just because there's a plan at hand that we just want to continue to move forward and develop things together with them.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we have good, safe places for the kids to be from our community and not just the new kids coming in. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Up next, Leslie, talk about skin.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hi. Thank you. My name is Leslie to our galaxy. I stand before you today as the executive director of the Federal Boulevard.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Tonight are speaking on behalf of my board of the Federal Boulevard bid. First, we want to thank Jason and Sarah and CPD for including the removal of the Cloverleaf in this plan and including the Cloverleaf at all. As you all know and could see from the visuals, this is an integral part of the entire neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so thinking of all this, instead of as separate plans, the Todd Plan, the Stadium District Master Plan, the Cloverleaf Plan in the West Area plan. This will help us tie them all together. So I wanted to say thank you for that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We look forward to a variety of housing options on this site, including affordable housing. We look forward to the addition of much needed green space in this neighborhood.

        "'speaker_0': 'Communities that surround it, including Sun Valley, Sloan's Lake and Jefferson Park. We hope that you support this plan, and we want to thank Councilman Paul Lopez and Robin Canete for helping us with the Community Benefits Agreement, CPD and the Broncos for what is a very exciting plan.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. We hope you support it. Next up, we have Nazar Abu. Soraya, I'll let you go ahead and pronounce it correctly.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'First of all, I.'",

And continuing to engage with with many of the folks you've seen up here tonight, this has been a phenomenal process.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And and I think everyone's come to it with good faith. After 20 years, the stadium is getting more expensive to maintain it, as all facilities do. This plan can be the engine that allows us to extend the useful life of the stadium for many years ahead.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'And I just want to say that in terms of a.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Process and participation, I really think that that's actually reflected tonight by the sort of sentiments that are expressed, the ideas are put forward. And it's really been, I think, a plan that has evolved a little bit and I, you know, somewhat so, you know, in my own world of the Cloverleaf in a way that I think has'",
        "'speaker_6': 'improved the plan, especially from the point of view of mobility and creating a sort of a vibrant area of West Denver that can work and together that's vibrant commercially and provides opportunities for the people who are currently residing in the neighborhood, who will come both as visitors, future residents.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I feel like the so that I feel like that that the relationships that have resulted in that you know, sort of developed evolved outcome is are sort of in place and you know, sort of a fruitful opportunity to further, you know, for for further development as the process evolve, develops and the project develops.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so I think it's really a just a good testament to a good planning process and a, you know, it is it tells a story of good collaboration. So that's it. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. That concludes our speakers questions from members of council. Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Madam President. Pro tem. So a couple of questions I have. First of all, can someone help me understand what the maximum build our square footage might look like? So based on what is allowed, the height densities, what what could be the the maximum amount of square footage that could be built on on this property where'",
        "'speaker_5': '. That we're doing this master plan for.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The the area of the stadium district, the Metropolitan Football Stadium District owned portion is about 50 acres. We also know that there's about 19 acres at the clover leaf and then there's some other assorted parcels in there. So the plan is giving guidance to to the area to be a mixed use environment.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We've also are making recommendations about affordable housing and mass production as part of it and as the plan is setting up what our next steps are along the way. A lot of that building shaping is going to be a key part of knowing kind of what that allowable amount is.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So I don't know if we have a total. I don't know if there is a number that we have are targeting related to it. But it is a it is a, you know, an urban neighborhood. And we do have both sort of formal recommendations.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We do have kind of the highest areas in the middle and they step down to the side.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we should see more of those details when the rezoning application.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That would be, yeah. I mean, there's going to be a suite of things that will happen. Rezoning will let you know more about that. We'll have a design centers and guidelines which will continue to shape some of those things, but a lot of that mass production component will be part of that rezoning discussion.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But then there's also just people either building out their full entitlement or, as we often see, not building out that full entitlement to. So probably the end result will be.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Obviously, as you know, a range of form.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'One of the speakers raised question about aviation uses. Is that excluded? Will that be addressed in the zoning? What kind of discussions were there about that type of use being proposed as part of the The Master Plan?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We didn't discuss aviation uses as part of the master planning process. Phil mentioned that before in another discussion that would be actually used would be a part of a I think a zoning discussion as part of that. But aviation, neither benefit nor detriment, really came up as part of the master planning process.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So as.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'For what exactly the context of their.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Discussions with the neighborhood on the zoning, the proposed zoning, some of those topics should be part of that discussion. Yeah. Okay. And then help me understand about the impacts to Decatur Street. I'm very familiar with this neighborhood and the the real concerns being expressed about the potential new volume of traffic that might be on Decatur because of'",
        "'speaker_5': 'the proximity to the school, to Denver Human Services, to lots of small kids in the neighborhood. So. How much was that part of the plan discussion or how much of it will be part of the zoning discussion when that comes forward?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'To highlight a couple of things and certainly can stand up if there is additional to. But one of the the value of of that as a good location for what we want to see is the sort of the direct access to the two light rail stops to the recommendation for an at grade connection to the to West'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Colfax. That was an important part of the process. Important part of the discussion is the understanding that there is a a traffic management and parking plan in place now in the future. Sort of relook at that to understand what the impacts are on game day and every day to the surrounding neighborhoods becomes important.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So there are a variety of things happening. We also know that as part of our our project management team and teams moving forward through the process, public works will be there and be part of the table games here today.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But other things, including 13th Avenue realignment, things on federal are all part of the the network and will contribute to that. And I think understanding how they work together is going to be important for the safety of a really important street in one that we know that there are a lot of kids on.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And the one that we want to be a walkable, bikeable connection, primarily up to the district is going to be important.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I want to ask Matt Sugar, if you wouldn't mind coming forward. Neither you or Mac can answer this question. I wanted to inquire about how much discussion there was about looking at leveraging other resources so that when we start talking about infrastructure issues that need to be addressed or infrastructure impacts, whether it's to our water system and'",
        "'speaker_5': 'whether the current infrastructure can handle the volume of all the new development that might be proposed on the site to maybe cost sharing some of the improvements on 13 Avenue, perhaps Federal Boulevard, any of those kinds of things.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'How much was any of that part of the discussion? Obviously, there see you've got Dr. COG urban drainage in flood control district where there could be some leveraging of other resources to address some of the. Overlapping impact issues.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes, I think that I, I don't know that I can address address those specifically. And those certainly are things that we would look at moving forward. I think that Jason and the team had looked at some of those issues as we looked at what the site might look like and reconfiguring the infrastructure and those types of things'",
        "'speaker_8': '. I don't know if I'm the best person to answer that specifically, but I think it's something we need to explore.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Mercury behind you. So he may have.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'To say the answer and match, right? Is the specifics? Not yet. Currently, our design team has begun meeting with the city to really get in to the infrastructure master plan. I think we have discussed the topics we're raising and realizing that we need to figure out how to coordinate those.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Obviously, the biggest change was the relatively late inclusion of the Cloverleaf because that actually introduced a number of new infrastructure issues that possibly affect where we were on the original 52 acres. So we're not there yet, but that process is underway with the city and I think again, we added some work to it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we're probably we moved further from the goal line than we were a few weeks ago. But it's I think we all realize the value of if we can create solutions for the Cloverleaf as a part of this, it's a big win for the city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Madam President, I have one last question, and this is for CPD. So with so many changes that have happened at the department and the fact that we don't currently have a planning director who is point on looking at sort of the big picture of a lot of the development that's happening along this I-25 corridor and looking at'",
        "'speaker_5': 'how these projects are going to interface with one another, where we're going to be looking at the opportunities for some cost sharing with the infrastructure improvements or, you know, the effect of that and obviously the effect that all of this development will have on the neighborhoods adjacent or in terms of gentrification and displacement.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So is there like a point person or how how is that being looked at and addressed by CPD from that bigger picture perspective so that we're not looking at every single project piecemeal?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I said, of course so. Throughout this planning process, we've definitely been in discussion with kind of other members of our department, and we always continue that conversation and recognize plans that have already been done, plans that are in process right now in upcoming neighborhood plans.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I'd like to recognize that this plan really puts forth the community's desires and everything that they would like to see in conjunction with the stadium needs and their operation. So that's kind of how we looked at this plan.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In addition to that, moving forward, it's really in the next steps where we have more of an idea of what will actually be implemented and how that really, truly impacts the adjacent areas, adjacent, surrounding neighborhoods, and also what the other plans and projects are doing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we don't really have an answer for that right now because that really is down the road and that this is more of kind of a high level policy document of what we'd like to hope and see there in terms of equity and potential displacement.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We recognize that there really is no residents living there right now. It's a very singular use parking lots and the community is very excited to see that transform into something that they can use. And we looked at that from the perspective of this planning process is how can we provide something in this planning area that really gives'",
        "'speaker_0': 'back to the community and include their voice through this? And so that's kind of our goal is we recognize that future development will impact them. But what are the tradeoffs of what we can also get through this process with future development?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we know there's going to be changes in Sun Valley. There's a whole master plan for Sun Valley. I'm talking about the effects that this will have on Villa Park, on Barnum and Westwood, on many of the other neighborhoods along the western edge of I-25 with all of the new development that's coming.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So, you know, we've got the stuff that will happen on the other side of the river and the religious site. You know, further south, you've got the whole design center and the bright green marketplace. So when you start looking at all of this, we're talking about over 500 acres of new development all on the west side of'",
        "'speaker_5': 'town. And, you know, we've got see that doing their their palace study. So just wanting to make sure we've got somebody bird dogging the cumulative effects of all of this that's going to be happening, maybe not all at the same time, but looking at where we can leverage and interface and address all of those impact issues.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I see. Dr. Arena, you are in the in the audience and I know that she's been brought on to help look at the gentrification and displacement issues. And I'm wanting to make sure that we have the right tools in place to address those and to be thinking about them and looking at them on the front end, rather'",
        "'speaker_5': 'than waiting until the impact is happening and it's too late to do anything about them. So thank you. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Ortega. Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Madam President. Four times, sir, can I ask you on the mobility section? And after looking through the plan, I see I want to make note, first of all, that the Colfax Viaduct will soon be about 40 years old, and that's the new viaduct.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so looking ahead to the time when that might be at the end of its useful life and we're looking at a replacement, I'm wondering if the steering committee or the community or the stadium district or anyone involved in this effort considered the possibility of bringing Colfax down to grade at some point.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Maybe the geometry doesn't quite work with having to cross the river, but when I look at your mobility section, I see the recommendation for a at grade intersection at West Colfax with a North-South road. Is that in the line of the lady where LRT would be or where is that?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But I note that that's on a big embankment where the viaduct then takes off across the property and really it's not even part of the the parking lot, if you will. It's or the ground level just takes traffic from from federal over to the foot of, I think, seventh Street and Osage on the other side of downtown'",
        "'speaker_6': ', on the other side of the river. Was there any discussion as to what to do with the Colfax Viaduct when when it's at the end of its life? No.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So what I was going to try to answer the first part of your question. So the accurate intersection was something that we looked at and the feasibility of that happening. And so that is an intersection that can happen and be at grade.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Granted, there is quite a significant amount of grade change between West Colfax Avenue diving down and then coming back up to Federal Boulevard. But that was one of the more important intersections that we could get, knowing that there is still the viaduct.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So the viaduct right now that I think could be a sort of a next step study. There was, you know, thoughts of what comes up. Must, you know, what goes up must come down at some point knowing the infrastructure will age.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But this wasn't really a part of our planning process, kind of deciding what to do with the viaduct and then also the feasibility of the viaduct. If it does come out great, how does it cross the planet and, you know, connect to I-25 and other mobility networks?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So this I'll just say that's kind of out of my purview of expertize and kind of we sort of kept to more of the kind of community's desires and what they wanted to see in this process. And that I think some of the feasibility will come later of figuring out how do we really implement everything and get'",
        "'speaker_0': 'what we want. Keeping in mind of kind of long term or the longevity of the Mobility Network as well.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So that at Great Intersection would involve lowering the grade of Colfax or raising the grade of of the North-South Connector.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Or resistor right now. It would connect it would be without moving West Colfax Avenue, and it would be kind of altering certain grades to meet up to Colfax.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. And then I saw elsewhere in the plan that you recommend looking at uses for the real estate that exists under the viaduct for some in some form or fashion. And to those uses take into account the possibility that somewhere in the near term, whatever it is conducted under the viaduct might have to be disrupted in order'",
        "'speaker_6': 'to construct a replacement viaduct or bring it back down to grade.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. So the plan currently keeps it open ended. What uses could be there, but it would be more temporary and looking at public space. But we also recognize that there is concern in terms of public health and air quality.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so we're working with other departments to figure out what uses could actually happen there. Knowing that we heard from the community that they'd like to see a variety of things from art to kind of little pop up recreational area.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Mass market.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Farmers markets, things like that. But we want to make sure that that definitely is something that can happen. And I think just with how that would build out it, it would probably have to be more of a temporary kind of structure if there's anything built.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'All right. Just one last thing. On page 86 of the plan, I noticed there was a typographical error refer to the viaduct as Old West Colfax Viaduct. And that's actually Old West Colfax is the at grade street. So that's on page 86.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And that's all, ma'am.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Flynn. Councilman Lopez.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'There's somebody in the Flynn household who sweats every day making a typo. Oh, I have a few questions. So one of them first one is for for Mac Freeman, if you can. So Mac or in Mac, there's been a lot of conversation about community benefits.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I want to make sure. So what we have and what the folks have in front of them here on the dais is not a community benefits agreement. It's a letter in which the Broncos, a signatory, along with some other folks in the coalition, will be signed at the end of the at the end of the hearing'",
        "'speaker_8': 'about the community benefits, some of that. One is because there is no development entity in terms of who to enter into community benefits with yet. But and so I want to make that sure it's clear on the record to some of the community benefits that are in the letter.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Responsible contracting policy practices. Utilization of registered apprentices. Minimum Wage. Living Wage. Prevailing wage. Minority women on business schools. Affordable Housing Initiatives, local hire program site. Specific housing plan, small business support parks and open space and then ongoing implementation and communication.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Can you going to talk about where, you know, the group has been, where you where you're at and.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah, well, that's that's obviously I mean, we haven't we haven't been able to really contemplate how much we're building, how high we're building. I mean, they get the zoning questions. It goes back to the question of, you know, what the mass square footage is.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think until we know what zoning will allow and what kind of uses we're going to build once we know that, I think we'll be able to get very specific. But I think, you know what, we've tried to come to the process, as has the stadium district is just come to the table in a good faith effort'",
        "'speaker_6': '. We don't have developers at the table. And I think, you know, all of the community benefits that that you've proposed, I know they're in there in the master plan. We we we subscribe to them all. I think, you know, I'm not a developer.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm a football guy. The best hour of education on affordable housing I got were the 230 minute sessions with Councilman Can each. So I'm learning along in this in this whole process too. And I think, you know, we're we're trying to understand what that balance is.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Right. And I guess, you know, we're we stand behind our commitment to keep the keep communicating with the neighborhood and make that a formal engagement and then sit down and really talk about all of them. I think it's it seems to me, you know, there is a really a window to avoid any of this.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's coming up with what mix works for year development. And again, until we really know what we're building and how much of it, it's tough to get to specific with that. And I know that's been somewhat frustrating for for you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Hall In some cases, but we're going to get there and we're committed to doing what's right for this project. And again, that's part of why we're trying to address some of this prior to being sort of commercially conflicted.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Mac. Mr. Sugar Stadium, the Metropolitan Football Stadium District. So the talk about the community benefits agreement, how far along are you after this plan? If this plan were to be adopted by council tonight, how far are you on selecting a developer?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And is that a would it could it be a condition of the Metropolitan Football Stadium District, as you know, said in his letter to. To advocate for those same commitments. A couple of things. We as I think we've been described here, we have several steps to go.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'This is a step. We have zoning steps. We have reverse clause steps. We have several different steps to go. Now, as you know, the district is represented by the seven county region. So they they have all been patient playing, paying close attention to what we're doing here.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Now, of course, it resides in the city and county of Denver, the building and the district property. We have worked with the neighborhoods. We have worked with the Broncos in the past, and we will continue to do that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We are committed to do that. Now, when you started getting into the specifics, I think that what Mac just described, that's something that we need to work out. Exactly. Again, we don't have a developer. We would like to move forward rapidly.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We think the time is right to do this. And with all your help, we can continue to move this process forward. So, again, I don't want to prejudge conditions that we don't know what they are at this point.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So there's been some mention about the condition of the stadium itself. Is a stadium I mean, a lot of people a lot of us I remember when in you know, was a great timing when we built the stadium, voted to build the stadium because we just had one Super Bowl.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It seems like that's just yesterday. What I mean, shouldn't the stadium be in tip top shape? And if not, what kind of repairs are needed and why do we. I'm sure. Sure. How much what would the price tag be?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I mean, some of us have toured the stadium, but there's a lot of folks that still look in the stadium is, oh, that thing's brand new. We looking backwards. It looks like we built the stadium for about $400 million.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The price tags are going north of of 2 billion. Now it's in our interest, the district's interest, the Broncos interest and all the folks involved that we preserve and protect that stadium to last us another 20 to 30 years.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That's what this effort is all about, is we're trying to generate an income stream that allows us to keep that stadium viable. So when people ask me that question, there's a lot of things you can say about that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And Mac can probably talk to this specifically. You know, an escalator, an elevator might have a life span of 10 to 15, maybe 20 years at the tops. It's close to $1,000,000 price tag to replace one of those.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Multiply that by 20 a seat, the seat replacement, another 15 year product. We've already been through a process where we replace the boards, the video boards several years back. Now, I guess 2013, we spent about $32 million upgrading those types of things, not to mention some of the technology that goes along with this way.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Back in 2001, when I was there and we opened the stadium, things like wi fi and those things weren't necessarily thought of as an important piece. Now they're like a utility. They are expected. Those are the investments that the Broncos have made into the facility, as well as the district.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I'm sure Mac had come up with a hundred other things that we've done. Not to mention the ongoing things like expansion joints in the building, again, 1.8 million square foot. That upkeep, I mean, it's literally separate buildings that are all built together because of expansion and contraction of the steel.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Those are ongoing efforts. 14 or so parking lots try to repave a parking lot. I'm sure you've all dealt with looking at the city's issues with repaving, parking lots, that those kinds of things are expensive. So I'm rambling on here, but there's a lot of need.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We've looked at conditions of the facility and what we need over the next 20, 22 to 30 years. And we're looking at a significant amount of money. What's the opportunity after this passes to get a Pro Bowl quarterback is not different fun.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Different fun. Okay, I oh, okay.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay, okay. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I'll get Councilman Lopez or. Yeah, yeah. Okay. I don't know if we're going to get an answer to that one tonight. All right. Next up, we have Councilwoman Canete.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you very much. And before I ask, I just want to first share my condolences for the loss of Pat Bowlen. I'm sure our entire community, including especially the Broncos community. And it just feels like we should mention that in as we're discussing this, I wanted to first ask, I think Sara probably or Jason a question.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So Councilman Lopez has been asking some questions about the community benefits piece. This plan document describes a couple different groups in it. And so I just want to get clarity on the record. So there's talk about an. Neighborhood Advisory Group.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then there's talk about community benefits. And so I share some concerns with you about developers self-selecting community benefits group in terms of who they're negotiating with. Generally, those are more organic. So can you just talk about whether you believe the plan provides flexibility for those to be two separate groups?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'One group that kind of gets updates on the project and can include everybody in their uncle and. And just give me your your answer that we we we talked about.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So the plan does remain flexible in terms of what that organizational structure would look like for a community benefit agreement. And in the plan, we recognize that typically they are between the community and the developer and that there could be potential for the city to remain as an advisory role and to be a part of it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I think there definitely is flexibility and that there's definitely flexibility to negotiate what that looks like in the future.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Right. So I. You think I want to ask this question, too? Maybe I'll ask Melissa Tidey to come forward for a second. One of the things that the community has discussed and the plan does a really excellent job of identifying is a desire for on site housing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And the way that that is typically done is through an alternative plan to paying a linkage fee. So this site would be standard expectations be required to do a linkage fee. Maybe there will be a bit density bonus.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But the regardless of how the path of on site housing happens, it would usually go through the Office of Economic Development or our new departments gait. And so but we have a community very interested it being in the table and talking about their vision and their goals.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So can you share some thoughts on how it is that we can accommodate both our legal requirements as well as now our blessing that's in this plan for the community to be involved in that conversation?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sure. Melissa Tardy, housing policy officer with Denver Economic Development, an opportunity so has been has been discussed a little bit earlier. This is just a visionary document. So is this plan guidance? No development has been committed at this time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There are strong recommendations about what would look like potentially a height, incentive overlay or some way of incentivizing affordable housing through or density. So through that process, it would require rezoning. This also would probably fall under the the large development review process that's going through city council process right now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And all of that requires community outreach and engagement to talk about what makes sense for the specific area area, median income levels, bedroom sizes, all of those things that the community's really been asking for.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay, great. I think that's it for now. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Can each. The public hearing for Council Bill 488 has closed comments by members of council. Councilman Lopez.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Madam President. Well, first thing and I'm glad and I'm glad a councilman you to mention this, because we know whether to do it in announcements or now. But just in that spirit, we wanted to acknowledge the passing of Pat Boland, Broncos owner who had a good vision.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I mean, Bears Stadium had been there for a long time, Mile High Stadium, but it wasn't always a sure thing. And from what I understand, Mr. Bolen had had a vision of not just having the stadium, but but a vision of everything around it as well, too.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Right. And if you think about what Coors Field has done for the city of Denver and Coors Field was built right smack in the middle of that area. And if folks don't remember what it was like in that area, it's nothing like it is now.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Now, think about going back in time. Think about that kind of opportunity down in in Sun Valley. But think about the community benefits that's tied to it. An economic engine that can help generate jobs, opportunity, housing, community benefits that go along with it.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes, we will be able to maintain our stadium, a stadium that has such history in Denver. It's a diamond in West Denver. But also to think about not just the stadium and maintaining the stadium and make sure we you pay for it, but the surrounding community.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so this planning process has been one that's been seamless. And talking about a seamless neighborhood, we looked at different iterations of stadiums in neighborhoods around the country. Some are good and some were bad. Some of them were just poor planning, some of them almost like its own isolated little Disneyland.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And it's a ghost town unto itself when there's no activity, no games. This is not that. There's this is a neighborhood. It's Sun Valley. And it's making sure that we are connecting and not just a planning sense, but transportation, economics, culture.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Right. And making sure that it connects Federal Boulevard being part of that connectivity. West Colfax and Old West Colfax. And looking at what can be done there, you've got an up and coming brewery. You have businesses like sports that have been there for such a long time on federal.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'How do we make sure that it's those folks who have an opportunity as well to as as this as this fleshes out? And so, you know, I got to say, over the last year, it's been a heck of a process.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It's been very inclusive. A lot of folks have been part of this process. But now the steering been part of the steering committee had meetings at the stadium, which drew hundreds of people to all chime in, everything from planning to parks to things like community benefits, the layout.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And then, you know, this is a one step in in a lot of in a series of steps in terms of what this looks like. Now, I think about this and I think about this opportunity to be able to have this hearing tonight, this plan happening today, just weeks before we change guards on the council.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I can think of. The opportunity I had as a young man. I was I was I lived at 2704 West Second Avenue, just over there on clay. And second, it was a bike ride away from the stadium in the shadow of the stadiums where I grew up.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'One of the places where I grew up, we moved around a lot. I rode my bike to go sweep the concourses at Mile High Stadium and clean the bathrooms and take tickets. My my friend sold soda. That was our opportunity.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But it's much more than that. And if you think about not just the jobs of the stadium, but everything that this economic engine would create around it, it's those local businesses. It's the mom and pop shops. It's those jobs.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You think of office space. You think of retail. You think of just these opportunities for food access, right? For parks space, an open space, even in a place like this one. When Paco Sanchez is just down the street and Rudy Park is just down the street and the Platte River, you think of that kind of connectivity.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And this plan addresses all that. So whether it's the built forum, the platform or even the economics and social, it's there. Now, Councilman Flynn have always been talking about Denver's Brooklyn Bridge. That is another conversation. That's a conversation you all will be have.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But, yes, looking at that viaduct and how that viaduct transforms into a viaduct that moves people from the west side to central to the rest of Denver, not just by cars and vehicles, but by streetcars, by bikes, by walking across Colfax.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Right. Without having to watch your back. So it's these are the generators, the cloverleaf. Right. And how it addresses the cloverleaf not turning its back on Federal Boulevard. And that's why you see a lot of that support here.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The Broncos didn't always win a super Super Bowl, as a matter of fact, for the most part of my life. We've always lost them painfully. We've had some seasons where we I'm sorry to say this, but we barely made an average 500 season, but we still filled those seats.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And the people who filled those seats, guess where they came from? He came from the surrounding neighborhoods. Paid those tickets. Watch those games. Cheered on. Sometimes we were disappointed and sometimes we were, you know, cheering them on all the way to the point where we go and watch us get blasted out of the Super Bowl 55 to'",
        "'speaker_8': '10. But we still came back. And that's that kind of ownership that the stadium had, and that's the kind of ownership this division will have. And I think as we remember those folks who live in that surrounding area, you will remember that they helped carry the team.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But also we make sure that we create those opportunities. Right, those economic opportunities to advance forward. You know, I want to acknowledge, like folks like like yourself at that time, like Derek Friedman, Rudy Gonzalez on services. There are some the partnerships that have existed, the champions in the community program with the Broncos.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Right. You look at the construction and building trades, the Electrical Workers Union, apprenticeships, it makes me feel good that there's a commitment to those community benefits. Now, this letter that's sitting on my desk is going to be signed after this by all these different folks, the Sun Valley Neighborhood Coalition, the Broncos.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But it is a it is a a and a memorialization of those commitments. We're not a community benefits agreement yet, but that'll be this next council. I mean, you are and I want to make why this letter just kind of memorializes that, because we can't do it in a plan, because this is the planning documents a little'",
        "'speaker_8': 'different. Up until that time. This is what we got to refer to and you memorialize that commitment. So thank you all so much. And especially the Denver Broncos, especially all of you all for for committing to do this.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Our planning staff. Thank you. This is a great process to have Steve Atwater and the real Vince Lombardi trophies. I had to go up there and actually look at them because I thought they were fakes. No, they're real.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And they brought them there. I don't know what the price tag on those, but the closest I've ever gotten to anything like that. But at the end of the day, I just wanted to say thank you and thank you to her sous or A.I. at my office, who has been our point person to our office, our interface'",
        "'speaker_8': 'for this whole whole thing, and making sure that at least on our end, the strings are tied together in the community and that communication is there. So with that, you know, I do support this moving forward and look forward to seeing this as a well.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'As another as. As a resident of the neighborhood in the surrounding area. But not from this diocese. So. Thank you, ma'am, but I do support them.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Lopez. Councilwoman Canete.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Madam President. It's it's not lost on me that we've just now last week had the first major area plan under our new planning documents in the far northeast. And then this week we have the first small area plan in this stadium district.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And you know that the headline writers, you know, through our last municipal election, the only headline that we could really see was growth. And you know what get gets lost in the the 30,000 foot level headline is the kind of alignment that is frequently happening in this chambers when communities are deeply engaged in long term conversations over'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the course of months and in some cases years about the places where growth both best belongs and the values that should be reflected in that growth. And so the subtitle of both last week and this week is that you can use a planning process to identify that alignment and you can get it with folks of very diverse'",
        "'speaker_2': 'backgrounds, including residents of public housing and those who represent an area of town, Colfax and Federal Boulevard, that have serious safety issues. And frankly, even though they represent districts representing vulnerable districts, vulnerable areas. And so I think that that's just a really important thing for us to pause and notice for a second that the details matter.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so to highlight, I think, a few of the details in the plan that I think are significant, where that alignment came together is one, you know, the physical alignment, right, about the connections, about the safety of streets, about the cloverleaf and the idea that we can do better than 19 acres of death trap.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Right? Which is what that is for anyone who's not in a car going 40 miles an hour. And so I feel that, you know, there was incredible work done by all parties. And I thank all everyone who's here tonight and who testified because I think you all highlighted that alignment.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then secondly, on the principles of equity, you know, I know that one thing that sometimes we think about is that this term development is all about some owner making a lot of profit. And it's interesting because I actually think there's a lot of similarities between this conversation about the Stadium District and Union Station, a project that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I was very close with, which is that in both cases, the development profit, if you will, is going to fund a public amenity. So we used all the development around Union Station to help pay for the transit, to help pay for the bus station, to help pay for the train station through a different structure.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You're using this development to pay for the stadium. So that is a good thing. The question then becomes, well, if it's not just some land owner who's getting rich, are community benefits needed or appropriate? Aren't you getting the community benefit by virtue of funding the stadium or in that case, funding Union Station?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And here's how I answer that. And I hear, I think how the plan answered says, which is to say, yeah, you still have to talk about the equity impacts and about the mitigation and the benefits because it is still an extraordinarily large amount of public investment involved.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Right. So those street alignments that are going to make these things possible and you know, all of the public taxpayer money that went into this stadium, it's appropriate that the benefits flow equitably. That's the first reason why you still have to talk about community benefits, even though the stadium is an important beneficiary of the profit or the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the margin. The second reason is because the displacement risks don't change based on who owns it. So if you put a lot of new fancy things in an area, no matter who they're benefiting or who the profit is going to, we know the ripple effects lead to the potential for displacement.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We know that they make it harder for local businesses to have access sometimes or for residents to afford the housing. So the benefits are agnostic. They don't care who got the profit, they just affect the residents the same way.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we know that because a lot of the things that have resulted in displacement have been really important. Public infrastructure, like fixing the river or fixing streets or adding parks. They're great, they raise values and they result in some displacement.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So so community benefits are appropriate, whether it's a corporate landowner, whether it's a public beneficiary, even if it's the city itself, building something. I think the question about how they get decided is, is where things get interesting and maybe the trade offs.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Right. Into the conversation. But I want to commend the city for making its commitment for the first time, frankly, as clear as it has, that it's appropriate for the community to be in this conversation, not just us negotiating privately.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's a breakthrough, and it's just really worth highlighting as we go forward. I think that each milestone will bring us a better level of definition in detail. Right now, the plan lays out topics without laying out how they get decided.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I do encourage and I appreciate that it seems like the stadium district is close to agreeing that these are the topics that your future developers need to discuss, and then we'll get more to how those topics get resolved in the future.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I really just wanted to kind of highlight all of that because I think that it gets skipped over a lot of times in the conversation about these projects. Once we leave the chamber and once we end up in the community, we're all just like, Oh, you're putting a lot of growth in.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The other thing I want to say is to communities concerned about change in existing, existing neighborhoods. The more growth we can put on this site, the more it relieves pressure in other neighborhoods. So I want to be clear.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The development here is happening on parking lots. It's happening on parking lots. Every story that is built here reduces some of the pressure elsewhere. And if we do it right, if we do it the way the plan says on site, with the mix of incomes on site, with open space, on site, with local business opportunities, it will'",
        "'speaker_2': 'reduce pressure for that same growth elsewhere. And I think that is really important also to put in the subtitle, this is the right place. And so it's it's a lot, but I don't think we're going to be worried about the views from the stadium.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Right. So that's the right place to put it, right. And versus maybe next to a single storey home, right in in a different established neighborhood. So thank you for your forbearance with the long comments. But these are, I think, turning points for the city, and they need to be underlined so that we're on the same page going'",
        "'speaker_2': 'forward. I'm excited to support this plan. I appreciate the time everyone spent. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Canete. Next up, we have Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. So, first of all, I want to say great job in all the collaborative work that you have done, because I can remember when the first football stadium project came before city council that was looking at closing down McNichols Sports Arena and then moving that and opening up the Pepsi Center and working to, over time tear'",
        "'speaker_5': 'down the old football stadium and build the new one. And they were both at the same site at the same time because we needed one for the games to take place and lots of community input in that process as well.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so fast forward to today, you're in a very active part of North Denver where communities are very engaged in what's happening in their neighborhood. And to be here tonight and to not having people here say, no, we don't want this project, we don't like it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I mean, everybody I think is in unison in wanting to see the changes happen, understanding that the stadium district needs to find some revenue to maintain the ongoing upkeep of the facility and at the same time creating some real benefit and opportunities for the community.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And, you know, we'll see more details as you come forward with the rezoning plans and the actual community benefit agreement with the community. But to be here tonight and know that, you know, everybody's pretty much singing the same tune.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. They're different issues still need to be worked out. But in general, this is this is a big deal and some great opportunities, I think, yet to come for the broader community. My comments about impacted neighborhoods deals with the cumulative impact of 500 acres of development, not just one project at a time, but over time, the cumulative'",
        "'speaker_5': 'effect that may have on the adjacent neighborhoods. And so I think as a city, we need to be looking at and working on the bigger picture of how all of that happens in the next area or the gas area.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That in DCC, the North Denver Cornerstone Collaborative, was created to look at how all those projects interface with one another, as so many of them are happening at the same time, and making sure that, you know, communities can get in and out of their neighborhood and things.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Like that. But I think in general, you all have have done a great job. I would just strongly encourage that. I'm assuming the issue of the neighborhood parking program was part of the discussion. But I would anticipate the neighborhoods will want to continue to see that strongly in place and enforced not only on game days, but when'",
        "'speaker_5': 'there are big events like concerts and whatnot. So that as we remove the use of parking lots that currently get fully utilized on game days and people now have to find alternative ways to get to the game, that we're not looking at putting any of that impact into the adjacent communities.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I know those are all detailed things that you all are already looking at and talking about. But, you know, good job and I know there's a lot more work yet to be done. So I will be supporting this tonight.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah, thank you, Madam President. Pro tem I hesitate to take Councilman Flynn's mantle is our council historian, but there's something I want to bring up. And in reference to Mr. Bolen, that and all the stories that have been in the paper about him recently, I haven't heard mentioned, you know, South Broadway, South of Sixth Avenue, has become'",
        "'speaker_6': 'very hip in recent years and it's booming. And there's people on the streets at all kinds of hours and nights of the week. And there's Punchbowl Social Club and the Hornets been there for years and years, and there's some new and great restaurants and ice cream shops, and it's just as vibrant as can be.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But over the years, as a resident and as a journalist, I've watched literally hundreds of businesses come and go on that strip. Every decade or so, new businesses would come in. They'd form a new merchants association and declare, we're going to revitalize South Broadway.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And it didn't happen until recently. But through the decades, what's been that the drawing card, bringing those businesses to try has been the main theater at first and Broadway, and in the mid eighties, the main theater was literally within hours of the wrecking ball.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I believe the story goes was Federico Pena that made former energy secretary and our former mayor, Federico Payan You made a contact with Mr. Boland, who got together with his partner at the time and purchased Union Bank and Trust, which owned the block that the man was on and preserved the man theater.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And the man, as we all know, has been revitalized and still stands as as that primary landmark that people know when they come to South Broadway. And so what I would just urge, as you know, we had a couple of people here tonight talk about, you know, not talk about who we hope some big chain comes in'",
        "'speaker_6': '. But I'd like to have my own restaurant in this district. I'd like to be part of it where Mr. Baldwin bought Union Bank and Trust. I hope he made some dough on it, but that was not a I want to get rich type of decision.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That was a community benefit right there. So recognizing that Mr. B is passed on to his next journey, I hope you'll stay in contact with him as this gets planned and be sure that those community benefits, those local businesses are part of it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I think it would be a great way to honor his legacy off the football field and really deliver something to that neighborhood that the residents can can take part in. So thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Cashman. And I'll just add in that I, you know, love that folks have been proactive and really looking at the community benefits piece and echoing Councilman Cashman around the small businesses that that we heard from here tonight, and that we want to make sure that we're bringing them into the fold and that with this'",
        "'speaker_0': 'amazing, great new development, that we don't lose that inclusive feel of the entire area. And so with that being said, I'm happy to support this tonight. And Madam Secretary, roll call, please.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Uh.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'A brief recap of the public engagement process that included in a relatively short amount of time, not the 18 months that you just witnessed in the Stadium District plan. But really, I want to point out that this public engagement sat on top of another almost two years of planning.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That was a part of our game plan. So in many ways, this is the first step towards implementation of our game plan. And you will see throughout the the two way plan very specific references and ties to our new game plan.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you very much for passing that recently. So we had held by five town hall meetings across the city. We had an online survey that was open to the public for the month of March. We included also an online survey of our capital, our six year capital improvement plan proposal, and which is very much a part of'",
        "'speaker_7': 'this plan. And we provided opportunities in all of our recreation centers. And thanks to Denver Public Library for once again hosting, being a host really to this city, as they so often are, an opportunity for citizens to come to their public libraries and weigh in on various, various topics.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We had over 600 survey responses specifically to this plan. And in in in those meetings, the town hall meetings, the general conclusion was a very strong affirmation of the proposal that we put in front of the public about the framework for the plan, which was maintaining our legacy.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I translate that as a message from the public when they voted for this. Take care of what we've already got. We like it and we value it. And number two, as a growing city, we need you to have plans for how we're going to meet the future needs of the residents of this city.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so we received much affirmation throughout the public process for that framework of the plan overall, a strong agreement with the criteria that we recommended for how we would prioritize the projects. And while this roughly 37 and a half million dollars a year is a tremendous boost to our department, we recognize that it is there will always'",
        "'speaker_7': 'be more projects to that people want to see than the resources that are available. And so we proposed a number of criteria and a highlight and particularly a couple of them. First and foremost, equity and as a strong driving principle for how we would prioritize projects and secondly, sustainability.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There were other criteria like do we already have projects underway using other resources and processes like the bond process, neighborhood plans, existing neighborhood plans that are there. So all of these information. All of this information. The facility and condition assessment reports that we have so using at our disposal all of the data to help us make decisions'",
        "'speaker_7': 'about moving forward. We got lots of individual suggestions in addition to the affirmation about the general approach. Lots of people weighed in with their specific suggestions, their specific parks, their specific recreation centers and so on. All of those were captured and remain a part of the lists that we will continue to use as we as we move'",
        "'speaker_7': 'forward each year with projects to propose the key themes for maintaining the legacy. And so these key themes were the things that many people repeated that repeated over and over again in both in the survey and in the meetings.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I won't go through all of them there in front of you, but they they they really underscored the values that people place in so many of the diverse assets that we have in our parks, in our recreation system, and in our mountain parks.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This is just a pie chart of our budget. I think the point of this chart, if nothing else, is to to recognize that the two way funding is an additional resource to an overall budget. We approached the planning for this to to think of this as an additional source of funding and not as a stand alone program'",
        "'speaker_7': 'on its own. So these dollars, as you can see, the the part of the chart that's outlined in Gray is a significant addition to our budget. And so but we looked at it in totality as a $133 million of of a budget for our department.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That will include general fund. That includes two way. That includes the the funds that you see, the capital improvement farm, the lottery funds, the winter park funds. And so as we looked at projects and as we look at how we move the department forward and how we maintain and extend this legacy, we looked at all of those'",
        "'speaker_7': 'resources together. And we we looked at an investment framework in categories that would help us think about the best ways to spend the dollars, both in maintaining the legacy our parks, deferred maintenance enhancements, facilities maintenance and deferred maintenance, and then around planning to ensure that we're we are extending that legacy, that we have the tools to continue'",
        "'speaker_7': 'to create the masterplans that help guide our investments and the resources and how we spend those those dollars. Land acquisition was a strong message. People want to make sure that we're growing our park system in a growing city.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so the the funding would would also be in that category. Resiliency is a new way of looking at our city and the important role that our parks particularly play in the environmental health of our community, as well as the individual health of our community.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Protecting our water resources, protecting our air, addressing climate issues. And so there will be a number of investments in that area. And finally, how we program and activate the spaces. It's it isn't just the physical improvements, but it's how we envision people using all of these facilities and ensuring that we have the programs and the activities to'",
        "'speaker_7': 'be able to activate the spaces in the parks and both indoors and outdoors. And what we what we find in, particularly with the two way funding, is an extraordinary opportunity to really focus much more on our outdoor recreation with our mountain parks as an important asset that is underutilized.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We want to take advantage of really focusing far more on our outdoor recreation opportunities and finally to continue to provide opportunities for signature projects like the Paco Sanchez, um, playground and Park. And I, and I'll point out, and I know Gordon will talk a little bit more in detail about the signature projects don't mean just brand new'",
        "'speaker_7': 'and innovative ideas. They often mean projects of such significant scope that in the past, our capital budgets or resources wouldn't have allowed us to do a major improvement like this without spreading it out over many years and phasing it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Now we have an opportunity to do significant projects that make a difference and not phase it over several year periods. So some of these may be signature park projects may be in existing facilities as we look to make improvements over time.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I will turn it over to Gordon Robertson to talk about the plan and a little bit more the plan summary in a little more detail. We also have Mike Bouchard with us today and a number of other members of our Parks and Recreation staff that I want to acknowledge for their tremendous help and support.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It was a team effort takes a village in. And I'm pleased to have so many members of our village here tonight following our brief presentation here. We will be available. All of us are available to answer questions. If you have questions, they will be for Gordon Robertson.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'If you need answers, they will be for Mike Bouchard.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Good evening. Councilmembers Gordon Robertson, Denver Parks and Recreation. And I guess thank you. Happy. I'm going to be just briefly going through the financials of the plan with you where you can see before you on the monitor is our plan on a page.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'It outlines our five year expenditures by the framework that happy just went over. The first orange line is our fund balance. So we will be committing 10% of the fund in any given year to be in a fund balance in case of emergencies.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And we'll grow that over the first three years to be the full 10%. And if it's used, it will be then replenish then in the next year. So that's the fund balance line across the top, the orange line.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'The next line is our acquisition and park development. New park development. Line item. And as you can see in 2019, that's at 19.5 million. It's a substantial amount in the first year and then it goes down to 12 million and then we estimate a roughly 10 million in the year in the out years beyond.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Well, we'll gauge kind of how our acquisition goes and see if those funds are needed additionally or maybe less. So the next line item is our capital maintenance budget. That's our capital deferred maintenance. We have a roughly 12 million plus in cap for deferred maintenance.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We're going to add to that number of roughly 7 million in 2019. And then that will grow over time to just over 8.2 million, almost 8.2 million, in addition to the 12 million that we get in our general fund, our entire annual cap.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So again, in the out years, we're assuming it'll grow at that rate. But if we if we find that deferred maintenance needs more dollars, we can always add to those dollars in those out years. Our capital expansion budget is broken into the framework that Happy went through, from planning to outdoor recreation to resiliency and signature projects.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And you can see that in the first two years, we're very specific about the kinds about the projects that we'll be doing in those areas. But in the out years, we really can't commit to projects in years three, four and five.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'It's just a bit of an unknown to commit to a project that far out. But you can see we've listed projects that are high on our priority list that will be competing for those funds. And then there are other projects that aren't listed there yet, but that may come up over the next few years that may end'",
        "'speaker_12': 'up being funded in those out years. But in the first two years, you can see the projects that we're committing to in each of the in the areas. And then lastly, the green line items are operations and maintenance funding.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'That was the 19% of the two way funding, and that is broken out in salaries and benefits for additional staffing in contracted services for things like pruning of trees and additional portal lights at parks and those kinds of contract services.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We also have materials and supplies for our staff. And then lastly, capital equipment. It's easier to see in 2019 with a pie graph kind of how and where the money's been divided. So as you can see in year one, we we put a lot of money into acquisition.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'There's a lot of good reasons for that. We have a pent up demand of properties that need to be acquired from years past that we when we couldn't afford to purchase properties. So there's a lot of opportunity to create to acquire land in the first couple of years.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'It also doesn't take a lot of new staff to acquire land, which is something that we'll need as we as we go into more projects. Deferred maintenance is the second largest piece of that pie. And then capital expansion, the new capital projects is the next largest.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'But if we go to the next year and I'll spend a little more time here in 2020, this is probably a more normalized expenditure strategy where acquisition, deferred maintenance and new projects are kind of equally balanced. And then the remainder of the funding goes to fund balance to salaries and benefits, contracted services, material supplies and capital equipment'",
        "'speaker_12': '. But you can see the three largest pieces of the funding are going to be acquisition, deferred maintenance and capital expansion. So those are that is the funding for the first two years. The other three, three years beyond that are really our estimates of where we think we'll be and the kinds of projects that we think we'll fund'",
        "'speaker_12': '. But of course, every year will be coming to you to update this, and we will be very specific as to what we'll be doing in the next year. So with that, I will be closing our presentation. I thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Great. Thank you. We have six individuals signed up to speak this evening. And so I'm going to go ahead and call all six up Bart Berger, Jesse Parrish, Kate Fritz, Jeff Shumaker, Beth Moisi and Paul Lopez.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we will start with Mr. Berger.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you very much, counsel. Madam. Madam President, my name is Bart Berger. I am the founder of the Denver Mountain Parks Foundation. And I really want us all to go home. So I'm going to be very brief. What I want to do is to thank this council for the support that the Denver Mountain parks have finally gotten'",
        "'speaker_6': '. When I first started this effort, the Denver Mountain Parks were a curiosity and idiosyncratic addition into the mountain, into the park system. And that's no longer the truth. Part of what we're going to continue to do in the Mountain Parks Foundation is to also work with Happy and the Parks Department to increase activation and to to to'",
        "'speaker_6': 'expand that to include education. Outdoor education is really crucial in what I call cultural and social sustainability. I want to thank the members of council specifically. I want to thank Councilman Flynn, who made being here today part of the two way vote.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So thank you for that. And I want to I want to also thank when New and Mary Beth Sussman and Paul Lopez who are going out, because now you get to be ambassadors for the Denver Mountain Parks for those, and you get to go train your replacements and tell them to get with me and so that I'",
        "'speaker_6': 'can give them my speech. So that's all I have. Thank you very much. 50, 65 years ago, I thought the Denver Mountain Parks were the did not have a dedicated funding source. But it occurred to me that the Denver parks have never had a dedicated funding source.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And now we've got it and you're responsible for that. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Next up, Jesse Parish.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Keep an H to my name.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh, sorry. This is Jesse.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'LaShawn Paris. Represent for Denver Homicide, a low black star action movement for self-defense and positive action commitment for social change. And I was on top of the ballot for at large this past May election. I almost got 15,000 votes with no money.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'This sounds really good that we're preserving our Parks and Rec for future generations. But the fact still remains we have an urban camping ban. It is illegal for on house neighbors to occupy these parks. It's illegal for you to lay down, cover yourself from the elements, wear anything besides your own clothing so we can keep pat ourselves'",
        "'speaker_10': 'on the back about these park and rec investment and plans. But the fact still remains, we still have an urban camping banner needs to be repealed. So until that urban ban is repealed, we are not letting up and could keep doing all this work on the parks and on the bricks.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But what good is it if our on house neighbors are now able to occupy this space? If we're really working to build an inclusive and welcome welcoming city, then we need to include all members of our community and not exclude them because of their status or their situation.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Kate Fritz.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'My name is Kate Fritz.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In January, I succeeded Bart as the chair of the Denver Mountain Parks Foundation. And it's always nice to go second because he doesn't get to steal.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'My thunder quite so much. As a preliminary matter, I would like to thank each and every one of you for your support of the Denver Mountain Parks and in ensuring.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Their sustainability for future generations.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Both the Foundation and I personally support the plans put.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Forth by Parks and Rec.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'For the use of the funds raised by two.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Way.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We believe that the plan addresses not only the needs of the Denver mountain parks importantly, but of all of the parks within the city. We were particularly gratified to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'See that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'One of the line items included in the plan is for busses to get kids who would not.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Otherwise be visiting the.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Able to do outdoor recreation and education.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'To participate in the two way stakeholder meetings as well as to visit the most recent Parks and Rec Advisory Board meeting, and am satisfied that the Department engaged in the development of this plan in a very thoughtful and very measured manner, and that it is pragmatic and practical and attainable.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I would encourage each of you to support it. And thank you again.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Very much for your support of Denver's mountain parks. And I look forward to seeing you all soon. Next up, we have Jeff Shoemaker.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you, Madam President pro tem and members of Council Shumaker two times in.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'One night should never happen.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I too. Thank you. 11 months ago we stood here and asked you to let the voters decide. And you did. And for those of you that are watching, listening tonight who voted for Measure two, I thank you as well.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'This is a long time dream of my family of the Greenway Foundation, the Colorado Parks Foundation. And it's an exciting night. I will not go on too long. I want to thank Happy and I want to thank Gordon and Michael, Fred, Doug and everyone here.'",

And I am extremely impressed by their focus and their passion and their determination to do no small things. But at the end of the day, it started here in this chamber less than a year ago.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening. I'm Beth Mirsky. I'm with the Downtown Denver Partnership and I'm speaking on behalf of the partnership. We are here in support of two AA and the five year plan. This plan presents real opportunities to realize goals outlined in the outdoor downtown and the game plans, which the downtown Denver Partnership was very much involved in.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We're looking forward to seeing investment in projects such as the Urban Forest, Skyline Park and a downtown signature children's program Playground, among other projects such as the 5280. The there is a robust, I think, public process in all of these plans now to our downtown plan, as well as the game plan.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Madam President, I want to thank the staff who shared a pretty lengthy response to a set of questions that I had. And I just got it today. So I think I've absorbed it, but I had a couple of follow ups.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'First question was about how the 2019 budget amounts work here. So we're halfway through the 2019 budget year. You presumably already have this money in the budget, but maybe it wasn't line item out. Is there a supplemental needed or tell me how the current year's budget works.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Given that you're just now releasing the plan compared to what was in the budget book. So just help me understand process wise.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I'll take a I'll take a crack at it. Gordon Robertson. Different Parks and Recreation. Our goal is to in many ways, well, one is land acquisition. So some of the funding will be utilized to acquire land. Other funding is being added scope to existing projects so that existing staff can implement the funds this year.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'With that, this really I think budget manage I think is your question more around kind of how the line items get set up in budget management for people.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So earlier an appropriation item was brought to City Council, so you all approved the appropriation of the full 37 and a half million dollars. Our aim is in the 19 budget is to spend those dollars in those categories.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And, you know, we've already brought one to you in the acquisition. The proposal is to use these funds for the acquisition of the property in southeast Denver. And we figured it would take about the same amount of time to get this plan approved.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It would take us that much time to actually get some of these other expenditures under way. But the first year our existing projects, so many of them we already have under contract, so we can add scope contracted services the same way we do a lot of our work by means of uncle contractors.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So we have the ability to add scope to those contracts and and the idea being to try to get instead of saying this was great and now wait until next year's budget before we start anything, we wanted to get things moving.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so citizens could see relatively quickly the focus again on some staffing. It'll still take, you know, a few weeks or a few months to get staff in place. But particularly because we use a lot of on call staff who if we figure we're going to be able to get moving on some of our park refreshing and'",
        "'speaker_7': 'just, you know, getting out into the parks and doing some improvements right away that that don't take a lot of planning and design and so on up front.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's great. And maybe I do just need to hear back from budget afterwards about the fact, for example, if you're hiring a staff person, you're only going to use, you know, one quarter of your FTE. I just want to make sure that we don't lose any of the 2019 funds because you weren't able to spend them on'",
        "'speaker_2': 'a full FTE.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'No, no. The good thing is, is that the funds are rollover.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They do not even even those that aren't just for capital. That's correct. Okay. That's huge. All right. Yes, super.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That's great. And and they were very good in working with us and recognizing that that would be that would be an issue. And so so we won't lose those funds. We're going to do our best to spend them.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But we recognize that that may not be possible for a lot of different reasons.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Super. My next question is about the process going forward. So like let's use dog parks, for example, one I'd love to hear, I didn't see that in any of the slides. What is the intention? But for example, acquisition might result in buying something for a dog park or development might be something about developing a dog park.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I guess what I'm curious about is as we go into the next budget cycle as a council and we have some priorities, for example, that we want to talk about with the department. Mm hmm. What does that look like in terms of being able to say, hey, we think this is really important, it fits within some'",
        "'speaker_2': 'of these things, but we want you to use some of your acquisition funds or some of your development funds and really speed up the implementation of dog parks. We've been delayed, you know, so and so I'm curious both about that actual topic, but also just thinking about it as an example of how we influence the more detailed'",
        "'speaker_2': ', granular level of this in an annual process.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Sure. Great question. It is, by the way, on the on the bottom of the slide, we did point that out and it. And it's because it came up in many of the meetings and surveys which slide. The one that's on the screen on the very the very bottom line.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I didn't see it in the dollar amounts list.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Oh, no, no, no. So but these that is a much greater we do have for 19 and 20 a much more detailed. So. So what you have in front of you is a summary budget. There is a much more granular level.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I don't think it specifically there is one at a granular level for dog parks, but I could be wrong. There are projects on the list.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean, someone can just send that to me afterwards.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And over to your the point I think of your question, which is how each year do we get to these decisions? And it'll be very similar to the process that we use every year for our annual capital improvements budget.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And that's one of the reasons why I mentioned earlier. This is simply another resource to add to the overall process. But the you know, we will build a, you know, a budget proposal. We will use the the usual sources, which is suggestions from all of you the bond list, as you know, where there were many projects that'",
        "'speaker_7': 'didn't get funded. That's a. So we look to those things the the what citizens have already told us that they wanted and maybe haven't been funded in in the past. And that we also recognize there will be some new things as we move forward.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There will be new projects that, you know, that get, you know, a project like the the district that you just heard. They may come up with some ideas. We intend to move forward. One of the items that we're very excited about or are continuing with master plans in in neighborhoods and in parks that don't have them.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So we'll have a whole bunch of new ideas and projects coming out of that process. So it'll be a very dynamic breathing process as we move forward each year.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilwoman Kenny. Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Madam President. Pro tem happier? Gordon Maybe. And we've gone over this before, but just because we probably have a wider audience here, could you briefly talk about the strategy for identifying and acquiring new parkland in under-par areas where we have residents who are well outside a ten minute walk and also address a strategy if there'",
        "'speaker_6': 'is one, which I didn't see. But I know you've thought about it for providing larger parks in areas where there's a greater population within within that 10 minutes. In other words, a five acre park in a neighborhood of 5000 people is probably not appropriate just as a 100 acre park in an area where there a thousand people'",
        "'speaker_6': 'would be too much. So what are our strategies when we have areas already developed where there's, you know, commercial, residential, whatever? In Southwest Demmer, I see some in Park Hill, I see some in South Central Denver, substantial areas without ten minute access.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Let me let Gordon Gordon's team is working on the acquisition strategy piece, and I think you can.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I congratulate you on identifying the parcel in in Councilwoman Black's district that we recently moved on and and hope to see more of that.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'As you know, we won't solve the problem overnight, but we are actively working with the National Recreation and Parks Association, with ULI and with Chester Public Land on a grant that we received to do a study of Denver and how we can implement a strategic acquisition plan.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'That effort is currently underway. We're going to go visit Seattle and Austin, who just finished their plans last year and learn from them. And then we're going to complete our plan here locally. But while we're doing that, we're certainly looking at properties that we can purchase like we did in University Hills.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So we are actively working on that with real estate. We have a team in Parks and Recreation that works with real estate to identify property and opportunities and that is ongoing. But we are looking we have a map that identifies the deserts in our city where we don't have a ten minute walk to our neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So we know the areas where we're looking. And as opportunities come up, we have the ability to to move. But in the meantime, we're doing a strategic plan citywide that we will hope to finish mid-next year.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Do you have a time out? Okay, Minister, thank you. And you'll share that with us.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I would add to that that in addition to the point you made is in addition to the ten minute walk, which is a proximity right criteria, we also take into consideration the density right in an area. So, you know, the acres per thousand people and and the development pressures so the the southeast site in council women'",
        "'speaker_7': 'blacks district is a perfect example of you know, there are equity principles. There's a there's the ten minute walk standard. There's a, there's a if we don't do something soon, there won't be any land to apply any principal to.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And, and so those are all the things that will be in the mix as we think about trying to guide our acquisition strategy.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. And we're not making any new land, are we, then?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You know, we just came back from Copenhagen when and so they actually did create new land. And so I'm intrigued by that as a potential strategy.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They're filling in, like filling in wetlands and stuff like that, I suppose, but we don't have any such recourse. Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Flynn. Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, I can remember when Sal Carpio was talking about Emerald City over the Sphere Boulevard. Cloverleaf? That was a long time ago. I'm happy. I just have one question. And it's about whether or not we can use these dollars to be doing actual planning.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Or do they. Are they concentrated on capital?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yeah. No, the the dollars can be spent on planning, which is really the most important first step in, uh, in a capital strategy. And we think very important. That's where we engage the community on what they want to see and go through the kind of process like we went through with Paco Sanchez Park where, you know, we'",
        "'speaker_7': 'heard from residents about what they wanted to see, what are the amenities, what are their, you know, interests in terms of activities. So planning and design are all an outreach for that effort, are all important parts of the process and are eligible for funding under this.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so I guess I'm I'm struggling with trying to understand how we move projects forward before we just keep piling on, you know, planning, but yet, you know, certain projects kind of lag behind because we're not putting the actual capital dollars into some of them.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So how are we like determining what those priorities are and how much does the the new equity framework that, you know, city workers, city employees are now doing the training around is sort of mimicking the Seattle model. Play into those conversations.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Is very important. And as I mentioned earlier, equity is probably the the strongest principle that guides us in the decision making about how to how to move forward. We are a part of that overall the overall city process and defining um, equity criteria.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So neighborhood them, you know, demographics, income, number of children. Um, the, you know, so a lot of, you know, a lot of things go into determining equity principles as, as well as others. And that's and that's an important part.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So when we bring, for example, each year when we bring our capital improvement budget to you, we include a set of principles that guided us in our thinking. And so it includes all of that criteria on, on how projects were selected and why some, you know, rose, rose to the top over others.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Um, one of the things I wanted to mention is I sat in on a process looking at red rocks and you know, this was around sort of the historic preservation of Red Rocks. And one of the commitments that I think we all walked away from was that we would be seeing some design guidelines for Red Rocks.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I know we've been moving forward with the camp. I understand there's some efforts to replace the the stage. And I would assume that, you know, joint parks and rec arts and venues effort. But I guess I'm just wondering kind of where are we in the design guideline process for for Red Rocks as one of our mountain'",
        "'speaker_5': 'parks that we've been anticipating would would be coming forward to guide how we do a lot of the construction work that obviously, you know, needs to happen. We want to keep it fresh, upgraded. I know there's some discussion now about replacing the the ramp on the West.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This was at the east side of the that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That's correct. And we do have in in the proposal, um, a specific budget generated for a master planning for all of our, for our mountain parks in general. It would include all of those various facilities, including Red Rocks.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And you want to add anything to that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah, but it seems like we did a lot of that planning through that process. And it's the design guidelines that are really important at that particular venue that will help guide any of the work that's that's even happening now.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Um, and so without that, you know, we want to continue to maintain the, the character and the uniqueness of that iconic venue.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We care about Red Rocks as much as anybody, and that conversation is ongoing with the community. Out the request for design guidelines. As you know, there are design guidelines for the venue itself, and so that guides whatever work happens there.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'The request currently is to have those design guidelines filter out to the whole park, the landscape, really. And that's a that's a trickier conversation to really create guidelines around the landscape of Red Rocks. But it's something that we are working with the folks that are interested in doing that to find out what they're really goals are so'",
        "'speaker_12': 'that we can make sure it's the right tool because design guidelines might not be the right tool to really kind of expand on to a landscape from what is a constructed venue. So it's a tricky conversation, but we are happy to engage in it with the community.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I think would be helpful to as those conversations continue to get updates on where we're at in that process. Sure. So that's my request to you. Thank you. And thanks for all your work on this. A strong game plan and a lot of incredible input, not just from people who served on the committee, but tons of'",
        "'speaker_5': 'people throughout the Denver community. And I know that has helped shape and guide what some of these priorities are. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. The public hearing for Council Bill 538 has closed comments by members of council. Councilwoman Sussman.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Madam Pro-Tem. I want to thank you all for the plan for this wonderful, dedicated fund for our parks. I'm very pleased about the game plan and very pleased how quickly you actually formulated from the game plan, how we're going to go about this spending, this dedicated fund.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I'm looking forward to, course, what it means for our parks to suddenly to finally have a dedicated fund for our parks and all the new parks we're going to find, whether we build the land or not, and also the activation of the mountain parks.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I'm still pulling for that regular shuttle for families from our parks here to our mountain parks. I read a story once about children in Brooklyn that didn't know that they lived beside an ocean. And I'm sure that there are children in Denver that do not know about our wonderful mountain parks.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And it will be wonderful. And I know you let us know at committee that the money can be spent on a feature like that and that you all are going to look into it. I'm very excited about that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So thanks again for all the work you're doing and I look forward to seeing our parks thrive.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Sussman. Councilman Lopez.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. I am happy to see this move forward. I just can't I can't believe my eyes after all this time. I'm just surprised. Well, I know why we didn't do it sooner. Because we were in the middle of a recession.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But somebody's always talked about is a dedicated part fund. And to see this moving forward and to see this parks, trails and open space program plan to have a game plan and actually have dollars to go with it is is different.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We've had plans. You've had so many plans that are just gathering dust and gracing bookshelves throughout the Web building. Now they're going to come alive. And I'm happy to support this. And I tell you what, all the good stuff happens when you're gone, doesn't it?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So the Llama Lincoln Park neighborhood plan is not the neighborhood plan, but the park plan. That master plan is going to happen. Lincoln Park is one of the only llama. Lincoln Park is one of our oldest parks. And it sits there and it's so underutilized.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And there's we've seen what we can do when we actually put planning to the process of the playground, turned it around. Historic park. You look at sunken gardens and look at sunken gardens to check out what it used to look like.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Right. And if you had a plan that really addressed and brought back that old sunken garden, now, it was pretty extravagant then, but the reflection pool, the pavilion and all that that got filled in because of the polio scare.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Right. Imagine if you still had that. This is one of those things that creates that reality, our mountain parks and trails. I'm just I'm happy to see this come on our time. So please move forward as you move forward.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Madam Secretary, roll call.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Black.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Flynn Hi. Cashman I.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Can.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Lopez I.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Knew. Ortega I. Assessment I. Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I. Madam Secretary, please close the voting and announce the results.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Nine Eyes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Nine Eyes Council Bill 538 has been ordered published on Monday, June 24th. Council will hold a required public hearing on Council Bill 547, designating the River Drive River Drive Historic District as a district for preservation. On Monday, July 22nd, Council will hold a required public hearing on Council Bill 449, changing the zoning classification for 2701 Lawrence Street'"
