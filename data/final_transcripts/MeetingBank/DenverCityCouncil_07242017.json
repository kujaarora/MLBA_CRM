        "'speaker_6': 'It's terrible on our streets. And it's terrible when nations engage in warfare. When when you see terrorism, it's a terrible thing. And the one thing that we always try to really promote is that age old adage that, you know, have.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'Good evening, President Berk Brooks. Councilwoman Ortega, Councilman Lopez and the rest of the Council. My name is Paul Cowan and I am the director of Denver's Gang Reduction Initiative. It's an honor to stand here tonight and accept this proclamation on behalf of all of our partners in grade, city and county that will be spending the next week'",
        "'speaker_8': 'with our friends from Birmingham discussing and exchanging ideas on ways that we can better develop prevention programs in our city and across the country and across the world as well, too.

        "'speaker_8': 'place over there. And now it's our privilege to host our delegation from Birmingham, and I just want to welcome them. And I speak on behalf of all the other Department of Safety agencies and our city agencies that will be spending the week along side our friends here.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'First of all, I'd like to thank the city of Denver for a incredibly warm welcome. This is our first day here, and we've been overawed by the incredible welcome that we've received, the people of Denver that we've met as we walked through the city and some of the people we've met this morning.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We look forward to a very, very good week ahead. I think this proclamation humbles us slightly. I think this is an incredibly important issue for both our countries and indeed both our cities. The prevention of violence, the prevention of extremism in all its forms is a challenge of our age, actually.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And it requires prevention strategies such as great and great to be successful, to be working with our communities. And we look forward to not just sharing our lessons, but also learning from yourselves and how we can move forward as two cities and as a start of an information sharing process that will hopefully work to keep our community'",
        "'speaker_9': 'safe. I'd just like to invite our Cabinet member from Birmingham City Council who has Cabinet responsibilities for this area, who may want to say a few words. Thank you and thank you for the Council for adopting this proclamation.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It's incredibly important. This work we do around global cooperation between our cities, I think is very welcome. And it's been, as I can say, it's been a great honor to visit the city of Denver. It's been aptly fascinating.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It's a great pleasure to visit your great baseball team, the Rockies. Great to see them win of the day. As a fellow support of a maybe historically struggling team of Aston Villa. It's brilliant to see the Rockies doing so well, so crazy.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I was also struck me as a city councilor, we have 120 members. So it's quite it's interesting to see the lower of the 13 members want to know how you manage the workload, quite honestly. But it's great to be here and thank you so much the welcome.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And on behalf of the city of Birmingham, the people of Birmingham, I'd like to present you with this. This shared as a token of our goodwill. So thank you. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, thank you. To the secretary. Please give them a hand. I have to ask the member of City Council. Can you please come to the person? How in the world do you deal with 120 city council folks.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Even though we don't have the First Amendment? I think it's incredibly challenging, but I think we work very, very closely between the Office of Core and the Council Membership Core. And it's incredibly important for our city where we have lots of challenges and we just do the job, I suppose.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, from us to you, we just want to thank you for being here. We recognize that, you know, countries talk to each others, but really cities do. It's cities that make things move. And so we want to be in cooperation with our global partners all over.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'As Councilman Ortega said, we have 12 sister cities. We've named them after our parks and we hope that we can keep a great relationship with you. Councilman Lopez.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I was just going to say, it's not the size of the city council that matters. It's the size. It's us. So, yeah. Thank you. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, thank you so much. And once again, we want to give you a round of applause for coming all this way. All right. Thank you. And thank you, Councilwoman Ortega, for for bringing that forward. All right. That concludes our proclamations for this evening.'"

Rezones property located at 8504 East Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and 2962 North Central Park Boulevard from C-MU-20 to M-RX-5A (commercial, mixed-use to master planned, residential, mixed-use) in Council District 8.

This is a request to rezone 8504 East Martin Luther King Junior Boulevard and 2962 North Central Park Boulevard from CMU. 22 rx5a property is located in Council District eight in the Stapleton neighborhood at the corner of MLK Boulevard and Central Park Boulevard, also'",
        "'speaker_5': 'bounded by Willow Street and 29th place. It's across an Oak Boulevard from Central Park. The property is about three acres and is currently vacant. The applicant is requesting the rezoning to develop the property. The requested rezoning is from C 20, which is an old code.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Former Chapter 59 Zoning of commercial mixed use to mrx5a which is the master plan. Neighborhood Context residential mixed use five storey maximum height. The next master plan in context is a bit unusual. We don't see a lot of it, but it's allowed in areas that have a general development plan of at least 50 acres and on sites'",
        "'speaker_5': 'that are more than a quarter mile away from a transit station. As mentioned, it's a residential mixed use, which Will has up to five stories with a wide range of building forms and uses. As mentioned, the property is governed by a general development plan, the Stapleton Redevelopment South General Development Plan, which calls for mixed use development neighborhoods'",
        "'speaker_5': 'which incorporate multiple uses. And includes urban design standards and guidelines. As mentioned, the site is currently zoned c 20 as is the property to the west. Properties to the south and east are zoned r m 30 with waivers that residential mixed use and to the north is again Central Park, which is zoned open space.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The reason this property was not resumed in 2010 was because at the time it looked like it was part of a plan. Building group and properties that were part of planned building groups were not resound in 2010 to the new code.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'However, upon closer examination, while this property was going through this current rezoning, we realized it was not actually included in that building group. So it's not part of the plan building group. But that's why it was not resolved in 2010.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'As mentioned, the site is currently vacant and to the north is the park. On the other three sides are residential mix of single-family, duplex and townhomes. You can see in the pictures here, the currently vacant property there in the center, the park above that, and then a variety of residential around it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This application went to the planning board on May 3rd, where it was recommended for approval by a 5 to 4 vote. There are also four members of the public there that spoke about it went to the Land Use Transportation and Infrastructure Committee on May 23rd and has received 18 letters of public comment as of.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thursday morning, which you have included in your packet. In order to approve a rezoning, the city must find that these five criteria are met. The first criterion is consistency with adopted plans. There are three plans that apply to this property.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The first being comprehensive plan 2000, as described in the staff report. Staff has found that the proposed rezoning complies with the four strategies listed here, mostly having to do with promoting mixed use development. The next plan is Blueprint Denver from 2000 to the proposed future concept plan to use and for this property in Blueprint.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Denver is single family residential, which calls for predominantly single family homes and density less than ten units per acre, but does allow for some employment and some variety in housing types. So we're looking at just this individual. BLOCK The proposed zoning does not match up with the the proposed future land use, but we're looking at the much'",
        "'speaker_5': 'larger single family residential area within Stapleton and accounting for that allowed variety and variability within that staff with the proposed zoning could be consistent with that land use designation. This is also an area of change. Blueprint. Denver also includes street classifications.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Both Martin Luther King Junior Boulevard and Central Park Boulevard are designated mixed use arterials, which call for higher intensity and mix of uses along them. Both 29th Place and Willow Street are designated locales which are intended to serve as access connecting individual properties to larger streets.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Blueprint. Denver also includes specific recommendations for the Stapleton area that calls for a network of urban villages within Stapleton and mixed use development to reduce the number of trips and life of trips taken. So considering the land use concept calling for single family, but the streets calling for mixed use development and the recommendations for the Stapleton area'",
        "'speaker_5': ', Steph believes that the proposed zoning is consistent with the Blueprint Denver recommendations. The third plan is the Stapleton Development Plan from 1995. This property is in District two of that plan, which calls for predominantly employment with some residential areas adjacent to parks similar to the site.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It also calls for higher densities, more intense development at intersections such as this one, and call specifically for higher density housing at Yosemite, which as it was developed, ended up being Central Park Boulevard and what's now Central Park.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So the site we're talking about right now. So we're looking at the overall plan direction from Blueprint and from the Stapleton development. Seems to be some inconsistency, some calling for single family residential, some calling for higher intensity and employment.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And Steph believes that the M or s5a is an adequate compromise of those different plan directions. And so finds that. The proposed rezoning is consistent with the adopted plans. The second criterion is uniformity of district regulations. Steph has found that the proposed rezoning will result in the uniform application of the Matrix five zone district.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The third criterion is to further the public health, safety and general welfare of the city. Staff has found that the proposed rezoning will do so by implementing the city's adaptive plans and allow and facilitating the development of a currently vacant parcel.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The fourth criterion is justifying circumstances. Staff has found that the proposed rezoning is justified by the current development of Stapleton. Stapleton has not significantly since this property was initially zoned in the nineties and given the nature of the development steps from the proposed rezoning from CMU to 20, a commercial mixed use to AMR X5, a residential mixed'",
        "'speaker_5': 'use is justified. And the fifth criterion is consistency with neighborhood context, zone, district purpose and intent. Staff finds that the proposed marks five eight zone districts will allow development consistent with the description of the master plan, neighborhood context and the metrics for the purpose and intent as described in the zoning code so that staff finds that all'",
        "'speaker_5': 'five criteria are met and recommends approval. I'll be happy to answer any questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Scott. All right. This evening, we have 20 speakers and I'm going to call the first five speakers and I'm going to ask the folks in the front row if you could find a seat back here, because we're going to use this front row for the speakers to sit.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And it's got that and that includes you. Okay. Call the first five speakers up. Bruce O'Donnell. Jim Christman. John Van Hoff. Sekou and Suzanne. Shuttle Challenger. Sorry about that. Bruce O'Donnell, you are first.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Actually. Do you mind if I. I'm Jim Christian of Forest City. And we talked about maybe maybe going first.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Um, we have an order in which we can do things, if that's okay. Thank you. Go ahead. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_15': 'Thank you. Good evening, Mr. President. Members of council. My name is Bruce O'Donnell, and I'm at 770 Sherman Street in Denver, Colorado. I'm a representative for Forest City Stapleton on this rezoning, this site, which is currently zoned CMU 20, which is left over from the old Chapter 59 code, has always been zoned for mixed density MIT pardon'",
        "'speaker_15': 'me, mid density, mixed use development. Ever since the former Stapleton Airport closed in the first zoning was put on it in 1999. It's been zoned CMU 20. The current CMU 20 zoning does not limit building heights, and it is for air or floor area ratio driven zoned district as opposed to a form base district like is in'",
        "'speaker_15': 'our current code and like will be in the mrx5a as such today it's a use by right that 132,000 square feet of building could be developed on this site, including a wide range of commercial uses. And in fact, as you can see in the packet that was provided to you, there's been a sign on the property you'",
        "'speaker_15': 'might notice for ten years now that this is a future high density, mixed use site, development site. Pardon me. The rezoning request before you this evening will allow similar type development as is allowed today to occur on the property with the following important differences.'",
        "'speaker_15': 'One Unlike the current zoning building heights are limited to five storeys with the more x5a. As I mentioned, the CMU 20 does not have a building height limitation. Unlike the current zoning, commercial uses are limited to only be allowed on the ground floor in the new zoning and in the CMU 20 commercial could be on every floor'",
        "'speaker_15': '. And then in addition, and importantly, far fewer commercial uses are allowed in the Mar x five, which is predominantly a residential mixed use district. In addition to all of that, in in response to neighborhood input, the applicant for City Stapleton has voluntarily offered and agreed to limit building heights to three stories along the east and south.'",
        "'speaker_15': 'Portions of the property adjacent to where there is existing development today in that offer is in response to input heard from nearby residents. Four City is firmly committed to continuing its partnership with the city and the community to responsibly develop all of Stapleton and to implement the Stapleton Development Plan in May.'",
        "'speaker_15': 'X5, combined with this voluntary height limitation, is the right zoning in the best zoning to foster the quality development for a city envisions finishing out the development of Stapleton with for these reasons and also for consistency with the staff report recommending approval and planning board recommending approval.'",
        "'speaker_15': 'I formally request the planning or excuse me the City Council vote to approve map amending application 2016 i0011 to rezoning 8504 East MLK Boulevard and 2962 Boulevard from See Me 25. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You on time and sorry we did not have your time up there. Mr. Jim Christman.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Yes. Thank you. My name is Jim Christman. I'm a senior vice president with four city Stapleton, just 7351 East 29th Avenue and Denver 80238. I'd just like to reiterate a couple of the things you've already heard. I think there are important points.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The first is this is consistent with the master plan for state plan that was adopted over 20 years ago as an amendment to the comprehensive plan. There's very specific language in that plan that calls out for higher density housing into two places one adjacent arterials and two adjacent to large scale amenities.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Parks like Central Park.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So knowing that that was always the plan when the infrastructure for Stapleton was designed, it was designed with the. Understanding that the trip count on this corner could be what it would be with the zoning. So the Central Park Boulevard and MLK have the capacity to handle any trips that are generated from this this project.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The Bruce mentioned some of the uses under the current zoning that wouldn't be allowable under the new zoning. And I'll give you a few examples of that. Any type of manufacturing facility is allowable under CMU 20th building could have a single storey 135,000 foot manufacturing facility.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Would we do that now but in the future? You know, you never know what might happen. Gas stations are also allowable as well as recycling collection facilities. Just to give another example and then again, we heard, you know, we did we did have some interface with the neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We did hear their concerns. And we're trying to address their concern by offering a step by step back the building height immediately to the single family homes from three stories to five to manage the transition and to move across the street to three.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And then when you get further into the project and up against the major arterials, it would go to five. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Christmann. John Van.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I asked Scott if I could. Good evening. My name is John Van Hoff. I reside at 8542 East 29th place, just south of the area. In consideration this time, I would like to ask those in the audience and opposition to this matter to raise their hands for a few seconds.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Within 200 feet of this site, there are 40 to 45 homes. I would appreciate if you could focus on the pictures of our homes, on your monitor as we speak. Since mid April, the biggest problem with the application has been that Forest City does not have a developer or a site plan.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In light thereof. We have to assume the worst under the proposed zoning. That being a five story apartment condo building, first floor commercial, and the associated traffic, parking and safety concerns. Forest City originally told the neighbors that the site would contain 130 to 150 units.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'By June that had increased to 225 units. And to make things worse, it appears that the neighbors have little or no say in the permitting process. A massive five storey structure consuming the entire three acre site does not fit into the surrounding neighborhood of some 40 single family homes, paired homes and townhomes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I should also note that from All-Star Street to Havana, some 24 blocks, there are only one, two and three storey residences. I should also note that from Ulster East Bridge, some 20 blocks, there is no commercial except for Punchbowl.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'While appreciating Scott helping me to understand the very complicated zoning process. Thanks, Scott. I cannot agree with him and CPD that the proposed zoning meets all five review criteria. Specifically, we feel that the proposed zoned district does not further the public health, safety and welfare, and secondly, that it is not consistent with the neighborhood context.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In brief, putting a five storey building on this site is totally incompatible with the neighborhood. There is already excessive traffic on MLK and CPB, plus extreme congestion at the intersection due to that congestion, entrances and exits to the complex problem.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We will probably be on our side streets that would be unsafe for the neighbors. In conclusion, I would ask that you consider the information I and my neighbors are presenting and reject the proposed zoning for not furthering the public health, safety and welfare and not being consistent with the neighborhood context.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'If additional traffic safety data is needed, I suggest a postponement until a traffic study can be done. However, if you disagree with a neighbor's position and desire to approve the request, then we ask that you approved with conditions, and those conditions should address those concerns expressed by the neighbors this evening.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I thank you for your time and consideration.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Must have enough scoop.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Yes. My name is Chairman Sekou. I'm the founder organizer for the Black Star Action Movement for Self-defense. We come before council today to support this zoning change. And we come to support the zoning zoning change but certain. Conditions.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Which have been outlined by the previous speakers who were opposed to this zoning change. Now. We already know how this thing is going to go down. Council was going to approve this zoning change. You're going to do it.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'It wouldn't get to the floor if you didn't have the votes. So consider a president. Seriously. The opposition. Conditions because we have a serious problem with these developers in our neighborhood, particularly when it pertains to black people. See there's going to be a lot of jobs available with all this construction done in Stapleton, but there's an abysmal'",
        "'speaker_13': 'record of black participation on these sites. You go by them sites, you don't see no black folks working. None. Not one even holding a stop sign. And then you come before council with these glorious plans, systematically excluding black people from participating in the benefits that are happening in the city.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So the question becomes political courage. Now these sites have to be overseen by city council as this developed. Otherwise, we have a systematic participation of city council and excluding black participation and employment within the city. And so we're faced with the challenge of not looking the other way.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Now, Dr. King once said that there comes a time when things have to be done that aren't necessarily. Comfortable. And they're not necessarily politically expedient and they're the right thing to do. And so he said in 1957, you show me a man and woman who has nothing they're willing to fight for.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'They are not fit to live. Go out to City Park and read his statue. So where do we go from here? Can we go from chaos or do we go to community? So I'm supporting this measure with these conditions.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So folks are real clear. We have some serious, serious work to do. And I salute city council for being present here with the existing members and also those that have been here for a while this cycle. Thank you very much for your time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Suzanne Chandler.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I have to break this down. Thank you very much. Good evening, everybody. And I do want to just preface everything I say. The plan for Stapleton was made 20 years ago. Things have changed in Denver, so. I am in favor of developing the parcel MLK Boulevard and Central Park boulevards, but development to be useful and successful should'",
        "'speaker_3': 'be intelligent, appropriate and compassionate, and should be in harmony with the surrounding neighborhood. The tio d plan only a half a mile from this site is everything it ought to be to enhance the neighborhood, a vibrant, urban style enclave anchored around a transit hub providing for retail.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Housing and office.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Space. This parcel under consideration here has none of those qualifications positioned at a notoriously congested, fast moving and hazardous intersection site of numerous accidents. The proposed project is a behemoth of 225 one and two bedroom units with ground floor retail.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This will add hundreds of new residents, visitors and their cars to the residential area. Additionally, the heavy traffic on the boulevards will force all this added traffic from the proposed complex, as well as delivery trucks serving the retail spaces onto Willow Street and 29th place.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Changing the nature of the residential neighborhood and creating a formidable safety risk to the citizens, children, parents and grandparents who bike, walk, jog and stroll. I urge you implore you to be good neighbors and reject any proposed zoning that allows for development not compatible with the scale and character of the existing neighborhood currently and solidly made up'",
        "'speaker_3': 'of townhomes, paired and single family homes. Please, all council women and men be good neighbors and preserve the integrity of our neighborhood and the safety of all its residents by voting against misguided and reckless zoning choices. I thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Ma'am. Can you state your name for the record, please? Excuse me. You didn't state your name at the beginning and you stated for the record.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'State my name. Yes. I'm sorry. Suzanne Challinor. I live at 85, 61 East 29th Avenue.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Miss Gellar. Thank you. Appreciate it. Okay, now I'm going to call the next five. No, Lawrence. Judy Bolen. Robin. I'm sorry if I mispronounce your name. Krakowski. Jane Warner. Let's see. One, two, three. And one more, Laura, Twitter.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No. Lawrence, your first.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Hi. I'm Noel Lawrence and I live in Denver and my address is 8462 East 29th Place. I reside to the south of the property in question. And it's a. Suburban courtyards and. Beyond the fact that it doesn't really make sense for.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The location in terms of having a huge apartment complex by the hour, suburban homes. It really is a traffic and safety issue because as it appears as though what would happen is the curb cuts or entrances and exits would go in on Willow and on 29th place, which are side streets and very small side streets, actually.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And. My children and other people's children play on the garden courtyard and. This really would decrease the safety of our children and of us having these be the cut ins where they're they would probably end up paying. And the Son community organization in Stapleton has voiced their concerns, too, about regarding the safety.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'In a letter that they sent to council. And again, it's not appropriate for the setting. There's this huge Todd development that's going to go on down the street at the where the light rail is. And so. That's really where these kind of buildings belong.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And for city has plenty of space to make piles of money and. You have their commercial development. But again, it doesn't make sense at this intersection. Thank you for considering the negative impact that this will have on our community.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And. Please. Please vote no.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. LAWRENCE Thank you. All right. Judy Berlin.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Oh, that's me. I'm Judy Bulow. I'm at 8461 East 29th Avenue. Sorry about that. Which is, again, south of the lot we're talking about. We brought our home 11 years ago, and we're promised a certain measure of light, openness and livability.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We're kind of like the tumbleweeds that were coming down the sidewalk in the streets, but the tumbleweeds are gone. But I'm afraid with this apartment complex that our way of life is threatened. And the people who live across from the apartment that they're talking about, their way of life is threatened to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I have two main concerns. One is the more traffic, more accidents. The traffic is unbearable right now. There's people speeding. There are people going through red lights. I can't even imagine what it would be like with an apartment complex.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And also, the punchbowl is going to be open soon. And that's where the tower, the repurposing of the tower, the tower that's still there. And that is like an amusement center. It's a bar. It's a bowling alley. It's going to have a lot of people in there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And that's going to increase the traffic, too, because they want families during the day. They want drinkers at night till one or two in the morning. Um. Let's see. Okay. I also have noticed school kids, walkers, couples, bikers, joggers, families, runners, cats and dogs and other varieties of animals using Central Park and Martin Luther King for their'",
        "'speaker_3': 'routes. I can't even imagine what an apartment complex would do to all of us who live close to their apartment. Complexes, by their nature, are busy and transitional at best, with dwellers coming and going, visiting, moving in, moving out on 20 place, 29th place and Willow, both of which are very narrow streets.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Homes are a little different. We already have a boatload of apartments on Martin Luther King. We have apartments coming in, as the other man suggested. Down by the train center. Is Stapleton going to be an apartment complexes? The whole thing going to be apartments?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I feel like it is. Well, let's see. What why do we need more apartments? Why here in this little place, this vacant lot? Why now? I also wonder, is this building complex? We're doing this duty for our homes, not to mention the quality of this man.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Excuse me. You're out of time.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I know. Yeah, I know. You're out of time. My question is to finish. Why don't we know you really.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You really have to. You have to sit down because we have to honor everybody else. People. Thank you. We have to honor everybody else's time. Thank you. Good points. Okay, Robin. Crack down, ski. I'm sorry. Oh, did I?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good job.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Come on. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Members of the council president. Good evening. Thank you for the opportunity to address you. My name is Robin Krakowski, and I've lived in Colorado in Stapleton for five and a half years. Although I currently live in Bluff Lake, I lived in the neighborhood adjacent to the lot in question for a couple of years.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Coming from the East Coast. What I love most about Stapleton is the thoughtful and deliberate attention that's been given to the development of each neighborhood. And each little neighborhood within each few blocks clearly have a different feel and atmosphere.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So it is beyond any understanding why this parcel of land would be treated differently and not be developed to match the surrounding neighborhood of residents as. A large five five story complex apartment does not fit. I am in and by this neighborhood on a daily basis.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This intersection is one of, if not the busiest in Stapleton. Adding additional high density and high traffic.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Activity to this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Location seems reckless. Punchbowl Social across the street, a men's development at the transit center and the expansion of MLK in the Central Park Bridge. All will increase activity dramatically to this location. And that's not to mention what already occurs with the park right there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Retail options already exist for this neighborhood. The 29th Avenue Town Center, Stanley Market Place and East Bridge are less than a mile with much more to come at the transit center. We don't need more restaurants, liquor stores, dry cleaners, or work out places, especially right here.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I encourage the Council to only entertain a zoning that would allow for one, two and three level homes, townhomes and condos. I don't believe that any other decision is reasonable or appropriate. Thank you again for the opportunity to speak.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Krakowski. All right, Jane Warner.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Members of council. Good evening. My name is Jane Warner and I reside at 2962 Willow Street in Denver, just east of the lot proposed for rezoning. I have lived at this address for 11 years. As I stated in my letter to council, we always knew that that lot would be developed, but we expected that it would be'",
        "'speaker_3': 'something that would fit in with the neighborhood, homes and surroundings, because that's what we were told. There are issues I am concerned about with the rezoning of this lot to more of a changing the character of the neighborhood parking, etc..'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But the main concern I want to address tonight is this the corner of MLK and Central Park Boulevard is already an extremely busy intersection. Or as Tom Gleason from Forest City says, main arterial, main street to Main Street.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The traffic has increased greatly in the last 11 years and is only going to get worse. Things like the extension of MLK, the expansion of the Bridge, the Punchbowl Social, of which Mr. Thompson described the development as part art, part science and the sciences.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The great demographics of the Stapleton area, including its proximity of Interstate 70, which could make it not only a neighborhood draw, but a potential regional destination. I understand it's his business, but for that corner, more traffic. Because Central Park Boulevard and MLK is a main arterial with a lot of traffic, cars, people, pets, lots of accidents and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'a lot of near misses. And the city's usual requirement that prevents traffic entrance from the main arteries. Chances are that the entrances to this lot and the exits would be on Willow and 29th place. This would really increase the traffic on Willow, which is an already busy street, especially when there are events at the park.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Holidays like Halloween and then add to the potential of 200 plus apartments and their tenants. With this increase in people in traffic, safety becomes the most utmost priority. There are times when our milk is like a raceway. Then cars turn onto willow and drive in the same manner.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we don't want to have another injury fatality like the one years ago on Central Park and 29th. In closing, I know that Mr. Gleason has said that Denver has said that putting the high density structures at major arterials is the way to go, but it's not necessarily the right thing in the end.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Once for a city sells the remaining lots and Stapleton, they will be gone to develop other areas and our neighborhoods will be here 24 seven and we need to protect them and especially the people who live here. Therefore, I am asking you to consider opposing this rezoning and encourage Barr City to resubmit for MH three zoning.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you for your time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Miss Warner. All right. Laura Tweedle.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening, President and members of council. My name is Laura Tuttle. I reside at eight, six, six three East 29th place. When I bought my home in July of 2007, I was told that that lot would be filled with single family homes, period homes and townhouses, which was taken under consideration when we made the decision to move'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to Stapleton. Now, ten years later, I'm being told that it's just been three rezone and filled with an apartment building that could be up to five stories tall. I've been living in this area for ten years. When I moved to Stapleton.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Ten years ago, there were 6500 people that lived there. Now there's 74,000. You can imagine the traffic and Central Park and MLK. I've said it that way at 5:00 through at least three lights trying to get through that intersection.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's without any additional housing right now. It's bad enough as it is with the additional with all the people that live there. Then when the punchbowl is finished, I can discern about what the traffic will be like. In addition to the safety factors, as Jane mentioned, there was a death a few years ago at 29th and Central'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Park. There could be another one, and I wouldn't be surprised if there was because of the way people raced through there and then they turn off of MLK onto Willow and continue to race. I've seen people fly through there at 40, 45 miles an hour.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm sure there's other things to be done about that, but I am very concerned about what would be built there. I'm opposed to the bill and I would like to see more residential, more single family homes, paired homes and townhouses.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Wade. Donna Davis.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening, councilmembers. My name is Donna Davis. I live at 8600 East 29th Avenue. Denver 80238. I moved into this address in 2003. There was nothing to the north of us. It was vacant fields all the way to Dick's Sports Arena.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I live right on the southeast corner of Willow and 29th Avenue. Over the past 14 years, my husband and I have witnessed the growth in our neighborhood, and we have supported every ballot issue to build schools, improve infrastructure.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We support the growth of Stapleton. However, we do not support the high density growth in this area. We are opposed to rezoning of this high density area for three reasons. Parking. The increased traffic to the neighborhood and safety and security concerns.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Currently overflow parking from events that occur at Central Park. They park on Willow Street and Willow is a narrow residential street. So you add more cars from the apartment complex to that and it will increase the congestion in that area even more.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The traffic. We've already talked to a lot of folks have talked about the traffic in the area, but they haven't really talked about the Willow Street traffic that's currently occurring. We have a lot of busses that travel from north to south on Willow, because they go to the Westerly Creek.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We have parents drive down Willow Street to drop their kids off at Westerly Creek. And we also have a lot of kids on bikes and walking to school. Adding 300 cars or are associated with this apartment building would impact that walkability bike ability neighborhood that we all bought into.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I have safety concerns about the crime and theft that's happening in our area and with the transit community that lives in these high density apartments. I am concerned for the safety of our homes. So I ask you to oppose this bill.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Ms.. Davis. All right. I'm going to call the next five. Evan Melman. Leonard Spaghetti. David Robbins. Let's see. Leslie Lockhart. One more. Kara Kuzma. All right, Evan Melman, your first.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Good evening, city council members. My name is Evan Millman and I live in Stapleton one block from the parcel in question. I'm an 8560 East 29th Avenue. First, I want to thank all of you for the work you do on our behalf.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'And I really want to thank Chris Herndon for being extremely responsive when I reached out to him to inquire about this process. I also reached out to Jim Christman and city planner Scott Robinson, also both very responsive. So I appreciate that.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'But I strongly oppose the rezoning application because although it seems like it might offer more residential options than the current zoning, the intended use that Jim Christman shared with me that we've been talking about tonight just doesn't fit the character of the community.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'And, you know, very simply, I don't know if I have anything new to add from what you've already heard, but it just to add 300 or more additional people on a three acre parcel in what is an entirely residential single family townhome community just will change the what it means to live there for the worse.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'And I think that the negative effects outweigh whatever positive benefits might be there for putting this amount of people in that space out of character of the neighborhood. There are five storey condo buildings in Stapleton. There's one being completed at 29th and Rosslyn, but that's the other end of Stapleton.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'There's existing buildings that match it that are already there. So people that live there are already on notice. The market's adjusted for it. And so in keeping with the immediate surrounding neighborhood, you know that real estate's local and it's very local within a couple of streets is what determines what it's like to live in your neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'So if you go east down 29th to where this is, this parcel, it's a much different residential character. It's reasonable to develop the parcel. It's just unreasonable to develop it in a way that single handedly increases the population density, traffic, parking, congestion, so much so that it negatively impacts what it's like to live near it.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Let me be clear. My objection is to the sheer number of additional people the development would add to the immediate surrounding neighborhood, regardless of the income, ethnicity, age, or any other characteristic of those people. I welcome responsible urban development in keeping with the immediate surrounding community, such as townhomes, income, qualified homes, single homes, even condos and apartments'",
        "'speaker_14': '. Just fewer of them. I went and counted how many townhouses you could fit on this parcel, and by my estimate, you could put 46 townhomes that match townhomes across the street. If you did that, instead of 275 additional bedrooms, which is just one way to talk about this, you'd be adding 138 additional bedrooms.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'So there's still room to increase the residential character of that parcel. Much more in keeping with the neighborhood in a way that allows more people to move in without it changing the nature of living a block away. So I urge you to consider this application as though you lived a block away and ask yourself if you want'",
        "'speaker_14': 'to wake up the next day with 300 new neighbors. I respectfully request that you deny the zoning application. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'I'm not here to oppose the rezoning.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I would hate to see this property continue as a commercial property. It could be much worse. Then the zoning.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That exists or the proposed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Plan for this property. I am opposed, however, for the many reasons that you've already heard. For the development of this property and the proposed development of this property. The. The area is very, very congested already. We don't need more multi-family homes in this area.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thanks. I yield my time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Spaghetti, for yielding time. David Robbins.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Really mean. President Brooks, members of the council, thank you very much for listening to us tonight. We appreciate your service to the city and understand sometimes you have to make hard decisions. I'm speaking on behalf of my wife and myself alone, a period home at 2958 Willow Street.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We've owned that home for ten years. That's across from the subject property on Willow. We would ask you to oppose the proposed action that is before you tonight. We we really oppose a five story structure, five storeys at any location on this lot.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'When you look at the pictures that were.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Provided by your.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Staff, you can see that on four sides of this proposed structure, there is a city park and there are a whole group of single family duplex, parent home structures as well as townhome structures. A five story building, five stories at any point is both inconsistent and inappropriate at this location for a city has done a good job'",
        "'speaker_5': 'of developing the Stapleton community. There's no question about it. But as development winds to a close, I hate to see them seeking to maximize their financial returns on the backs of this neighborhood. A five story building with commercial.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Where will the tenants and the employees park? They certainly are not going to park in parking constructed below ground, but for a city that they have to pay for. They can't afford to pay rent in a building as well as parking fees.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So they'll park in the neighborhood, changing the character of the community for several blocks around. And where will access occur. You've heard from.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Several of the speakers.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Tonight that both Martin Luther King Boulevard and Central Park.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Boulevard are major.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Arterials in this part of the city. Traffic moves quickly. Traffic has high volumes at the intersection of those two streets. We have lanes that are.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Designed to allow traffic.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'To accelerate or decelerate before making turns. It's unlikely that your traffic department is going to allow significant access into this parcel off of those sorts of streets. It just will create enormous confusion and congestion. So they will have to get into this space off of Willow and 29th to streets that are absolutely not designed, set up to'",
        "'speaker_5': 'manage that kind of commercial traffic. Therefore, we ask each of you to vote no.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'On this proposed agenda.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Item and to support this community.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you very much for your time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Robins. Lesley Lockhart.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hello. My name is Leslie Lou Card, and I am here tonight seeking to be educated about the development that has been in The Buzz. I live at 9074 MLK, which is just down from this proposed area. And I would like to speak in solidarity with the people who live on Willow and 29th and are objecting to a'",
        "'speaker_3': 'development of this size and scope at that location. For the same reasons, I feel there will be a significant change to the character of what's currently a wonderful neighborhood. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Carol Kuzma.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hi. I'm Cara Katzmaier. I live at eight, six, five, four. Martin Luther King Junior Boulevard, about six doors east of Willow. And the lot in question. I'd rather be at home in my pajamas right now after a long workday, but I thought that this was important to come and talk about.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I've lived on MLK for three and a half years, and in that time I've observed a glut of traffic both on MLK and Central Park. You guys are probably noticing a theme, seeing as they are the only real arteries through Stapleton.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That should come as no surprise. For a city built a suburban neighborhood of quiet, single family homes bordered by higher density townhomes, primarily on these two main thoroughfares, with some commercial mixed in around the edges of the neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'By insulating the rest of the neighborhood from through, traffic planners have created a problematic high traffic zone, including high speeds, driving past residences and the park where our children play. I'm often nearly rear ended in the right turn lane so only right turn off of MLK onto Willow.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'When and often when pulling into the frontage road that the go in front of the townhomes on MLK. In my view, to add the potential of up to four stories of residential and a story of commercial at the intersection of these two arteries will tip the balance from a neighborhood community feel to a congested blight.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Simply put, it's not why I chose to live in Stapleton while finalizing plans for developing this rezoning, presumably being a part of that. You must also view it within the context of the offer of the other nearby projects, of which there are a number.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And while I hope they augment the neighborhood, they will undoubtedly add a lot of people in cars. Well, I purchased my home knowing it was on a busy corridor. I'm stunned to see the advancement of large scale development that doesn't quite fit the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'When it's placed on the edges of the neighborhood, it makes some sense and seems to have community acceptance. But I'm having trouble accepting the idea of it being in the virtual center of our community, surrounded primarily by homeowners.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The scale of whatever development is built on that lot needs to be consistent with the surrounding neighborhood. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Kuzma. I'm going to bring up Mr. Mr. Robbins one more time. You just need to state your name for the record. You didn't get a chance to state your name.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'this. I just want to add a personal story. My wife and I bought the bought our house seven months ago when she. Nine months ago when she was seven months pregnant. And the reason that we chose this house over a lot of others is the wonderful courtyard that I believe nine of us neighbors share.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We saw kids playing in there the moment that we looked in there. We look forward to my son Nate playing in there with me, whatever he's into. And my main worry is that a development of this size will increase the traffic like you guys have heard from many neighbors along 29th place and along Willow.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That's my concern. I know that Denver is growing. I'm a transplant myself. I support growth in Stapleton. It's a wonderful community. We want to have new neighbors. We want to meet a lot more people for our son to play with.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But I feel like the proposed development is just too massive in scale for it to remain safe on the streets that are right adjacent to a courtyard in front of our house. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Stanley Berry McDermott.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Barry McDermott I live at 8604 Martin Luther King Boulevard. My wife and I live right on the corner of Willow and Martin Luther King Boulevard, and we have lived there for about three and a half years, and we certainly know the experience of listening to the traffic rush by our Martin Luther King Boulevard.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We also know the difficulties of turning right onto Willow. We have heard the accidents in our living room some evenings. We are not strangers to urban living. We've been in Denver for over 35 years. We lived in Capitol Hill for ten years.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We live about ten blocks away from here on Bannock for another 20 years. And when we moved to Stapleton, we moved to Stapleton because of how crowded this part of Denver had gotten for us. And that's that seems to be the big concern is how much more crowded Stapleton will become if this particular unit housing unit is'",
        "'speaker_2': 'allowed to be developed there. As far as the zoning board goes, many people in here tonight do not agree with the rezoning of it. But I think those same people do not agree with the present zoning of it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so we feel that that will have to be addressed at some point. Also. But just as a personal note, for three and a half years while I've lived here almost every day of the year, I go for a walk through this neighborhood and I either begin it or ended on the hill across the street from my'",
        "'speaker_2': 'house in the park. And when I stand on that hill and I look at this lot that we are talking about, for as long as I can see, there is nothing over three stories. And on Sundays I can see pretty far south from that vantage point.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so it is obvious to me, just by standing at that spot every day, that a five storey 200 unit complex on this three acre lot would be totally inappropriate. I also do not buy arguments that this was in the original plan because things have changed and those people who set out in the original plan not to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'their fault, they do not know what it is like to be in Stapleton right now, what it has become. And so we are asking that you vote no on this request because what is being proposed to be put in this place is not in character with what the neighborhood has become.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'As far as the president's zoning. It is not a good argument to me to say that a lot worse could be built there, because when that present zoning was given to that piece of land. It also was the wrong and inappropriate thing to zoning it for.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I ask you tonight, as all these people have spoken before me, I ask you to oppose this. And I thank you for listening to all of us.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. McDermott. Kim KENYON.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'My name is Kim KENYON and I live at 8704 East MLK Boulevard, which is just a little bit east of the. The the. Open lot. I do want to say that I have really loved what Four City has done.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'As many other speakers have mentioned before in Stapleton and some of the decisions that that that they have made have been wonderful. But this one, with the potential of this being a five storey building, as everybody else has mentioned, is something that is of great concern.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'When the building that I live in, based upon the argument that the 1995 plan stated that this should be a specific use. I live in MLK. 8704 MLK, which was never designed to be this because what happened, as all of you know, is that the economy plummeted and there were lots that could not be that nobody would'",
        "'speaker_3': 'would purchase as developers. And so lots stayed empty and vacant for years until the economy came back up. So actually many different changes have happened based upon need, not directly related to the original plan. For instance, a school was built and it wasn't supposed to be built in that area, but it was built based upon need because'",
        "'speaker_3': 'there were more children. So basing this on something from 1995 is not a valid argument. The arguments that everybody have made about it shouldn't really be taller than a three storey building. Any of you could drive there and you would agree in the meeting on May 3rd, many of the members of the committee that we that we'",
        "'speaker_3': 'spoke at in the May 3rd meeting where this was originally proposed, there was a very lengthy conversation and people knew that lot, lot plot of land. And it was that's where this compromise came about of, well, maybe we do three stories on on Will on 29th, and then we do five stories closer to Central Park in MLK'",
        "'speaker_3': '. But that's not a zoning you want. Why don't you zone it and you say, yes, it's okay to do this. Then the developers get to do what they want. It's not like you get to say, Well, we're going to go ahead and put in this little agreement.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'A zoning is a zoning. And so I had asked a member for City why wasn't a request for zoning made for a three storey building? And my understanding is there isn't a zoning specifically for that height, so I don't know if that's accurate or not, but I did want to just mention that the other members that other'",
        "'speaker_3': 'people that that mentioned all this about retail, there is a lot of retail going in and I don't want us to overbuild Stapleton because we also have a lot of vacancy still in Northfield. We have open spaces in Quebec Square and I'm very we've got some open spaces in the Stanley and I'm very concerned that we're overbuilding'",
        "'speaker_3': 'retail and then we can't keep those those businesses alive. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Miss KENYON. All right. John Swire.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Swire Schreyer, Scheuer. Thank you. All right. Thank you. My name is John Scheuer. I live at 8502 East 29th Place. Thank you for giving.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Us the opportunity to speak council.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We appreciate it. You know, these days you hear a lot about the lack of citizen involvement in our democratic process. Well, I think everybody here tonight has put that their arrest. To me, this rezoning issue boils down to two main points safety and quality of life.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'If you allow a five storey monstrosity to be built on this site, it will destroy.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The fabric of our neighborhood and jeopardize the safety not only, not only of our current residents, but also the residents that we live in that building. Just like.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You, we have seen no site.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Plan from the applicants. This leaves them wide open.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'To do as they please. The cutouts to enter and exit.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This site will almost.'",

        "'speaker_2': '29th place is a three lane street. Look at the negative impact the Overture.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Building has had only a few blocks away.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I walk there almost daily. The increased traffic and.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Increased parking have made it much less safe.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'MLK intersection. They were gracious enough to tell me that through June 1st there were 17 accidents in 17 months at that intersection.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I also think that adding any commercial operations at this site is inappropriate because of the added traffic.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'On Willow and 29th place. The town center is only 6/10.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Of a mile away from this site. East Bridge is 1.2 miles away and the new TOD is 7/10 of a mile away and punchbowl social's diagonal to it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The traffic is only going to get worse when the 399 unit main apartments open soon as also will Punchbowl Social. Add in the million square.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Retail from Todd. Can you imagine what the traffic's going to be like at that intersection then?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I've heard proponents of this zoning request. Well, it's a tradition in Denver to build apartment buildings at major arterial intersections and across from parks.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That may be the case, but it's time to start a new tradition by listening to the residents still have to live with whatever you allow to be built on that site. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Schreyer. All right. This concludes our speakers. Those who are sitting in the front row can return back to your seat. Mr. Robinson, won't you come up to the front here and questions by members of council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Herndon.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thing. Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You can turn on your mike there, Counselor.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Scott, can you come up? And I'm having John Bear come up to. I don't want to say I don't like the word ringleader, but John and I have had numerous conversations and I just want to talk to him just to ask a couple of questions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Scott, first with you. The neighborhood organization. And John, this is going to be a question for you as well. I love to get your thoughts. So Sun Stable in the United Neighbors is a registered R.A. took a position of neutral and actually you know what I'm going to ask John for this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'John, if you would come up. Ken, did you have any conversations with Sun and why they took a position of neutral on this? Because you did go to them and ask them to weigh in on this.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's my understanding when when I met with him in some conversations afterwards is that they heard the concern of the neighbors, and especially as they wrote to the letter today, the concern about the curb cuts not being allowed on Martin Luther King or Central Park, that they really understood the concerns of the neighbors.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But it was my understanding that their biggest fear was that the current zoning would allow commercial and they didn't think the commercial was appropriate. Well, of course we agree we agree that commercial is not appropriate on that site.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And once again, I don't want to speak for Sony Shame. They're not here to speak for themselves, but that's what I heard.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. And so with now, just for you, the industrial uses that could currently happen on the property. So the zoning right now allowing the industrial uses, you are you are comfortable with this rezoning potentially being denied. But the possibility of the industrial uses or other uses currently moving forward or what would be your approach if this rezoning'",
        "'speaker_1': 'is denied, what would be the next steps?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, we definitely don't agree that it should be developed under the current zoning. Basically commercial and we have suggested numerous times to include in letters to council that we feel the appropriate zoning and we wish for city since they own it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They're the only ones that can request a rezoning that they go with the mrh3 row home, three storey maximum, which would completely be compatible with the neighborhood, completely compatible with the neighborhood. So but, you know, some can't do it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We can't do it. It's up to four city and and God forbid, we would hope that they would never consider putting the commercial on that site that is permissible under this current zoning which is I don't know how old maybe Scott can administer the current zoning.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Jonathan. Appreciate that. Scott, could you come up a couple of things I wanted to I heard in the comments, one, I believe it was Kim made the comment about the covenant that the applicant has said they would put on three stories to the south and the east was not solid.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So could you just speak to that? If this does pass, would that covenant be mandated?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Um. Not necessarily. I don't. I mean, I don't know the state of the Covenant, whether it's has been signed in agreeing to that. But they have can perhaps you can ask the African. That's not a factor in our analysis of the rezoning and it's not something that we know.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'No. And that I understand. And actually. How about Bruce? Bruce, you can come on Dec since you said that. I'll answer that and that's fine. I understand you're basing it off of just your criteria. Maybe this might be a legal question.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We'll get to somebody else, but we'll go to your. Well, let's go to planning board because it was a54 vote. And I think that that's something that should be asked. Question to one. And I don't expect you to speak for the voting members who voted in against and I actually did and I'll talk about that in my'",
        "'speaker_1': 'comments. But could you give me those sentiments during the planning board, what they what they were saying?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah, I think there were only two areas of concern and one was the height. And there was some discussion of some way of getting this step down or step back that's been proposed. So it'd be three stories against the existing neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then the other was the the use and the consistency with the adopted plans that the potential for commercial uses may not be consistent with the adopted plans as opposed to a purely residential use.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so in the minutes that I read for the planning board, there was a motion to do a step down. And could you talk to that briefly?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah, it was proposed. There was, I think, two areas again, two areas of concern with the proposed condition. One was whether it was appropriate and then the other was enforcement, how planning board could enforce this proposed condition. So it ended up not passing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so the the vote was based on the application.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I want to make sure my colleagues hear the the the amendment that was voted down was to do a step back of four stories on the south and to the east. Correct. Because that's how when I read the minutes, I want to make sure I am and Bruce, correct me if that's wrong, that that was voted'",
        "'speaker_1': 'down, but I believe that was the motion that was made, correct?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah, that sounds right. I don't have it in front of you. But yes, it was something to that effect.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so. Okay, thank you, Scott, if you want to come up. Is that is that correct? In the minutes that the planning board did a motion to do for story setback to the south and to the east?'",
        "'speaker_15': 'Yes, I think that's correct.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. And then your proposal, you are suggesting even going lower. Three stories to the south. Three stories to the east, correct? Correct. Now. I'm assuming obviously you were you're the applicant for fourth city. I would I would I hate to use the word hope, but if you're going to stand in front of this body and say we're'",
        "'speaker_1': 'going to do a three story for the south to the east, whether for city chooses to sell a develop the land themselves or sell it to another developer. Will that three story stay in effect?'",
        "'speaker_15': 'Yes, it will.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Talked about that. Talked on some board. Thank you, Mr. President. Those are my questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you, Councilman Herndon. Um, screen just were in Black Oak. Councilman.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'You are Bruce recently. As, of course. I've heard the proposal go to three stories and did the number of units change? I've heard different stories about how many units? 152 to 52. What is the what is the configuration of the number of units if is reduced to three stories on this portion of the lot?'",
        "'speaker_15': 'So I should pardon me, I should reiterate that there there isn't a project, there is not a design, there is an attempt to get better zoning on the property than exist today. There's an estimate that under the current zoning, about 135 to 150 units could be built depending on unit mix in parking in the.'",
        "'speaker_15': 'The estimate on the rezoning would be about 200 to 225.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So so there's no effect that you can tell from reducing the heist to three stories on a portion of their life.'",
        "'speaker_15': 'I would guess there would be less units in total. Yes, but that calculation hasn't been done.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. Did you consider condominiums on the side instead of apartments?'",
        "'speaker_15': 'So the that will be a market driven decision at the time that for city is ready to proceed, it could as easily go for sale as for rent, given that there is some improvement in the construction defense pardon me defects work.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'At the present time is considered just market rate apartments.'",
        "'speaker_15': 'There isn't a decision at this time.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay, maybe the applicant should get out. Maybe that would be helpful. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman, do you continue to ask the applicant different phenomena?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Yep. Can you ask the question about the future where there's condominiums and market rate apartments? What was the plan for the development? It's either or. And, you know, until we actually decide that that property is ready to be developed.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We won't be able to gauge excuse me whether we rent or for sale. I can't tell you if it's for if it's a rental product for city will execute it. If it's a condo for sale product, we won't execute it.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We'd bring in a third party developer to do it. Okay. In the discussions with the neighborhoods, did you consider a development agreement about this property with the neighborhoods to reach agreements? And we've seen those to be very successful in other areas of the city, and it really brings in the community to have a voice in what you're'",
        "'speaker_10': 'doing. Well, I think we feel like we we did hear the community's voice. We we had meetings with them. We had several, you know, emails, phone calls, discussions, presentations, the state of the United Neighbors and so on. If we were able to reach an agreement, we would have no objection to putting that in the form of a'",
        "'speaker_10': 'development agreement. Right. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Yeah, thank you. Councilman, Councilman Espinosa, first questions for anybody. Did anyone do an analysis of the sort of amassing the bulk the bulk analysis of both the current zoning and the proposed zoning? Okay. So that's where I'm going to be struggling with this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I have some questions along those lines. First for you, Scott. The step to the mention of the step back. Obviously CPD is of the mindset that the the rx5a is wholly appropriate. So do you would CPD oppose step back's being you know what's the opinion is that CPD is the appropriate is is a step back appropriate'",
        "'speaker_0': 'or not appropriate in this situation.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I don't believe we have any objection to the estate tax, as you said. We've found that the m r x5 a is appropriate and meets the criteria. Okay. I just want to confirm if the applicant wants to voluntarily reduce that or stop that that that's fine.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. I just want to confirm that the army throw with waivers is not a protected zone district. Correct.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Even though the waivers in for a city sort of conform the development essentially to the pattern that you now see today, which would be more consistent with a rowhouse in district or a townhouse, some district, you know, or possibly protected zone districts.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It is not a protected zone district.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. To a question for the. You know, I do want to just confirm, because I'm a little bit confused by the graphics in the zoning code and you don't have to go to the page, but it is page nine seven, dash 9.7, there's 22.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It shows a general building form. I can't see anything about a lot coverage restriction, but the graphic shows a mass, you know, that conforms to the site, you know, the setback and then it shows a surface lot. Is there anything that compels them to to to have a surface lot or could it be under I mean, below'",
        "'speaker_0': 'parking underneath the structure and and go full setback on each side?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah. I'm not 100% familiar with all the requirements, but my understanding is that they could do structured parking. There's nothing that compels them to do a surface parking lot. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And then the question for the applicant. Or Bruce. It doesn't it doesn't matter. Somebody from the team. How deep is the STEP Act that you're proposing and at what heights do those setbacks occur?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I can't. Well, the way that I envision it working. Excuse me. So you the street there be the appearance of a full three storey unit. And I don't know how far that sits back before the unit above it starts.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I mean, it's a design question, but it's not it's not two or three or four feet, something inconsequential. It's, you know, it's as if a unit could have been built above that unit and isn't. So whatever the depth of that unit would be, would be that setback.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's too bad you don't have like a sort of definition. That sort of would have been the point where you had negotiated something in a term that you could have presented in a covenant. Because there is a if this were if there's if this had been a relationship of a protected zone district consistent with the current development'",
        "'speaker_0': 'pattern over there and this rezoning, there are this zone, this section, the zoning code does have step means set up or story setback requirements in the max five of five, 15, 15, 20 and 25 feet in. And I would be that's why I'm asking about the massing study as I would be even curious if that was sufficient'",
        "'speaker_0': 'or not. And so since Charles, we're talking about a stories, I have no idea what sort of bulk restrictions you're talking about. But what I do know is that this and it's as evidenced by what Bruce O'Donnell just well, actually, that's the first question are you know, Bruce mentioned that it was using the zone district today.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's between 135 and 150 units that you could capture. And then with the rezoning, it would increase to 202 to 25. Are those numbers that are consistent with your understanding of this redevelopment potential?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To the the old zoning code with the 3 to 1 four are restricted in in your own presentation to 130 some odd thousand square feet. With this new zoning code, you increase the development potential by two full floors over the 3 to 1.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So it's essentially a 5 to 1 favor, which is how you get that increased increased development potential. That old zoning code, which all of Stapleton was developed, also had an open area, open space requirement and the same exact parking requirement.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So this is these are two very, very different things. When we're comparing the old zoning code and there's this discussion about, well, it's not the right, it's that this is somehow better than that. This is more comment. So I guess I am trying to figure out if there's a question f r councilwoman, let's get to some other'",
        "'speaker_0': 'folks and then we'll come back to you to develop that question. Well, this is one quick question, was, have you guys discussed any use.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Restrictions as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In the covenant or is it simply a setback, require, you know, step back possibility?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Well, if we were to sell this to a third party, we'd have retail use restrictions. All the, you know, typical retail uses that people want to see in our neighborhoods. We did it on every deal that we that we do.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Other than that, there wouldn't be any.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'When you were presented with a little bit of opposition from the neighborhood and you clearly heard it because you're responding to it, did you go back to CPD and asked them if there was any way to sort of codify a way to address these concerns?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And what was their response, if you did.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'To address which specific concern do you mean.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Height, setback.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Parking, any of the sort of metrics of zoning?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Well, I mean, I the concern is that they don't want five stories. There's really no way to address that other than, you know, what we what we propose is kind of a, you know, meet your halfway proposal. Okay?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The parking the parking will be fully screened from view of all the neighborhoods. The only thing you'll see is the Access Points Center. It'll be a parking structure. The units of either be built on top of it or around it.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And it's Europe product or podium product. You're probably familiar with those terms.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Great. Well, thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Councilman Espinosa, Councilwoman Black.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I first of all, I first of all, want to thank all of you neighbors for being here so late and being so dedicated. So thank you for being here. Most of my questions have been answered.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I just have a couple more for the applicant. So if if you develop the property, you're committed to housing, but if you sell it, what else could be developed under the Marques five?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Under American life. Yeah. My understanding is it's limited to residential with some ground floor potential for ground floor retail.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And if if someone wanted to build townhomes there, could they under that zoned district?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I believe they can. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Excuse me. Thank you, Mr. President. Bruce O'Donnell. Under the current zoning. I'm trying to make the numbers work. The number of units that we were talking about under the existing zoning versus the number of units under the requested zone.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'You get more units under the new zone. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_15': 'Yes, that's potentially.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Potentially. Well, I'm confused then, because you've been saying or you were telling us in the handout that the current zoning allows up 6 to 8 storeys. So can you make the numbers for me?'",
        "'speaker_15': 'So the the current zoning has in air of 1 to 1.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_15': 'Which means the site's approximately 130,000 square feet. That size building could be built there.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'They just have a smaller footprint right in.'",
        "'speaker_15': 'Okay. And so you that that practically you, it'd be hard to go beyond higher than eight storeys because the floors would be too small.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Exactly. Okay. Jim Christman, can you describe the parking program? You'd start to get into it with a wrap. Can you tell us how you expect people to access it? Will it be off of Willow and 29th place potentially, or would it be off of the major streets?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'How do you envision that?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I mean, we would support trying to secure access off the major rights of way. But as you know, that's not always easy. So it really be a function of how public works looked at it. Yeah, I think there'll be a.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'My personal view, there might be opportunities for like a write in, write out off of MLK, sort of certainly no full movement because of the nature of that intersection. Correct? Okay.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Is Noel Lawrence still here?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Maybe Mr. Schweiker, maybe you could answer was somebody Noel Lawrence said that the son of the R.A. Stapleton United Neighbors had expressed concern and had had a letter. Had sent a letter. I don't have that. Is anybody did anybody up here receive it?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I certainly didn't receive it. I would like to see it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It was it was emailed to us, the neighbors, at about 1230 this afternoon, so that maybe that's why you don't have it in your hands. I've got a copy. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilman Flynn, I. I got the letter.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. Is it if it's digital, could you email? Yes. Thank you. That's almost prison.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you. Councilman Flynn, Councilwoman Cannick.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Question for Jim first, please. I understand you're not sure whether it would be apartments or townhomes or I'm sorry, apartments or condos. But let's just go with the apartment scenario for a second. Can you refresh me what.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The overall vision.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Or estimated number of apartments was going to be for the Stapleton neighborhood in the original documents that you all.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Oh, all of Stapleton. Right. The Green Book. Com for about 3000 multifamily rental units.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And where are you at right now with that? So where are we where are you at with that overall number right now?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Or about a thousand with another. 500, probably breaking ground within a year.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And have you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Are you aware of requests or concerns from, you know, community advisory boards or other groups within Stapleton who've been asking for more apartments and more apartment development? Is that something that's gotten.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Yes, there's there's a group that's been asking for more apartments for quite a while. Part of the Citizens Advisory Board.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then I had a question for I don't know if Jane Warner or Laura Tweedle are here.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah. If you want to come forward, either one of you. I, too, want to thank the folks who came out tonight. You clearly care a lot about your neighborhood. Both Jane and Laura mentioned something that I want to just follow up on.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You both mentioned that you had been told or you were informed that this would be townhomes or or single family homes. I'm wondering about the sign. I just I checked the Google map just to make sure. But the sign that says mixed and high density mixed use site and had you, you know in your ten years have'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you seen that sign?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And more recently there's been a sign posted. But no, there wasn't until six months ago. There hasn't been anything on that lot talked about done with. It's just been a vacant lot for nine and a half years. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Can I just ask follow up with Jim or or Bruce.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Whether or not when when the sign was posted about the zoning of this site. I'm just because it's very common. You know, I'm in the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Yeah. Yeah. We went through our records and, you know, we keep records of every sign goes and we show the sign being installed ten years ago.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I don't have the right answer now.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Or like here, believe it.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Or not, through the.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This perspective.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Okay. Sounds good. And then I guess my last question is just for the the CPD staffer.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I know you got asked some questions about this earlier, but I just wanted to put a finer point on it. We have in numerous neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Put overlays.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'On sites to do transitions like this. I think about the Sloan's Lake area in particular. Did you guys have a specific conversation about that or was it that the the interest in that came up so late in the process that it was too late?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah, that did not come up until after the planning board hearing. So, you know, we had evaluated the proposal was are either following the planning board hearing I was informed by the applicant that they were then proposing the covenant put in the city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So if if it had been raised earlier.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Is there some reason why it wouldn't have been.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Considered in the same way at Sloan's?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There wasn't it wouldn't have been considered, you know, would have gone through the same evaluation process that any of these proposals would go through.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. No more questions, Mr. President. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilwoman, can each councilman you back up?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Scott, I forgot to ask one question. You know, when the rezoning consideration was, was, was taken and this slide was held, you sort of gave started going to be a joint available or something else. This property.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'When the rezoning of the latest rezoning code went through in 2010, you said that this property wasn't considered for the rezoning because it was going to be used for an jointly with another property or something like that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It was. We have what are called plan or plan building groups. So I was I had a tool used in the old code to look at larger sites that had multiple buildings on them, and they had generally had special rules applied to them and, you know, agreement among the property owners that those would be kept, too.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So in the 2010 rezoning process, we didn't want to try to crack all of those open and and apply the appropriate zoning. So we among other things, we left all of the planned building groups alone in 2010. And the way this was mapped in our system, it looked like it was part of a planned building group.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Again, as we were going through this rezoning process, we looked at the actual plan building group document, and it specifically excludes this block. So it includes the properties around it, but not this block. So it's not actually part of the planned building group.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But that's why it was not resigned in 2010.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'All residential zoning around it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Now it included the same CMU 20 zoning that's along MLK to the West. Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And it has not been developed. Has it been developed yet?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Most of the other blocks to the west have been developed. With what? Immediately to the west is new development that is similar to the other residential areas. It's townhomes and duplexes and single family. And then further to the west is some commercial and some I think there's a senior housing development there and a fire station.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'West of three stories.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Uh, I don't know. Off the top of my head at all. Yeah, that's somewhere in there.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you very much. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right, Councilman Clark.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Scott, if you could. I'm going to buzz through some of these. And if some of those if you want to pass off the torch, let me know. But I'm just trying to understand the changes between what is the existing zoning that could be built on right now with no city council or neighborhood involvement'",
        "'speaker_6': 'and the proposed zoning. So current zoning 135, 150 units, new 200 to 225.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's what I've been told. We haven't done that calculation. So that comes from the applicant.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Can you just confirm that one?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Why don't I try to put some color on that? So a typical mix of one bedroom and two bedrooms. The average unit size, an apartment project will be about a thousand feet. So there's 135,000 feet of FDR that can be constructed under existing zoning.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And therefore, that's where you get about 135 units. The five story building is going to either be a rap product or a podium product. And those those densities generally range from about 7 to 8 units per acre. So it's 210 to 240.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But now then so estimate take maybe ten or 15% off of that for the the setback that we're that we're offering up. And that gets us to that, you know, 210 range.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then height, I think, versus a maximum realistic height on the current zoning is eight.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Well, there's no there there is no there's no legal maximum height. There's a practical maximum height. You can build 135,000 feet. So for an office building, for example, they could have a 25,000 square foot, you know, floor plate.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That's a five and a half. Five six storey office building, a condo building that may have a 10,000 square foot footprint, maybe only four units per floor that can go up to 13 stories.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'On the current zoning. It sounds like townhomes and single family are allowed because there's adjacent with the same. So it could be developed as townhomes and single family on the current zoning. Yes. And on the new zoning. Townhomes and single family both also a level.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Yes. Development.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then one more time, we started talking about uses new zoning, limits it to residential. Maybe it could be fully residential or it could be residential with ground floor retail, but that's pretty much the use table on the current zoning.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You'd mentioned gas stations or recycling collection. Walk me through some of the current allowable uses.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Well, I mean, it's called commercial mixed use 20. So it's predominantly was intended to be commercial type of uses. And then a lot of those are, you know, would be acceptable on that site. But I just picked the three or four that, you know, I think people would have objections to.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And there's some others as well. I can't remember off the top of my head, unfortunately.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you. Councilman Clarke, Councilman Espinosa, Skip, you can get to these other folks. Uh, Councilwoman Sussman.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you. Councilman Clark, you were going where I wanted to go to, but let me just sort of help make it even clearer. Scott, I'd like to ask you a question. So this old zoning, CMU 20, is used by.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Right. If they sold this property to somebody who wanted to keep that zoning, they would not have to do anything like come to the city or come to the council, or they would just be able to build this 135,000 square foot building.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Of industrial use, right?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah. They would just have to go through our standard site development plan and building permitting process, which is all administrative. So they would not have to come back before you were planning board or anyone. Right.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I wasn't sure that the members of the community realized that that it would be used by. Right. Thank you very much. Thank you. Also.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilwoman Sussman. Thank you, Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I want to ask Bruce if you can come forward. So I'm trying to focus more on the macro level and the micro level in terms of the. Eight acres that were originally earmarked for Stapleton for affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Have all those sites been developed so far? And where does this fall into that scheme of the eight acres that were set aside for affordability? Can someone answer that question?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Do you?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'If it's not you, Bruce. Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Of course.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And no, I don't believe the edict. I don't know what portion of the eight acres has been developed. I know that between what's been developed and what will be with that sites aside for that for those developments to.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Have all those sites on top of it to. Different organizations that are going to build the affordable housing on the sites that they have not yet actually been built. And, Tom, if you're the point guy, will you please come to the microphone?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'm just trying to understand where this fits into the overall scheme of the lots that were set aside for affordability.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Tom Gleason For a city 7351, East 29th Avenue, the councilwoman is referring to the agreement to set aside to sell it, provide at no cost, eight acres of land to nonprofits for affordable rental. And to date, we are just under eight acres with our most recent development, which is proposed for senior affordable.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So but that really is just for the affordable rental. We have donated all of the land at Stapleton for both affordable rental and affordable for sale. So that is we've done much more than that eight acres.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. And so it sounds like we're on mark with the rental. Where are we on the Affordable for sale? That was part of the original agreement.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We are in terms of the affordable rental, we are running ahead of what was projected to be a 20%.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Commitment on.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The Affordable for sale. That's been 10%.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we're running it probably at about.'",
        "'speaker_5': '5.8% in terms of that. But the agreement, the Stapleton Affordable Housing Plan, says at the end of the development, we have to be a 10%.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And how many more developable acres are still available that have not been obligated or are still available for development?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, for the Affordable for Sale, we have identified all the parcels and projected the number of affordable units that will be created on that so that we meet our formal goal. For instance, we are projected to build out at Stapleton to be in the range of.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'About 1880 900 homes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so we have set aside.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Land for 891.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Affordable for sale on the affordable rental. We projected some.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Somewhere in the range of probably about 800. And and.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We're we're tracking that.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Pretty closely as well.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And we donate land for both affordable rental and affordable for sale, even though that wasn't part of the Stapleton affordable housing plan.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So, Tom, was this anticipated to be one of those sites?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'No, this this site would be commercial. I mean, this would be market rate. It would not be affordable.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. That's all the questions I have. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. Councilman Ortega. Councilman Cashman.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Scott. So would you. How close is the next five story building? Do this. This site, would you guess? It's found closer to Quebec. There's some new apartment buildings that have gone up. I think off the top of my head, I don't know every quite a while.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I have quite a ways from this site. But yeah, it's it's a little ways to the west. Okay. And the finance and developer to step up for a second. So you said you've had discussions with people in the community wanting more apartments available, is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'There's a contingency, probably the wrong word. But there are there there are a group of folks that have been involved in our Citizens Advisory Board who for some time have asked us why we haven't built more multi-family rental than we have.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And have they expressed or have you discussed with them their preferences for what style that might be? Be a five story building, be a townhomes, be it whatever.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'You know, they don't really express the building form. They express more the income levels that the property could serve and they'd like to see a diversity. Okay. Things for say on for rent.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'All right. Appreciate that. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Castro. Councilman Espinosa. My question for the city attorney when they were. Well, I assumed that this project, because it's still part of the master plan, doesn't even though. This is entirely to new floors of additional development.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right. Or actually more than that. Not eligible for the linkage fee. Is that correct? Dave, Missouri Assistant City Attorney. Councilman Espinoza, could I have you repeat the question? I just didn't quite hear you. This project wouldn't be eligible for a linkage fee because of the it.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Falls under.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The current affordable housing plan for Stapleton. Is that correct? Yeah, that's correct. Okay. Tom, is there any sort of willingness for Stapleton and for City to sort of voluntarily commit a portion of these additional units to affordable considering that you guys took down the land some time ago and would be getting essentially additional development rights?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We haven't had that discussion, as I mentioned earlier. We had the signed a an affordable housing plan with the city back in 2001. And that's what we're implementing at this time now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, great. Thank you. Thank you. Councilman, as one other thing, councilman herndon, I.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Think it was Perez. I just want to my colleagues and now I emailed them the letter from son this neighborhood neighborhood organization reasonable organization. And Scott, this might have been asked when I had ran to run out quick there was an email that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I got wasn't mentioned today, but the person talked about the inability to park all the cars in this unit. And I've and I've heard parking within this conversation. Can you briefly just talk about any development that occurs has to have parking requirements.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So could you just please talk about that? And I know we're we're we're generalities but just people to understand what the city does when it comes to that. Please.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah. That's all handled in the site review site development planning process. And our zoning code set standards for how many parking spaces must be required. And it depends on the type of use and the amount and the specific zoning.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So, you know, whatever the zoning, whether it's the old zoning or the new zoning, proposed zoning. The zoning code would dictate how many parking spaces must be provided and that would all be required at the time of said development.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. I just want to make sure that that was. No, thank you. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilman Hearn. I got a couple of questions myself, and I'm going to ask our two city attorneys to volley this question. And we'll start with you, Nate. Nate, what is our criteria for for doing zoning?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So what do we do? How do we make zoning decisions? A city council. So the city council bases their rezoning decision on the rezoning criteria, which was outlined in the staff report. And so we look at consistency with adopted plans.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Health, safety and welfare. I'm having a little bit of remembering here. You know. That's okay, Scott. Can you put that? Put that. Yeah. Thank you. Slide up, because I put our city attorney on the spot there. Okay. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So, yeah, there there are the five criteria there. As I mentioned, consistency with city adopted plans, uniformity of district regulations, public health, safety and welfare. Justifying circumstances is always a big one and of course, consistency with neighborhood context, zone, district purpose and intent.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Great. Thank you, Nate. David Braswell, our assistant city attorney. Can you help us help me with this question? I think we get a lot of neighbors in here with with the concerns around, you know, what's being built and things like that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What is your legal advice to us when making a decision for rezonings?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'My legal advice to you for a rezoning. Okay. Well, some of it's just been covered again by Mr. Lucero, which is you have to apply the evidence to the criteria and make the decision. You do have significant latitude in terms of applying the criteria.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We've got active litigation recently where decisions of this council have been upheld, where reasonable people can disagree, but courts tend to defer to whatever decision you ultimately come up with. So you've got you've got a lot of discretion, but you do need to link your findings to the criteria.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that's what we always advise.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. And then they want one more question back to you. I think Councilwoman Kennedy brought this point up. I think it's a it's an interesting one. And I'm going to ask the applicant to to answer this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We do overlays all the time. Matter of fact, there's a lot of overlays, conservation overlays that we have in in Curtis Park. And matter of fact, I have a legislative rezoning coming up. That's an overlay actually down zoning, a part of this community where all the neighbors really wanted to down zoning, which I haven't seen in my'",
        "'speaker_0': 'seven years on council, but. Have we ever amended a rezoning for a conservation overlay on the floor? And do we have latitude to do that? I've not seen that. Typically what happens with conservation overlays is if they are brought before a council, then everything that is within that overlay district is subject to the conservation overlay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So long as they are zoned into the new Denver zoning code, then they're able to take advantage of the conservation overlay. So that's that's how those typically work. Yeah. Could we amend it? And, you know, the, the the applicant has already said that there's going to be some restrictions on the, the three, you know, on I forget'",
        "'speaker_0': 'what side it was, but three stores on the South Side or whatever. Could we restrict that in the zoning as an amend that in the zoning tonight on this bill? I think what you're asking me is whether or not you could plate place a condition on an approval and.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The answer to that is. What's before council tonight is the ordinance that's been filed, which simply speaks to the May five A and there's nothing either in the zoning code or anything more memorialized in the application which would mandate such a condition at this time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So it would have to be something that would be agreed upon by the applicant. Which is the way our Denver zoning code works. So we could not amend on the floor. So what you're saying? No. Okay. Let me just ask the applicant real quick what either one of you are.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Did you sign any agreement with the neighborhood on this three story? Is it written or is it just a kind of a.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It's not formally read. And I mean, what I would envision and I'm not an attorney, but I would envision that we would agree to record a restrictive covenant that outlined the terms of that. And that would be a condition of your approval if you were if you were to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So right now, it's just a commitment excuse me? It's a verbal commitment to the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It's a verbal commitment. It's an informal written commitment. Okay. We put in writing, but not in a legal format.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Great. And then my last question. Excuse me, sir. I forgot your name. You're leading? Yeah. Yeah. Leading the neighborhood. Let me ask you a question. A lot of points were made tonight that I think were very important. And I'm I'm curious, the number of people who you've been working with and you yourself.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Have you been a part of this citizens advisory group board that is with force?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I did go speak before the Citizen Advisory Board.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Prior to this development. Prior to this development, have you been a part of the Citizens Library Board? Okay. Have you been a part of the Stapleton United Neighbors prior to this?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think I've attended one or two meetings, but okay. I guess not actively involved.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. Just want to know that. All right, Councilman. Councilman Cashman.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Just to be clear. I thought you said the planning board five four split was partially over confusion as to neighborhood plan consistency. It was, in my remembering correctly. No, there was. I believe you are remembering correctly.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It was one of the issues that came up, and I believe one of the concerns that some of the members had that voted against it was that it may not be consistent with the city's adopted plans, particularly relating to commercial use versus residential use.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. Thank you, Scott. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilman Cashman. Councilman New.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Yeah. You're up on the revised on the proposal of a three and five story compromise that you're proposing. What percent of the project would be? Three stories. In terms of a unit count, just the total development for part is going to be, first of all, retail, you know, three parts going to be three parts going to be'",
        "'speaker_10': 'five stories. Well, bringing it down to three, what portion of the lot would be three stores for the project? Maybe it'd be two of the four phases of the building. It would be three stories. Mr. McDermott 50% would be three stories and 50% five stories.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Yes. So I'm pretty pretty much really close, maybe, you know, 50 to 48 or something like that at the corners. Great. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. Councilman. Councilwoman Gilmore.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sorry. I'm sorry I didn't catch you before you went back and sat down. I have one additional question. So with with that estimate, two councilman knew then the three story outward facing would would it be along Willow and East 29th place?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Have there been conversations with public works about MLK Jr Boulevard and kind of that intersection right there at MLK and Willow Street? Are there plans for any improvements at that intersection? Based upon the possible density on this lot.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We haven't had those discussions. It's difficult to have that discussion in the abstract. They like to see a specific proposal in front of them. Okay. But we haven't had that discussion.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The size some community members had commented that Willow Street seems narrow. And I can understand that if they're school busses going up and down Willow Street. But I have our I'm assuming that both Willow and East 29th Place are regular sized Denver residential streets.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Correct. With on street parking.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. All right. Great. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, thank you, Councilwoman Gilmore. Councilman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'One last one. Last one. So, Jim, I think you were the one who mentioned that you all would be willing to consider a covenant on the land. Is that did I hear that correctly?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'You did.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. And so what that does is it it ensures that regardless of who owns the property, that covenant stays with the property.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. And. But typically those issues are done on the front end before the applications come before us. And I guess I'm just wondering, is this is this something that for a city is committing to do regardless of this, the action taken by city council tonight.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'No. I think the commitment is only if the. If the actions approved at this. If the rezoning is approved, then we make the commitment to. To record the covenant. Otherwise we'll probably property would be developed in accordance with the existing zoning.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Do you do you have interested developers right now that are looking at the site based on the new zoning?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Now, we are not marketing the site right now.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. You're waiting to get the zoning done first. So I would just propose that. Councilman Herndon, I know this is your district, but I think the covenant would be an important safeguard, if you will, for lack of a better word, that the community has has raised, as is concerns that if maybe we postpone this for a short'",
        "'speaker_7': 'period of time to allow that to get done and to bring it back so that it's part of the application and it's contingent upon the zoning, you know, taking place, that that will go a long way, I believe, in building that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I don't know. Goodwill with the community. And I just wanted to ask if that's something that you all are open to. And Councilman Herndon, same with you.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We'd be open to that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. When her.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If you know, I've been a part of this community since 2008 and I've worked with Forest City, obviously since I've been a council person in 2011. I believe that if they say that they're going to do that, it's not necessary to put a covenant on it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And by the all my interactions and their interactions with the community, I personally do not think it's necessary if they this isn't a developer that's coming into town and then is leaving. We have several different acres of land that still needs to be developed for city is not going anywhere.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And had they choose to do something like that, rest assured there would be some serious repercussions from a city perspective, I would imagine. So I don't I personally do not think it's necessary if Jim and company have said they're going to do it, I believe it will be done.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I will certainly defer to if the majority of the council feels the need to do so then. Soviet.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Well, I just want to say that I know ferocity has not developed every single parcel, a number of the parcels have been developed by other other developers who for city has sold some of that land to. And I know with some of the other applications that we've had come before us, the Covenant becomes a really critical piece'",
        "'speaker_7': 'of that assurance that the community is going to have those safeguards in place. I'm not saying I don't trust for city, but if the land is sold to somebody else and the covenant isn't filed, then that next party is not going to be obligated to adhere to what we're discussing here tonight as an assumed agreement.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So, Councilwoman, I'm going to take this from questions and start the comment period so that you and Council Councilman Herndon can can debate this issue. The right. Okay. This hearing is closed. Council Bill 565 is now closed. Comments by members of council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman herndon. And then we'll go to councilwoman ortega.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mr. President, one, I really appreciate you all coming out and have a conversation about this. You know, I, I and I sincerely appreciate the civility because we have seen several contentious rezonings and the respect towards both parties just dissipates immediately.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I really appreciate these conversations being cordial. And even though you share the passion of what's happening in your community, we still treat each other with respect. And I and I cannot say that enough because we're losing that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So thank you for that. And I appreciate the council president asking the question about what do we as a council base our decisions off of? And you see you see the five criteria in front of us because that's what we should be focusing on.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I know we always go into particular plans. And when you don't have a plan and this council has shared their frustrations with that, we we have a tendency to go to the worst of what can possibly happen.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And it is our city policy to not base it off site specific plans. And people have expressed their frustration. But that is our policy. But I appreciate the dialog that we have had. I'm going to focus on the health, safety and welfare initially because as I wrote down the notes of what everybody was saying.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Let me first talk about traffic. So no matter what happens at this site, traffic is going to increase. There is there's no getting around that. Central Park Boulevard and MLK are busy streets and they should be. That was the design of Stapleton so that we have traffic that's going through the community goes on our major arterials so'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that it doesn't go through the side streets. And we're not naive to say that it doesn't happen. People choose to do that. And I agree that MLK, CPB, our busy streets. But when I wrote down someone said Hazardous.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I respectfully disagree that that is hazardous, inappropriate and I'm sorry that wasn't about the streets. So I believe traffic will increase. But I also believe we have a great traffic and engineering department that for those of you that have been in Stapleton for a while, has made several adjustments along MLK, Central Park Boulevard.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So whatever development occurs because development will occur, whether it happens with our current zoning or the proposed zoning, traffic and engineering, I absolutely believe will address it and has done so in in several different ways. We talked about I asked the question about the parking because the question was, well, is the parking going to be enough?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is going to bleed it bleed over into the side streets. We have rules and regulations in place that should this potential zone go through, the parking and the parking requirements will be adhered to. Then came up the comment of safety and I, I you lost me on safety.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I don't understand how simply adding apartments makes the community less safe. I rented until I was in my mid-twenties and I stayed in apartments and I don't believe that I cared less about a community simply because I rented versus owning.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Um, so I, I disagree with that safety perspective that adding additional apartments makes the community less safe. That is, that's just my opinion. As I was, I was writing that down. I tilt to my head and said, I, I hear you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm not sure if that's something I agree with you. And there was a comment to people made about transitional tenants. And yes, renters do leave quicker than homeowners, but that doesn't mean they care less about their community. So I wanted to say that as we have these conversations, you know, I reached out to the planning board because'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I didn't watch the minutes. John said, watch the planning because I read the minutes and there were four members that were anti that. And so I called them and just as got talked about, there were concerns about consistency with adopted plans.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I disagree. I do think the adopted plans are consistent, but there was a consensus about common questions about the the height, which is why the planning board did a recommendation to say we're going to move that. You can only do four stories to the south and to the end to the east.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And even though that was voted down, the applicant came back and said, okay, we hear the concerns and we're going to go lower than that and go three stories. And I spoke to a couple of planning board members and said, were you aware that they that the applicant went from four stories to three stories and while it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'doesn't change their vote. A couple of those planning board members said, well, that seems like a good compromise. And I actually think in this conversation we've come to a point where the applicant has heard the community and said, okay, we're going to try to accommodate you as best that we can.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And while we recognize that there are going to be some people of the position that no matter what happens, this is inappropriate, I think that that effort from the applicant is worth noting. I also want to talk to about.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'What's just to the west of this? Because we we focus solely at Central Park and Martin Luther King Day. So for those of you that are familiar with this, I am as well. You've got Central Park Boulevard runs north.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'South. If you head west, you've got Uinta is the next street that heads over and you go over one more block and you got holster my dry cleaners right there. Everyone knows I'm talking about the dry cleaners. So I go to that dry cleaning.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'When I come out of the dry cleaner and I look I look east, we have the overture. The overture is the senior housing. The overture is four stories. It's four stories. And so for the people on 29th place, right behind the overseer, they look out of their house and they're staring at a four story building.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So to have a four storey building two blocks away from what could potentially be three stories that said back to five, I don't believe is out of context. And I have. And I remember when the overture was being built.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It was being built after the houses were already there. And I literally I checked back with my staff. I said, remember when the overture was built? Did we get any complaints about traffic or any crime issues with the overture?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And to the best of their memory, there weren't any. Because I wanted to say, Well, have we done this before? And what was the response from that? So I think that that's important to note when I were thinking about this potential rezoning.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then I want to I have a question about density. Where should we put density? Because as I have heard comments from the the residents, it said say density should only go in tod sites or along the Quebec square or along an East Bridge.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think now in a place when we are trying to find space for the people that want to come here, I think thoughtful density should be along major arterials. So I agree with the notion that that's where it should go.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm not sure a single family adding more single family and Central Park anymore makes the maximum use of our space. The overture that I talked about, it's 1.5 acres, it's 108 units. So we approximately double. It's about 200 units.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I wrote down numbers of 300 cars. I think we're going a little bit higher than what is potential and not even talking about the setbacks in the design of that. So. Taking the criteria into account. I believe that the and lastly because I want to come back to Sun.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Who was I was a son board member before I was on city council from 2000 and 2008 to right before getting elected. Sun has a very good point. So it's not just a matter of this rezoning. This the May five is what happens should this rezoning.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Not be approved. What happens to that development? And I hear people saying, we're not interested in Merrick five. But I can assure you, you do not want the possibility of what could happen with the CMU 20. Because I don't believe industrial uses are appropriate at all on that site.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But in the current zoning there are industrial uses that are applicable. Use by write in as a body. There would be nothing that we could do to prevent that. So I taking all that into account with. And this is this is a difficult decision.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I appreciate all everyone's comments. I believe that the criteria has been met. And I'm I appreciate the applicant hearing the community and saying, we hear you and this is how we believe we can come to a place where some might agree.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Because my understanding is and I'm a look to John when the three story came back that we're going to go three stories, there were some people that were okay with it, not a lot, but there were some people that said, okay, that satisfies us for exactly I know not a lot, but I think that that's important to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'note. So this is something that I will be supporting. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Hurt and Councilman Espinosa, can we go to Councilman? Councilwoman Ortega. All right, Councilman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'm going to pass. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right now. Okay. Um. Okay. Councilman Espinosa. Welcome to my last two years on this body. I represent Northwest Denver. A lot of that area got rezone like this in 2010. So we get really objectionable new construction using these existing the new zoning code and there is not a damn thing we can do about it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Apologize for using a partial swear word. So I my constituents would probably definitely relate to you. And here's a situation where we actually can do something about it. We've had many of those situations since I've been on councils, particularly in my own district, and that what you just heard is the response that you get from the majority'",
        "'speaker_0': 'of council almost every single time. The only time a neighborhood has been successful in my district in stopping a rezoning. Uh, was when they they petitioned and forced a supermajority, meaning that you had to have ten members of council, not the usual seven.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That one failed, but it still got eight votes. So it would have passed under all other situations. And it got real interesting, too, because this council even tried to delay that vote because because it we weren't going to have a full body.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And they knew that they needed everybody here to get to the ten. Yeah, that's. That's the sausage making. And I'm not supposed to talk to you about it, but that's what happens here. So I appreciate you all coming out and expressing your concerns.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I do also trust this for a city is a good master developer and will do the right thing. But. I'm I'm looking at it. And you're right. You're John, you're right to be concerned because when you change the zoning now, all this stuff becomes of use by right and you have no say.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You're lucky that you're protected by a design review committee. Much of what you see and what you enjoy in that community is because it's been vetted by some really great professionals. That said, we do have an issue of here, you know, in my past life as an affordable housing developer, whether you like it or, you know, love'",
        "'speaker_0': 'him or hate him. My last one of my last projects were the ones those townhouses and multi row houses that line MLK and Central Park Boulevard right there on that corner. And we did that in the CMU 20 without waivers, the exact same zoned district that you have today.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'As a matter of fact, all of the development from Ulster to Willow has occurred with this zoned district without a rezoning. So that sort of gets you to the justifying circumstances component, like what has changed? Nothing has changed in this situation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You know, the roads have been built, but those roads have been always planned. It's a matter of fact. They've been narrowed. Right. They used to be three lanes in each direction. Now they're two with bike lanes. It's good.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But, you know, it's so the the the change is towards a more residential pedestrian oriented environment, which would, um, you know, but it's not, that's not a radical change in condition. I think you all bond with the master plan developer.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think we've all recognize.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'You've heard allocated.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Time and time and time again about Stapleton both in the city and in the nation and in the world, about the success of this development. And that all occurred under the old zoning code somehow. And now this has to happen, this change.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You know.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I will say.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'One of the thing that really frustrates me and I try to avoid this in my own district, I actually hear a win win here being proposed, but it hasn't been formulated and hasn't been generated. What I do in my district when I have the opportunity and I don't always takes a developer coming forward early in the process'",
        "'speaker_0': ', not putting in their application, but we have a sort of two step process, a memorandum of understanding in my view that says, okay, developer, you agree to, to, you know, build five or six or whatever stories you want on the corner but that you transition your project as you get to the residential neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we will support that because by the time you get into this lower density area, you've, you've addressed the massing and certain conditions that the community feels would adequately address the impact of the development. You codify what you're agreeing to in the memo, you basically says, we support we the community support you, Mr. Developer, and your ambition'",
        "'speaker_0': 'in exchange that you will file a covenant restricting that property to that sort of massing or those sorts of agreements within X number of days after that rezoning occurs. So you have an agreement before you come in here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You have that agreement that takes you through this process. And then within a number of days you have security that that is memorialized now and for the future. I also recommend that you don't do that in perpetuity because then it creates a legal nightmare in the future.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But ten, 15, 20 years sort of buys the people that live here negotiated that outcome some predictability. It's a great tool. I can tell you that there are developers that don't want to use that tool, so they sidestep that whole process by never coming to the community and never coming to council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's their prerogative here. I think there was the ability to get there. I just know we have real, capable people. For a city, it sounds to me that not the real nuts and bolts that I would like to, you know, be considering is how do we shape and mold so that we address the other criteria.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I wish could we pull up the justifying circumstances? I actually want to speak to two of them. I've already spoken to number four that the justifying circumstances and there's nothing that has changed here. They are the CMU 20 has been good enough for the entirety of Forest City redevelopment and it should be good enough now it meets'",
        "'speaker_0': 'all of that criteria, the currency and EU 20. So you know, what we do know is every piece of property to the east and every piece of property, well, not every piece of property in the west, but this property and everything to the east that has already been developed, save for you into an MLK.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is, you know, already uniform with the district regulations. And so this is now going outside of that. So we're now intentionally deviating from the plan. And I just don't agree that that is, in fact necessary or it benefits all of the other criteria.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then particularly in really what it boils down to is then you get to consistency with neighborhood context and zone district purpose and intent. You already have it there. You already have it. Everything's been developed in that zone district.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And and so I don't see how this improves by increasing the development potential. I don't buy the industrial concern because there are other provisions in CMU. Zone District in chapter 59 specific to trying to do industrial in a commercial mixed use zone district.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So there and that is that was codified. What are the reasons our old zoning code was left is because this moved to this greater flexibility. But this greater flexibility means less predictability, more uses and more density, same amount of parking spaces required in this district.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But now you've got to fit a heck of a lot more cars. And then there's it's only one per unit people will visit. And all your concerns are legitimized, not opposed to density. But you got to make the case and I haven't heard one case that why this zone district is absolutely imperative to address the concerns and'",
        "'speaker_0': 'needs of this community to further the public health and safety and welfare of this community. This is a great community. Yet for a city did a bang up job. Probably too good of a job in this situation is because this neighborhood that close to the park ain't going away any time soon.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so, you know, 4 to 5 and four are clearly not met. And I could extrapolate on every element here. And it could you could address those in the zoning should, in my opinion, be amended and it should have waivers and conditions rather than you have to enter in a part private party agreement.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But that is a battle that I've been fighting for two years. I will continue to fight for two years for the next two years. The attention District One needs the help of District eight constituents and the city needs to participate in the Denver right process.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Let them know that our next vision of the city should address have a means to address these these situations, because we have ceded a lot of responsibility on on the sense that this zoning code is just great as it is off the shelf.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And it needs tweaking. It needs to be addressed. And then this process of asking also needs better input and validity. I believe you've made the case. I know it to be. You know, I think the split vote on the planning board speaks to that as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You don't know. You don't always see that. Very rarely do you see that. And I won't go. I've talked long enough. I won't go into plans. I won't go into master plans of I'm going to adopted plans. Blueprint Denver area.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But so with that, I mean, this is I think you all picked up on it. This is the situation that I wish my committee was prepared to fight, had the resources to do this, because there are lots of, you know, questions to be asked, a lot of ask that could be made so that both sides would come'",
        "'speaker_0': 'prepared with a win win. That has not happened here. I believe it could have happened. But I do believe that the blanketed zone district based me in the existing zone district, based on all what I've said and evidence that the it's it has in fact, allowed this area to flourish already.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And it could develop in a manner that is consistent with all of our review criteria under the existing zoning code. I will not be supporting this rezoning. All right, Councilman, you.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I want to thank everybody for coming out here tonight. And last year, I went through a very contentious rezoning in one of my neighborhoods. And it was just the opposite of what you're going through, which was even worse.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It was from good zoning to better to worse zoning, a much worse zoning. And it was a bad situation. Where I look at this is you're going from bad zoning to better zoning. It may not be perfect. It may not be the three stories that you want all, all the way.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But it looks like you're coming up with a compromise. At least 50% of that development will be three stories. So it sounds like you're moving in the right direction to that meets better your context. I know that may not be what you want, but sometimes we have to make that compromise to make sure that the right thing'",
        "'speaker_10': 'is done, not the wrong things. It's done. So so I'll be supporting this tonight. And I just want you to know how much we understand what you're going through. And I really appreciate you're doing, but I think you're moving in the right direction.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I believe this this owner for our city will develop this condition to make sure this restricted and we're looking to make sure that happens. So thank you very much.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'And in blunting the effect of the building of this size in an area where there's no context for that. So, you know, in my district it's along University Boulevard. There are other five story buildings. The developer decided to do a step down facing the residential, the single family neighborhoods to the east.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And it's it's it's a nice it's better than than a five storey wall, but but not much. So I and I have faith in Forest City that I don't see them doing anything other than looking for an alternative.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Were this to fail, which I have no thought that it will. But from what I've seen of Forest City in the past, I would expect them to look for a better alternative than the worst case scenario that the current zoning would allow.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That was actually really good. Okay. The hearing, public hearing for Council Bill 659 is now closed. We have a special deal to hear a little bit from the mayor's office through our representative, Miss Gabby. So what was the mayor have to say about this?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Council President Brooks, Gabby Krieger from the mayor's office. The mayor asked me to share that. He absolutely and unequivocally supports this naming, that there is no greater champion in our city and our state for our kids other than antigens.'",

You know, I've been thinking about for the last couple of weeks what to what to talk about with Miss Anna Jo Haines.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And as you can hear by her accolades, you could be talking all day. But the real mark of an individual is how they treat other folks and how they leave you feeling and experiencing them. And, Ms.. Haines, I tell you, from the first day that I've been in contact with you, you've always you just have a dignity'",
        "'speaker_0': 'about you and about that dignity about the people you interact with where some elders in our community expect you to kiss the ring, you know, and you deserve that. I should be kissing your ring all the time. But you come with this dignity in this service and this love for an individual.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I just really felt that just as a young politician seven years ago when you were getting me involved in the Denver preschool program and the way you you move in this city in the way that you treat people is just incredible.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I just want to thank you for that. And I also want to thank you for the incredible knowledge that you've given me around early childhood education. I am now I was a supporter. I was the advocate.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Now I'm a champion for it because of you, because of your leadership. And so I really want to thank you for that. It's just been so inspiring. And I chaired the campaign to raise in 2014, I believe it was, to raise it the tax to a little higher so we can invest in our kids.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I just really appreciate that and appreciate what you've done. But, you know, what I'm really excited about is this area that we're going to I don't know how many folks have been in this area. This is right off Tremont.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This building right next door is the. Albert Wedgeworth building across the street is the Leonora B Quick Park. And it's in an area that's rapidly changing. It's in an area that is seeing a lot of new neighbors. But it seems like the last.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Couple of years, we've been putting these pillars in the community and little kids are starting to say, who is who is Albert Wedgeworth? You know, who who is a eleanora? Be quick. And I'm so excited that they're going to rock and hear these kids playing in this yard and say, who is and and Joe Haynes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And there's going to be a plaque there. Someone is going to be able to tell them, let me tell you, sit down. She changed this community and she has her fingerprints all over this community. I forgot who said it, but I second whoever said this little building.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We got a name, many other buildings after her. And so this is such an easy vote for me. Thank you for the person that you are. It's so nice to not have any. You know, sometimes we do these names and we have folks come upset that were naming at the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No. One you had say who speaking in favor. But it's because of who you are as a person. So we love you and we support you. Congratulations. And and Ms.. Happy Haynes. Next next to her daughter, who is also on the school board and leading our Parks and Rec department.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you for your leadership in the city as well. All right, Councilman.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Her name is president. The question I could ask could have been enough. Because what took us so long and, yo, you're. Your impact is everlasting. Because the change, the difference you have made in this city is generous. You have changed people's lives.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that can't be overstated. And the stature in the way that you carry yourself is your warmth from a new person coming to Denver interested in running for elected office. I have just valued our conversations. Your love and your passion that you have is something that we can all benefit from.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I just want to say thank you. This is a no brainer and will probably be the easiest decision I will make as a council person. Thank you, Mr. President.'",

And you have inspired countless other people in our city and our state and our country. You are gifted at persuasion, and just like Tom Sawyer, you get everyone excited to join your cause.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You're fearless and unstoppable. You're optimistic and always smiling. What you've done for Denver and generations of children has been transformational and monumental. An antidote. You look beautiful and strong and powerful tonight, and I'm so happy to support this.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'But this could could not be a better naming of an early learning center. And I hope ultimately we all get an Anejo Heinz building in each one of our districts, because you have definitely changed the fabric of the city for the better.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I'm glad to support this and congratulations Anejo, to you and your family tonight. Thank you, President Brooks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, thank you, Councilman Gilmore. Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Anejo, I just want to thank you as everyone else up here has, but I want to add my voice thanking you for your lifetime of dedication to what I think is the city's most important resource.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And that's growing our children and raising them up to take our place in their time. And I think you've done a remarkable job, but I do have to wonder about one thing, and that is I think I probably met you 30, 35 years ago for the first time.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'How in the world do you manage to never age? I swear, you look the same as the day I met you back in sometime in the eighties. Remarkable. But it's my pleasure to support this. And thank you very much for your lifetime of dedication.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'And and and the fact that I think, you know, everybody in Denver and everybody knows you. And so it won't be too hard for people to say who was who is this and a Joe Haines, because so many people will already know it.'",

Sue Casey, who was one of the council members on this body, who was the original voice pushing for, you know, the Denver preschool program.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We called it something different at that time, helping educate everybody around the fact that, you know, when you expose children at an early, early age to quality education, to, you know, good nutrition or all of that, that 80% of the brain is being developed in the first three years.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And in giving our children the tools they need to be successful.

        "'speaker_4': 'complimentary way. And I think the true test of whether power is achieving good is is for whom, you know, we speak when we have access and we have a voice that others may not.

        "'speaker_3': 'Did or to the people.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That you had access to or the rooms that you were invited into. And so I commend you in, you know, not just.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'What you've achieved, but in the use of that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Power in such an effective and moral and highly outcome oriented way for people who really needed to have an advocate because they didn't have that same access. And so thank you for that. And I'm excited to see a powerful woman's name on a building here in Denver.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Good luck. Very nice. Thank you. Councilman, can each councilman knew.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Crispbread as he's. I'm not sure I know you very well either, but we know your daughter very well. And then the qualities we see in her obviously come from you is no question about that. Your whole list of accomplishments were so impressive, just like were said earlier.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I just love reading about it. And this naming was a small tribute to the honors that you've already received, and we are so look forward to doing that and everything on your behalf. So thank you again for all you do for preschool.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We love preschool. We love reading the stories to the kids every year. And and I just want to feel proud to be a part of this small honor for you tonight.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you, Councilman New Miss Sandwich Johanns, we apologize for keeping you here this late. No one said that, but we. We did not know who was going to run this long. But in the meantime, we honor you, Madam Secretary.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's been moved and seconded, and we have a roll call, please.'",

        "'speaker_4': '12 eyes.'",
        "'speaker_0': '12 eyes. The building at 2851. Fremont is now the Miss Anna Jo Haynes Early Childhood Center. I'm going to take a little bit of privilege and ask Miss Anna, Joe Haines to come up here and make a few words.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Bless us with your words, please.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Wow. That's all I got to say. Wow. You know, there was moments, this really wow moment. Mr. President and esteemed council members. I'm extraordinarily humbled. For this recognition. And I mean, use my cards because I was told by my children and other people who know me very well that I must, because otherwise we'd be here as long'",
        "'speaker_3': 'as we were earlier this year. So I won't I won't do that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I want to especially.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank Mayor Hancock. From back when he was on the city council. I remember coming to him and saying, We're in buildings that you own that are in dire shape. They've been around for more than 25 years. It's time to do something about that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So he said the bond was coming up at that time and he said he'd work with me to make sure that we could get them in the bond. Well, we did, but I worked with him very closely and just talked to him all the time about early childhood.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'At the end of that time, when the bond won, he did say to me, you know, you really know a lot about this. You know, I think we had a name, a building in your honor. Well, that was several years ago.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so here we are today. So I want to especially thank you for thinking about me. There are several other people that I would like to thank, and it's the committee that put the petition together for me. This was going on for a few months before I even realized that something was happening.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I want to thank Dr. Pamela Harris, who is my boss now, and Albert Wedgeworth and Aaron Brown, the executive director of the Office of Children's Affairs, who I work very closely with. And. Dr. Lisa Roy and the many people who went to the committee and spoke on my behalf.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Walter Eisenberg, Tracy Winchester and many, many more people. And I want to thank all the signers of the petition if they're listening in tonight or not. A lot of people couldn't come tonight, they said, but they were going to listen.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so I want to thank them. That was well. And I especially want to thank the literally hundreds of coworkers that I and colleagues that I've worked with over the years, just many, many people who plan, I think, to come to the dedication at some point.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'As I listened to the tributes tonight and to all of you council people speak, I was reminded me of the people who worked side by side with me to accomplish the tasks I was able to do and the tasks we set out to do.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'How lucky I was to work with so many people who cared so much about the children and the families. And, you know, it takes that village to raise a child. So it was really important. And I thought about each of them and thought about some of the things that people said about me tonight.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I said, Oh, I remember who worked with me on that. I couldn't have done it without them. I remember all those people and they were there, you know, in my heart tonight, because you can't do things by yourself.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It takes that village not only to raise a child, but to make sure something happens in the process. Let's see. Let me tell you about a really important thing that I think you don't know about, and it's made it possible for this incredible recognition to happen.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's a serendipity. So I have to tell you just very few things about me. I was born on the orrery a campus. And so I think instilled in me when I was very little without even knowing that it would be an education campus.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I kind of believe in those things. It was meant to be that I was going to look at education. So I lived there for a while and then I moved over to Northeast Denver and was lucky enough to go to Mariah Mitchell School.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And. That names may sound a little familiar to you right now because Mariah Mitchell is being talked about as we speak because she brought a contingent of women to Denver in the late 1800s when the last. What do you call that?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's coming. The eclipse is coming. She was not looked at with much respect for most of the men in her field, and she decided to bring all the women engineers that she knew at that time and brought them to Denver so that they could see the eclipse.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I then was lucky enough to go off through Mitchell in my fourth and fifth grade. I had two teachers who told me all about Mariah Mitchell, and it was the first time I knew anything. I thought, This building is named for her.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Isn't this incredible? And she brought those women because she felt it was important for people all over the country who were looking at us at that time to know that there were women in this field and that they could really do something.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So she taught me something very early on about taking leadership. So I'm grateful to teachers who taught me that. And to know that there were women that long ago out there really making sure that things were happening not only for women, but making sure the kids had what they needed to have.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I want you to know also that I grew up in this neighborhood and the building where the rec center is now was the old Clinton YMCA. And I grew up there going to teen campaigns. And then when I took one of my first jobs, which was with Parks and Recreation for the city, I became a coach'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and played basketball in that building before it was torn down. As the buildings were being looked at there, there were temporary buildings, but there. And so this is my neighborhood. And when it became time to bring Headstart into the city, I worked with people to do that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And it it was a huge payoff because what happened from that was the mothers said, our children have had a head start, but we haven't. We need that headstart and and we want to go to work. And so our agency came into being to help those people go to work.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We worked very closely for help, and we got it. And we were the first contractor to do early childhood with the city and county of Denver through the Department of Human Services. Three years later, Mile High United Way stepped to the plate.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we grew and we grew to be the largest subsidized early childhood Karen Education Agency in the city of Denver and in the state of Colorado. We were only able to do that because in 1970 there was had many available and the people who were sitting in those chairs before you were trying to figure out what to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'do with that money? Well, I had a chance to talk to some people about that. They actually made the decision. To build the buildings we are still in. To this day they were the new Denver was the only city in the country that used HUD dollars for early childhood.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And this was in the early seventies. So you should be very proud of what you did, because if you hadn't done that, I wouldn't be standing here today getting all this credit for having done something for the kids and the families that started right here in this building.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I thank you so much for this honor. Couldn't do it without you. Oh.'"

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Wow. That was very sweet. We have another public hearing tonight. You. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You guys are welcome to stay for the next public hearing as well. Councilman? No. Will you please put Council Resolution 687 on the floor?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Mr. President, the Council of 687 be adopted.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It has been moved and seconded. The public hearing for Council Resolution 687 is opened. May we have a staff report? I believe. Happy. Haines, are you on deck? It's a busy night for you.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Thank you very much, President Pro Tem and members of council. I will be very brief because I know we are here tonight to hear from our citizens about this project. I just wanted to give you a quick background and overview.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'It was sometime last summer when this idea, this opportunity came to the city and we worked very closely with the Office of Special Events to consider it. And I will say at the outset, our department, the Department of Parks and Recreation, was among the skeptics.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And so we spent a number of months doing a little due diligence on the idea of this festival, including sending a team of individuals to the sister festival that has matured in San Francisco. And we did that along with a number of other city agencies.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Before I go any further, I would like to really acknowledge those individuals because it really has been a team effort. And I particularly want to thank Fred. Fred Weiss, Scott, Ralph Lake, Laura morales from our Department of Parks and Recreation, the Office of Special Events.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Katie and Grace. And her whole team. The city attorney's office, who have been just terrific in helping us think through each step of this process. Our Parks and Rec Advisory Board and and particularly there are residents and neighbors in in the community.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Whether they were in favor or against their involvement at every step of this process has been invaluable and has shaped where we are tonight with the the contract that you have before you. I'm not going to go through the details of the contract because I think you have seen we made a pretty lengthy presentation at committee a'",
        "'speaker_12': 'few weeks ago, and the contract really reflects all of those items that we went through with you at that meeting, with one exception, and I and I want to apologize at the outset for how late the contract actually came to you.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And I know that you'll be taking a little extra time to review it, but we wanted to make sure that every last thing was in place and it was right. And we had some issues, some details to work out with excise and licensing since the council committee and wanted to make sure that each of those pieces was'",
        "'speaker_12': 'in the contract that you received during the course of the conversations in the community that started about November of this last year. We have had input through a survey from over a thousand individuals, both in the neighborhoods directly involved in the neighborhoods throughout the city, as well as a thousand petitions that we received both in favor and'",
        "'speaker_12': 'in opposition to to the proposal. We used all of that input to shape an a set of commitments that we floated in a number of community meetings, guidelines, if you will, that helped really shape the core of the contract that you have before you.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And it really and I meant it genuinely when I said earlier, we thank those individuals who were both skeptical and oppose as much as those who were in favor because voicing their concerns helped to sharpen our thoughts and where we needed to go in the kinds of issues that needed to be addressed in this contract.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And so it is a better contract and it's a better document because of all of that input that we received. We worked with neighborhood organizations, schools, recreation centers, all of the users of the golf courses, not only the Overland one, but throughout the city.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I want to thank you particularly for the support that we got from your council offices in helping with the community outreach. We had individuals literally walking door to door and and a robust online presence to try to get input and all of that added up to the contract that you have before you this evening.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Two things in particular I want to address before I sit down and then let you hear from the community. The mayor added his own input and it was as a result of meeting with a number of. Neighbors in the Oberlin community.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'He made a commitment that both our department, the city and the promoter are absolutely committed to, and that is the establishment of an accountability committee that will be very engaged, an accountability committee with a level of independence that will enable us to get real, honest and genuine feedback from the community about how this event goes.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And those of you who know the work that we've done around events throughout this city and in our parks, and you all walk through us. Just recently with the new event policy that we put in place. And I mention that because our aim in addressing all of those issues, both in that policy and in this contract, is'",
        "'speaker_12': 'to ensure that we have good events in this city and that they're there events that people want to go to, that they add value to our community, and that they minimize the impacts in our neighborhoods. And that is where we believe that this contract does.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Councilman, knew you raised a question, I think a related question about this earlier this week with some concerns about making sure that the language of some accountability and some evaluation and review are not being reflected in the contract.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I will point you to the language that is in Section 5.2 S, which we believe does address that issue, and we're happy to work with you more directly in the future. There are two things that make this a little bit unique.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'One is this contract includes a fairly lengthy list of requirements and plans that the promoter must provide to the city and to our department for review and approval before we move ever anywhere. And the language that I just mentioned in the contract requires us to evaluate the results of all of those things.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'It commits and requires the promoter to be engaged in the community outreach that's necessary to get that feedback about how the festival went and what the issues were and what concerns were raised. And I'll say this to begin with, as much work as we've done and as much as we have focused on the details of this contract'",
        "'speaker_12': ', we know that it is not going to be perfect day one. And that's why we've built into this process and into the contract processes that will enable us to respond, to adjust, to adapt both during the Feast of the festival itself and more importantly, afterwards, so that we make the adjustments and the changes that are needed to'",
        "'speaker_12': 'make this the very best festival possible. I will end with that and thank you all very much again.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Miss Haynes. All right, we have. Yep, go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I did forget one thing, and that is to make a quick introduction of of the promoters of from Superfly who are here tonight. I just want to make sure that, you know that they are present. They are here to answer questions.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I want to thank them personally for the amount of time they have spent going through in painstaking detail what we believed we needed to make a great event. This is Rick Farman from Superfly. He's a co-founder of Superfly.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And I just have to say, I'm literally a guy who's willing to roll up his sleeves and and get to get to work and and respond. And finally, David Erlich, who many of you know in the community, who is the festival liaison and is the local guy on the ground and has been a tremendous partner.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So they are both here available for questions after the public hearing during and and and are at your disposal. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you. First, I want to I want to just say to all the folks who are here, thank you for enduring a long time. Thank you for coming through security, sitting in hard seats. We realize that this is the not the best process, but it is the only process we have and look and always improve'",
        "'speaker_0': 'that. So we want to apologize because you could be doing a lot of things at 940, but you are at the city hall trying to make your city better because you care about your neighborhood. So thank you for being here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This is a courtesy public hearing. Courtesy, public hearing. You cannot yield time. So it's it will be 3 minutes straight up and we'll do in favor and against will be alternating everyone. The other thing is we have 28 speakers, so 28 times three is more than 60 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I will have a timer right here going going on there. But you don't have to everybody doesn't have to use all their 3 minutes. Many of you, especially if you're at the halfway point, you're going to start hearing speakers say similar things.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so be courteous to the folks who are on the bottom end of the list. And if you've wrapped up your comments, you can wrap it up and leave someone some more time so we can get all 28 people in.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I haven't figured out the math of how to get all 28 in, but, you know, 2 minutes would be appropriate, I think. Okay. So I'm going to call the first five. We'll leave this first row open for the first five people to come.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Come through. Robert Lavelle. Kathy Hamilton. Reyna. Reza. Q Razak. Okay. Okay. Thanks for your vote of confidence. All right. And. Carmen knows. And Max Hirsch. Okay, Robert Rob Lovell, you are first 3 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Good evening, everyone. It's been quite a night, a long night. And I just want to first thank you, Mr. President, council members, for allowing us to come speak. Really? I'd like to thank all the members of the government that I have dealt with over the last year in.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'My name is Robert Lovell and I live at 406 west of Joel, right across from the first green. So I would be one of the neighbors most directly impacted by this festival. But as I was saying, I wanted to thank the government representatives, Parks Department's Office of Special Events.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I've met so many people throughout this process. And I've been impressed every step of the way.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's been very in-depth, very thorough and.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I really feel that whatever happens, everybody's working for everyone's best interests. So I had some written down remarks prepared, but throughout the evening I just decided to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Wing it and I kind of.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You know, feel like my philosophies are guided by like good, like the greatest, good for the greatest number of people and operating.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In good faith.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'When this idea came about. I was part of the first group where it was like, Hey, there's this idea being floated around. Is this something that we're even remotely interested in as a neighborhood, as a neighborhood association in pursuing?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There is multiple public meetings in every step of the way. People acted with good faith, and I appreciate that. And every step of the way, the concerns were notated. They were categorized. They're attract, they're addressed. I never heard false promises.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I never heard things that would lead me to believe that anything. Not up front and not in our best interest is going on. And the survey really drove that home for me, seeing all of the concerns listed out, seeing the proposed steps to address those concerns.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean, that was pretty comprehensive. And that's why not only myself as.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'An individual could I support it, but also support it like as recommend recommendation for the rest of my community. It's going to benefit the community by the money that comes in it, the attention that comes to the community.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's underserved in terms of pedestrian access, transportation safety, things like that in it, in a focus in that area is going to naturally improve those things over time, like the proposed pedestrian drawbridge. Also the opportunity to get additional funding for community engagement.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The Community Advisory Board. The Accountability Board steps are being taken to protect our best interests and I'm 100% comfortable endorsing this. It's going to be part of a bigger whole.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In my opinion.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The synergistic thing going on with the vet pavilion. So all of the music, the music venues on South Broadway, possible CPR, I mean, there's a lot.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Happening in that neighborhood and southwest Denver can really be placed on the map.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'On the same level as Austin City limits south by Southwest.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So in terms of. Thank you. All right, Kathy Hamilton.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hi. I'm Kathy Hamilton.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I live.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In Denver. Remember when Colorado turned down the Olympics? Our state didn't want the crowd nor the expense. Overland Park neighborhood is rejecting the equivalent of the Olympics. Think out of the box. Just try to think out of the box for a minute.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Can these huge events be held at Red Rocks instead? How about.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Barbie? Barbie, your park.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Or at the Denver Country Club. All these places have parking. The city of Denver often exceeds the carrying capacity of neighborhoods like Globeville.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Swansea and Elyria with 14 lane highway.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Projects or or say a while ago when.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Neighborhood of Berkeley. If you live there, it's it wasn't a success. Um. If the Overland Park golf course were a beach. Like with sand and bathers and things like that. A beach taken over for profit. You would surely be outraged.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Somehow, if it's just a golf course. It isn't. It just seems like, you know, excess green sward that can just be, you know, worked over. And, you know, this has happened to the golf course on the other side on the on the east side of Eye of the Mousetrap, because they're going to chew it up to make'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Sorry. Sorry. My name is Rainer Isaak and I live at 406 West Ewell Avenue with Robert Lovell. That's my husband right across from the first screen. So I'm really proud to live in a community where we have access to so many natural resources as well as urban amenities and natural activities.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I'm also proud to be here with neighbors who are so passionate about our community regardless of where we stand on the issue. I'm torn by this level of civic engagement because we all live where we live and have our community's best interests at heart.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I work at Denver Public Schools in the Office of Student Equity and Opportunity, so I'm passionate about eliminating the opportunity gaps that exist in our community. Southwest Denver has historically been marginalized and lacks access to a robust culture of art and music.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, that pavilion certainly adds to our to the culture of our neighborhood, and it'll take things to a new level, as well as give us the opportunity to make much needed improvements to our area, basic things like crosswalks and safe bridges to walk across.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And this music festival will definitely add to that as well live. It just wouldn't have the capacity to make these infrastructure improvements by itself. Some of the items that I think are particularly advantageous from my personal perspective is that there will be a separate fund for community outreach efforts which can be routed to increase arts access for'",
        "'speaker_3': 'our youth. Communities in southwest Denver have been traditionally underserved, and cultures with traditionally rich art and history and tradition have had to put these traditions on the back burner as art becomes something that's more of a privilege, and as they scramble for access to community resources to highlight their culture and their art, our culture and our art'",
        "'speaker_3': 'opportunities for community folks who volunteer at the festival will gain them free access to renowned music, as well as incredible work and service experience. And this is going to be particularly helpful to young adults in our area. High schools like Abraham Lincoln, Coons, Miller, Creative Arts Academy, South High School, giving our youth the opportunity to access positive'",
        "'speaker_3': 'outlets that engage their interests. The golf course is going to be available to a much greater portion of the community as well. Increasing access to this beautiful land and the funds that are routed toward neighborhoods will help us increase our infrastructure.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'My name is Max Hirsch. I live at 1235 Grant Street in Denver, along with my family owned businesses on South Broadway and the Overland neighborhood. I'm also a student at C.U. Denver. I study music business and music cities with the creative economy.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And tonight, I'd just kind of like to speak behalf of the younger residents of Denver, as well as the students that I go to school with. First off, Denver is an island for music. What I mean by that is it's very hard to break out of Denver as a musician, as a local musician, there's not a lot'",
        "'speaker_8': 'of places to go from Denver. We're not surrounded by a lot of other markets, and unfortunately, we're not a national market right now. So there's not a lot of national attention on our artists. This festival could change that, could flip that immediately.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Not only will local artists be able to play at the stages during the festival with local stages, they'll be able to share with share stages with big names like Radiohead and stuff like that. Adding to their resume about big shows that they've played and out of town, residents are going to come to this festival and they're going'",
        "'speaker_8': 'to find their new favorite artist, and it might be a local Denver artist, and that's huge for us. And we're also going to be able to be playing in bars and restaurants and venues around the area.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So when this ends.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'At 10:00 at night, people are going to want to continue to go out, which is going to help the businesses and it's also going to help the artists that are playing the shows at these businesses. Next, I wanted to touch on the what my age group is doing right now.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'When we're going into the workforce right now and we're the trend has flipped from. Go into a finding a job in a city, going to the city and hoping that you like the city. It's now you're going to a city for the culture.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You're going to a city for the lifestyle. And you're going to search for a job in that city. And I think the Denver brand and the Denver culture is great and it's amazing and we're going in the complete right direction and I love it so much, and I think that this can really help that culture and really'",
        "'speaker_8': 'help that brand and be a positive for the city of Denver. Thank you all for your time and consideration.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Hersh. Thank you for the time. All right, Eleanor.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Council members excuse me. After sitting here for 5 hours after work, I'm a little rough in the throat, but thank you for the opportunity to speak. You all have heard from me and some of my other neighbors who are the neighbors of Oral and North, a registered neighborhood organization recently.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I really just want to touch on a couple of points, and that is we have a great concern in our neighborhood about the use of the golf course for this festival, just in principle. I'd like to get this on the record.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's been a designated park since 1956. On September 10th, 2010, the Denver Department of Parks and Recreation adopted rules regarding admission based events in Denver parks. These rules were the result of a lengthy public process that included input from many citizens, citizen groups and agencies in order to address conflicts related to major, massive events being held in'",
        "'speaker_3': 'parks and inundating neighborhoods, etc.. The following parks were designated as parks were admission based. Events may be permitted. I think you all know what they are. Civic Service Center. Park. City Park. Confluence Park. Skyline Park. Central Park. Park.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Field Park. Ruby Hill Park. Overland Park is not among them. The rules also state that an ABA shall be no more than four days, including set up and tear down, and ABA shall not allow public attendance to exceed 7500 persons.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'No ABA shall occupy more than 20% of a contiguous area in a given park. So we recommend. And respect those rules and those agreements and that you say no to this contract based on that. We further recommend that the Denver City Council take back oversight and regulation of Denver's parks.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Parks are public. Public used to be in public. Public now. Seems to me in private. Maybe I haven't caught up with the language changed. I'm not a psychologist, but I think we need to think about putting the public back in parks and also to respect small, unique neighborhoods and not inundate them with massive numbers of people.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we don't have the infrastructure to support this. And while I think the festival may be a terrific idea, it's the absolute wrong venue. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Andrew. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Hello, counsel. Thank you for having me here. My name is Andrew Huff. I live on the 200 block of Acoma, just a few blocks from the festival. I've been to most of the meetings that have pertained to this event.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It's really been a wonderful experience. Everybody that has been involved with it has really spent their due diligence making sure that everybody's best interest has been heard. That includes the folks from Superfly, as well as the city council, as well as the neighbors.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm excited for the opportunity. You know, it's it's a wonderful thing to have this type of cultural event in the city. It's something that I don't think Denver necessarily has right now. I'm also excited to use the park as an angle for, you know, I'm not necessarily out there using that, even though it's amenity just blocks from'",
        "'speaker_8': 'my house. And I really think that this festival can be a beacon of the cultural fabric of the city. I think that it's it's a really awesome opportunity. And I very much trust that so much that has gone into this, that it is a really good opportunity for the city.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And that's all I have. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Jeff. Joann Weiss. Weiss. Weiss. Sorry about that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hi. I definitely shaved off a few years in Purgatory by sitting in the Keys. My name is Joanne Weiss. I live at 540 West Ewell Avenue, a few feet from the golf course. From the get go, we've been told that this is a done deal.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So my statement tonight and I still feel that way. I feel overpowered by that. But I have a statement to make that just for the record, just to get it out there. When lobbyists, corporate profiteers and city government officials gang up on our neighborhoods to fill their coffers and advance their careers, it can make a person feel'",
        "'speaker_3': 'a little crazy. Throughout this process, our collective voices have been drowned out by a tsunami of hype and propaganda. Few few questions have been adequately answered and legal issues hardly addressed. For some of us, the long game is clear.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Degrade the park. Displace the people and develop the land for the greater good. This aggressive behavior has at times left us feeling hopeless. The opposite of hope is empowerment. As a new newly registered neighborhood organization born on July 4th, 2017.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The neighbors of Overland North is committed to the struggles of all neighborhoods under attack and parks and open spaces put up for lease to the highest bidder. This festival is a juggernaut that does not fit the French fragile infrastructure of our historic neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And it will dramatically alter the quality of our lives and our sense of community. We agree with her recommendation of the Inner Neighborhood Coalition Agency Parks Committee that the city should create a permanent festival site to accommodate an event of this magnitude.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Please vote no on the Superfly contract. Thank you for listening.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Terry Pascual. PESCA Well, Mr. El there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening, Mr. President, and members of Council.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'My name is Terry Pasqua.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I live on Jewell Avenue from right across the street from over the golf course with my husband, Paul Murdaugh. We are not golfers, although we have buckets of golf balls that are accumulating in our yard. And since we're not golfers, we do not get to benefit from this open space for most of the year and feel'",

        "'speaker_3': 'the impact on the neighborhood.

        "'speaker_3': 'issues that come up in the first few years are evaluated and are appropriately addressed. I have total confidence that this will be a good thing for all parties involved the golf course, the neighborhood and the city at large.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'With Denver's growing and changing demographics, our parks need to be able to provide a variety of types of usage, not just golf, which only caters to a small percentage of the population. A music festival makes perfect sense and that it would allow enjoyment of this park, if only for a few days of the year, to a much'",
        "'speaker_3': 'larger and diverse population. And the direct impact to overland neighborhood is only three days. What better way to celebrate our neighborhood in the city of Denver, but with a musical cultural festival in a natural urban setting where it provides a venue for local artists.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The increased traffic into the local area before, during and after the festival would bring a boost to the local economy and businesses along the developing South Broadway corridor. My husband often asked me, But how do you really feel?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm not a public speaker, but I am a lover of live music and dance and I love my neighborhood. The good vibes I felt from attending the concerts at Levitt Pavilion last week still linger, and I'm looking forward to more live music in the hood.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm really excited to see how this all comes together, and especially to watch out my front window as the construction of the main stage unfolds. Council members. We want this music festival. We want this for the betterment of the golf course, the surrounding neighborhoods, our local businesses and the city of Denver.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Let's bring more good vibrations into the city. The amount of love and joy coming out of this would be exhilarating. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Miss Pascal. All right. Thank you for those who came up. I'm going to call up the next five. Laurie Paulson, Paul Middaugh, Phil Hanlon, Heinlein, Jack Unruh. And I want to call one more Kathy Dugan. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Laurie Paulson, you're up first. You have 3 minutes. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's me. I'm Mary Kay Paulson. I live at 520 was Jewel Avenue. And. I am not for the destruction of the golf course. You can't replace which which you have. All these people excuse me? Whether it be 30,000, 80,000 over three days.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, not only destroy the wildlife, the habitat, the environment. What it's going to do is it's going to kill people. And you have the your words have the power of life and death. There are fragile elderly people. Disabled people.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'People on a fixed income. People that are dying. End of life care. Do you sure you can turn down the volume? Sure you can try to put it or put it further down the street. But we live across the street.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There are people that are dying and the reverberations or whatever your technical term is for the boom and the base. You can't do anything about it. And people will feel this. People with emphysema. I've been in nursing for many years.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I had to retire because my back's messed up and my body's messed up. But I wouldn't trade a day of it because I care about people. And I made a difference in their lives. That's a life enhancing moment.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You can't get that. I've been to concerts in a couple days.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Or.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Something else. A concert is not a life enhancing moment, but taking care of your people in your neighborhood. Treating them kindly with respect. Helping them. When you see they're struggling, this is the kind of people we have. This is our neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Concerts that come and go after a couple of years, it won't be new anymore. And what he got left. People on a fixed income that can't afford to move for a few days. How do we leave our property?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We've got to what? We can't replace it. How about can you replace my husband's life as he struggles to breathe? Try holding your breath. Take a deep dove and hold your breath until you can't. And you try to take in areas that you can't.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It is impossible. Your lungs can't do it. And that's a lot of these people are living moment to moment just worried about. How am I going to breathe? Am I going to breathe? That's your whole day. That's your whole night.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This concert, the noise, the chaos, the uncertainty of what's going to happen to them. And their yards, their homes. This is an abomination. It's so wrong on so many levels. And I ask you to take this into consideration.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'What do we do with people who are dying and who this all act Christmas passing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Your time is up. Thank you. Paul Bader.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Good evening, Mr. President. The members of the council.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'My name is Paul Vidor. I lived on this jewel avenue with my wife.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Terry, directly across Overland Golf Course. They're both.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Enthusiastic supporters of this.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Music festival. I'm also a dreamer.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And personally.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I would like to believe that this ought to be a done deal.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Because I see you all as our change agent.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Not just for our common good, but also for a greater good.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I also believe in magic and consummate. Clark, I think you would agree that Thursday and Friday night there was Magic and Ruby Hill at the first two concerts at the Levitt Pavilion and. To me, Leavitt Pavilion is already becoming a good testament of what's possible with the right intentions.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Imagine if Super Fly could also use the new Levitt Pavilion during their events. Wounded and hence all the magic. Council members. I believe that in the years to come, you will look back with great pride that you were so forward looking and also a dreamer by your support of this festival.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I believe that through the years after years, the success of this festival, you will personally observe Overland Golf Course being uplifted by improvements that this music festival helped to fund that you will observe. Are nearby neighborhoods and businesses also being more and more uplifted?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'As well as our great city of Denver, is being uplifted in its irresistible attraction to so many who want to live here. I even believe that most who are now against it will also come around later to support it.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I believe that eventually we can build a bridge between all of us, the enthusiastic supporters and all those who are passionately against it. We do want them back in our fold. As we understand it, there's a pending contract is now on the table and in the months to come, it will be expanded through the addition of several'",
        "'speaker_8': 'what I call operational plans, such as parking, security, transportation. I believe that our for and against neighbors can, in good faith participate together in a related advisory boards committed to the year to year improvements of these operational plans.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Most of the fears and concerns can be mitigated. Clearly, there will be kinks to work out. Respectfully, I'm asking this council to vote unanimously for this event, and I'm also taking this opportunity to publicly invite the opposition to join in and work with us.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Let's do this. Let's have more music.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Let's celebrate and let's dance. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Bradshaw. Phil Heinlein.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, let's see. My name is Phil Heinlein, Denver resident and former sound engineer. I love music. I love parks. But it's sad to see one sacrificed for the other. I'm sure you've seen those big stacks of concert speakers.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm talking a really big one. Okay. Now, imagine somehow I snuck one of those stacks in here, Pastor. Good securities in there. Or maybe I'm wealthy enough to drive a flatbed trailer all around here with a full 20,000 watt counter play on it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. You would have me arrested. And appropriately so. Because you, the government, rightly consider the volume from that size. Inappropriate, inappropriate for a minute, let alone three days. You and the good folks in the surrounding buildings want to conduct business.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But what about the homeowners near Overland Park? What do they want to conduct? Why did they buy a modest home in a very modest neighborhood? This is money making in a public park. 2 to $300 tickets. The audience mostly white.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'A scheme by the affluent. For the young. An affluent.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Simply limited access commerce.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In a public park. Everybody but the neighbors is getting a cut. Appropriate. In New York City, when they permit theater and music in a park.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Almost all the tickets are free.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'A public space for the public. Imagine that. Now surrounding Denver, there dozens of would be max Oscars. Remember Woodstock farmer willing to rent their farms for much, much less. So why did the promoters fly some council members around the country wine and dine them?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Because leveraging the grass and trees of Overland Park will result in greater profits. Leveraging the grass and trees. Good for business. Funny thing. I know in your hearts most of you think this is wrong. Inappropriate. But the money's too good.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Principle versus money. This administration. Not a chance. These Oberlin neighbors are simply not affluent enough to afford government protection. Imagine if the only.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Neighbors had the same resources. Say the good folks living on seventh Avenue.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Imagine that we wouldn't even be meeting here. This would have been over. Not even happening.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We had time to invoke Warren Zevon. You know, send lawyers, guns and money. Sadly, I have no confidence that you city council will do the right thing. Your votes have been counted. The press release already written. This hearing is just public theater.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And you're the cast performing. Well, at least you're making union scale. And the tickets were free. Know this. With your vote, you'll be reducing the public in public space and probably never be able to watch. It's a Wonderful Life.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Quite the same way again.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Healy. Jack Unruh.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Council members.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm Jack Unruh. I live four blocks south of the park and. Have done so for 37 years. And the last time that you saw some of us here who are.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'For the the festival.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Was the meeting.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Before Thanksgiving when through Councilman Clarke, we brought the proclamation of.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Denver as a compassionate city to you. And I mentioned that because we really do respect and love and honor the people who are extremely.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Opposed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'To the park. I, on the other hand, am not and I think the best way I can I can support that position is to talk to Councilman Pash Cashman's point. Does it make the neighborhood better? I believe it will.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And not just by.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Bringing notoriety and.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Recognition and.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Visibility to the neighborhood, but in the same way that the Botanic Gardens concert makes the Botanic Gardens neighborhood better. All the events in Civic Center Park make the Golden Triangle a better neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The Greek Festival makes Hilltop a better neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We make it a better neighborhood by hosting and honoring the the desires and the good times that will come out of this not only for the attendees, but also for the musicians who will be well paid, the artists who will participate, the concessionaires who will be there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Change is hard and it's it's uncomfortable, but it's the way to the new normal.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And in that sense, since.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's always happening, it is fair. And when we make our neighborhood a host.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So that things are better for others, that makes us better neighbors to others. The mixing that will take place.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'At the very diverse audience with a very diverse audience.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In terms of families, ages.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Ethnicities, music preferences and so on, is what Denver needs to do. And so I hope that you will resoundingly and unanimously vote yes in favor of the contract.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Ms. Unruh Okay. Cathy Duggan Oh, yeah. There you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hi. I'm Cathy Duggan and I live at. Sorry about that. Doug and I live at 1947 South L.A. Street. I'm a half a half a block from the proposed music festival. I say propose kind of tongue in cheek, because, quite frankly, as we've been reading in the paper and hearing, it's pretty much a done deal.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And my belief is that it's been a done deal since we've before the city was first approached. That said, I want you to keep in mind I ask that you keep in mind when you vote, we are human beings were not collateral damage.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Most of the people in our neighborhood cannot afford to go to this festival. And quite frankly, I think it's a little bit of lead us to have an event in a neighborhood where people can't go to it. We can't afford it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I can't afford it. The other thing that I would like to ask you to do as you consider this, is to think about would you want this in your neighborhood? Would you want 70 to 80000 people for three days and three nights?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And that's just the festival time. That's not the set up and the tear down. But would you want them in your side, back or front yard? Would you want to open your window in the most beautiful time of the year, in my opinion, fall and hear music that you know, I love music, quite frankly.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I have musicians in my family. I have a nephew who plays in festivals all over the place. I don't want to hear it. All day, all night. I can hear the baseball games going on. I love it. It's an hour long.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So my question to you, as you think about this, think about would you want to for three days and three nights, would you want to be subjected to music all day, all night, 70 to 80000 people in your backyard, your side yard, your front yard, people you don't know?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. We can always leave. We certainly can leave. We could move out for the weekend. I don't want to be Tommy when I have to leave, especially when I have 70 to 80000 people in my yard that I don't know.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you very much. I appreciate your time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Miss Dugan. All right. I'm going to call the next five. Please come to the front bench. Mara Owen. Diane Thiele. Justin Bressler. I think he's gone. Ronayne Montoya. And one more then Ericsson. Mara. Owen, your first.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hi City councilwoman, city councilman, thanks very much for having us here tonight. My name is Mara Owen, and I would first like to say thank you to everyone here on both sides. We really do. To make a good neighborhood need both sides of every issue.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think that the contract has been made better from every input on every side. And so I just want to say thank you, especially with how this is going for the shared passion. I am the president of the Overland Park Neighborhood Association, and I'm here representing my personal opinions.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I have lived in Denver my whole life and I've been in the Overland Park neighborhood living at Broadway and Evans since 2011. I'm personally a strong supporter of the festival. Just one of the many reasons I'm a supporter is that this festival will keep Parkland in our neighborhood solvent into the future and allow the golf course to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'cover critical and much deferred infrastructure improvements. This ensures a lasting park space in our neighborhood that is well-kept and not in danger of being closed, developed or even run into the ground. This piece of land is a huge asset to both our neighborhood and to the city, with the amount of people moving to Denver and needing space'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to recreate in an increasingly dense urban area. Spaces like this are precious and need to be both utilized and maintained. Currently, the golf course is a for profit enterprise and not simply a park free to the public. It charges a fee for using the course and tries to cover those expenses using the revenue.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They regularly host public events such as the demo night and a beer liquor garden that they did on July 21st. And they're available to host tournaments and special events. In my opinion, this is a good thing and the Superfly Festival is simply a continuation of this existing use.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Having a diversified income for any business is much more fiscally responsible and can bring more people into the space who may not be interested only in golf. The festival also hopes also helps to incentivize and fund improvements in the neighborhood and the wider city of Denver.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It directly contributes $1 per ticket to a community fund that can help make our neighborhood and the surrounding community a better place. To put all this into perspective. I've attended quite a few of the meetings for the upcoming General Obligation Bond, and I was so surprised by the list of worthwhile projects on the capital improvements list, as'",
        "'speaker_3': 'well as the amount of deferred maintenance in our city. Watching people choose which projects to fund and not fund was painful when all of them are incredibly important and some of them far overdue. This festival is an opportunity to increase funding for some projects, perhaps like these, without any type of tax on already burdened citizens.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It would be a shame to ignore this opportunity after having to cut so many projects off of the bond. In addition to all that, it's important to keep in mind that we were talking about a music festival, an inclusive all ages music festival where people come together to celebrate the cultural achievements of our society.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Music is something we have already seen as a huge community asset in the new Levitt Pavilion and has the same potential as a catalyst here. This festival can build on and encourage the music identity that is already present and growing in our neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And with events and venues such as the new Levitt Pavilion, the Underground Music Showcase, Swallow Hill, Herman's Hideaway and the upcoming color of public radio headquarters on Ruby Hill. The festival has this opportunity to strengthen the existing sense of identity.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right on time. All right. Thank you, Miss Allen. All right, Diane.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good night. Counsel people in. Mr. President, my name is Diane Thiel. I live in Denver. Our administration continues to want to use our public parks and facilities for private gain. People have to constantly come down here, right here and say no.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We're here again to say no. Overland Park residents already have to live with many concerts at Ruby Hill Park. They have to put up with not just the noise of the concert, but also have to hear the equipment testing and the band rehearsals.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Isn't that enough to put on the Overland Park neighborhood? I would not like to have a three day festival in my neighborhood. Not once and not certainly every year for five years. If you want this festival in your neighborhoods, I encourage you to call this company tomorrow and set it up.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think you might not get reelected if you do that, but I don't think you should put it in the Overland Park Golf course. Finally, I'm speaking up for the wildlife that live in or travel through the river corridor or hunt for food on the golf course.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They do not want this festival either. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Doyle. All right. Justin Bressler.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Good evening.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'President Brooks City Council.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you for having us. My name is Justin Bressler and I'm the vice president of Marketing and Business Development for Visit Denver. We are the Convention and Visitors Bureau for the metro area where 108 year old nonprofit organization whose mission is to bring conventions and leisure visitors to Denver for the economic benefit of the city, community and'",
        "'speaker_8': 'our partners. We enthusiastically support bringing the multiday music festival to Denver beginning in 2019 at Overland Park. A festival of this scale provides significant benefits to residents and visitors alike, which is why our organization is proud to be a sponsor.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We're currently progressing the Denver Tourism Road Map as a ten year strategic plan to increase the economic impact created by tourism and ensure our industry remains vibrant and competitive for years to come. Pursuing signature events and festivals like this that draw overnight visitors is the primary initiative in the roadmaps visitor driven events goal area.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Music festivals are major economic drivers, and a festival like this creates both short term and long term economic impacts to both local and city, with both local and citywide benefits in the short term. Nearby. Nearby businesses will see an immediate economic impact from the spending generated by locals and visitors who head to the festival.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And in the long term, the entire city benefits by the extra taxes paid by visitors who come here, spend money and then go home. As a matter of fact, metro Denver households would pay more than $500 in annual taxes to receive the same benefits.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Were it not for the $523 million in state and local taxes paid by visitors. Music festivals also help divine the define the tourism brand of a city. Top tourism destinations have major music festivals from Austin to Seattle to San Francisco.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And with our growing population and active residents. Music plays a huge role in our brand. And over the course of the festival, we feel that Denver's brand would be elevated at the regional and national level and also how it incorporates Denver's culinary arts and cultural experiences.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So now we live in a time when most people are listening to music privately and in earbuds and on their phone. Live music is a way for people to connect with top artists and like minded fans and communities up close and personal.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We're committed to working closely with all stakeholders to ensure the festival's unique and positive, welcoming experience for all attendees. And Denver. And we urge the Council to support the festival. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Bressler. All right. Rene Montoya.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hi. My name's Bryan Montoya. Um, I lived in the neighborhood for 31 years, and I want my neighborhood to prosper. But not this fast and not in this way. So we want to keep contaminants out of our neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And that means like bios and toxins that you guys have taken. And also prior to keep accountability, I would like to have you guys test the soil to make sure that all the shadow and the radioactive waste that was buried 300 feet from there is is actually not going to be coming up when all these people are'",
        "'speaker_3': 'coming through, peeing everywhere, making bile everywhere. All these uranium, radium and thorium are going to be coming up from the ground if it hasn't been analyzed prior. So that's one thing I want. Is soil samples done prior to exposing 60,000 people to this kind of atmosphere?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'On top of that, there's already squatters along the river. What are you guys going to do about that? Are you guys going to stop the whole area around it? Not only that, but fire hazards like we need. Part of zoning should be.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You should have your fire. Fire? Exactly. Fire person. The chief of the fire people there for making your zoning because they know what's safe and what's not safe. So having people come in three avenues versus downtown Denver, which you could also look up on your Denver Parks and Rec that September, those dates are free for the Civic'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Center. There's nothing going on there. So your super fly thing could go on downtown where it's prepared to have that many people come in. There's there's actually bus systems and light rails and good avenues for people to not have dangerous building the bridge within before it's even put in is wrong.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Saying that you're going to be making all these promises and having a lengthy list is not right. Saying these all these promises prior to actually doing them is not right and is not part of my agenda. And I do not want to support this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I do not support the music festival. I am very, you know, artistic and I love creativity. But it needs to happen like. Like. Like in a like accordance. Like right now they have the music festival and they're like testing it out up at the Ruby Hill.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Your second event you guys started and you barely know what the impact of it. Exponential growth. If you know anything about that, you guys saw the 420 event go from. I went there when I was like high school.'",
        "'speaker_3': '200 people now look at it, that's exponential growth. And so yeah, $200,000 ain't nothing. $200,000 a nothing to destroy a historical landmark. Not only that, but to go in there and allow kids to be along the river. They get so trashed, they get they they're going to go in there and make you guys.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Forget about what you guys came in voted for. They're going to be so drunk. I've seen it. I've seen these college students. They don't know their limits. And they they throw themselves they're going to be right on the banks of the river, having you guys fish them out for days so you guys could, like, make this decision'",
        "'speaker_3': '. But I do not want people coming into my neighborhood. And I've been to Mardi Gras. I've seen it. I've seen what people do and the lack of respect that they have for the environment. Our neighborhood is not set up like Mardi Gras, where we take all we have the space all the way up until the very last'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you guys. We have people saying, I just have to have prior as your your lawn, you can't build on because it's your guys. But we've got to maintain it. Right. So. That's the difference is this area is not prepared.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The safety is not taking care of. You guys haven't done any preparation in the sense of Shattuck. Have you. And I think exposing 60 to 80000 people is like very, very important. I'm OSHA, 30 certified, and I know the standards that you have to take in order to build.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so not only that, but. Like. You guys are going to be like, you know, stumbling in this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Time as a thank you. Thank you. All right, Dan Erikson.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Good evening. Council President Brooks Member of Council. My name is Dan Erickson. I live at Ruby. I live in Ruby Hill at 1390 South Canosa Court. Tonight, I come forward in support of the proposed music festival at the Overland Golf Course because it will provide an opportunity to showcase Denver's culture through local art, music, food to tens'",
        "'speaker_8': 'of thousands of people that will attended here. I'm a fourth generation Denver native. I grew up in South Denver. I am a fine artist. I've been working in the medium of painting portraits on street signs for the past 17 years.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I recently had a piece of my work accepted into the permanent collection of the American Jazz Museum in Kansas City. I have been fortunate enough to show my work around the country as well as been in a bunch of publications with my work.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I've had gallery representation the past seven years in New York. But Denver is my home and I really enjoy sharing my work with the public through all spaces around town, like Dazzle Jazz or the Servery, or through murals like the one I painted at Metro State Center for the Visual Arts.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm also very excited to be providing the artwork for the green rooms at the new Levitt Pavilion and Ruby Hill, and I consider it a huge privilege and honor to be working on any creative projects in my neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'As an artist, I've appreciated the fact that Superfly reached out to me to ensure there is a connection between the local community showcased at the festival. This will provide an opportunity for the local artists to be connected with new audiences and to make the Denver Music Festival site reflect the amazing culture with the city has to offer'",
        "'speaker_8': '. I look forward to working with the festival organizers and local artists on the details of this exciting plan in the coming months. In addition to its commitment to the arts, this festival excites me as a resident of Ruby Hill.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Superfly has done a great job of reaching out to the neighborhood through extensive community outreach. They have been very responsive to the neighborhood concerns. But perhaps the most exciting aspect of the festival for me and my family is the community fund that will be financed by $1 of each ticket sold.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That's $800,000 for Overland Park in Ruby Hill over the proposed five years. That will make my neighborhood a better place. I thank you again for your time and urge you to vote yes on supporting the Superfly Festival.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Great. Thank you, Mr. Erickson. Okay, I. Okay. We're going to call the next five. I assume some of these people are not here. Bridget Walsh. David Warner. Okay. Daniel Lowenstein. David. David there. Okay. I guess her and Marilyn Barela.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. David Warner, your first.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Good evening, Mr. President. Fellow council members. I feel your pain. I am also a council member in another city and if I was giving this speech now, there'd be nobody here. I don't know how you guys do it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm not necessarily opposed to this, although for one, I think there are better venues. I think Ruby Hill might be better. It's at least 20 acres larger than the area and Golden Gate Park where the Outside Lands Festival is being held.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I also feel this is a subtle attempt. Maybe not right away, but an attempt to close overland down. There's been talk about this before. This could be a first step. I'm going to take a different approach. I'm not I'm not going to try to appeal to anybody's emotions or anything.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm going off what I read in the paper and what Superfly, his website, says. I'm a finance person. I have not read your contracts, so if I state something wrong, you'll have to correct me if we're going to sign a long term deal.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think it has to be done right. I don't know if any of you remember the Grand Prix in 89 and 90, Dummar was on the hook for about $1,000,000 and that contract was done right too. So. If I can make one comment.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'All I want to discuss is all I'm going to do right now is compare revenues from the San Francisco Festival to what we're going to get. In 2014. This is off their website. They generated for the San Francisco Parks and Rec District about two and a half million dollars for their event.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The attendance was around 200,000 people for the three days. That comes to $12.53 per person that went back to the rec district. This is based on all their figures, the 11% gross, all their different fees. What we are being offered is $9.89 per ticket.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This is based off an attendance of 120,000. Based on the same, I calculated $93 average ticket price. I think we need a better deal than that. This is also based on everything that there was in the paper, the rent, all the different funds going to the Enterprise Fund, the golfer discount the seat tax that are 10%.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The one thing that I think you guys are missing is I don't I guess you calculated the $200,000 rent as something that would supplant the lost revenues from over the golf course as the golf course, the driving range.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The restaurant, the pro shop. I think you. So you're not considering this loss of revenue and you're also not considering the fact that you're cleaning up 130 acres compared to 69. Golden Gate Park has minimal lost revenue, but we do what I recommend in the last 6 seconds is I think you're too low.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You need to read this contract. You need to add at least a 3% ticket fee to get back to the golf course and to give back to people in the neighborhood store.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's a time's up. Thank you. All right. Mr. Daniel Lowenstein.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hello.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, my father was probably best or very fondly remembered for doing the festival caravan program in the parks of Denver. He well, this was a really organic process where he worked with the neighborhoods and the shows that he developed were of buying for the community.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And he in the process of working with various neighborhoods to see if they'd like shows in the parks. Some neighbors in neighborhoods would opt for shows in the parks and some wouldn't. And he would respect that. And. My father, he considered the public parks public and saw these shows for free for everyone.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And this was in the seventies and eighties and. Well, he was never too fond or involved in things where the public areas were taken over for private use and. I feel that way too. I think that public land should be for the public and private.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Should should seek another venue and. That's what I say. All.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Lowenstein. David Richter.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Good evening, Mr. President. Council. Thanks for having us here tonight. My name is David Richter. I live at 252 Pennsylvania Street. I am Councilman Clark's representative on the Parks and Recreation Advisory Board. Crab has been updated pretty much every month, I would say maybe more often in and out of meetings since the promoter first brought this proposal'",
        "'speaker_5': 'to the city sometime, I guess last fall or late last summer, I'm not sure which as a body we haven't made any specific recommendations on this proposal. But as keeper of the minutes and I'm the secretary, I can tell you that the board has generally made some positive comments about what we have heard.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There have clearly have been some members of crab that have had some concerns about the usual issues related with a big festival like infrastructure, traffic, perhaps safety. I personally have attended a number of community buildings, meetings excuse me, and participated in the city survey.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Seen the results of that and the.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Metrics during the process. And it seems to me overall that the promoters intentions, aside from the contractual obligations, will mitigate pretty much all reasonable concerns. It won't be perfect. I think Happy Haynes alluded to that herself, but it Prabhu let me just leave you this thought.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Pretty much every month we're confronted with a common theme. It's How can we make a park more versatile? Accommodate new users. Activate a space in a unique. And purposeful way. I think this proposal is worth the effort. And I think it has tangible and intangible rewards for both the city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The golf community. And yes, believe it or not, I think.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Ultimately even the local neighborhood, plenty of.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Rector. All right, Merlin, Barilla.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Good evening. Thank you for having this courtesy hearing. My name is Marilyn Barella and I live at 1420 South Osage Street. I'm a native of Denver and have lived just across Florida next to Ruby Hill Park for 50 years.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We were told by David Erlich and John Clark that if the neighborhood did not want Superfly on Oberlin Golf course, then Superfly would find another venue. The majority votes of both the Oberlin neighborhood and mine are against Superfly on Overland.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Don't betray our trust. Find another venue for Superfly, as promised.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This contract is all speculation.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'A big guess about something that is not known. A risky business assumption. Upfront, taxpayers are supposed to pick up the tab for police, fire department and trash services. This is not what we were initially told. Again, this is speculated to be 200,000.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'A big guess. I contend it will far exceed that amount. Denver's man hours of time already spent on planning this proposal must have added up to be an enormous expense to the taxpayers of Denver. If approved, DEMARS Future man hours of planning costs will be even greater.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Shocking, I suspect, to the citizens of Denver. If you approve this contract, you are going to use taxpayers money in defiance of the vote against it. Super fly on overland is precedent setting. This contract needs to be held in the proper venue, not on Overland.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Don't stand behind David Erlich, whose only reason not to have it in the proper venue is because they don't want to be on concrete. Don't betray the golfing community, the neighborhoods, the environment, wildlife, and all the citizens of Denver.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Denver's government has lost its credibility. Ask any citizen of Denver or even Denver's employees about the collaborative process that Denver espouses. They will tell.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You it's a big joke.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Denver's government does not represent the citizens of Denver. There's hatred and division in the city of Denver that I've never seen before. Much of it caused by the proposals of different government. I'm here to ask you. To vote no to the super fly contract.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Stand up and protect Denver's priceless parkland and golf courses. Stand up for the citizens of Denver. Don't stand up for the private, corporate profit interests of Superfly. Restore your credibility and vote no to the Superfly contract. Remember, we already have 50 concerts each summer at the Lemon Pavilion.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Please have some consideration.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'For our neighborhoods. Keep Superfly off of opening. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Miss Perella. We are at an hour, and there are four more speakers. And if it's okay with the council, I'd like to keep it going. Dylan Clark is praying. Okay. Ronnie Crawford, please come to the front running.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Crawford, LeAnn Montoya, Jesse Helms Theater. That I get the right. And Margaret kiss. And actually, I didn't pause it when I was calling people. So you actually guys do have a little bit more time. Okay, um, Ron Crawford, you're up.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Howdy, Mr. President. Ladies and gentlemen of the Council, thank you for enduring all of this. It's late night. Everybody's tired. What I want to speak to is the Overland Park neighborhood run in Crawford, 2149 South Park Street, 17 year resident of Overland Park.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I am vice president of the Overland Park Neighborhood Association. I want to approach something a little different here that our neighborhood is called Rhizome. Everybody knows Rhino because they've got that rhinoceros logo and everybody knows that all that's going on up there will rise, though.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We're we're at the beginning. So for river south, the river is a main amenity of our neighborhood. We are the last neighborhood in Denver on the river. And it is such a great amenity. On July 2nd, I would a tube, tube and rafting trip down the South Platte.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We started at Mineral and got out at Grant Frontier 19 tubes. It's a great river. It's a great thing to see. And everything is different from the river. I work with a couple a couple of groups, Denver Trout Unlimited Project Healing Waters, which just gets veterans back to fishing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It is a great amenity. I would like to see this concert happen. I am for the concert. Absolutely for it. This will bring a lot of people to see one of Denver's overlooked and greatest amenities, which is the Denver South Platte.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'My colleagues at Denver Trout Unlimited call it from Chatfield to Commerce City. It's more than Denver, but the Platte starts way up in the mountains. So that's Denver. South Platte. It's a great thing. A lot of cities have their river walks and things located around their river.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I would like to see that happen. I think that if we get 30,000 people, 100,000 people to see that river that has been reconstructed, it is reconstructed in the river from Grant Frontier to almost to the Mississippi Bridge in water.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And our neighborhood is a city of parks with past canals, grant frontier, Overland Park, Pond Park. There's a lot to see there. The whole riparian area has been rebuilt. All of those parks are pretty, pretty brand new. Couple of years old and the river's looking good.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I finished last night at the bridge at Grant Frontier Court. A 16 inch rainbow and an 18 inch rainbow. The fish are in there. I want to make that river a place where people come. It's a destination because it's a wonderful place that's right in our city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I want our our visitors for the concert to come down there. I'm not talking about drunk college students. There will be game wardens, river rangers, everybody watching all that. I want people to see the beauty of our river and the beauty of our neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mr. Crawford. Thank you. River South. All right. You heard it here. Heard it first. Here. All right. Leon Montoya. 3 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hi. My name's my name's LeAnn Montoya, and I live at 700 West Asbury. I had I bought my house 32 years ago, and I raised six kids and nine grandchildren in that home. And my kids have gone up and down that neighborhood, know everybody there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They've gone to the park, down to the weed. Every night we do our nightly walk on the golf course, so there are uses for it. If people really want to go out there and see what uses there are, besides put a music festival in there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'One of the reasons why I'm against the music festival is because we are a four by two block area. That's all it is. And if you're going to have 60 to 80000 people in that neighborhood and say they're going to come in on the Florida side, they're still going to overflow into our side, they're going to overflow'",
        "'speaker_3': 'into the park and they're going to overflow into the river. We already have squatters. There are already up and down the Platte, which from what I heard, is illegal, but they still all out there living out there. And the crime rate has gone up because of that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Most recently, we had an incident where I couldn't even go into my neighborhood, a four by two block area with three entrances I couldn't get in. The police kept it blocked off because they were searching for someone that ran away from the cops.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This was like a week ago. So that just a little bit of the crime you start bringing in, all these people in here don't think they're just going to be there for three days. If you've got people coming in from all over the country to see this music festival, they're going to be sitting up in an up'",
        "'speaker_3': 'along the river and up on Ruby Hill and all around the neighborhood for at least a week before. And so it's going to cause a lot of problems. There's going to be people disrespecting our property. There's people that we don't know going in and out of our neighborhood that you keep promising that they're not going to come'",
        "'speaker_3': 'in. I don't understand how you think they're going to come over that bridge, that rickety bridge over Santa Fe and and not come through our neighborhood, not come through our streets to get to the golf course. I don't know how else you guys are planning or they're planning to bring them through if they're coming through Florida.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think also one of the same things, too, is that a lot of people are against it, just besides us. The people that matter are us, people in that four by two neighborhood, because we're the ones we're going to have the direct effect from it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Not anybody else. Not any of you guys. Not any of.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You guys, only us people that live in that four by two block area are going to feel the direct affect for three days with music pounding and people walking, even them, even though the people there, 60 to 80000 is going to make more noise than the people, than the music.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And it's going to be really rough on us. And who's going to take care of any property damage? Is that in the contract? You're going to take care of property damage for us? I'd like to see that. And I am totally against this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Montoya. All right, Jesse Homesteader.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. Good evening, President Burks and the members of Denver City Council. My name is J.C. Homesteader. I own both residential and commercial property in the Overland neighborhood. Currently, I'm serving my second term as the president of the local maintenance district on Broadway as well.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm one of the board members that should be in a hopefully very soon time be bringing to this board a potential business improvement district petition. So I'm speaking firsthand for the businesses, and I want to say that the business owners along Broadway haven't done all the research to know all the numbers.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'However, there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Are very eager.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We have met with David Erlich and Liz Adams and have engaged in what the businesses believe is going to be very beneficial for them.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'For example.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The local businesses are able to have a presentation at the concerts, which means you can go to the beer tent and get a local brew from Declaration Brewing, which is located on South Delaware, or go to the food tent and get some delicious chicken from post chicken.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I believe the Super Superfly is very invested in our community. It's our ideals and our ideals because they want to showcase the amazing culture that we have in our neighborhood. The businesses in Overland area are a diverse and unique bunch, but they're united in support of this festival.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And I'm really hungry for some chicken, so thanks for that for mentioning that. All right. Um, last but not least, Margaret Rundle.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Somebody left the glasses. Anyway, my name is Margaret Brown Dix. I live in West Platte Park. I'm at 1625 South Downing Street. I imagine a lot of concert goers will be walking from Pearl Street and down on down to the concert.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This is a big deal. It's been promoted for a long time. The first time I heard about it was through my grandson. He's 17. He's a golfer. And he talked to me about it and I said, What do you think?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And he said, Well, I don't like it, but I think it's a done deal. And I said, Really, we're, you know, this is zero way. No, no, no. I think that we have some voice in this matter. He said.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I don't think so. I said, Why not? He said, Well, I've heard a lot of talk at Overland. And I said, I see. He has a coach when he can afford him at Overland. He works at Overland. He's worked at Wiltshire at 17 as an East High School student.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'He has qualified on his own. Freshman, sophomore, junior year. He hasn't done it yet for his senior year because he's just going into his senior year for state competitions and done very well. His team didn't qualify. He was the only one who did.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'He's a very avid golfer. He's been all over the state. He's been on every municipal course in the city and in the state. He plays golf all the time. He dresses well, he speaks well. He has learned a lot about greeting people, meeting people.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And he's learned he's learned how to handle himself. He's straight. He doesn't drink. He doesn't smoke. He doesn't use drugs. He's kind of a quiet guy. And he aspires to be on a college golf team. His mother promotes his golf.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'She's a single parent and she gets him to tournaments way over her budget. But she does. He's going to play in an international tournament at the end of the summer. He's disappointed in this. You bet. I followed him for 11 years on all these courses.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I've watched him play. I've learned a lot about golf. I'm not a golfer. I've watched kids, girls, boys all throughout the state playing golf. People say it's dad. It's not. It's elitist is it's not. I'll tell you one thing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Municipal courts courses give opportunity to boys like him, kids that don't have it otherwise. First tee of Colorado sent him to Pebble Beach to play with the Walrus. I have no more time, but I'm telling you, it's special.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So support it. It's a golf course. It's not a music venue.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Hendrix. I want to say thank you to everyone who stayed this late in and got in here. I want to I implore you to stay for the questioning. And if if you do have to leave, that you'd go back and watch this portion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I want to remind members of counsel we will not be doing comments this week because we've extended it to next week. We'll just be going through the question portion. Councilman Cashman.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mr. President. And thanks to all the overwhelming folks on both sides of the issue stuck around. David, if you don't mind. A few questions quick. What what will the ticket cost be for this event?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I'll defer to Rick generally.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'They'll be a one day ticket and a three day ticket.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And there's also contractually a provision for a materially discounted ticket for the community. Right. In terms of the actual ticket price, I believe that hasn't been set yet. It hasn't been set yet, but likely is going to go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm sorry for the three way tickets. Somewhere in the 250 to 325 ish range, there'll be tiered. So the earlier you buy them, the cheaper they'll be. Right. And then there'll be a single day ticket somewhere in the 85 to 95 range.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Really? So considerably cheaper than outside lands. Is that what you're. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. Certainly. You know, the outside lands ticket price has matured as the festival has matured.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so with the same thing, probably if you have a festival at Overland, if it's.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Successful and there's demand, that's likely.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. Is being presented as a. Of a family friendly event and my experiences with these festivals, you get got to be a fairly well-to-do family to take a couple of kids to the show. But thank you.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We will likely have a free for for ten and under ten tonight. Yeah. It's typically with events like this nationally, it's, you know, typically what the pricing is. So because likely we would do something similar here.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Because outside is two and under, right.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Outside lands. Outside lands is different.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. If Denver gets a long debated festival park at some point, is there any room in the contract for consideration of it moving? I know you have a lot of upfront costs in doing a festival like this.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Certainly always would be open minded to what makes sense for the community and what makes sense if there's a suitable site at some point. We'd love to take a look at it too.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'As far as Outside Lands goes, how? I'm not familiar with where it is in the park in San Francisco. So how far is it, say, from the main stage to the nearest homes? Is it similar as to what?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You got it over? I would say. Maybe. 100 yards.'",
        "'speaker_12': '200 yards, something like that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So similar to what you had? Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yeah. There's a on both edges of the space that we use in Golden Gate Park and we use a rather large space. There is a, there are, you know, four lane roads basically on either side. And so it's right across those roads.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But yes, at probably the nearest spot, something like that, a couple of hundred yards.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Is there a mac? I mean, I've heard 30 to 40000 the first year, maybe building up to 80,000. Have you looked at that site? And I mean, I'm guessing if you end up doing a show there, it's going to be very successful from an attendance standpoint.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Do you have a maximum in mind? How high could it go?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I believe the maximum by the contract is 80,000.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Is that going to get you? Thank you. And the last thing is, I've kind of gotten lost in the numbers. How much net maybe, Fred, this would be for you. How much will Denver net out of a successful.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Event.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Fred Wise, director of finance for Parks and Rec. It obviously depends on the tickets. Of course, tickets are old, but I didn't bring my glasses, so it's between about a million and a half to two and a half million dollars.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. Is the range depending on the ticket sales.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. Thank you. That's all I've got, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilman Cashman. Councilman Espinosa. How much would the full parking and transit plan that you're going to do cost you to do right now?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We have a lot of expertize in the house, so we don't really track that as a cost. But our outside consultant that we'd be bringing in anywhere from 25 to $50000 is just a guess. As I said, we have a lot of experience with our internal team of how to devise these plans, and so we'll supplement that'",
        "'speaker_8': 'with a transportation and traffic engineer.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. What's the difference between the crowd has it? You know, if you've got the full 80,000. How long would that take for people to sort of go from 0 to 80? And then when? How like so how fast is that sort of build up?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then how fast is the. What's the window for exit.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yeah. So we layer the programing to make sure that there's a gradual ingress and gradual egress. So it usually happens over a 2 to 3 hour period that you have people coming in and usually about a two hour period people leaving.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You know, it's never that you have the full amount of ticket buyers there at any one given time. People come and go. And so, you know, we feel like we have really good experience in how to layer the programing to enable that kind of flow.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Do you know what the capacity is for an RTD light rail car per car?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yeah, I don't personally.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's 125 people. We have we have a member of council that used to be on our team. Yeah. Kevin, what's the capacity?'",
        "'speaker_11': '64 seating a total of 125 at what we call Crush Load.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, no. So actually.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I would wait. I would wait for the next train.'",
        "'speaker_0': '125 is standing. What is crush load?'",
        "'speaker_11': '125. That's 64 seated and the rest standing. Okay. So four card train would have 500.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So you might have to bet cleanup on this one as well. Well, not on this one, but the follow up. What? So do you know what the stadium of the capacity is of mile high? The seating capacity there, the mile high stadium.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yeah. I don't.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Personally know.'",
        "'speaker_0': '77. So I'm going to think about 76,000. Exactly. Councilman Brooks wins that one in then. Do you know what percentage is of that seating capacity that takes the Broncos?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Right. I'm not.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Anyone want to venture a guess on what the percentages just tell us because I kind of get that offline. It is between ten and 14%. So thank you. I'm asking those questions because and you know. Well, you guys are in the sort of I won't go into comment, but.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, my concerns at committee.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Were large, were.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Overwhelmingly mildly addressed. I heard some things tonight that give me a lot of pause again. And in you know, you've always heard my concerns about traffic and transit and stuff like that. And more and more sort of sitting here going, how does this how does this work?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And if it's really 25 to $50000 to sort of figure this one out or in the in the ballpark, which I think is sort of due diligence sort of costs. I think it's important that that that I see that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So just. Thank you. All right. Thank you, Councilman Espinosa. Councilman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thanks. My first question is about the hotline. I'm not sure who would address that, but what I want to know is who will manage it and will the responses be in real time? Will there be a live person answering the phones?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And if there are, you know, real issues that need to be addressed? How is that being handled?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So there will be.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'A 24 hour.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Manned hotline both for the. Originally it was for the festival three days. And in the.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Course of the public.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Discussions over several.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Weeks, we added for the build up and build out period as well.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So how many days in total?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So while the total rental period is five weeks, so the response time I think is a half an hour by contract. So we have to have a response within a half an hour during this concert and within an hour, I believe in the end, the beginning and the end and will be manned by a person all the'",
        "'speaker_8': 'time and that's by contract. So that's something that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'If so, that's four, five weeks during set up the event itself and then takedown it'll.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Run the whole time.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Will there be any fireworks as part of the event at all?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think it's not you know, it's not anticipated at this point. And I think, you know, when we put together the programing slate, we'll work with the city on that and both our security plan. But that's not anticipated currently.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. The reason I'm asking is because, you know, in the past, when Barry Fey used to do concerts that had fireworks at the end at Mile High Stadium, he would actually pay the cost of having the animal control people come out because people's dogs would, you know, jump through fences.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I mean, they were just roaming the neighborhood and they would help pick them up and try to get them connected back. And there was a hotline where they could connect people to it and whatnot. Is that something you all have talked about with the neighborhoods?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Is that something you're willing to do?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, I think.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The the you know, the issue is, Rick said, is there's a.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Series of acts that go and the final act has to end by 10:00. And there's no intention to keep people on the on the event space any longer than that. So I think it's unlikely we would do anything like that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But now we've talked to we can't move forward without the security plan, the ingress you guys plan. All of those plans will anticipate that issue. And we can't move forward with the festival unless those plans are approved by well.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I would suspect that to a large degree it would restrict part of your seating area and all of that because you have to sectioned off an entire area and, you know, if it's drier. You know, as as we've had hotter days, you know, the likelihood for a fire or something I think are real.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so I would I would advise against it. So I just wanted to ask about that. I want to ask the city attorney what the if if there are penalties built into the contract for cancelation, if things just totally go awry and we decide that we don't want to continue it into the future.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I know when we did the Grand Prix, you know, the anticipation was we would do it for the fall. I think it was three years, but I think we ended up only doing it for one or two of the four years of that time frame.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So are there penalties for us not continuing to move forward for the full five years of this?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Proposed contract defender of his city attorney's office. We have provisions, a default.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Clause in the contract that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Requires us to give notice and a right to cure of any defaults that have occurred. The city would have the right to terminate the contract for a substantial breach, so we would have to document that and they would have to give them the right to cure it to see if we could resolve the issue.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And if if so, the right to cure that assumes that the next year they're going to cure the problems that happened this year or they have to cure them. Day one before day two and day three continue. Help me understand what that means.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Obviously, it would depend on the type of breach that we were talking about.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. All right. So. I think I don't have any other questions right at this point. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilman Ortega. Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I remember the Denver Grand Prix. Councilwoman, you were on the council at the time. They had a five year contract, and after the first year, they expected to lose about a half million. They lost 5 million and they wanted out the next year and they went bankrupt after the second.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I just want to mention that I think Bill Daniels took it upon himself to write a check to cover all those losses and God bless them. This kind of reminds me of that. It in the presentation to the committee that I saw after I was out that week, but I went back and looked at it.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Either happy or Fred can address this. $200,000 is what will be paid to us for each year's rent of the golf course. Is that right?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, that's correct.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'As well. Yes. Okay. I just want to wait to get to the mic. Okay. But then it says that we will waive we will credit them with $200,000. That's correct. So are they getting it for zero? Well, there's many other revenue streams coming to the city.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. Obviously, the 10% tax. Right. There's $2 per ticket. There's $90,000 for a landscape position at Overland. Right. So, you know, it's a we looked at it and the promoters looked at it as a package. Okay. And so.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And the $200,000 of waived expenses is part. So if we're going to credit them with $200,000, why are we charging them $200,000? Are they going to give us a check? And we just do one $2,000 goes to golf.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And since it's an enterprise fund, there's the issue of splitting money. So it's $200,000 going to golf. Now, the the Denver, the DRC, the revised municipal code, requires that anybody who has an event in a city park that will have more than 25 participants, and I assume you will have at least that many the concessionaire is required'",
        "'speaker_11': 'to deposit with the city the full cost of what we expect to be any city expenditures for that permitted event. Do you have an estimate of what the city. First of all, I question whether if we credit them with it, whether we're actually abiding by the code.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But do we have an estimate of what we think we will have to spend? To support city services to this event. How much will that cost? I imagine it could be more than $200,000. Anything that's in addition to that $200,000 will be paid by the promoter.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Do we know what that is? I don't anticipate there to be very much more. Most of it's for with outside contracts. Okay. So in there, they've committed to reimbursing our expenses in terms of rangers, golf, maintenance staff. So whatever we need to support and monitor them, they will reimburse.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'When will we know that? Because according to the code, the city code says that you can't give them the permit or happy can't give them the permit until they've deposited that in advance. Is that. Yeah. This is my contract.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I mean, I would defer to the city attorney's office. Okay. The DMC that you're referencing, I'm not familiar with. Okay. And I believe the terms of the contract supersede the city code. I hope not.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I don't know if that's the right for it. Okay. Contract terms.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Now, Councilman, I have to take a look at the provision.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It's 39, dash 73.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. We'll take a look at that.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'All right, Mr. Pratt, that's all I have for now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Great. Thank you. Councilman Flynn. Councilman Espinosa. You are backup. Is there any. And forgive me for not looking at this. Is there any provision for neighborhood cleanup after afterwards? And does it. How far does that extend?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So yes, the contract has provisions for overnight cleanup during the festival and at the end the actual dimensions of that area have yet to be determined. But we will determine that for for the for the promoters, we will define that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Area as somebody who lives next to the stadium. What you get a lot is is, is people leaving the stadium and either just dumping the things out of their car and leaving on the street or people picking, getting Uber.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You know.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Overrides and stuff like that in the neighborhood and again, just leaving whatever they don't want to.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Pack with them. So, yes, so that is a requirement. Multiple sweeps through the neighborhood overnight is part of the contract.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then I don't know if this is happy or the city attorney, but can somebody obtain a First Amendment permit to do something like the Women's March in Overland Golf Course?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So in terms of getting General Assembly a right to assemble Kermit inside of in the parks, the forms that we usually have for First Amendment protected activity, it would be what are called traditional public forums, usually in a park or within a street.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we have, through park rules, designated what those areas are that are amenable to having First Amendment activity.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. That's going to lead to other questions, but I'll bring them offline. Thanks, I think. Sorry. Thank you, Councilman Espinosa. Couple of questions and then I'll leave it to Councilman Clark to close us out. So we had one of the speakers kind of get into the parks policy happy.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so just want to. Is this a this is this a designated park?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I'm sorry. Say that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is this a designated park?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Yes. It's a it's a part of our designated park system. It's a golf golf course, part of our golf enterprise.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And is this you know, I deal with the admission based event policy question in a second, but we're this the Enterprise Fund, we're generating revenue. And are there other private events that are on this golf course? Well.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I mean, in addition to the golf enterprise itself, it is a it is a fee based operation. All of our golf courses are fee based operations. They're open to the public, but they are fee based operations.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, but we've. But my question is, I think this came up by one of the speakers. Have we had other private events on that golf course that were other than golf related?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I, I don't believe we have on Overland, but I.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Think that our.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Director of golf is here and he could speak to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'This is Scott Lake, who's director of golf.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Scott was shaking his head back there. But we're going to make you come to with golf.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yeah, we do have private golf tournaments. Several of them.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Do you have any private parties at all?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We do have private.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Parties in the clubhouse, yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, great. And then one more question. Happy the emission based event. I think we all remember that conversation. How does this how does that policy affect this particular golf course?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So the admission based events policy addresses our parks. The golf courses are under the auspices of our golf enterprise. So they are a little bit different. That's one of the reasons why we approach this whole effort through means of a contract.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mm hmm. Okay. Thank you. And we add to the cost of the ticket. And thank you, Councilman Cashman, for doing that, Councilman Clark.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I don't have any questions, in part because I think the entire team from the city side, from the Superfly side for being you know, I've been asking questions for months and months and months. And I appreciate you making yourselves available to me at weird hours with requests from constituents and getting back to me'",
        "'speaker_6': 'in a very timely manner. On all of that, I just wanted to take a second to thank all of you for all of your hard work on this getting us to here. I wanted to thank all my colleagues for letting everybody speak, to give you an idea of just how local Denver politics can be if we had'",
        "'speaker_6': 'cut it at an hour. We have been cutting parents and grandparents of both one of my daughters best friends at school and someone I went to high school with. And so I appreciate you letting every single person speak their mind and their peace and their opinion.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And most of all, I want to thank all of you who came out here and sat through a very long night and stuck with it and who have been so passionate on both sides of this. This is the community dialog that makes us better as a community and as a city.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And at the end of the day, no matter what happens here, your voice is so important to that process and your passion and your thoughts and your ideas and the things that you think of that nobody else did and you bring to the table.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so I just wanted to thank everyone for being here and sticking it out. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Clark, I'm going to ask you one quick question before we close. There are about five, six, maybe seven people who kept saying this is a done deal. And so as someone who has been on the ground working on this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'How would you respond to that?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah. Thank you. And that's something that's really hard for me to hear, because I don't feel like this has been a done deal at any point, including next week, when this vote is going through to to say yes or no.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think that it's hard sometimes when we're facing a tough decision and you feel like maybe there are more people on one side than your side or you feel things should be done a certain way. I think to see that and as I shared in committee, there's no set policy for when someone comes and says, can we'",
        "'speaker_6': 'do this on a golf course? We don't have a set thing like we do with rezonings. And so some people thought that we should do it one way. And I navigated that the best that I could, the best that I know how.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so, you know, I think that. Absolutely. At no point have I certainly thought that this was a done deal. So I don't know who they're getting that from or where they got that from. This was a, you know, important process and certainly not going to stand here and say that it was a perfect process or that'",
        "'speaker_6': 'everyone is going to get what they want at the end of the day, because at the end of the day, we we got to vote yes or no. Not everybody wins. But I think and I think we heard it from a lot of other people about the process being robust and could have been more robust.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But I don't know where that came from. And it does make me sad because I do think that I've spent a lot of time listening and everybody involved with this has spent a lot of time listening. And I think that's really important.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I know that it can be frustrating to get to a point and think or be afraid that you're not going to get what you want to do, but that's different than it actually being a done deal. So I don't know if that answers your question.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It does. Last quick question from when you first heard about this proposal until today, how long has that been?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'A long time. I don't remember when I first the meeting that we had when you guys called me in and said. Okay. About a year.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So. So it's been a year process.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And don't quote me on that. I would have to double check when exactly that was. But.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. The public hearing for 6087 is now closed. We will have comments next week on Monday, July 31st. We will conclude by doing a final vote. And I want to thank the city council members who've been here since 230.'"
