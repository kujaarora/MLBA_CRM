        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you so much. Mr. President, I've had conversations with many of my colleagues and heard from more of the community since our last public hearing. So a couple of you and a couple of the community had asked me to provide some updates just on this bill.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So one wanted to do that. First of all, we had some questions for the Denver Housing Authority last week, and they got back to us with the question of how many vouchers get expired after the 60 day period because they're, for whatever reason, unable to find housing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And their answer was about 308 of the 1371 issuances they've had were expired. So that's about 22%. Remember, if you add that to the 12% of folks that are leaving Denver with their voucher, it's looking like, you know, we've got about 34%, if I'm doing my math right, folks who are struggling to find housing in Denver with'",
        "'speaker_1': 'vouchers. So I think that's an important fact. Many of you wanted more data. And I just wanted to say for a minute a little bit about the relationship between the city and DOJ, because I think there might have been some confusion about this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Denver Housing Authority did not propose this bill. They didn't come to me and suggest we run it. This really came from the community. It came from best practices. They are a quasi governmental organization. They are separate legally from the city.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so we don't govern how they administer their programs. And in fact, in many cases, we can't govern how they run their programs because they are subject to federal rules provided by the Housing and Urban Development. So, for example, the number of days that folks have to search for housing is a standard established by HUD.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So there are many ways that we might, you know, use our our collective energies to provide assistance to DHS. For example, we already have a meeting scheduled. I described this last week, but we're working on a meeting where we might say to them, is there something our pique team or our technology team might be able to do'",
        "'speaker_1': 'in order to help you track data, for example, and on what the time period is between getting an approval for a voucher and then when someone or applying a unit applying to be approved for a voucher and then the move in date.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we will see what we can offer as a as a partner. But we can't legislate the way that they do business, both because of HUD and because of their separate legal authority. And I just in part, you know, data is one of these things.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'No one has ever asked them for this data in this way before. And so I know that there's frustration, but I also just I feel a little sensitive to folks holding them accountable for something we've never before asked them for and being mad that they don't have it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I'm just putting that out there so that folks really understand what the relationship is. The second update I wanted to provide, we heard from a number of landlords last week and, you know, many of them shared some of their concerns with the program over the weekend.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I know many of us got at least one or two emails from landlords who had different experiences, who reported their on time payments and the fact that they have a lot of success renting with vouchers. And I also, when I was out at my Denver days events mostly in northeast Denver this weekend, I heard from a couple'",
        "'speaker_1': 'of landlords who pulled me aside and said, you know, that they were very supportive. So just wanted and wanted me to share that, that there were these varieties of opinions. Lastly, regardless of whether or not we have total agreement in our community about whether or not people can stay in business and rent units using all of these'",
        "'speaker_1': 'sources of income, it's clear that we do have questions about a second line of defense in the case that maybe a security deposit doesn't cover all the damage I committed in the beginning to the landlords and the associations that I met with that I would do the serious research into what these funds that provide a little extra'",
        "'speaker_1': 'assurance looked like and what the best practices were. I don't believe in stopping it, just looking at how much money people put into the fund or what they're named. I went the next step and my staff, Paul Kyle, went and talked to them about how many claims they actually had and whether they were effective and whether they'",
        "'speaker_1': 'were working. And so that research got done last Monday and it shows that the funds are not heavily needed. But as we discussed, they may be very important for the individuals who make the claims. So we did share that research with the mayor's office and the departments.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They've had a minute to talk about it and I just wanted to see if Skye Stewart wanted to provide a brief update on where the administration is that I know some folks would have wanted us to legislate a fund here at the dais tonight for charter reasons.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We don't appropriate money in bills like this in the middle of the year. We can only do that through the budget. But I took seriously my commitment to work on this. I have followed up on it every day.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And and I'm really pleased that the administration has similarly taken time to to look and review the research. Sure. Skye Stewart, mayor's office, as councilwoman, said, she provided the research she has done to our office. And the mayor had a chance to take a look at that and has.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Now directed our housing team to look into what a fund might look like in terms of parameters for its use size, the oversight where that funding might come from. So our team is starting to do that research and anticipate coming back with some thoughts on how that might work, but definitely open to moving forward with an idea'",
        "'speaker_1': 'like that. So I want to thank the administration for for their willingness to keep working on this. And with that, I would like to encourage my colleagues to support this ordinance tonight. I think the evidence is clear that we have folks who cannot use the housing assistance they need in our city.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have survey two separate survey data is demonstrating that there is a need, that people are being turned away from these sources of income. We heard testimony from folks who are experiencing this. And because this is something that we have the ability to deter, I believe it is our obligation to help to meet more of the housing'",
        "'speaker_1': 'needs of our residents who are struggling. So with that, I urge a yes vote tonight. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Gage. Councilwoman Black.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I am going to support this. I even though I'm voting differently than Councilman Flynn, I agreed with all of your comments. Councilman Flynn, however, I am voting for it. I do have some concerns. We've all heard from a lot of landlords, particularly concerned about some small scale landlords.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And with as with any law that we pass, there's always the risk of unintended consequences. So I want us to monitor this. We talked last week about in a year from now getting a report with feedback from tenants, from Denver Housing Authority, from landlords and the apartment association.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I think that will be really important to evaluate how it's gone. A couple of the things I would want to look out for is that. Is there any sort of additional financial burden on smaller scale landlords that would force them to increase their rents or even sell their investments?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I talked to some people and they were here last week who actually owned some rentals in some hot neighborhoods and. If it's too much of a burden for them, then they might end up selling and we are going to get some housing that's not affordable.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So those are the kinds of things I'm concerned about. That said, I am supporting it and thank you for doing all that hard work, Councilwoman.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Black Councilman. Thank you, Mr. President. Just to clarify with the council we klipsch, it's my understanding that the bill really just knows no guarantee to Section eight applicants for housing. It just it gives all the income for section eight candidate be treated equally so that they're an equal basis with all other applicants for available'",
        "'speaker_0': 'housing so that a landlord for legitimate business reasons can choose whoever he was among the applicants available. We hope that this will help, you know, Section eight to help us find more housing. But the main thing, it doesn't deter the rights and privileges of the landlord to select any applicant that he wants or a legitimate business reason'",
        "'speaker_0': '. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That is correct. Councilman, I think the simplest way to describe this is it is an equal opportunity. It is not a guaranteed outcome. So everyone has the opportunity to seek housing, but it doesn't guarantee the outcome. I know there was a claim made.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You know that if you only had one applicant, you have no choice but to accept them. That's simply not what the law states. The law states that you can't turn someone away for a discriminatory reason. If you have a legitimate business reason and you're screening your tenants.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That would all be investigated. And nothing in the law says that, you know, if you're down to one, you have to you have to rent it. It's all about the reasoning and what the legitimate business purposes are. So this is not about guaranteeing who you rent to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's just ensuring that everyone has an opportunity.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Councilman. New Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I also want to indicate my support for the bill tonight. I believe that the work that has taken place looking into the fund is very important. I support that and appreciate the work the administration has done in directing our Office of Economic Development to identify resources and parameters for how a program would work'",
        "'speaker_4': '. I heard loud and clear the information that perhaps in other cities the funds are being highly utilized. But I think to operate in good faith with our apartment owners, property owners that may experience damages to their property that are in excess of the deposits that we should have a fund available.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Obviously, if it's not being utilized, we could look at how to redirect those dollars. But I think having that in place is is very important. I appreciate the work that's been done by Councilwoman McKinney, the Colorado Apartment Association or apartment association and Metro Denver, I think is it's more properly known, DHS, for for your role in this'",
        "'speaker_4': 'process as well and appreciate the the briefing that you gave us around the process and how you all have worked to try to share that up and make it more timely in terms of approving people and and getting the money out the door to the landlords.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think this is critically important as one of the many steps that we're taking to try to address housing affordability for people in this city who are struggling. I know that oftentimes it will take somebody several years to finally get approved for that DACA voucher.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And they're so excited because they've been waiting for this for years. And then they take it and they go to different places. And if they can't get into housing, that's a problem. So this should help to some degree in solving part of that problem.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Again, it doesn't guarantee anybody anything, but it's again, one more tool in the toolbox that says if you were the only applicant and you were not considered for that housing, then you have a claim. You can you can file a discrimination claim.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But, you know, I think we have a collaborative environment in this city where we have worked to. Find a way to close the gaps with so many of the different programs that we have seen brought forward. And this one, I think is going to help tremendously so that one can each thank you for your work on this'",
        "'speaker_0': '. Thank you, Councilman Ortega. Councilwoman Sussman.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I, too, appreciate very much the work that Councilman Kennish has done on this, particularly to help everybody find suitable living expenses. I've just sort of feeling the way that Councilman Flynn does that I'm not sure that the initiative is fully baked yet.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We had an amendment just last week. We have suggestions that there be a fund for damage deposits that don't cover damage, although I think that's of great concern since it is the renter that pays the damage deposit. And how would we choose this kind of renter to help the landlord with but not another kind of renter to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'help the landlord with? We learned that it looked like it might not be possible to pre-qualify landlords so that they might be eligible for taking vouchers and maybe there would be a way to pre-qualify them so they wouldn't have to wait that even the two weeks or sometimes the month.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I just feel like there's lots of things that can be fixed with this. And I hear what Councilman Kennish has said, that we could work on fixing it, but it reminds me of some of the initiatives we've had that that do pass.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then we have to go in and make sure that they'll work with what the city can do and what it can't do. I would very much like to support the concept. I believe in, you know, having complete equality on being able being able to rent a place.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I'm not sure we've got all the. I's dotted and the t's crossed in this one, so I won't be supporting it tonight though I am very much in support of the concept and look forward to perhaps improving it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Sussman. Councilman Cashman. Thank you, Mr. President. I i office next to councilman. Can I sit next to the councilwoman on the dais? And I work with her and councilman new in the Homeless Housing and Homelessness Working Group.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I believe this bill, whether it's fully baked, I believe it's sufficiently baked. And I'm certain that the.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Need.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is is fully baked. And we have people in need of housing that are being discriminated against because of source of income that I don't believe is appropriate. I very much hope that that our landlords will hang with us as we iron out the remaining details.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You know, at the end of last week's meeting, I stood.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Here for for.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Quite a while after the meeting with three landlords, relatively small scale landlords, who said, we don't care about the fund we have insurance for for excessive damages. Now, I know it's not that simple for everybody, so I'm glad the administration continues to to look at what is appropriate.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And my guess is we'll get there. I know that Mr. Guerrero and the DEA are committed to doing everything that they can do to become as efficient as possible in the administration of their functions. So, you know, like I say, the need is is so obvious.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And, you know, we. We looked at a program recently, the live program where we're assisting our apartment owners with subsidies of some vacant apartments to help people find places to live that they can afford. So I hope that that partnership can move further along in this particular case.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I'm very pleased to support this tonight and committed to with my colleague to continuing to iron out what needs to get ironed out. Thank you very much. Thank you. Councilman Cashman. Councilman Lopez.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you, Mr. President, I. In this in this environment. I think I think to myself and and this environment that that we are in in Denver, in the challenges that we're facing with the lack of affordability in the housing crisis that we have here amidst a booming economy.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I don't know how I could not support this in an environment where discrimination is rampant again. I don't know how I would not be able to stand up for this. We have to stand up for this. This is an easy step.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Um. In a much more complex issue of vouchers and modern vouchers, the modern voucher program, the modern landlord tenant program or environment that's out there, that's not what this bill is set to to fix. This is a bill isn't a comprehensive housing plan bill.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'This is. Making sure that no matter the source of income, if their rent can be paid, you shouldn't be able to discriminate against her. I do not like the stigma. I do not like the characterization. I don't like the the stereotyping of so many folks who are who have lived in Denver, have always lived in Denver, have'",

It's a it's it's something that we can implement in Denver. And it's it's it's a step in the right direction, a very important step.'",

General, I just wanted to mention to the in addition to what Councilwoman Soares was talking about with the HUD regulations. I just want to voice input put on the record from the committee.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We really think there really needs to be a meeting with HUD and bring them down here to talk about some of these issues of making improvements. I'm especially concerned by where the 60 day expiration of a voucher says 22% of all the people who have approved vouchers have expired after 60 days.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And it may be in this tight housing market is very hard to find a suitable housing in 60 days. So I really think they'd appreciate if you could express that to the HUD officials. And somehow we need we've done doing our job, trying to help.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'So it's not a question of if people aren't finding housing, it's because all of our vouchers are being used. And I'm reminded also that in the update we got today, that of the vouchers that have expired, we don't know the reason why they were expired.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Mr. Guerrero told me before the meeting that it could be because of family situation or finding other suitable accommodations or some other such reason that that the vouchers have expired. But the fact that all of the vouchers that we're authorizing can fund are being utilized tells me that we do have some time before January 1st to to'",
        "'speaker_8': 'think this through and to come up with a mitigation and to work with those for whom this actually may be working a harm. Otherwise, it's entirely a good idea, and I support it completely. And if it were if it were balanced on both sides, I would gladly vote yes tonight, and I would gladly vote yes before January'",

All have been notified several times through this process. We've not received any official public comment from Arnaud's. We did receive one appraisal document with a short email introduction from a neighbor and it has been included in the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'staff report. As you're aware, to adopt a rezoning, the Council must find that these five criteria in the Denver zoning code are met. With regard to the first consistency with adopted plans, this property is affected by two plans the comprehensive plan and Blueprint Denver.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This proposed rezoning would further several comprehensive plan policies aimed at incentivizing the preservation of historic structures and landmarks in the city. The blueprint future land use proposed for the site is single family residential and it is an area of stability which, according to Blueprint, includes most of the city's residential neighborhoods and their associated commercial areas.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And the goal for areas of stability are to identify and maintain the area, the character of these areas, while accommodating some new development and redevelopment. The waiver request in this case, staff feels, is justified because it would allow for the use of property that is just slightly smaller than what had been originally intended by the YOU oh'",
        "'speaker_3': 'three overlay. And Historic Preservation staff have noted that there are other structures around the city where perhaps adjusting this threshold may be appropriate and it is intended to be addressed on a larger scale in a future text amendment to the zoning code.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'With regard to the other criteria, this request will result in the uniform application of the CFA zone districts, building form, use and design regulations and the regulations of the historic structure use overlay. It will improve the will the general welfare of the community by facilitating the rehab and preservation of a historic structure while respecting the existing suburban'",
        "'speaker_3': 'development in the area. And staff agrees with the proposed justifying circumstance that it's in the public interest to apply an overlay here to allow for the rehabilitation and adaptive use of a unique historic structure that has been in nonresidential use for for many years.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then finally, this will this proposed rezoning will result in the establishment of the appropriate suburban neighborhood context, which is appropriate in this area for the single and multi-unit, residential and other and commercial use types found in this area and the pattern of suburban houses on larger lots.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'I, I don't believe it actually matters because if the if even if the you oh three overlay were applied and for some reason the landmarking was not adopted, the, the other three would not apply unless the landmarking had been accomplished as well.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. And the you oh three overlay can only be applicable to residential properties to residential zones. Is that true?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I believe so. It's it's typically aimed at older residential properties. It was it was originally used to replace the R four zone from the from former Chapter 59. And it was applied around kind of around Cap Hill and places like that where there were kind of older mansions and other big buildings that they were looking for.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Prior to the current zoning code, we're looking for creative ways to allow reuse of those of those old buildings. And the UO three was developed during the process of creating the current zoning code and applied there as well.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Commercial residential.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Uses, so these limited commercial uses could occur in residential structures that are in a unitary overlay but are not landmarked.'",

As Andrew just said, this is in Council District four in the Wiltshire neighborhood on the corner of University Boulevard and Bates Avenue.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The property was constructed in 1926 prior to the incorporation into the city. PJ is the owner of this particular property. The current zoning is SBF and the request is for a landmark designation for this property. This was submitted to Glenmark in May.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'On the 21st, it went to planning board for the rezoning and then for the Landmark Preservation Commission for their approval, which was unanimous. Then went through Rudy Mayor Council at first reading and we are now at the public hearing as required by the landmark ordinance which was established in 1957.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sorry, it is required to meet the designation criteria in at least two of the following categories history, architecture and geography. To maintain its historic and physical integrity, which basically means it should look like what it used to look like.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And it should be considered how it relates to a historic context or theme. This particular property, which was constructed in 1926, was through was for a dreamed of the development of the Wiltshire Park neighborhood. This was the first house that was developed with this neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You can see it on the 1925 Park Plat. This was also developed in coordination with and the developers coordinated with the Wiltshire golf course in an attempt to build an upscale neighborhood kind of in the southern part of Denver.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This was developed by Elinor and Phil and Wider, who are developers within the city and county of Denver. They did the brawny Bonnie Brae development, and this was hoped to be a second version of Bonnie Brae just a little bit further south.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They hired landscape architects to design the layout of the streets. It was intended that it was going to be multiple. Lots would be put together for larger homes. In 1925, owner took out a mortgage in order to help build this particular structure.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'He had planned to build more. However, he went out of business and so he sold this particular property and with sort of everyone else in the late 1920s when the Great Depression hit, it hit him as well. And so his business of the Wiltshire Park ended up going under and no other buildings were constructed as part of'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the Wiltshire Park development until after postwar. Into what we see today is more of a postwar suburb. So this property is representative of the initial dream of building the Wiltshire neighborhood but didn't really come into fruition except for this particular property.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And the Wiltshire golf course. The Landmark Preservation Commission and staff feels that this meets the history criteria for the development of this of the city of Denver. The application also talks about it being a historic for its architectural style or type.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This is a French eclectic style. It was constructed in 1926, and this particular style was brought back to the United States after World War One, after soldiers had been banned in France, and they brought this particular style back to the United States.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's rarely seen in Denver. It's been used more popular other places in the country, but it's rarely seen in Denver. Some of its defining characteristics are steeply pitched, complex, rough types, a lot of hipped dormers stucco walls and often seen as stone, used as sort of a whimsical detail, as if it's a French farmhouse.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There are multiple pane windows and French doors and then entryways that typically are arched and stooped, but without a large porch in front of it. And so these are the character defining features of the French eclectic style as seen in this particular property.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And finally, it is also significant for its geography and the geography of promoting and understanding the appreciation of the urban environment by means of distinctive physical characteristics or rarity. This is both a rare and distinctive building for Denver and particularly for this part of the this part of Denver.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The French, a collective style, is very unusual for Denver and extraordinarily rare in this particular area. And it's sitting on a very large lot in comparison to the other buildings that are around it that are smaller. One story ranch houses on smaller lots.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Does it have the ability to convey its historic and architectural significance and being recognized as belonging to a particular place in time in Denver history?

        "'speaker_1': 'They're stuck structured, so they maintain the same compatible the same compatible material with the rest of the building. And there are small size and scale, and they're also easily removable. And so it still retains its historic integrity, even though there are a few small additions on the building.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And finally, the Landmark Preservation Commission considered how the structure related to the historic context and themes in Denver history. This particular area was projected as an area of development and growth. It was initially started post-World War One when there were hopes that there were actually more materials available and people available to start building it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There was an initial part of the development or planning of it. But eventually, due to the decline and then bankruptcy of the owner business in the late 1920s, it did not get fully developed in sort of fits within the theme and context of the Great Depression.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So the landmark staff in the Landmark Preservation Commission found that it met the criteria under history of having a direct association with the historical development of the city, that it reflected the architectural style of the French eclectic style and architecture, and that it met the geographical criteria as being both distinctively physical, distinctive physical characteristics, as well as'",

        "'speaker_9': 'And I think there's price and cool characteristics of that building. So it was kind of fun to do it this time and learn a lot about the building. It's helping me get to the usage that I wanted. A little fun.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Fact is, there's for the last 15, 16 years, it's been a daycare for autistic kids that which they used for the back doorstop for all those 16 years. As we were cleaning some things up, it looked very interesting to me and it turns out it was the missing Keystone piece above the door.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So there's these lovely rocks that go around the door and there's one piece is just missing. And I've been trying to figure out to get somebody to fabricate. And all of a sudden I realize the back doorstop was that that piece.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So one small improvement and hopefully lead to many others. It's cool property. I intend to you know again, anyone driving by it for many, many years will recognize it. The outside, I think it's a really great building. So thank you.'",

Numerous people had looked into purchasing the property and they wanted to build townhomes there. And it wasn't something that would really fit into the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It wasn't really desired by the neighborhood. And to find a buyer who was willing to land market and to spend the resources to restore it to its probably better than its original glory is really a gift to Denver and to the community because as we all know, a lot of historic buildings are being torn down.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I'm really, really thankful, P.J., for your willingness to do this. And thank you to all of you at CPD for helping with this. And my community is very excited about this.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'In fact, Wilshire Park is not even in our records. Was this part of Arapahoe County when it was subdivided? So we might not have the records, but it was recently it was replanted in, I think, 1955 as Southern Hills.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so nothing it's association. It's direct association with the historical development. The city is really zero. But I believe that it does qualify under to the two remaining categories. So I intend to vote yes on. I just wanted to state that I disagree with the historical finding.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilwoman Black, to you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I would like to respond to that. This the statistical neighborhood actually is Wilshire. And the Wilshire End still stands in the Wall Street golf course, and it's all part of the same community. So I disagree with you.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'As is your right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilwoman Black, Councilman Espinosa.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah. I mean, I guess you could argue that the fact that there is a different community and this is the one fragment to, you know, if it would have been significant, if it had succeeded, it's also sort of significant that it failed.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's sort of weird. It's all part of the history of that place, whether it looked all like these French structures or at all looks like what didn't happen. It's sort of interesting what we you know, what what traces and remnants we the tell tale of of of our of our location and our history as a city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Each iteration, what we sort of choose to to say is significant and what's not. But what is significant to me and worth commenting on is first, I want to thank you for for for pursuing this designation. But I also wanted sort of noted, I probably should have called you up to ask this question to sort of emphasize'",
        "'speaker_5': 'the point is that you made it very clear your financial your financial advisor, you run a series of companies or amalgamation of companies that all deal with money. And there's often this question about the value of preservation. And and and I would think that somebody who knows the numbers had done that math and said, hey, this makes'",
        "'speaker_5': 'sense for my business and for the long haul. And so so I hope that that's factored in. And I hope you do. I'm glad that you sort of postponed your improvements because you you know that there are some tax credits that will come along with this.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And as you save those receipts, you'll be able to to to take those deductions year in and year out relative to that, unless you have giant receipts and you take them one year. But, you know, it's there is there is value to the structure.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There's value to our place, our history, and there is value to the owner. And and I think somebody with this background on a property like this has made that that factored into that calculus part of the calculation and determined that it makes sense all around.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so thank you for for coming to that realization when others might not have, because generations down the road will sort of recognize this anomaly and go, how the heck did that get here? And what is that connection to other parts of this place, as Councilwoman Black noted.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So thank you for doing that. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Espinosa. Councilman Cashman. Thank you, Mr. President. I want to add my thanks as well to Mr. Putnam for moving forward with this designation. I know this property so well, having driven by it for years and years, and it's one of those that you look at and go, wow, that that certainly has potential.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But boy, it needs some love, needs a whole lot of love with 34,000 square feet, I think, and a large building. And Mr. Turner was actually directed an error to my office originally because he's right across the street from a District four, from my District six boundary in District four and had a chance to chat with him'",

        "'speaker_3': 'So it's a site plan that sets forth building footprints, building heights, number of parking spaces, location of parking spaces. Basically everything that would go into a technical site planning exercise is contained in these plan building groups. So I think they work for the city for a while.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And the and these were done around 1980. But there is some challenges with them because you really get locked into a specific development type and can't do a lot with the with these properties without amending the plan building group.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So in terms of existing land uses, subject properties are multi-unit. Most of the surrounding properties are also multi-unit. But then you look closer to the Parker Road corridor. Then you get into the office uses and then the park certainly nearby.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So have some images of both properties. And so just looking at kind of a 3D of both of them, you see the existing wood stream village property has, like I said, built in about 1980, has two and they're all connected, but it's essentially two 6 to 7 storey multi-unit buildings.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And you look at the Dayton Crossing parcel built at the same time, 1981, I believe those are similar architectural style, but mostly four storey multi-unit buildings. I believe there's nine of them on those on the Dean crossing parcel.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So images I've got an image library here that I'll go through, but images of the existing properties. So I'll start with Wood Stream Village. That's the six and seven story apartment building. So this is kind of the main entrance to Wood Stream Village.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So you come in off of Harvard and there's access. You can get to it from Park Road and off of Dayton as well. And then just images on both sides. And you can see looking east and west on this public property, the this is the parking garage that is the subject of the Arizona request requesters that serves'",
        "'speaker_3': 'these adjacent multi-unit buildings. And they're looking to expand and rehab those parking structures. So just another image looking the other way. So this is behind the multi-unit building. And so images of Dayton crossing. So that's the Western parcel we were requesting to go to SMU five.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So similar architectural styles. This is the main entrance coming in to that development. Mostly four story multi-unit buildings with tuck under parking and then looking on the side. And so on to some images of. So those are existing images of the existing castle.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'These are the surrounding properties we're about to look at. So for Wood Stream Village, in terms of what surrounds it. So this is looking east toward the Parker Road corridor. So it's immediately adjacent to a fairly large office complex.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So you see the parking garages that serve the office complex that fronts on Parker Road actually doesn't have access of Parker Road. You have to come off of Harvard or Dayton. But you see a pretty large office building up to nine stories, and it transitions down from there, down to four stories of a Parker Road.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then the images of the surrounding context really reflect the suburban development pattern in the era that these were built in and in the 1980s. So mostly four storey and three storey multi-unit buildings. So looking west and most of these have that are to a with the plan building group restriction.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So each of them have their own sort of specific site plan that is pretty prescriptive. So that was Woods Stream Village. This is Dayton Crossing. Images of the surrounding properties so very similar. A three and four story, some two story multi-unit buildings.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So this is looking west. You see some pretty generous setbacks with some landscaping buffers that kind of reflect the suburban context. Looking north. And looking south. So we have followed our normal rezoning process. Planning Board on June 6th unanimously recommended approval of the request and then Ludie on June 26th recommended that the request move forward.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There is no neighborhood specific registered neighborhood organization and we have not received any public comments on the requests. So I'll go through each of the criteria briefly to kind of see stuff's analysis and recommendation. So there is no neighborhood plan, there is no area specific plan.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we only have citywide plans to guide us here. So that means comprehensive plan and blueprint. Denver. So looking at the conference plan first. So staff started to policies in the comp plan one related to the policy to encourage redevelopment.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So the evolution of these housing developments to meet the diverse needs of Denver's present and future residents. And then also to look at encouraging infill development that's consistent with the character of the surrounding neighborhood. So staff finds their requests consistent with these policies, mostly because through this rezoning request and through getting sort of getting out of that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'old code custom zoning framework, that's been really challenging for them. It would encourage the, you know, the reinvestment and the rehab of these properties. So these buildings being about 38 years old probably need a little bit of a facelift.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then in terms of the character of the surrounding neighborhood, looking at the existing conditions of seven story buildings, four story buildings on the properties, and then looking at the surrounding context closer to Parker Road in particular, where you go up to a nine storey office building staff finds that consistent with that character.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So in terms of blueprint. Denver So the designations are one area of stability into a single family duplex feature land use concept. So the purpose of the area of stability designation is to maintain the character of an area while encouraging some new development at appropriate locations.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And in the single family duplex does include some language addressing that some apartment buildings may be appropriate in that land use. So looking at its location too, in terms of it being an appropriate location. So you have Parker Road right there, which is an enhanced transit corridor with pretty good bus service.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then Dayton Way is a residential collector. Staff does find the request consistent with Blueprint Denver in the sense that it is encouraging reinvestment at an appropriate location relative to those corridors. And then there are some blueprint Denver policies related to essentially promoting getting rid of a lot of these custom old code zoning scenarios that would create'",
        "'speaker_3': 'some challenges. So staff finds it consistent with those policies. So in terms of the second criteria, uniform of district regulation staff finds it consistent in that it will result in uniform application of standards under the new zone districts across the across the site.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Criteria three staff finds the request consistent with the policy to further public health, safety and welfare because it will implement adopt plans by supporting reinvestment in a approximately 38 year old multi-unit complex for residential development. And so in terms of a justifying circumstance, we actually just passed a code change some of you may know, whereas going from'",
        "'speaker_3': 'an old code to a new code zone district in itself is a justifying circumstance. So that finds it consistent with that criteria. And then the last criteria staff also finds the request consistent with the suburban neighborhood context. Because when you look at the description of the the suburban neighborhood context, it speaks a lot to large setbacks, mid-rise'",
        "'speaker_3': 'building forms, and then a separation of these multi-unit residential developments from single family. And so that's consistent with what's there today. So I think the zoning would would better match what's there today than what's currently on the on the ground in terms of zoning.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So staff does recommend approval of the requests and I'm happy to answer any questions. I know the applicant is here for questions as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. We do have one individual signed up to speak this evening. Richard Sidorov, you have 3 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'My name is Rich Cicero if I'm the architect applicant for coal rich communities, American Institute of Architects. The owner originally pursued this rezoning because the two existing structured parking buildings there are two stories apiece and have 200 cars.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'These are dilapidated and need to be either heavily rebuilt, rehabilitated or removed. So as part of that process of design exploration that they will be interested in exploring potentially rebuilding those two parking garage structures and putting apartment units on top.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Happy to answer any questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you very much. That concludes our speakers. Are there any questions from members of council? Councilman Brooks?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. Thank you, Mr. President. You know, this is actually a question for Councilwoman Black, for since I've been on here, this is the first time we've had three public hearings for my council District four. And I just wanted to know, are you finally happy that you're getting more for four?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's actually a question. It's not a comment.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm happy to support all of these this evening, but there are other things I'm told when I say I want.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'More, I'm sure.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm sure that it comes from Brooklyn. All right, Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'My question is for city staff. I'm sorry, I forgot your first name. Yes, chef. So to do something with the garage is why they had to go through this process.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah, I think in the applicant could speak to it more, but I think that's what spurred the request. In terms of looking at so I mentioned that plan building group that really restricts the parking garages to their current footprint.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I think that was part of their exploration is realizing they need to amend or eliminate that plan building group. And as part of that, just getting out of the old out of the old code into the new code is something that we support.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So. So an applicant could speak more to that, probably, but.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. I'd like to ask you, if you wouldn't mind, coming up. So is the plan to only deal with the garages and then build above them and keep the existing structures?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The the intent is to build on the footprint of the two existing garages, which likely have to be removed because of structural remediation. And in doing so, there's an opportunity because the parking requirements under the new zoning afford additional multiple units to be constructed.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'They would research putting some additional multi units on top of the garage as part of the reconstruction of the garage. The garage, the lower levels of the garage are poorly planned and have poor circulation connections to the existing two towers.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And as part of the garage reconstruction, there's an opportunity to enhance the quality and connections.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So any of the other structures that are on the property are not being proposed to be level than redo the entire site?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'None. None of the multi-unit buildings, just the two precast concrete parking garage.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you for that clarification. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Ortega. Councilman Espinosa.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah. Jeff, can you go to slide four? And this is because I'm not sure we're trying to connect. It's it's the one that shows that has in big, bold letters on the lower right corner parking structure. So it's go all the way to the very beginning right there at this point there.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah. Okay. Purpose to accommodate expansion of parking structures. So this is a follow up to Councilwoman Ortega's question, because I am struggling a little bit with your with your comprehensive plan justification slide. So is it or isn't it a foregone conclusion that you will be putting housing on top of the structures?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Not if you could come up to the microphone, please.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'No, it's not a foregone conclusion. It's simply that they'd like to explore that through the rezoning.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. All right. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Espinosa. Seeing no other questions. The public hearing for Accountable 699 is closed. Are there comments by members of Council Council woman black.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Jeff, thanks for pointing out that there's no neighborhood plan, so you don't have to get out, that there's no neighborhood plans. And Councilman Brooks, that's what I'm talking about when I say more for four.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There is not one neighborhood plan in my entire district, nor is our neighborhood planning initiative coming down there any time soon. So that's what I'm talking about. So thanks for bringing that up. This neighborhood doesn't have a neighborhood identity either.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It doesn't have a name. And I am affectionately calling it the Green Triangle, even though it is actually not a triangle. But it just sounds good. It's very cool. It does have Parker Road and Havana on two sides, but it also has the Highline Canal, the Cherry Creek Trail, which intersect right there.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The Cherry Creek Reservoir and State Park is very close. Kennedy golf course is right there. Hensel Park is right there in Barre Park, which is an exceptionally beautiful park, is right there. That's all in that neighborhood. There's also a brand new school.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's got all kinds of housing at all different levels, at different price points. And when I say in committee meetings that we have, you know, more affordable housing or attainable housing prices in my district, this is one complex that has those kinds of rents that people can actually afford.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I'm happy to support it, of course. And who knows, maybe we will get some more housing down there also. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Black. Councilman Brooks.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. I'd just like to say I'll be supporting this based upon the criteria that's in front of us. But what I really chipped in was to say, you know, I just contacted all the presidents in District nine and they'd be happy to give you some of our plans because of the development issue.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we're happy to support that. And I did hear from Councilman Espinosa that you have a lot of PBDEs, and so you got you got some good stuff going on down there.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'These are bad.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Things. Thank you, Councilman Brooks. Councilman Espinosa.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah. What I meant by that is know, instead of neighborhood plans, what they have is very, very, very planned zoning that are very deliberate. Now we're trying to reverse that. The so just to my questions, I'm just going to comment on it because we don't.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The way the plan. I mean, the rezoning was justified. Makes sense. If we smack on the early in the presentation that the purpose is for a parking structure and then our planning justification is about encourage housing. That's where it's a little bit discombobulated for me.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You know, it's one thing to get rid of old zoning because they want to do a replacement structure and they want to break themselves free of those shackles that are there. But then we should just talk generically. You know, we always don't talk about specific projects.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And here we opened with a specific project, but then justified it for the right reasons. But then, you know, and so I was really struggling the whole time until the property owner mentioned that there might be housing on top of it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then I was like, Oh, there's where the housing comes in. But then to find out that that's really an afterthought and not a primary factor. I'm sitting here struggling with with how this is congruent. And so this is one of those situations where I wish I knew less about the proposal going into it, because it is'",
        "'speaker_5': 'ultimately the right justification and the right zoning to get to these outcomes. But now, without the TBG, Councilwoman Black knows less about the future of this property than she did with the PBGC. And so as restrictive as PBDEs are, they do lend a heck of a lot of predictability and did some 38 years ago, as you know'",
        "'speaker_5': '. And now we're going into a situation we're giving carte blanche on zoned districts with the very, very limited, you know, limited things that form base zoning does, which could be all parking structures in filled here, you know. And so so so to her point, definitely in support future endeavors for planning efforts to help better guide how these'",
        "'speaker_5': 'new zone districts are used in her district. But so that is a long way to say what I just said. But I think you follow me on this one and I will be supporting it because because broadly speaking, it is the appropriate zoned district for this property.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But in the specifics, I was sort of struggling with it things.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Espinosa. Seeing no other comments, Madam Secretary. Raquel.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Black crooks. Brooks. Espinosa. Hi. Flynn. Hi. Gilmore. I. Herndon in Cashman. Carnage. Lopez knew Ortega. Sussman Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Madam Secretary, please. Because the voting announced the results. 3939 as Council Bill 699 has passed seeing no other business before this body. This meeting is adjourned. Kelly.'"
