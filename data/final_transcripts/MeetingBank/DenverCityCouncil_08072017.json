        "'speaker_4': 'Well, first of all, I'll say we feel very optimistic about our chances at trial having gone through many months of discovery, evaluating the plaintiff's claims. We think that the project that's being put forth for approval is entirely consistent with the Denver charter and the Denver zoning code.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I'll say that first in terms of what happens at trial. I mean, obviously, in the event that we're wrong, we'll have to see what the judge's decision is and determine what, if any, changes need to be made.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'So whether we delay or not won't have effect?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, it will have effect on the project because the project is being very carefully timed in order to minimize the amount of golf season that's disrupted. If we delay the contract, then all that planning work gets delayed, which could have a significant impact on the schedule for the project.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Jessica, could you come back to the microphone? Sure. I think the motion was to or Councilman Espinosa's intent is to try to have the administration amend the contract so that actual physical work doesn't commence until the end of the appeals process.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In your experience, the outcome of a trial, of course, doesn't. That only begins the appeals process. How long could that take in your experience?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The appeals process can take months, two years, just depending on what the nature of the appeal is, what the court's docket looks like. So again, it at this point is pretty much speculation in terms of how long that would involve.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I would say in general, it's it's months, two years if you wait for every potential appeal to run.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mm hmm. Thank you, Mr. President. I had another question. And for Jen Hillhouse. Could you come up for a second?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Go ahead, Councilman Flynn.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Members of Council Main. Jennifer Hillhouse I'm with Public Works and we have procurement. Steve Coggins My best answer that, but I get as he comes up, I can give you a little bit of indication if we delay this, this contract, as Jessica mentioned, we will lose an entire season of golf and our commitments that we've made to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the public would be hindered. And so it's it could be a substantial impact to us.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we expect work on the site. If things went according to schedule right now, we expect that the work on the site would begin in November. That's what I recall. That's correct. Okay. That's all, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, Councilman Espinosa, I'm going to jump in. So I just want members of council and the public to know that Councilman Espinosa, with this motion, has exercised a rule beyond our rule of 3.7, which delays a council bill one week.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so this goes above and beyond. I'm not comfortable voting on that. We've been. This project has been talked about, worked on. Had a conversation with her last year. And all of us stay here to midnight for the water rates increase as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I think Councilman Espinosa knows a lot about this project, actually, and is very well attuned to it. And we got many emails from residents saying we should wait for the ruling and for the judge to rule on this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, this is the legislative branch and we take on our legislative process as such. A judge can can issue a stay on any of these projects, and we will not be able to move forward. So we're going to go I am as a district representative who was knocking doors in our city park in Skyland last night, 7'",
        "'speaker_0': 'p.m. talking about this issue. I feel comfortable moving forward with this, knowing that the judicial process is going to take its course. So, Councilman Espinosa, let me get to Ortega and then I'll pop back to you. Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. I have a couple of questions. The first one is Katzman Espinosa. Did you postpone to a date certain? Yes. What was that date? Well.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's 828, so August 28, two weeks.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. And to the city attorney, Jessica, if you don't mind, coming up, when does the 30 day clock expire on the contract?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I believe that would be the last day to take action.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The last day. So if we took action on that night, it would still be allowed to move forward.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It would be within the 30 days. But again, it would cause delay to the contracting process and to the start of the project.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'How so?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, probably the procurement team is best to answer that. But my understanding of the schedule is that we're hoping to issue a notice to proceed to the contractor. So again, they can start their preparatory work as soon as possible in order to take advantage of that November 1st onsite start date and minimize the disruption to the 2019'",
        "'speaker_4': 'golf schedule.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So if if the ordinance moved forward on the 28th. I don't understand how that affects the contracts schedule, the construction schedule. And so help me understand that. Sure.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So, Councilman Ortega, this is a design build contract. So before they actually start any onsite work, the contractor will start preparations of the design of the project.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So and you've been doing that all along.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We've done preliminary design, but as this is a design build contract, there's still a lot of work for the contractor to do before they start any onsite work in November.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. I have no further questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilman Ortega. All right, Councilman Espinosa, back up. So I do want to clarify something, and I understand how this happened. I did. I was asking for two weeks. So that's actually August 21st, not August 28.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But less my watch is wrong.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I would like to change that, that request. I would like to change my motion to.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'To from August 28 to a date certain of August.'",
        "'speaker_0': '21st. With that said, I don't believe any concrete, any work that a contractor does between now and the executed contract, which we aren't required to act until 828, would be at risk. And up to them, it would be.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Sort of wrong to assume that just with our vote, they start work because I mean, is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That true or should they wait until they have an.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Executed contract before beginning work?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We always advise contractors to wait until they have a signed contract. But if this action were to be approved tonight, we would hope to get to a sign contract as early as later this week or early next week.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But this body has technically.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Until 828 to act, correct?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. Yes, you do.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So if we were to take our full allotted time that was anticipated by the contractor would not have been.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, that's certainly your prerogative. But as far as the anticipated schedule, again, our hope is to get the design underway as soon as possible so that we don't cause delays on the back end of the project.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Again, I would like to change this behavior. If you want a contract executed by eight seven, then you should start this contract 30 days. I mean, we should be seeing this 30 days.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Ago and not, you know.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Telling us that your entire schedule is contingent on us acting to meet three weeks ahead of when we're required legally to act. So I do have a question. What is the is it possible that a contract I mean, the contractor could proceed then during the appeals process and trees be removed.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, at this point, yes, because no injunction has been sought by the plaintiffs in this case.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So failing that and sort of putting it on the citizens who are making this case rather than on this body, who can actually compel the administration maybe.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'To.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Put this language in the contract, what is the how do you resolve that situation if 100 year trees are removed? How do you replace those?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, I think as you can anticipate, you can't put the trees back once they've been removed.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So that is the core of my concern.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so then the last thing it's related to these this ballot, I mean, this this battery of contracts. How the Parsons contract actually is for both City Park and Park Hill. Those are two separate projects. It's sort of difficult for me to say, you know, one should be able to move forward while the other one sort of'",
        "'speaker_0': 'tries to resolve this issue.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In my book.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Why are the parsing contracts essentially linked and how do we you know, if City Park and Park Hill are two different things?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Jamie Price. I'm with the Park Hill team. Councilman wanted to try address your last question and then also the question about the appeals process. We're somewhat fortunate in that the trial date is very close to when the A.B. date is for the contract, and we will know the result of that trial before physical work begins on site'",
        "'speaker_2': '. After that, yes, there could be an appeals process. But at that point or now there's risk in every project. Right. And we're now weighing the risk of not moving forward with with that of moving forward. And there's going to be significant costs and delays and impacts quite a bit beyond the risk of moving forward.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Based on what we know about the case and the strength of the cases. The City Attorney's Office has consulted us so wanted to clarify our impression of that somewhat unlikely event happening. The Parsons contract. Your second question. They are being retained to help with extension of staff services for construction management and project management, so they will need'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to be in place at about the same time as we engage with the contracting team, the design build team, the Saunders team to help with contract administration inspection, oversight of the project safety, all those things that go with the owner's role.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So were the durations. So there's a contracting period. I mean, it's it's going to be a required amount of time to build this course. Does the duration of the construction change at all? Because, yes, there's a delay in the start.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But the overall time it takes to complete the work is still the overall time it takes to complete the work, because they're doing it over the winters.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'As opposed to over the summer. It's doing both.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But so, I mean, I'm I'm a little bit worried that you're you're you're addressing this concern by saying that there's risk, but moving forward with the contract, as is if there's a sort of.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Of.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sort of confusion caused by the litigation or, you know, some sort of, you know, what you're relying on in predicting is is is monkey wrenches thrown into it. You will then be under contract and will have to amend those contracts.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that would cost money and delay the project. So why wouldn't it be prudent to actually just say, look, let's get let's continue the design because the design is not complete. That's work that has to be done and hold off on the construction with Saunders until such time as we have resolution.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I mean that wouldn't that be the safe, most conservative way to go.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Not necessarily. We have a design build team that's ready to work on a particular schedule at a particular cost.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Again, changes to that will then cost money.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Changes to that particular.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Schedule.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Would then cost money. Councilman, let them. Let him finish what he said, and then you can respond.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Go ahead. Yes, sir. I assume we're talking about both contracts now, both the Parsons contract and the Saunders design build contract. There's risks either way. The team believes that there's much greater risk to the city in terms of delays and cost overruns by delaying at this time with little benefit as we understand the status of the lawsuit'",
        "'speaker_2': 'as the city attorney's office has represented.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. All right. Well, thank you. I sort of beg to differ because it is a significant impact to the quality of life, to the environment. To lose mature trees, if, in fact, we do it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We end up being wrong. In this case, it is very.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'None of our lifetimes here will see those trees, any new trees get to the size that they are today. That is two generations from now. Okay. Thank you, Councilman Espinosa. By the way, there was a question before I'm going to go to Councilman Clark, because he has not said anything but the percentage of trees that would be'",
        "'speaker_0': 'saved on City Park.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah, we have an estimate on that. Just you want to just make sure I got that right. I believe what we said in committee was well over 70% of the trees will be saved, including the significant older growth trees on the perimeters that are valued so highly.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There will be tree loss. We know that that tree loss will be some of the smaller trees or the trees that will be internal to be mitigated. Every tree will be mitigated to City Standard.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And there's a there's an effort to preserve older trees on the perimeter. Just I just want to make sure you say that again. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Very big effort, sir.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Great. Thank you. Councilman Clark.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I just wanted to jump in. This one's hard, obviously, because there are a lot of people who feel very passionately about this issue. I just wanted to jump in and say that I agree with Council President Brooks about our legislative process versus the judicial process.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I also think that it is it makes me uncomfortable sitting up here that anyone who filed a lawsuit on anything that we do, we would just freeze and not take action on anything, because I think it opens the floodgates.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Anybody can sue the city or anyone else for any reason at any time. And there is a process by which the judge could say, this just needs to stop. And I think that's the process to get that to stop.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Otherwise, I don't think we should be delaying just because there's a lawsuit. All of that being said, I also want to clarify, because I don't think I'm buying the storyline that a two week delay when you know any one member of council.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilman Espinosa, if this is not successful, can simply ask for one week. You can get a one week delay. And the statement was made that we will lose the entire season of golf and everything that we've promised our golf and our community over two weeks.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'When I would hope that this team has anticipated that someone up here at their discretion with no vote could delay for one week. So you're somewhere there's a magic number between seven and 14 where the whole world comes to an end.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I guess I'm not buying that either. So I just want to clarify again, I don't think we need to postpone and I back what Councilman Council President Brooks has said. But I do think for the record, we should clarify that this is really only seven days longer and still within the window of when council has its'",
        "'speaker_2': 'prerogative to approve this contract. And I would hope that our team, very smart people that you all are, have anticipated not losing an entire season up to the date at which we could take action. But certainly the difference between seven and 14 days.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So can you clarify for me that that that you're you're really making the statement that that extra seven days will lose an entire season?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So first of all, just to clarify.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'When we were speaking about the original DeLay requests, we thought we were addressing a three week delay as opposed to a two week delay. So just to clarify that, we certainly had anticipated that there could be a one week delay.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We've included that in our schedule, but beyond that does jeopardize the contract.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Still not 100% sold on that, but I don't smoke. Can I? Jamie, perhaps. Could I clarify? Once we get beyond one week delay, the contract is still whole and viable. We're going to complete. It just starts to impact a lot of things that are happening on the backend in terms of how quickly we can return this golf'",
        "'speaker_2': 'course back to the golfers and then those and I understand your your preference, but I would certainly hope for the citizens of Denver and for all of us that when a contract is brought in front of us, that we have until a certain date to approve, that the whole thing is not shattered for an entire year.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'DELAY If we if we don't vote on it, the first chance we get versus the 28th, I hope to all the city agencies out there that the way we're doing business is in anticipation of that last day. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Councilman Flynn and Cashmere, are you still there? Okay. Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. President. First of all, if I could have a point of personal privilege, I want to recognize the presence in the chamber of former Councilwoman Cathy Donohue, who served on this body from 1975, I think, until 1993, when she joined the Webb administration.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And welcome you. She served as council president on at least one occasion that I can recall, at least three occasions that I now recall that she's raised three fingers. And so I just want to acknowledge her presence here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But on the point of the of this motion. I really don't like this this project. I voted against it last year when we had the wastewater fee. I think Councilman Espinosa and Councilman Cashman joined me. We were we were the only three votes against it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilwoman Ortega was absent that evening, but she would have been a no vote had she been here. We could have killed the project then if we really wanted if we really wanted to kill it. I thought it was much too big going by a factor, I think of ten or 12 times larger than anything wastewater had ever'",
        "'speaker_2': 'done before. I thought it should have been done more incrementally and with more planning already in place, but that was not the case. We were outvoted and the bonds have been issued. And I think our responsibility now as fiduciaries of the city and the taxpayers and the ratepayers into wastewater is to make sure it's done efficiently and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'at the most efficient cost, particularly. Mr. President, on the matter of the contracts themselves, they do contain the standard provisions that in the event the court would rule in favor of former Attorney General McFarland, who's the plaintiff in the case and whom I wish a lot of luck.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I, I do know that the contracts contained both suspension provisions and termination provisions, specifically in the event that there's a court ruling against it. If there's an injunction, for example, and if the plaintiffs should move for an injunction, should we approve this contract tonight or in two weeks?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The plaintiffs can take advantage of that. And I think that's as the. Mr. President, I think you've already hinted that it would be the proper avenue to do this. I really dislike that this is going forward in the manner it is.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I wish that we had done it more incrementally and with more forethought a year ago, but that that wasn't the majority decision of the council at that time. And I believe my responsibility now is to make sure it's done right.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And just to one other point, it is I know that in the public mind and the minds of a lot of folks, this is so intimately intertwined with the I-70 expansion. But the plain fact is that the I-70 project is not dependent on doing this drainage project.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We are not doing this project in order to enable the I-70 project. The I-70 project can go ahead. If we didn't if we didn't even think about doing this and conversely, if there were no I-70 project, we could still be doing major drainage improvements in the Park Hill and the Montclair Basins, which are needed separately.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'What happened last year was the prior council locked us into an idea before the seven new members came on, locked us into an idea that says we will cost, share and take advantage of those efficiencies and do a project that we think will benefit the wastewater ratepayers in Park Hill and Montclair, as well as the as well'",
        "'speaker_2': 'as the CDOT beneficiaries, the public, the traveling public, the people who pay their faster fees and their gas taxes. So that's how they that's how they are married. But each of them is independent of each other. So with that, Mr. President, I would my principle that I like to act on is we should take as much time'",
        "'speaker_2': 'as we can take to to approve contracts. And I would I would not be opposed to a two week delay as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. I'm going to woo. Okay. We got some new ones in here. Let me, Councilwoman Sussman first and then I'll pop to you new and then for the councilman.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You already have a chance to speak on this one.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'He spoke already.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's okay. Yeah, I wasn't really going to chime in, but I really like what Councilman Clark said a. You know. A one week delay still makes him a state councilman, Clark says, which is. We delay things just because we've had a lawsuit filed.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I mean, whether we do it two weeks or one week, we're still responding. Oh, dear, there's a lawsuit. Let's delay. And as a legislative body, I just don't think that's a correct motion to take. And so either the vote for a two day, two week delay or a one week delay seem hollow and useless.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I it's interesting that we're talking about the bill tonight. Which is if we're going to delay, we should talk about it in another time, because I think the thing down on the bench is, are we going to delay or not?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But delaying it doesn't change. The the fact of what of what's going to happen when we do have that debate. So and it's still whether it's one week or two. It still has the problem that Councilman Clark suggested that we can't delay things just because we're being sued.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilman, you.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Just had a question on the attorney about Councilman Flynn's comments about the contract having a clauses there that if the ruling goes against the city, that there will be a. Opportunity to terminate the contract or suspend the contract.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm going to invite my colleague John McGrath to come up because he is the lead on the contract.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Strom McGrath Assistant City Attorney Yes, we have a standard set of general contract conditions for all construction contracts that the city enters into, and they have a number of rights that would enable the city to either suspend, cancel.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And because we have those rights, we could also then sort of open a dialog with the project team to figure out exactly what the best path forward would be.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And who would make that decision to cancel?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So would the client public works and in consultation with the city attorney's office.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right, Councilman Cashman.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Yeah. With all due respect to my ex journalist brother, Councilman Flynn, there is opinion and evidence on the other side of the argument about whether Platt, the Park Hill and I-70 are connected. But the thing I just can't let go of is a one week delay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Delays your project a week, a two week delay delays two weeks, a three week delay, delays at three weeks. Maybe you're going through the winter. You have no idea what weather is going to do to this. And the reason I bring it up is a large part of the disapproval of this project is among the constituents that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I talked to came from that insistence during the development of the project that this has nothing to do with I-70, when again, there's evidence on both sides, depending on how you interpret that. And to stand here and intimate that this the delay that Councilman Espinosa requests, regardless of how you feel about this project or his reasons for'",
        "'speaker_2': 'delaying this project to intimate that it's going to have some sort of major effect on your pride, on your project is disingenuous. It just is. So I don't think it's wise to take that tack in something that is this project is extremely important to the community.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Again, depending on which side you're on, so let's argue on the merits of the project. And, you know, as far as it being shallow or not shallow to ask for a delay, I don't want to psychoanalyze any of my colleagues reasons for for asking for a delay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so, as I said, I'm in support of this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. So as Councilman Flynn said, I was not here the night of the public hearing on the wastewater increase, which basically created the funding that allowed the project to move forward. And just to go back a little bit, some members on the council tonight were not here when this body was asked to vote on the original'",
        "'speaker_9': '. So it started with both a proclamation and then later followed by an idea, an intergovernmental agreement between Denver and DOT that clearly tied the funding that Sea-Tac was going to spend for drainage on I-70 to the drainage project that Denver wanted to do on this area.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And initially, you know, when when it came forward, it was a $40 million span CDOT was going to do. When the AG came forward, it was about 180 some million dollars. And then when we had the wastewater increase, it was $300 million.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So the project scope just kept growing and growing and growing. Now, maybe it was the intent of folks from public works to always bring this forward as a, you know, a bigger scale project. But the problem I had was we did not have a public input process on any of the drainage projects before the decision was made'",
        "'speaker_9': 'that this city was going to move forward with the Twin Basin, which is what it was called initially and then later changed to the Platt to Park Hill project. So. You know, in these big projects, typically you have an EGIS, an environmental impact statement.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And when you look at the cost of the funding that was spent on all of this. Folks will say we did that, but it was not called. And it's during that part of the process. And so, you know, people who are in the neighborhoods who have this these various aspects of drainage that are going into their communities'",
        "'speaker_9': 'feel like they had the project shoved down their throats, just to be blunt, because. The input came after the fact and the decision had already been made that the city was moving forward with the Twin Basin Project. The plot to Park Hill and the East Montclair Basins.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So. I would have voted no. Then I plan to vote no tonight just because I think we don't do things backwards. It's important for us to follow procedures and to do them right in making sure that we do have genuine community input.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And again, that's not what happened in this case. So I just want to ask, Jamie, were you clarify your role in the project? Are you are you a city employee? Are you a contractor to the project? And will you just explain what that role entails?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sure. Councilwoman Jamie Price. I'm with the Plat to Park Hill Project. I've been serving as the project director to the project for the past almost two years now. I am a contractor to the city.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And the company I work for.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I work with Matrix Design Group.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. I want to focus this back on this delay. Councilman Espinosa, you have on the floor a 2828, so a three week delay. But you wanted to change that to a 21? Correct? That's correct. Can we. Councilwoman Gilmore, can we move to change this back to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Just the permission of the river in the second or the second year? Councilman Herndon.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Turner, do you have permission to move it back a week? I did not second that. So this is flim flam. Councilman Flynn?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. So just just again, Councilwoman Espinosa, Councilwoman Gilmore, it is Resolutions 23, 24, 26 be postponed to Monday, August 21st.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'All right. Thanks President Brooks I move the that the adoption of council resolutions 823 824 and 826 be postponed to Monday, August 21st.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have a first mover and a neo seconder. President Brooks. I should be the mover on that again. Okay. Yeah, it truly matters, but. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Councilman Espinosa, are we ready to vote on this? I do have one more question for city attorney.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Um, so if you were asked to produce article A clause and for the on the contract to preserve to to preserve trees until. Until, you know, a certain date. Uh, could you have done that?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Um, I think we essentially have those rights in the contract as it is today. The city is in control of the timing of all phases of the project.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Would that make a little closer area?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Geographic and City Attorney's Office. We have suspension rights and we have termination rights and we have other rights to have the program unfold in a way that suits your needs. So I think that with those rights, we can delay certain phases of the project on site if events suggest that, that would be prudent to do.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I recognize that all of our contracts have the ability to amend and terminate. Pretty much standard boilerplate language that then we revise project specific. I'm asking if somebody had directed you to specifically address preservation of mature trees until such a time when we're free of litigation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Could you have produced such a language.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And put it in this contract? Sure we could we could produce other clauses that that either are or aren't. And so, you know, of course.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So to to close out that that was all I was asking for. This was not a whim. It was really to to to spend a couple of weeks making that ask of our city attorneys who are fully capable of doing this, the administration who is fully capable of incorporating this, because this is not I think Councilman Clark'",
        "'speaker_0': 'sort of explained a false equivalent that this would be something we could always do. We're talking about preserving an irreplaceable asset. These are trees that we cannot grow tomorrow. We cannot grow in 30 years. We cannot grow in 70 years.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We need 100 years to produce these things. And so if we set a threshold and made a commitment, we could codify that in in in language. And I don't think that's far fetched idea for this council or the administration to to protect.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I mean, those trees can then ultimately be removed once everything's a go. Yeah, it would be painful to work around, but it's we really shouldn't be marching until such time. And I recognize that the comments have made that we have the right to terminate, we have the right to amend, we have the right to do a whole'",
        "'speaker_0': 'bunch of things. But it's very clear in all the city statements that that desire to postpone or delay or keep these projects is independent, as has been stated previously for for a year. And as Councilman Flynn sort of reiterated, you know, if they're truly independent, then we should be able to say golf course, you stay on hold'",
        "'speaker_0': 'until we have clarification that we, in fact, can disturb that historic golf course. And that wouldn't be so wrong. So did you want to. I would just say that a no vote is to not allow a representative of this body to seek time to to at least make that ask.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. I think we want something from the legal team.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah. I just wanted to briefly address your concern about the tree preservation. We do believe we already have the language and the authority in the contract as written, in addition to the standard suspension and termination clauses. The city has the rights to approve all phases of the work.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'One of the requirements of the contract relates specifically to tree preservation and any tree removal and replacement plan would need to be approved by the city forester, among others. I think.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Again, all of that is known. That's all very clear. What you're obviously obfuscating here is the fact that that tree removal plan basically says you remove this tree, you replace it with these. And and I'm saying that it is not the same to put three new trees in to replace one large mature tree.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If you were telling me that it was only removing seven inch caliber trees, that would be one thing. But we know that they're more substantial trees than that, and those are the.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Ones that are hard to produce.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right, Councilman.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Just briefly, I appreciate as council president was saying, I don't think we should let a lawsuit dictate our timeline. And in the end, does it make a difference? No, but the principle of it, as legislators, we are moving this city forward and we should not start because of fear of litigation.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And let's be real. If the judgment comes down in support of the city, there will be an appeals process. And will we be getting more chain letters saying that we should wait for the appeal to go through? I just don't believe that is something that we should do as a city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I am comfortable moving forward with this and I would hope that our council members support it. But in the end, it, I don't think will make that significant of a difference. But for me, it's the principle that who dictates how we vote.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It should not be based off of who chooses to sue the city. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. Councilman Herndon, just to remind everyone we're not actually vote on the bill are now are voting on a delay to 821. It's been moved and seconded. Secretary Roll Call.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mr. President. Of all three of them or just one?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. Thank you for for pointing that out. This is all three of the bills. 823, eight, 24 and 826.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Espinosa, I.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Flynn I.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Gilmore No. Herndon. No. In. Can each. No. Lopez.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I knew.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Ortega, I.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'SUSSMAN No. BLACK No.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Clark.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No, please, cause very nice results.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'That's a suburban neighborhood context residential multi-unit, up to three stories. This request is in Council District three. It is in the Marley neighborhood near the intersection of Florida Avenue and Federal Boulevard. The site is currently occupied by five three story apartment buildings and one single family home.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And hopefully, as you can see in this aerial here, it is comprised of two parcels. The surrounding zoning here is a mix of single and multi-unit residential. There are quite a few instances of the SMU three zoned on nearby properties.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Land uses in the area are primarily residential, with a mix of single and multi-unit development. Commercial land uses. Federal Boulevard there to the east and to the south is a church with a school and a child care center.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'As you can see in this area, all the multi-unit development immediately to the north of the site is very similar in scale and layout, built in a suburban form with apartments arranged around internal parking and open space. This next slide shows a couple of views of the site.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The top looking northwest along Irving and at the bottom southwest along Arkansas. These photos show the house at the northwest corner of the subject site, as well as the multi-unit development to the north. And then this photo shows single unit development to the west of the subject site.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So the existing planned unit development, or PUD Zone District, was established in 1985 after the apartment complex had already been built. Permits 116 residential units on site and calls for three storey buildings with setbacks, landscaping and other design standards.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Essentially, based on what existed at the time, the PD also specified that a commercial use that was in operation on the single family home in the single family home at the time of adoption could continue. The current PD 180 is the second PD established on the site.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The first was PD three, which was adopted in 1978 when the owner at the time wanted to seek a redevelopment of the property. PD three was based on plans for five apartment clusters, each of which were to contain 22 one bedroom units and one two bedroom unit for a total of 115 units, plus the single unit house'",
        "'speaker_2': '. Building permits were issued in 1980 and 81 for the five structures. Some of them listed the total number of units at 23, some listed at at 24, and some had a number scratched out without any explanation or replacement figure.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No subsequent building permits for renovations or reconfigurations were found in city records, and staff believes that the five structures were built at that time with 24 one bedroom units for a total of 120 apartment units. The slide shows some of those building permits.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And you can see that there are differences and discrepancies between the number of units each each structure could contain. So in 1985, the apartment developer realized that the map for PD three I'm sorry, for PD one three had emitted the single unit house, which had been envisioned early on as like a manager's unit or some other amenity'",
        "'speaker_2': 'for apartment residents. So I proposed a new.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'PDP 8180.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That would did add the single unit house at the corner of Arkansas and Irving into the boundary. But the documentation was not updated to show the actual number of units on the site. The development was the apartment complex was recently acquired by a new owner who learned late last year that from the city that the properties existing'",
        "'speaker_2': 'improvements were not in conformance with the plan unit development zoning. Due to this discrepancy between the number of units specified in the number of units actually built on site. This slide does show shows some of the language from PD one A.D., including the reason for its adoption and the maximum number of units shown at 116 year.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So as I mentioned upfront, the applicant proposes to rezone the property from the current PUD to SAMU three. That's a multi-unit residential zone in the suburban neighborhood context. This neighborhood context is characterized by single and multi-unit development with lower building heights, larger lots and deeper setbacks than the city's urban neighborhood context.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'With regard to the process to date that this request was considered by the Planning Board on June 7th and the land use and transportation or land use, Transportation and Infrastructure Committee on June 27, both of which recommended approval.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Staff has received several inquiries about the application, but no public comments. As you're aware, to approve a rezoning, the Council must find that these five criteria established by the Denver Zoning Code are met with regard to consistency with adopted plans to plan impact the subject site.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The Comprehensive Plan and Blueprint Denver staff finds that this proposed rezoning would further several comprehensive plan objectives and goals, including preservation of existing housing stock, support for affordable rental housing, near transit services such as those available on federal nearby, and recommendations to simplify and update the city's land use and regulatory system whenever possible.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Blueprint, Denver established a single family residential concept land use for this area as described in detail in the staff report. Staff considers this proposed rezoning to be consistent with that concept land use because it allows the continued operation and reinvestment in an existing residential use and would actually reduce the opportunities for commercial uses on the site.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'With regard to the other criteria, this request will result in the uniform application of building form, use and design regulations for the SMU three zone district. It will further the public welfare by enabling the continuing operation and maintenance of affordable multi-unit housing, by establishing regulations for future redevelopment to create safe, active pedestrian spaces, thereby implementing adopted land'",
        "'speaker_2': 'use plans and policies. Staff agrees with the applicant's proposed justifying circumstance as the existing PUD adopted in 1985 should have accurately reflected the number of units on site that at the time of its adoption. And finally, staff finds that the proposed rezoning is consistent with the surrounding suburban neighborhood context.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So with that, CPD recommends approval based on a finding that all review criteria have been met. And I'd be happy to answer any questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right, thank you, Andrew. Appreciate it. All right. We have two speakers this evening. If they would come up when their name is called and you have 3 minutes each, we have Mark Lampert and Chairman Sekou. Again.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Good evening. My name is Mark Lippert. I'm here on behalf of the ownership and applicants Parkwood Plaza, and I work with the owner, Mark Venegas. And during our due diligence process late last year, we discovered this discrepancy between the number of units that exist at the property and the number of units that the current zoning calls out'",
        "'speaker_5': '. So we're here tonight to address that zoning issue and bring the property back into compliance and answer any other further questions. Great.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Stay cool.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yes. Once again, Chairman Sekou Blackstar Action Movement, advocacy group for poor, working, poor, homeless and senior citizens. We support the journey. We support the zoning change for a couple of reasons. One. From since I've been coming down here for the last almost ten years advocating for.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Our constituency. What has become evidently clear is that the zoning is crazy. And it's antiquated. And city council is always coming up with at the moment seeing contradictions and then trying to smooth the path so that the process is fair.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And so we think that this is a fair process that in order to be consistent with the zoning, that this is necessary to approve it. And also suggests to city council that a review be done of all zoning stuff that's inconsistent and make that into a package so that people don't have to spend inordinate amounts of money'",
        "'speaker_11': 'trying to straighten out city council business that should have been straightened out a long time ago. It's unfair. Persistence is also unfair for you guys have to go through that and spend time with that. So in addition to that, I just want to suggest to the folks who are anticipating these different projects, especially for our folks that'",
        "'speaker_11': 'we represent rapidly. Black folks are becoming an endangered species in this town. The neighborhood that I grew up in for 67 years at five points is now 72% white. And I know many times we talk about the gentrification and the unintentional consequences.'",

        "'speaker_11': 'So we suggest for folks who are doing these development projects, and I know it doesn't have much to do with the zoning that you're not required to do any of this. Anticipate the possibility that for us to be able to live in this town, we have to be able to work in this town.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And we have plenty of skilled labor. Councilperson President is working with unions and whatnot to develop a better skill test of plumbers and pipefitters and those kind of things. And over time. And so there are plenty of folks who have skills.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Who aren't even considered or when they show up to apply for these jobs. Their applications thrown in the trash. Now, folks call that one thing. Other folks call that the other thing. But the real deal, we're talking about a systematic and it needs to stop if we're talking about diversity in this town, which includes black people.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And I say that unapologetically. They deserve the same opportunities as other people in this town to work in this town and make this their home. Thank you very much.'",

So this came it was brought to our attention because it was out of compliance. And rather than having them go through all kinds of or all kinds of craziness, so to speak, you know, this this district was proposed'",
        "'speaker_10': 'just to kind of bring it back into compliance. But also, you know, here's here's one of the things I remember and one of the previous counsels sitting on some of these pads are so restrictive, they're not they don't know.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'They some of them were created in error, not anticipating growth, not anticipating the neighborhoods around them as they developed. And when you look at this property, the important thing about this property, you know, I appreciate one of the speakers speaking about this, but.'",

        "'speaker_10': ', it's important that we keep up with it. And so I here's the thing. There are a lot of these different pads around this the city, a lot of these kind of apartments scattered around the city. Not all of them have been brought to our attention.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But I really appreciate this one being brought to our attention. It's an important part of our neighborhood, and I know this real intimately because I had an uncle and aunt that lived here, had had neighbors that lived here, and there's some awesome little apartments, but they do need upgrading.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And in order to do that, we have you have to have you have to come in. You have to bring it into conformity. So. Mr. President, without further ado, I support this rezoning, and I think it's something that is a long time overdue.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. So as you all recall, we began this process back in 2016 where we started to develop the list of projects that were going to be considered as part of the 2017 Geo Bond. We began by using Elevate 2020, which is the city's six year capital improvement plan.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then we added on input that we received from the city's cultural institutions and Denver health, plus input from City Council and the public. From there, we went to the next phase, which was the evaluation and recommendation of list of projects that again, you'll see this evening before you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The foundational document that we used elevate 2020. Again, that capital improvement plan for the city actually has a culmination of projects that have received input over a series of years from neighborhood plans, community meetings, city council members, as well as city agencies that have taken technical analyzes and created projects out of those for our city assets.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Then, starting in 2016, over a year ago, we began six citywide public meetings co-hosted with City Council. Through that process, we received over 3000 ideas about potential projects which were part of the evaluation and ultimately either screened out or included in the final recommendation.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Over half of those comments were received were about transportation and mobility, which also was one of the initiatives that the mayor wanted to see a focal point on was transportation mobility. And then in 2017, as we entered into the evaluation and recommendation process, we've continue to take input from the public and have received, again, over 1000 comments'",
        "'speaker_5': 'to date associated with this list. So we in the evaluation and recommendation phase, we had over 60 volunteers, stakeholder committees within five discrete areas, transportation and mobility, parks and recreation, safety facilities, city owned facilities and arts and culture.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And those five subcommittees made a recommendation to an executive committee who then in turn did additional analysis and evaluation and made a recommendation to the mayor. The mayor then worked with council leadership to incorporate City Council's thoughts on the 2017 G.O. bond, which ultimately culminated in the list of projects and the bill ordinances that you'll see this'",
        "'speaker_5': 'evening. They started with over $3.6 billion worth of projects, had a very difficult task. We are very appreciative of their work as well as the input received by the public in council members. By the numbers, the total project value in the bills that you're seeing this evening is approximately 887 million.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We have an additional 50 million which gets you to the 937. That is part of the purpose contingency. Again, best practices. This has generated over 460 distinct projects. About half or over half is about fixing repairing what we have.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We've heard that loud and clear from the community through this process, and just about half of the funds are going towards transportation and mobility, which again was one of the mayor's vision and goal for this bond. We are also leveraging approximately 400 million and other people's money when we go forward with this bond.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Good evening, Laura Perry with the Department of Finance. If the ban is approved by voters, the debt authorized under the bond would be issued in multiple issuances about over a ten year period. Our bonds are secured by debt service mills to the tune of 8.43 mills, and the anticipated total repayment costs for the 937 million in principal'",
        "'speaker_7': 'is approximately 1.7 billion, and that's principal plus interest for a term of approximately 20 years. And of course, the city's two year bonds are currently triple-A by all three of our major credit rating agencies. Once the funds are issued, they will be managed by an oversight structure, which essentially will take a look at each project, its execution'",
        "'speaker_7': 'funds and the governance around those funds. The structure will consist with our of our department staff and leaders as a starting place. And further details on that structure will be provided once we pursue a program management structure for the bond.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'At a minimum, annual reporting will be put forward for how bond proceeds are expended and the status of our projects. But we fully expect to honor quarterly reporting, which we have done to date via the Better Denver Bond program.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And of course, city council will see all contracts over $500,000, including our debt issuances. The eight bills before you today are listed here on this slide. I'm not going to read each one, but our total proposed 2017 two year bond package is a little over 937 million.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'With the allocation among these seven listed in the table below and then the final ordinance is the companion ordinance which designates how each of the dollars will be spent within each of the ballot. Questions slash purposes listed on this slide.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Following tonight's second reading is next week on the evening of August 14th, which would be the referral to the ballot. Then between August and November would be the ballot campaign, with the vote concluding on November 7th and if approved by voters.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Department of Finance would seek to go to the market primarily the first quarter of the year and of course would bring forward that first issuance to City Council for approval. And that concludes the staff report.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. I did not introduce Laura Perry, but she's been doing a great job for the last year working on this. All right. I'm going to pass it over. For the amendment for Councilman Lopez and or Espinosa, who wants to go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I'll take. Thank you, Mr. President. So I'll make the motion first and then. Then explain it, if that's okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Now, you don't need to make them. Just explain it right now.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Oh, you just want. Okay. Yeah. All right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Just. Just for the 30 people who are about to speak so they know what you're talking about.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Gotcha. So let me just speak to the purpose of the amendment just as written. That way, you know, that we'll go into discussion later. But the the amendment that Councilman Espinosa and I have is to reallocate a portion of the bond proceeds associated with the debt issuance for transportation and mobility projects by eliminating the Federal Boulevard Infrastructure'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Project, thus freeing up 9.8 million to be reallocated as follows an additional 4.2 million for Morrison road improvements, bringing the total amount of bond proceeds to be dedicated to this project to 12,242,500. The addition of the following three projects were originally listed on potential projects list, but not included in the mayor's recommendation.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That's the Central Street Promenade, with the estimated cost of 850,000 Federal Boulevard pedestrian improvements, with an estimated cost of 2.8 million and West Colfax Transit enhancements with an estimated cost of 1.9 million.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Anything else you want to say about that? Guzman-Lopez Well.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Yeah, so let me just say this. Let me just, just start out by saying we were very happy seeing, you know, the process and you know, our amendment is not a critique of the process or anything like that.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We, we noticed that the this throughout the process, there have been some key projects that folks who you you'll hear from later had been working on for such a very long time. We know in the West Side there's just a lack of connectivity to the west of the to the rest of the city.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And, you know, it's still a long time of not being able to really fully have that connection in a lot of ways. 13th Avenue, some of the upgrades, the realignment, things like that are doing it down in the valley.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But when you look at some of that connectivity and mobility, there really is that barrier. And I think it's important that we address that. And also because along this stretch and it's not just Federal Boulevard, but the neighborhoods that surround Federal Boulevard also suffer from the same thing, is that there's just a lack of strong pedestrian transit'",
        "'speaker_10': 'oriented infrastructure. Right. And key nodes. And so although federal is important, you know, federal has seen its its fair share of work along the way. And what you're going to see, I mean, apologies ahead of time, but you're going to see a traffic nightmare because of the fact that we are also going to rebuild Federal Boulevard from'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Holden to Sixth Avenue, and that that kind of tops it off from the previous project was the previous closure that we had was rebuilding those bridges along Sixth Avenue and then from about Fifth Avenue down to Alameda, rebuilding Federal Boulevard.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So in a lot of ways, we have dedicated a lot of resources. And look, we identified we asked that I asked this question not too long ago during this process and wondering what this 9.8 million was during this process.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We knew we were following certain projects that were key, like Morrison Road, like West Colfax, and they were key because they are they are neighborhood centers, they are city centers. They move people and they are what we wanted to see was complete projects.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Well. They came through the processing complete from one from the committee to the executive committee, back and forth. We'd see it kind of like a like a tetherball. And there were times where I was just dying to scream and say, hey, wait, wait, wait, wait.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That's for this. And, you know, we're just respecting the process. We didn't do that. But in looking at filling those gaps, Morrison rode on West Colfax on on the the project that was supposed to happen a long time ago with the Central City Promenade and then also some portions of Federal Boulevard that were just high priority.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We just wanted to make sure that if we had an opportunity, why don't we complete the projects that were already there? Let's complete it and let's walk away from right there, complete. We can walk away as opposed to what we found in this $9.8 million that was allocated for Federal Boulevard.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It was really kind of like it was really, um, wasn't so ambiguous. It was pretty obscure. It was very general. And we understand, yes, there has been great work done on this federal corridor study. If we really wanted to try to make Federal Boulevard and transform Federal Boulevard into a transit corridor, ladies and gentlemen, it's going to'",
        "'speaker_10': 'take a lot more than $9.8 million. And in no way is it West Colfax or is it Colfax, but it is very important and it is that big of a deal. Right. And so when you look at this opportunity in this bond right now, you have you have these projects that were not completely funded.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And then a project that basically is is a pilot, right? It's much more of our it's much more worth our time and our investment to complete these projects, be done with them and move on to the next vision and actually look at reinvesting a lot of future resources into federal government as we do it.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And so it you know, I. If these funds are approved, does it get us any closer to the BRT? Does it does it or any other high capacity transit for that entire quarter? Does it stop momentum of the BRT?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I don't think so. But what this does on on the West Colfax side is because that BRT stops that just right at the federal Decatur station. Does it go any further despite Colfax being going all the way to Sheridan?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'This makes that connection. This allows us to connect to that BRT, make that East-West connection on and on. Further on Morrison Road, it actually allows us to make that East-West connection on a diagonal. The folks that are coming into the city, Van Morrison Road and what people really don't understand is that is a heavily used avenue for'",
        "'speaker_10': 'it. And so as that happens and as folks as you see here are working in along Morrison Road to transform that into their main street to their main corridor, the biggest obstacle to that is the lack of pedestrian infrastructure, the lack of stoplights, the lack of the lack of bulb outs and medians and pedestrian refuges.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So that's what that does. And it complete something that has long been awaited. Councilman, I look at you because I know you were part of that council a long time ago that really set that vision. So I also want to allow my colleague to chime in on that as well, too.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I don't want to dominate that, but that's really the heart of what we're trying to you know.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You guys are going to get another shot when we actually amend the bill to comment on it. I want to get these 30 folks out here. Thank you. Mr.. That gives them a good idea of what's going on.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. We have, first of all, the the public hearing for council bills, 812 to 819 is now open. We have 30 speakers. Remember that this is an hour courtesy public hearing. So I'll keep a timer with the president, pro tem Joe and Clark looking over my shoulder to ensure that it's at an hour and we don't'",
        "'speaker_0': 'cut you short at all. You have 3 minutes and I'm going to call the first five people, have them call you in five sets of five and just come up here to the front here and thank you. Take us and Laura for giving that up.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. For the first five, we have Rick Locke and tour George Sparks, Robin witnessing Steve Garrett and Sekou. Steve Gerrard. I'm sorry. Mr. Looking. You have 3 minutes. Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right. Well, thank you. Thanks. Council President Brooks. My name's Frank Logan. Tory. I live at 2145 East 16th Avenue, said City Park, West Council District nine, and just one block off of Colfax. I'm also the executive director for the Colfax AV Business Improvement District, and that runs from approximately the state capital on the West End to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'East High on the East End. My favorite quote about Colfax is it's the most Democratic street in Denver. It's accessible to all types of people. My second favorite quote is a little bit disparaging, comes from George Orwell in the late seventies who said the threat of nuclear annihilation loses a bit of its sting once one has visited'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Colfax Avenue. We've come quite a long way since then. And and I look forward to telling Mr. Will after the voters pass the bond in November, how far we've come. And it's been because of all the work that you and City Council and others have done, the community supporting lots of comments about Colfax improvements during the the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'community engagement price. The process that takes was talking about city staff has identified Colfax as an important corridor to invest in and then the Go Bond Transportation Committee and the mayor have both recommended that $20 million go to Colfax for eight miles of improvements, serving about 75,000 people in the city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The four Colfax bids have also been unified and organized. In order to be able to take this to it to another level, make the streets safer and and have a sustainable plan for the long term. And last but certainly not least, is the $55 million for the bus rapid transit that has also been recommended, which will serve'",
        "'speaker_2': 'approximately 50,000 people at its peak. It's 50,000 daily riders. So in a decade or two from now, when these people are going to be getting off of the bus on to Colfax, they'll be stepping on to a safe and friendly and vibrant Colfax.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And it's going to be accessible to everyone, regardless of their ability or income, whether they're a resident employee or a tourist. They'll have more freedom of choice of how to get there and things to do once they get there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And and I want to thank you all the mayor, the Bond Committee folks that volunteered.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Countless hours to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Doing it. And and thank you for supporting the $20 million going to Colfax improvements and the 55 million for the BRT. Mr. LARKIN See, that's it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You've run out of time.'",

And Councilman Cashman represents our family there, president and CEO of the Denver Museum of Nature and Science. And I'm here to express our collective support for the general obligation bond.'",

We represent city assets that have a global impact. All of our proposed projects repair and replace critical elements of our ability to serve a diverse population for decades to come.'",

And while our guests have happily been engaged and entertained over the years, our facilities are regularly impacted by this steady use.'",

Our $116.9 million request will help cover the costs of critical deferred maintenance and Enhanced Education Center replacement of a 50 year old animal hospital.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'The volunteers on the committees and to the staff who worked on this bond project. It was an amazing effort. And as I watched it coming new to the city of Denver, I have to say that I think that there's a great deal that everybody who is involved in this.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Denver Health Plans on using the $75 million request that is included in the geo bond as a partial payment on a new outpatient medical building that will be constructed on our campus. We started a process in 2013 of doing a master facilities plan, looking at all of the.'",

With those primary care clinics providing PCP, SE primary care physicians, behavioral health, substance abuse and other types of services in those clinics.'",

So when we have patients who come to our clinics and in 2014, we served 419,000 people, in 2016, where we served approximately 500,000 people. And that number continues to grow when patients need to be referred to a cardiologist or general surgeon or another specialist.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We are quickly reaching capacity in all of our specialty care clinics, and these are patients who are coming to Denver health from across every every part of the city of Denver.

When we open the building, we will include not only specialty care services that the patients need everything from cardiology, general surgery, new clinics for behavioral health.

        "'speaker_4': 'specialty services to the campus. So we think that this is something that the citizens of Denver, and particularly those citizens who are most vulnerable, are in desperate need of. So we ask you for your support on this.

        "'speaker_4': 'the outside.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you, Ms.. Weinstein. All right, Steve, draw. I get that last night.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You got it right the first time. Okay. What? Garrett? My name is Steve Garrett, and I'm a retired division chief with the Denver Fire Department for 37 years. And I'm here on behalf to thank you for putting on the bond issue several fire issues.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And thank you for your support to the fire department on all the other items. As a Division Chief, I was responsible for the building of new firehouses and for the maintaining of the existing ones, as well as all the other logistics.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And two of the issues tonight are the building of a new firehouse at 72nd and Panya, I believe that's Council District 11. And one of the reasons is we've identified that station as having a response time average of 5 minutes and 40 seconds.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'What we strive for is an NFPA standard, national fire protection, a four minute response time. We also have a committee, MRSA, in which we worked with council members at the time. I was on it for five years. That was Peggy Lehman.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And in order to meet that four minute response time, you have to build firehouses to do that. And those hotels have been out there since 1995. And we tried to get it. We had studies done both in 2003 and 2014.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And the 2003 study identified it. And they said at that time it would be a mid project to be put on the books at 2008 to 2014. Well excuse me, 2012. Well we all know what happened during that time with the big financial crisis and we weren't able to go through with the project.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But now we hope that we can continue to go through the project. And the other item on the list that I have a minute is some station repairs that deal with gender specific bathrooms, kitchens, replacing flooring, relocating a chief to the south district.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Because of our take over of Sheridan and Inglewood, we have to accommodate them at one of our stations out Southwest and the other. Items. As you know, when you get in construction, especially a building is over 40 years old and our oldest is 86 years old.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You're constantly dealing with environmental issues like as best as radon and a bunch of other items. So we're asking you for your support, and we thank you for your past support on these issues.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. All right. Thank you, sir. Last in the group of five is Sekou.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yes. My name is Chairman Sekou. After the third time up here, we pretty much know what I'm doing, who I represent, a particular focus. It's on in this bond issue. The libraries. Money for the libraries. We look at all of the numbers.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That's a lot of money. Libraries is at the bottom of the bill. And we know for a civilization to advance. They have to have knowledge, understanding and wisdom. Before you talk about a bus. Or before you talk about health care.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'No knowledge, no wisdom, no understanding. And then all of that falls apart. And yet it has the lowest numbers in it. And we know that a government commitment to its citizens and civilization is based on how you spend your money.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So the question becomes, oh, secret, how are you going to encourage? Black people to vote for this. How are you going to do it? Because when I look at the numbers and I've been down here coming in, watching how the money split up.'",
        "'speaker_11': '90% of the money is going to white male privilege. And then the rest this left 10%, which is the crumbs that everybody else got to fight for, ends up being an exercise in futility. So we need to stop lying about our priorities.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Stop lying about diversity. Your answers it because I. What would you do with your money? So stop lying about equal opportunity for women. I watch how you spend your money. Everybody just needs to be authentic about it and say, Hey, man, this is all about white supremacy and white privilege for males.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And we're going to take it back to where it used to be. Well, that's not going to happen because black folks ain't goin nowhere. We're going to stick and stay. We're going to fight for our right to be recognized and treated like human beings.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And that library on Welton Street is crucial to our legacy. Crucial to our legacy. I was up in the mountains, Arapahoe County, part of the national park, and it dawned on me that was named after Indian people. But guess what?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I saw no Arapaho Indians nowhere up there.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'No one.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And that's how the West is. One. That's how this one. So we've got to stop this. And we've got to stop it now. And you have an opportunity to do that. Because when this thing is voted upon and the money comes in, we've got to change the paradigm in terms of participation in how we do the money'",
        "'speaker_11': '. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Time's up. Thank you. All right, I'm gonna call the next five up here, and, um, I think I. I think we got that first name spell wrong, but if you. Your first initials. In your last initials, Rodriguez, you're up.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Jill Larkin. Tori. Denny O'Malley. Kristen. Monroe. And last one and this five is Bart Berger. This misread? Yes. I'm sorry. We spoke. Your name? First name?'",

        "'speaker_13': 'I would love to have this recreation center be built for the community, of course, and for my family. I used to go to a recreation center, but the recreation center was far away from my home. So I had to stop going to that center.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And the reason why was my mom works and there was no transportation. And as I mentioned before, it was. Way too far away. So I want to thank you guys and hope you consider giving us the grant. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'that will provide Denver residents with increased options for getting around our city.

        "'speaker_7': 'Practice of leaving it entirely up to private property owners to build and repair sidewalks has directly led to the current inequities in our city today and created a system.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Of haves and have.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Nots where only the wealthy neighborhoods have complete, well-maintained sidewalks. Tragically, the Denver residents who are most dependent on walking to get to transit, to get to jobs, to schools and other daily destinations, often live in neighborhoods with the worst sidewalks and the highest rates of people dying and suffering injuries in traffic crashes while walking.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This is not acceptable. The presence or absence of sidewalks should not be the indicator of whether a neighborhood is affordable or not.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To address this inequity, the city must proactively.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And systematically invest in building out a complete sidewalk network so that every Denver neighborhood has this most basic infrastructure that people need to get around safely. The 30.7.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Those are important to our legacy in our history, in the development of Denver and our relationship with the federal government. And it's a pretty interesting thing because that TCC camp was of course where the boys were who built the Red Rocks Ampitheater and we used other people's money to do it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This $2 million that's dedicated for this is is a lot of money. But when you consider the Denver mountain parks are 72% of Denver's park acreage, that's not a heck of a lot of money, but it is a significant amount of money when you consider that it's the first public, dedicated public funding since 1955 for the mountain'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you very much for having me. My name's Lesley to our Gal Ski. I am a resident of 1754 Olive Street in Denver, Colorado, and this is my first time ever addressing city council as a whole. So I'm a little nervous and thank you for having me.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm here to speak on behalf of the Espinosa Lopez Amendment. I got very jealous when Frank Logan tour got up and said that Colfax got I think we're up to $70 million federals. Current allocation in the bond is 9.8 million.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And as a person who has spent the last year as a member of the Federal Boulevard Corridor study and currently as a member of the Federal Boulevard Corridor implementation team, I think that Councilman Lopez, Councilman Espinosa, myself and several others feel that there's a better way to spend that 9.8 million.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It feels horrible to take money away from busses on federal to give it to pedestrians on federal. I hate that we've gotten to the point where we have to make a Sophie's Choice. However, I really feel that with the money, with with the plan that I have on the Federal Boulevard Business Improvement District, we can save that'",
        "'speaker_6': 'substantially, increase safety for pedestrians, train across federal both at 26th Avenue, which was listed as as a very important corridor for RTD as well as pedestrians. We also have a Denver City high school right there, school as well as veterans housing that was listed as one of the intersections of priority in the Federal Boulevard Corridor study.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Again, I want to thank Councilman Lopez and Councilman Espinosa, because I know that public works has worked very hard, but they were able to step back and look at the West Side as a whole and the connectivity again of the Westwood, the Morrison area, North Federal and and trying to get the all of all of us connected'",
        "'speaker_6': 'is no small feat. And thank you for helping us try to get to a space where this 9.8 million that has been allocated to us can make a little more sense. I appreciate you, Marybeth Sussman, for fighting for a very similar proposal in our neighborhood on East Colfax that was submitted by the Mayfair bid.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Again, this is my first time up. I hope it's I hope I don't have to come up again. But if I don't get the chance to come up again before the end of your term, Councilman Lopez, I have to thank you from the bottom of my heart, because for the last ten years, in every meeting you've been'",
        "'speaker_6': 'in, you've been such a strong advocate for Federal Boulevard and Colfax and West Denver. And I thank you from the bottom of my heart. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Mr. Tyler Gorski. All right, Julie Casale.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I council. Thanks for hearing me tonight.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Julia Consult the Community Development Co-ordinator at Brochu West on Morrison Road. I know you've heard a lot about this tonight, so I'm going to speak briefly. I'm here to support the Espinosa Lopez amendment for the additional phasing for Morrison Road.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This is extremely important for our community. They fought hard. They've worked hard. The community is here in support of this tonight. Numerous residents came to.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Speak at public counsel.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And to the committees. The community came forward to show the importance of completing this transit corridor from the West End and the East End to really pinch traffic, to slow it down and make this pedestrian friendly. Right now, the kids try to cross the road with their bikes and they can't.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So the parents are continuously driving their kids to school when they're closer to their own youth elementary schools than anywhere else in the city. We know that this additional.'",
        "'speaker_9': '4.2 million is a lot to ask for as it is to funding a different project.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But this would provide us a complete central street for Westwood Work to slow traffic and support continued growth for business, aiding us in building a commercial corridor and making this community stand on its own. We're committed to responsibly maintaining this as well.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We know you've spoken a lot about deferred maintenance and the pressure of this on the city, and we as a maintenance.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'District would like to take this on. And our business members understand that again, we urge council to support this amendment. And thank you for hearing me tonight.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Miss Hop Marshall Vandenberg.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you very much. Marshall Vanderburg. 2043 Grove Street in Council District one. Thank you very much for your time this evening. I'm here to speak to the Espinosa Lopez amendment that's on the floor. And I'm also president of the Federal Boulevard Business Improvement District.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The the business district is approximately five blocks long along Federal Boulevard, north of West 25th Avenue, and also goes over two blocks or one block over to Elliot Street. The area has historical significance as the town center for the City of Highlands annexed by Denver in 1896.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Three blocks reside in the Winter Coalfield Historic District.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Created in 1992.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'By the City Council. During the 1990s, Denver designated Federal Boulevard as a parkway. Also during the nineties, with assistance of federal dollars, Denver installed landscape center medians to enhance the parkway, feel and improve vehicular and pedestrian safety. Since this investment over 20 years ago.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Infrastructure. No other infrastructure improvements have occurred. In 2010, commercial vacancy rates in the project area exceeded 40%. Rights of way were aging and soaring, showing signs of deterioration. As board member of the Federal Boulevard Partnership, we organized a streetscape visioning effort involving businesses and residential communities to start addressing these issues.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'From the plans came additional community plans, community based efforts such as Denver's first Better BLOCK Project along West 25th and Elliott and the Organization of the Federal Boulevard Business Improvement District.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'To update the streetscape designs and to support pedestrian.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Oriented visions of past efforts, the federal bid developed a new set of plans early in 2010. The effort found that while the historic character of the area provides a foundational thematic element, the public right of way infrastructure supporting safe pedestrian mobility is aged and inconsistent.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This has further impacted due to population density in and around the project area, accompanied by new development. Several hundred people were involved and have been involved at this point of time. The federal bid led the effort to define this project permanent to the 2017 Denver Go Bond Initiative.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It was a Tier one project recommended by the Mayor's Transportation.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And Mobility Committee as part of the Go Bond effort.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We would very respectfully ask you to support the original reg original recommendation of the Transportation and Mobility Committee and also support this amendment on the floor this evening. I'm happy to be available for questions later on this evening as necessary.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. All right. Thank you, Mr. Vanderburg. Next. Group. Dan Schorr. Peep. Van Haven. Lance Wright. Uh. Mauricio Gomez. Oscar Gomez. Um. Dan, you're up first 3 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Well, good evening, council members, and.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you for the opportunity to speak. I'm Dan Schorr.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I live at 3014 Fourth Street. But I'm here.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Tonight on behalf of the West Colfax Business Improvement District and to talk about Colfax East and West. First of all, you know. To both all of you and the mayor, a great deal of thanks. I feel a great deal of gratitude.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Just for putting trans, you know, for.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The transparency that has been, you know, that throughout the process and the prioritization on improving mobility for pedestrians and the responsiveness to the public in general. And and that is all that all resulted in tremendous support. Thank you so much.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'For the support of Colfax improvements which Frank Looking Tory.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Earlier spoke to. I can only you know if I could just you know put did oh marks under there. Thank you. So that that's wonderful and. So in terms of. The amendment that has been offered by Espinosa. Lopez.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Espinosa. That's really why I'm here to talk as well. I want to speak in favor of that. I as I mentioned, I live on Forest Street, which is in Park Hill, as you probably know. And I work in West Colfax.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I take about, you know, some percentage of the time I take the 15 L, which is effectively what will become the BRT. Same routing, same busses, revised busses, that kind of thing. It is an unbelievable connection to go from west to east side all the way east on Colfax.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I get off at Glencoe. I get on in Decatur. Get off in Glencoe. Bring that further west so that the rest of the people in Denver who live on the west side along Colfax can make that connection and can get back and forth, east and west in town.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That is a huge opportunity.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And from the.'",
        "'speaker_5': '2.0 or the 1.9 million in that amendment is great leveraging in my mind for it, looking at networks.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Through the city and.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'How to best connect in really efficient ways and make transportation sort of like advance public.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Transportation in the city. So really, for those reasons, I would really support your.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I support the amendment on behalf of the West Colfax Business Improvement District, and I hope that you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Will just be. I again, thank you for your incredible.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Effort.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To show.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Balancing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Effort. Your time is.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Up. Balancing time. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Miss Shaw. Even here.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hi. Good evening. My name's Pippin Haven. I live in Park Hill and District eight and I'm here to support the current Gabon transportation package. I also represent Bicycle Colorado and.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Denver's active.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Transportation organizations that are members of the Denver Streets Partnership. We supported through this process the bond process, citywide sidewalks and citywide bike lanes, and unfortunately there are a few cuts in the executive committee. But we were really pleased to see that there were also some very important bicycle and pedestrian projects that were reinstated through the process.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We also really appreciated the process. It was clearly going to be broad and inclusive. It was obvious from the beginning with the community representation on the subcommittees and just with all the different opportunities that the community had to comment and provide feedback.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I really would like to commend the city on the process from our perspective.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Right now, Denver's.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Reached a pivotal moment with regard to transportation. We know there's tremendous pressure, pressure on our transportation system. There's challenging traffic problems, and clearly there's a lack of safe and complete networks for people who are walking and biking. That's our issue.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We see three key areas that Denver's facing. Really, the first one is a single occupancy vehicle issue. About three quarters of people in Denver are driving alone to work and our population is increasing. The people who want to.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Walk and bike and take transit aren't.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Able to yet because the safe options don't exist. The second is a public safety issue. One person every two weeks walking or biking on Denver streets was killed last year and one person every two weeks died walking or biking in Denver.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So let that sink in for a minute and consider.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That that's not people who are out jogging. It's not people out for a road wide ride. It's people who are trying to get from point A to point B. And the third is really that our transportation priorities have been out of balance for many years.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we are now to address our active transportation need, forced to play catch up. We know that creating a livable, walkable, bikeable Denver is important not just because mode shift is the only way to address congestion congestion, but also because how we get around town speaks to what we value as a city.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Many, many mobility options are going to bring individual and community economic opportunity and transportation equity also for neighborhoods that have been ignored and forgotten.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'For many years.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Transportation is the second biggest household expense after housing, so that's thousands of dollars in savings for families that can figure out how to reduce their dependance on driving. Looks like I'm about out of time, so I'd like to say we support the final package of transportation projects because the dollars are going to help increase safety access and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'connect people across neighborhoods. And we look forward to working with the.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Mayor and his council and.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Staff to create a safe, connected, bikeable and walkable Denver. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. It's been moving. We are at one hour. However, we still have a couple more. So if council allows and folks in the audience allow, we're going to keep going to in three more left. And thank you cultural for giving us another 15 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Lance Right.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Good evening, ladies and gentlemen of the Council. My name is Lance Wright, and I live at 1960 South Gilpin Street, which is down in Councilman Cashman's district. And I'm not sure exactly what I hope to accomplish tonight in 30 seconds, but I do want to raise the issue of autonomous vehicles.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'To the extent that any of this I must I'm going to confess, I have not paid a great deal of attention to the bond issue up until about a month ago. And the reason I didn't was because I was a good Democrat.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That looks like a tax increase. I was going to vote for it the that. A month ago, though, I heard a presentation by a gentleman named Tony Seeber, who is a Stanford professor, talking about how quickly the autonomous vehicles are going to take, are going to be in existence and going to start changing our transportation concepts about'",
        "'speaker_5': 'what a road can handle. His predictions are that it will be about five years before and only five years before we start changing of lanes into autonomous vehicle lanes. And the car has to be going 60 miles an hour all the time, a foot and a half apart, and we will double the trains, the capacity of freeways'",
        "'speaker_5': ', to the extent that the bond issue may have at least a couple of what road widening lane addition projects i. Hope that we can take advantage of the staged authorization of the bonds and expenditures so that we can make sure we're not building a roadway that is obsolete when we get it done.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And by the way, I'm not particularly nervous when you see me shaking up here. It's because I've got Parkinson's. And usually if I see that's going to be a problem, I say that upfront so that you know that I know that, you know, I know I have Parkinson's and it's no big deal.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So don't worry about me fainting. I'm not going to faint, at least not from Bashful Ness about speaking in front of an audience. So that's the point that I wanted to let you hear tonight, that autonomous cars are coming and they're coming rapidly.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Uh, they're out there now already and experimental numbers. But when it happens, it will revolutionize our concept of a freeway. And Denver shouldn't spend any money on an obsolete, freeway widening project if that's in the works. Without real careful consideration for how the world is changing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Usually we can look at the past to see what worked well in the past and extend extend at a certain distance into the future. But the past is not going to be an example for us to follow. We need to look to the future and computers will be driving your car while you're reading about the council meetings'",

I'm representing the GSA Coalition for Health and Housing Justice, as well as the Cross Community Coalition.'",

        "'speaker_15': 'You know, we really do need emergency housing right now for people who are being displaced. There's 88% of people who are at risk of being displaced right now as we speak. You know, with CDOT coming through and doing the I-70 expansion, Western Stock Show doing their renovation there, they're they're displacing a lot of people.'",
        "'speaker_15': 'A lot of these people who have been here for generations and years are not being able to continue to live in these communities where they have their roots and their families that I want to you know, I want you guys to take into consideration that we do need affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_15': 'We have a solution as a community owned land trust for our communities to be able to to continue to stay here. And this would also benefit the city by alleviating some of the problems for people who are who are counting on Section eight, food stamps, health, you know, health assistance, things like that.'",
        "'speaker_15': 'If we can get this housing done. It'll cost about $15 million to run this for five years. And, you know, this you know, this would be one time investment. It'd be able to continue to have people to have homes, affordable housing for years and years.'",
        "'speaker_15': 'So it's a one time investment rather than having to reinvest money into Section eight or housing assistance and things like that. And this is the reason why I'm here, is I do want to advocate for these, you know, for for you guys to consider allocating some of these funds for affordable housing, emergency housing, like there's people who'",
        "'speaker_15': 'are who are at risk right now. 88%, eight out of ten of these people who live in these communities are being pushed out. Is $14 million the cost to replace the homes? See, that is taken. And that's you know, that's almost pretty much the housing fund that you guys are allotting to us.'",
        "'speaker_15': 'So, you know, just to put sidewalks in is not an improvement. So our community, we need help with creating that affordability, the sustainability of housing. And we need to get these funds, you know, to our community and not just to improve infrastructure that's going to bring more people in here, more outsiders, more people who are just developing'",
        "'speaker_15': 'and trying to make money on the plight that's going on here in these neighborhoods. So I really appreciate you guys time. Please, if you get a chance to look at the report, if you don't have the report as coalition dot com, you can download a copy.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Gallegos. All right, Kendra Black, you're up with questions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilwoman Q I wanted to ask a question about what former Councilwoman Cathy Donahue brought up. So maybe Laura Perry. She just walked out, unfortunately. But I know in my my two years as a council person, I have received multiple briefings on how the 27 better Denver bond was spent.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so to address her concerns, I feel like you are one of the most competent people I've ever met in my life. You are on top of it. And you know where every single penny has been spent ever?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Wow. You go.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Laura and I feel very confident that that you will stay on top of this bond in the same way. So if you could just explain to everyone how you go about doing that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Absolutely. So we have an extensive project control system in the city that consists of a very strong governance structure, particularly around our financings. So for the better Denver Bond Program, as I commented earlier, we implemented our what we've called our bond executive committee that was comprised of department leadership.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The Mayor's office, Department of Finance, as well as a member from city council. And that group was truly the oversight body that reviewed every project, its current status. And if we all recall in Better Denver we experienced the Great Recession.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So there was a lot of project savings that were reprogramed for additional project needs throughout the city. And that committee also worked through the governance structure around how those funds were programed with the goal that we complete every single project that was committed to the voters, and we truly did accomplish that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In fact, we accomplished 100 more projects the better the bond program that was promised to the voters. So that was a huge success story. Through the Better Denver Bond program, we instituted quarterly reporting, which consisted of both a website presence as well as regular presentations to the Land Use and Transportation Committee that still continues today.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We also have extensive project tracking systems, so on the technical side, we do track every dollar to the penny as well as every single project when it started, when it was completed. And actually for our Better Denver Pan program, we have a one page write up for every 388 projects that were completed.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So there is strong institutional record there about the great successes that we had in that particular program. And of course, last but not least, I want to mention that in our annual budget we also report out on our bond programs in that we show how much has been spent in the particular prior year as well as what's'",
        "'speaker_7': 'estimated to be spent, and an update on the status of all the projects underway for all of our financed programs.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Great. That comes when I'm black.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah. Thank you. Sure.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I actually want to before I jump to Councilman Flynn, call Kweli or anyone from the legal team to ask a question around Bond. Um, not only. So not only do we feel like we have a responsibility and some systems built in financially through our fiscal responsibility, but we have some legal responsibilities in how we spend that money'",
        "'speaker_0': '. So real quickly, what are our parameters in a kind of very macro? And what happens if we spend money outside that?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening, President Brooks. Council members. Yes, there are legal parameters around how these proceeds can be spent. And in addition to the kind of tracking that Laura has described, there are legal requirements in terms of making sure that we're spending money in a timely fashion.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I think, Councilman Brooks, one of the questions you're asking is around the timeframe in which the proceeds need to be spent. The rule is that you have to spend the dollars from the date you issue the bonds so that that process is that we will come back to you with a bond ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And once that ordinance is adopted, we'll actually go out to the market and issue bonds from the date that they're issued. You have three years to spend. 85%.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If what? If what if we don't? What if we take four years? What if you take five years? What happens?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, you have a you need to have a reasonable expectation that you're going to spend 85% in three years. If you if we exceed that period of time. There are things that we can do. There are remedial steps that we can take.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And what about, you know, the specific question around spending outside a specific purpose.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So before you, you have seven different ballot measures. Each measure speaks to a particular purpose. As we spend our dollars, when we issue the bonds, we will do it in accordance with those seven different purposes. So, for example, if we spend, we decide we're going to say we're going to issue $100 million of debt in the first'",
        "'speaker_1': 'tranche. Not. First issuance. How about that first series? You can say trends that might cover four or five different purposes, but we will track and last time will be tracking how many dollars we're spending in each purpose, because the voters are going to give us authorization to spend up to a certain dollar amount for each purpose.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So, for example.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is there real quick and you don't have to go in to that, but specifically, is there any penalties that the city will endure if we go outside of a purpose that voters have authorized?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We legally we don't have authority to do that. So the voters are going to give us authority to issue approximately 116. I don't I don't have the numbers. Yeah. Hundred and $16 million for the purpose of improvements to cultural facilities.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So that's where I just wanted to put a fine remark on that, that we don't have the authority to do what was stated earlier to spend outside a specific purpose.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes, that's correct.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. President. A number of questions, Laura. Could you tell me what the current thinking is with regard to how much in principal amount might be devoted to the mini bond program with a program of this size?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Certainly. And as you know, Councilwoman Ortega and I have been urging you to size it a lot larger than the 2007.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So there is a commitment to follow through with a mini bond transaction for the upcoming bond. However, an amount at this time has not been determined.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. So is there any thinking about whether it would be more than that? There was a 12 million last time.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'm going to actually invite Brendan Hanlon or CFO.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'To go because I have some questions for him too. Good. And, and he did well because I actually prepared him. I told him I was going to ask the other questions. So. And these are bonds that individuals can purchase.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So they're in small enough power amounts that we can you know, homeowners can purchase them and and really invest in their own neighborhoods and get a return on them. So it's a really good program.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's right. Good evening. Brendan Hanlin, the city's chief financial officer. I think this question came up a couple of weeks ago as well. So far, the Department of Finance is committed to a program that is at least as large as leasing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In 2011, we did hear feedback about having a larger program. We're willing to entertain that conversation. The one thing I have to caution is that there is a higher administrative cost to processing that, and we pay a higher interest rate on those transactions.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we just have to balance that out around the needs of the program. But we're willing to have that conversation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Thank you. And while you're there, Brendan, you know that one of my greatest disappointments with this package is in the public safety package, because for ten years, folks in southwest Denver had been. Virtually promised that the district for police station replacement would be part of this bond issue.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We would. We were told to wait the turn. And and I dearly love that we're doing Districts five and District six because they probably need it more than District four. But in the alternative to waiting another ten years before we can issue another round of general obligation bonds.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'What kind of tools do we have and can we start using them in 2018, for instance, you know, bringing you do an architectural study or a programmatic study or some sort of incremental approach to the CIP program to get a start on providing some relief down there.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Councilman, you allude to the proper first steps in and really identifying funds is the first thing you have to do is really identify the scope and figure out what exactly you're going to do. That would require some incremental funding that could be funded through something like CIPA or the general fund or something along those lines, which is'",
        "'speaker_5': 'something that we're considering at this point. And then that would help define a larger scope, which might require larger tools. I think the last time I was here, I said, we just have to make sure we're matching the size of the tool with the size of the project.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Right. So do you know, can you say if the administration right now, which is preparing 2018 budget, will this be will will something for district for police station be included in the budget, if you know?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we're working through the 2018 budget as it stands.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So you don't know.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We're not done with it yet. I could tell you that it's something under consideration, though. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And can you speak to the transportation bonds or who can speak to that?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I probably need to bring.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Some in in Council Bill 812, which is the referring to the ballot, the transportation package. I noticed as Mr. President, as you know, I.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Would.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'An error what I think is an error, and maybe we need to correct it, but it refers to rehabbing the Eighth Avenue Viaduct. I believe it's an $8 million scope. There's been some bearing issue with the bearings in the piers, but he refers to it as an 88 year old structure.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The Eighth Avenue Viaduct was just it was done under Mayor Pena. And I know it seems like a while ago, but it wasn't 88 years. Are we referring to the actual viaduct over the rail yards, or are we referring to the bridge over the Platte?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Over the Platte.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It is referring to the bridge over the Platte, which has not been replaced.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Since.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It was constructed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Because when I think of the Eighth Avenue Viaduct, I think of the over the rail yards, which are now closed. And so. Okay, thank you. I believe, Mr. President, that's all I have right now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Nice. Nice try. Councilman Fletcher.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, it's not a fight. It's the bridge over the plaque. Should which should we change that? To change that to the Platte River Bridge, Eighth Avenue. Platte River Bridge, rather than the Viaduct Council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is that a real question?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Because the Eighth Avenue Viaduct is a different structure. Just a question, Mr. Perez. I do have one more thing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I shouldn't have said anything.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I would have to defer to the city attorney's office for the amendment in the companion ordinance and what that would look like. However, we will be sure to adequately describe the scope. Sorry, I.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Just don't misapplied the money to the viaduct instead of the the river the river bridge. They all save the other the other as a comment and I'll save that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay? Yes. Okay, that'll work. Councilman Lopez.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you. My question had been answered, but Councilman Flynn, I do appreciate that technically it is not a viaduct. But just so you know, I was the only bridge in that one of the only bridges in Denver that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Survived survived the flood. That's right. That's right.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Still there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It was opened in 1929.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Okay. Question question.'",
        "'speaker_2': '28.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilor Lopez, was that your question?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Mine was answered.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, great. Okay. Councilwoman Ortega and then Black.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I'm not sure who in the audience or maybe a couple of my colleagues that have been working on the Colfax BRT. I just wanted to ask, is that proposed to go down in the center of Colfax?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's the new design. Yes. And Chrissy Agnello, I see you back there behind those heads.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And raising this because I was in Albuquerque, New Mexico, about three or four weeks ago, and they are building a similar project down the center of one of their main streets. Yeah. And everybody in the community is complaining about it because people will be let off into traffic.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It's it. And I'm I'm assuming that, you know, we've been looking at this very carefully, and I, I would hope they they were as well, but. You know, in order for people to be let off on the platform, the busses will have to go in the wrong direction on, you know, in order for them to be let'",
        "'speaker_9': 'off. And I don't know how far along we are with the. You know, design of how this would work. But can you help me just understand how that is proposed to work so we're not creating a greater safety problem for residents or for pedestrians that are would be utilizing this bus BRT.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I apologize, I haven't sat through all the meetings where this has been, you know, proposed and worked on with the community.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yeah, thanks for having me up, Chrissy. Thank the director of Transportation Mobility for the city and it's a good question. So when we were out of the public last week, one of the things we heard about with regards to Colfax, BRT, was can you make it better?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so we actually took some time over the last year to look at the geometries along the corridor to see if center running could fit, because if it didn't fit, then we weren't going to move forward and we were able to determine that it does actually fit geometrically.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We're not terribly far along in the design. We've got some funding available right now to actually help us start to move forward. It's it's a little bit it's much easier to see in a picture or a video. The busses will still have the normal right side boarding that they have today.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'They will pull into the station and on the right is going to be where the platform will be, where it'll be at least 10 to 14 feet, where that's where the folks will get on and off, will have some railings to sort of direct folks to actually crossing at the intersections with.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Colfax is one of the highest injury network's roadways on the network for Vision Zero. We actually believe this will help significantly with reducing the safety issues that are out there for pedestrians in particular.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Great. Thank you. I do have a couple others. I just and they're not necessarily questions, they're more comments.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I do.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You want to you want to wait to the comment portion?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Sure. Yeah. Let me just make sure I didn't have any other questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. The rest are all comments. So thank you. Great. I'm sorry. The apprenticeship piece. This was something that came up at the mayor council meeting last week, and the mayor said this is something that he's looking at, he's working on.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Do any of you have any information on progress? I see Evan coming to the microphone. David Dreier, can you Evan, can you tell us kind of where this is at in the process so that as we're looking at this almost million dollar bond package that we will have a firm commitment to.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And as you all know, there's so much construction going on. We don't have enough trained, skilled workers and being able to utilize both union and nonunion apprenticeship programs to help ensure that we've got the workforce needed to do these projects.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Where are we in the process of that being a critical element of the bond package?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening, Council.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Evan Dreier, Deputy Chief of Staff to Mayor Hancock.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'A couple of points about that. The carpenters union came to us a few weeks ago with this idea, which in one way or another.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Has been kind of kicking around for a little while.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Quietly reminded us very quickly that we can't actually use bond proceeds for programmatic purposes like job training or apprentice or pre apprentice programs, which is a very helpful reminder. But I think there is a lot of interest in pursuing this kind of a concept.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think there are a few different council members, including yourself, that have been looking at it for a little while. So our request is let's move these bills through the council process on the bond and then let's figure out a process where we are all at the table.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Trying to look at this together, because there are.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There are billions of dollars of public projects that will be moving through the pipeline over the next ten plus years. And we want to make sure that we are doing everything we can to provide jobs and skilled skills training to folks that will be filling those jobs.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Well, and it's important to make sure that we don't have people who are being impacted in what is becoming almost citywide, gentrified neighborhoods to be able to have people afford to stay in their own communities. So it's a critical component.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Agreed.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So nothing further has taken place yet then in terms of next steps that the administration is working on, it's just a commitment to do it. But maybe I think it sounds like you're suggesting that we pull a meeting together with some of the folks who are interested in making this happen.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Correct. Including Denise Bryant.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Our director of work for me.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. Thank you. I'm looking forward to us taking that next step soon.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We are, too.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. Thank you. I'll wait on my comments until the end. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. All right. The public hearing for Council Bill four four for the combined public hearing of all the council bills is now close. We have comments by members of council. But I want to I want to say that we have seven bills and I want to, you know, get you know, council members could make a comment'",
        "'speaker_0': 'on one bill to, you know, take care of the entire package or you can make a comment per bill. But I would ask that you think about that judicious in your comments. So, Councilman Espinosa. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This is a single brief comment. It's long, but it's brief. First of all, I want to thank you all. Truly thank you all for paying attention to this process. Clearly, it's been done because everything that I mentioned that should be scrutinized a little harder in this bond process was mentioned here tonight or via email defending their inclusion'",
        "'speaker_0': '. So thank you for persisting. It is important to put people to those projects, so it's really nice to see you all out here speaking to it and supporting the process.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I want to thank Councilman Lopez.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'For his thorough work on finding this amendment that we put forward tonight. And this amendment opportunity, I should say, which is greatly simplified. The amendment request, due to initial confusion at the beginning of the job on process, a tiny but high priority project was removed from consideration that is added through this amendment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Our amendment funds pedestrian infrastructure that has gone unfunded since it was included in the 19. In the 1995 intergovernmental agreement between city and sea that went public, this public right away was altered and lost to a widened I-70 through the city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I mean, I-25. Sorry. Freudian slip there. Sorry. At a time at a time when single occupant drivers have increased it more in northwest Denver neighborhoods, the nearest nearest to downtown than any other place in the city. Supporting this amendment will encourage and further prioritize free and safe walking through important public right of ways in west and North'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Denver. So so everything that I mentioned. Somehow I got to cut and pasting sounds. So I want to thank you. And sorry about this is not my normal computer. So free and safe walking through this important these important public roadways in west and north Denver.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So please join me along with those whom spoke in support of this amendment and vote yes. Thank you very much. All right, Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. President. A procedural question, is the amendment on the floor yet? Because I had a question on the amendment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This amendment is now on the floor. It will get to the floor at 819, where? At 812.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Thank you, Mr. President. Then I will. Can I make comments on the package as a whole? It said in the ordinance designating the projects. I just wanted to let folks know that next week I may propose an amendment to change the words, for example, to the word, including, as we had in earlier bond issues, so that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'these projects are included and not just examples that may or may not be may or may not be done. I want to provide the public with some assurance that these projects listed are included and not just examples of projects we may do.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I've asked for that to be drafted and circulated among my colleagues during the week. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you. Councilman Flynn. Councilman Lopez.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Yeah. Thank you, Mr. President. We'll speak to the amendment when we cross that that bridge, not the viaduct. I wanted to thank everybody. Take us, Laura, the team, they did such a great job. You know, when we first talked about the bond and how we were planning on for us, I mean, you got to include Corky Gonzalez'",
        "'speaker_10': 'library as a site. I just I just remember I remember a picture that was printed in The Denver Post. And I think it's just something that John Murray had wrote about. And in the picture was Norma's hand with a whole bunch of stickers and the whole bunch of stickers were just centered around this this neighborhood that I'",
        "'speaker_10': 'grew up in and I live in. And, and, um. I was just I'm just happy as a city councilman to be part of a bond that addresses equity. That's really a revolutionary and progressive, forward thinking bond that helps balance the city.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And that's what it's doing. Its per its equity is different from equality and equity leveling the playing field so that we all have the opportunity to compete and not necessarily to compete in this case, but to really give neighborhoods the opportunity to prove who they are.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Right. And just what how important they are to Denver and on an equal level playing field and to to hear folks tonight hear that wonderful little girl giving us things. Right. That's just that's just the tip of the iceberg of what this is about.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I know we're going to face a lot of criticism. I know we already hear it from our critics. But at the end of the day, these are these are the very projects that are going to be the game changers for the neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Right. The bridge, the Sixth Avenue. You look at the the the transit mobility throughout the city and the West Side, the connection. And, you know, I could just say this, colleagues, you know, there's there's nothing better than seeing those things come to fruition.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And it's taken a very long time to get to this point. And there's a lot of hard work that's represented here. These aren't just things that just end up on a on a on a Post-it, you know, with Post-its on a wall or they're not just things that just end up with numbers by them.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'These are actually every single one of these projects has work to it. Right. And effort to it. And. And having said that, I'm just very I'm very glad to actually be part of this bond and seeing it move forward now.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And, you know, we put it on the ballot, but it's going to take voters, it's going to take our public getting out there and approving it. And I just have to say this and and just thank you to all of you who participated.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you all for identifying these issues, for identifying these needs, and not just being an armchair activist at home in front of a computer, but somebody that comes out to these meetings, someone that visits some of the talks about these priorities, someone that shows up at a microphone, even if you're only four years old.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Right. You have a voice and it matters. And thank you. And this is you know, I just kind of think about one of my colleagues recently. It's blew my mind. Right. And it shouldn't blow my mind, but. Paul Kasten We were having a conversation, he says, you know, and somebody says, Hey, you know, what do you think'",
        "'speaker_10': 'your purpose is? What's your purpose? And we all thought about our purpose. And he says, to restore our faith in government. That's exactly it. And his bond helps get us there. Right. And for a lot of people on the west side, it's going to restore that faith in government.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So now there's a couple of other things that I want to paint is to make sure you all know it's never over until it's over. And we want to make sure that before before he hits the ballot, that everything's.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Organized to reflect just that that work that passionate work product that comes out of the neighborhoods. Right. Those are the priorities. So and it's by number one, which was the crisis of those days, because that NAKI can win year on year participation.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'You see a Luciano Londono seller was.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. All right. Thank you, Councilman Lopez. Councilman New.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I also want to thank the two tigers and Laura and Courtney I honestly Courtney here and I and so but also I want to thank the woman who is sitting back there real quietly in the back row. And I say in a word is Dianne Barrett, who's been the the mother of all bonds here.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And she.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'She is she is her leadership is invaluable. And what a great team she assembled. And they've done a magnificent job, though the feedback we got from the public, which is phenomenal, it was a great process where everybody was participating and felt good about it and gave, gave, gave their $0.02, even know that even though they knew they'",
        "'speaker_8': 'weren't going to get all the money they wanted, but they felt like they were valued and and their input was was truly appreciate. We do have some you know, I fully support this bond issue. And I just hope the citizens will look at each one of those items carefully and and each item and I was in the'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Parks Task Force, and we went through every item in excruciating detail asking questions. So there's a lot of attention paid to every specific item in this bond issue. So I hope the public will take a look at it and then ask questions if there's information that you can get on the website or the staff's here to help'",
        "'speaker_8': '. And and it's just a very important you understand how important this bond issue is. But also, I can't help but say we also got to keep in mind, we've got other needs coming down the road. Our strategic planning processes are coming due next next year.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And and and Councilwoman Susman made sure get our transit agency and hopefully hopefully Christie will get a dedicated revenue stream for transit. We're to we're just taking the baby steps with transit. And so we've got to come up with additional money down the road.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So this important bond issues is is going to be a good start. And, you know, just let the citizens know it really helps build a great city. I appreciate all the efforts. Thank you, Mr. Brown.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman. Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you, Mr. President. So, first of all, I want to just express my support for the amendment that is that has been talked about tonight. I think those improvements for Westwood in the Federal Boulevard corridor are important to address pedestrian safety.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Really pleased to see that so much around mobility, pedestrian and bike safety is a big part of this process. I know this council has been very vocal about those kinds of things, have been sort of high priorities in our annual planning process and has resulted in more and more funding in the annual budget.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And this bond package takes that significantly further in addressing issues that many neighborhoods across the city put on the table as wanting more walkable, bikeable neighborhoods. I want to express my appreciation to the entire city team for the many neighborhood meetings that were held across the city that truly gave Community the opportunity to go to a meeting'",
        "'speaker_9': 'in their own respective district, you know, in their neighborhood where they could share what their priorities were. I know all of our city agencies had their lists as well, identifying their priorities and to the. Multitude of volunteers that were on the different committees that had to help whittle down those lists and put forth a list to the'",
        "'speaker_9': 'executive committee that then worked with the mayor's office. This truly engaged our community in a way that I haven't seen that that just. Was so inclusive in to Councilman Lopez's point that that truly addressed equity as well. And to see that the Alameda underpass, which was an issue going back to when I represented part of that District'",

        "'speaker_9': 'So this is a really, really important component of this bond package, 56th Avenue, which I know Councilwoman Gilmore has has been very vocal in wanting to see in this package, because we know when that I-70 project starts, traffic is going to be going through our neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And it's important that they the traffic stays on arterial corridors and not through the residential neighborhoods. The sidewalk piece that is going to address the needs for sidewalks, I know the geese, neighborhoods, Globeville area, Swansea, who have never enjoyed the benefit of that basic infrastructure that many of our neighborhoods have.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I know other neighborhoods have bits and pieces here and there, but these neighborhoods really have not enjoyed that. And this is going to go a long way in assisting bringing that basic standard of living up for for those neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The one thing I'm I'm really sad is not part of this package and you heard a number of the speakers talk about is the fact that we have no affordable housing in this package. And when you consider the size of it, you would have thought we would have carved out a way to ensure that we've got more'",
        "'speaker_9': 'than the $15 million that was worked on by Councilman Brooks and Councilwoman Kennedy. But if our HUD funding goes away, all that does is is replace that. So the need for us to continue to work to ensure that we have more dollars to address affordable housing is is so critical to us continuing to be a diverse city'",
        "'speaker_9': 'which, you know sadly we're we're losing our diversity at rapid pace as. I also appreciate the mayor's office, his commitment to the apprenticeship program, which I know can't be part of the Bond language, but it could be part of the contracts that we have with our contractors that will be doing much of this work.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And lastly, the fact that we will have the companion ordinances that will go with each of the package to ensure that, you know, the dollars stay within each of those categories. If for some reason a particular issue doesn't move forward, the dollar stay within that category.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So thank you to everyone, including my colleagues who sat on the various committees as well. Councilman Brooks, you were part of the executive committee. It was a lot of work, but we've got some great projects in this package that are moving forward.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I'm I'm excited to be a strong supporter of this one package moving forward and look forward to talking to our neighborhoods as I'm out and about in the community.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you, Councilwoman Ortega. Councilman Herndon.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Like most, I want to give kudos to the team for all the work that they have done up to this point. When you have the needs that we have versus the resources, there are several difficult decisions that had to be made.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I appreciate the conversations that I have had with the administration. They have understood my my desire to try to increase library funding. And even though it's not something I'm going to bring an amendment forward on, I still am I still something I want to work really hard for our libraries because those are investments in people.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And as I hear and compliment everyone for all the work, then as I look at it, that was just the easy part because it's all for not if we can't get it to pass in November. And so for those of us that are supportive of the bond as I am, we have work to do to make sure'",
        "'speaker_5': 'that people understand what they will be voting on because there will be several questions on the ballot and the importance of each and every one of them so that we can continue have a great city. We have to make these investments.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And even beyond that, what do we do for the investments that could make it in this bond package? Because we cannot afford to wait another ten years. As Councilman Flynn and I, during the break, we're talking about his police station.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so we can't afford another ten years before that comes. Other projects for our bikes and infrastructure for sidewalks. We've got to find ways to get this done. So a lot of work is still ahead of us, but I want to applaud everybody for their efforts and we will we will get it done.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Herndon, Councilwoman Cannick.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. President. And I want to thank all the speakers tonight, especially the members of the public who stayed late on the hard benches. And I am very impressed with the unity that has been demonstrated for folks who maybe didn't get full funding for projects or, you know, got some projects but not others.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'For some neighborhoods, I think it's an incredible testament to the coming together of a community. And on that point, I think what's really powerful for me, I think, is the way that this conversation has crystallized a couple of things that I hope will become precedents for the future.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I taught our law school class recently back at my alma mater, and I was teaching about the difference between equality and equity. And equality is where you have a pie and you divide up all the pieces and that's equal.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But equity is where you look at where there is historic disadvantage and where there's structural inequity. And you say that sometimes you have to invest a little more to overcome those things. And I think that, you know, we've heard tonight about the Westwood Recreation Center.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We've heard about some of the investments in Globeville area, Swansea, you know, the the bridge that Councilman Ortega worked so hard on. And I think that the the fact that the community has come together around this package in the council is, you know, at least based on last times, comments coming together around this package is a sign'",
        "'speaker_4': 'of us understanding, a really nuanced conversation about how the way we spend infrastructure, resources can help to both, you know, rectify, mitigate and help to prevent that kind of inequity from from reoccurring in our city in the future.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Right. So that we don't have the same kind of historic challenges in terms of health disparities or poverty or safety of of lack of sidewalks, things like that. So so I'm especially proud of that piece of it. And I appreciate how this isn't just something that came from the community, but it was also echoed by the staff'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and the guidelines and the criteria and from the mayor. So I felt like that was coming from both the top and the bottom. I think apprenticeship actually fits in that same lens. And I, you know, just to to to just pick a little bit at the the legal advice, again, apprenticeship is a procurement requirement, just like is'",
        "'speaker_4': '. So when you want wealth to be spread to the owners of businesses who are women or minorities, the way that we do that is we say, if you want to do business with the city, it's important that you have women and minority owned businesses on your team.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We don't pay them for that. It's not a program funding. It's something that it's an expectation that they bring to the table when they bid. Apprenticeship works in the same way it works by saying, if you would like to do business with the city, show us that you have training programs that are bringing people along.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We have a real financial interest in this in the city. It's not just to do good thing. It is. It's important to build training and create pathways to careers for folks. But Stu Williams at the airport will tell us that when there's a shortage of construction workers, we pay.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We pay as a city more for our projects and more for the labor. And so it is very much in our pecuniary financial interests to have contractors investing in that training and doing that training. I'm not going to say there's not the benefit of city resources for things like pre apprenticeship or maybe providing, you know, boots or'",
        "'speaker_4': 'childcare, things that can complement it. Those things don't come from these contracting packages in this city or in most cities. They come from, you know, complimentary funds and things like that. But I just want to make really clear that as a procurement requirement, I believe that could be in this ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I believe it would be appropriate to be. We haven't had time to have a full conversation, and I get that. But I just, again, don't want anyone leaving thinking that that this kind of a requirement is one about the city paying for a program.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This is not about a program. This is about a way of doing business that integrates training. And so I hope that we do continue the conversation. We could always potentially amend this ordinance if we are able to figure out the best way to do that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I think it is it is linked into this to the themes in this package in many of the same ways that speakers talked about the projects and the way that the projects and the people come together. The last thing I just want to say about why I'm so supportive of this project tonight, and I think it's'",
        "'speaker_4': 'important for us to remind folks when we go out and talk to them is that this bond package is made possible with our existing property tax mills. And so it does not represent us needing to bring out or charge people additional mills to pay for this bond package.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think that's a really important message and one that I think is an important way, that this is a balanced approach with paying for things, but with existing property tax mills that we have. So with that will be enthusiastically supporting it and continuing to work on the things that didn't make the list like housing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's right. Thank you. Councilman. Can each Councilman Lopez. I see you're up, but go to Councilman Cashman.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So you can. Thank you, Mr. President. I'll repeat some of what you've heard from some of my colleagues about what I wanted to say. Mainly, as I remember, maybe it was a month, six, six weeks or so ago, sitting with Evan Dreyer and talking about the the bond package and telling them that at that point I was'",
        "'speaker_2': 'a no vote that I expected to get to. Yes, but it was just that point in the process where the stew wasn't wasn't cooked enough. And and I knew there was room for movement in the process and and move the administration moved.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They didn't blink. And they held the line on certain elements that they felt very strongly about. But on other areas that were important to me, there was movement not just in my district but in other districts around the city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I sit here today. A yes vote, an enthusiastic yes vote. And if I were to have been the only one to have been asked to put this bond package together, it would look somewhat different. I think any one of us would write a slightly different package.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But there is so much good in this. And you know the old thing about not letting perfection interfere with the good and. So much of so many of the projects in here are jumping off points that if we don't move forward with them, they're nice starts, but they're not getting us where we want to go.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know, the project that I talk about a lot, you know, our sidewalk infrastructure, we need hundreds of millions of dollars over the next couple of decades. Okay. But as I've said before, the money that's in this package we talk about, I think the figure is about 30.7 million, which is a wonderful jumping off point.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But that is only one section of this bond that's dealing with pedestrian infrastructure, I think. Birthday girl Sussman down on the way here talks a lot about the the Colfax corridor dollars, a lot of which are going to go towards, uh, pedestrian infrastructure improvements for miles along that corridor.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And there's other elements doing the same thing, the bicycle money. We need a whole lot more of that. Most of the arts and culture facilities, their wish list was for considerably more than they got, you know. So they're going to have to continue to go to their donor base and to push in the annual budgets.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I just I think it's a great thing that we have an opportunity to do for the city. Hundreds of great projects. My district is getting improvements to several rec rec centers, new playgrounds, great improvements along the Buchtel corridor, fire stations and so on and so forth.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I'm glad to approve this tonight, and I will look forward to supporting the Lopez Espinosa's amendment as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right, Councilman Lopez, I got Councilwoman Gilmore. Councilwoman Gilmore.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, President Brooks. I will echo my colleagues in saying thank you very much to the city staff and really taking us through the entire process. And I want to thank my council colleagues. We, I think, took a really different look at what we were going to prioritize and equity continued to be at the forefront.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It never left as far as the conversation went. And this really allowed us to, as a council, see the different issues that each one of our districts are facing. And, you know, in the last year we did a lot of council tours.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so having the majority of city council on a bus driving down 56th Avenue really was able to show them what we face as a community. And they delved in deep. They wanted to understand what the issues were.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They wanted to hear from myself, but most importantly, folks who actually live and deal with the issues on a day to day basis. And really through this process, you know, we talk a lot about unintended consequences or unintended outcomes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And sometimes those are bad. And unintended outcome of this entire process was that we were able to really hear from the folks of Denver. This was a process where the community, residents of District 11, we bonded together over advocating for the important projects that we now have on the bond package.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And that was an amazing process because for so long the equity issues that we had faced easily can tear our community apart. And we were able to utilize this process and really bond together and do great things for District 11 and for all the council districts and the rest of the city.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So first and foremost, I want to thank the constituents, the regular community members who show up, who stay here late and really advocated for these these projects and then my council colleagues for your support and the city agencies.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, President Brooks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, thank you, Councilwoman Gilmore. Councilman Lopez.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I forgot. I absolutely forgot. And. We can't. We can't, I think the mayor enough for setting the tone. And I wanted to make sure I had that in my comments. But I think, you know, I think the mayor getting out there and really and really championing and championing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Equity and.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And the equity studies that were done and a lot of the work, you know, he and I were out Paco Sanchez Park just with the sign and we had a groundbreaking that had nothing to do with the barn yet.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But the rest of it's funded through the bond. I mean, both looked at each other and I didn't know whether it was okay to start campaigning for it or not. So I you know, I decided not to. But but at the end of the day, he.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'He deserves a lot of credit. This takes a councilman to know. Right. And deliver to the districts. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilman Lopez, I'll just make a couple of comments. I think my my colleagues made some really great comments and thanked a lot of people who've made this be one of the most inclusive, transparent bond projects of all time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I'm so grateful and honored to be a part of it. And the fact that we have a room that is half full on a $937,000,000 billion bond is crazy. And that's me. That means the process was right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I also want to thank Roxann White, J.J. Newman and Jen Dale for being part of the chairs of this volunteer led committees that got yelled at and got e-mails because of the work that they've done. And so thank you, guys.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's incredible. And obviously the staff has just been amazing as well. I guess I'll just say this. Anytime you have capital like this, it's an opportunity and you have to have a strategic vision or else everybody gets crumbs and you sprinkle it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I just think we had a strategic vision and it was a great process. But people are going to be upset when the strategic, strategic vision because that means is directed towards one big issue and the transportation mobility was our issue for this year.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And being a housing champion myself, it was very hard to say we're going to prioritize this because we have a finite amount of resources and every year we got to figure out what to do with those resources. And so I want to echo some of the comments that I think, Councilman, you made as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': '2018 is around the corner and there will be another strategic focus for this city and there will be other hard choices. And so I appreciate everybody realizing what it takes to lead and having a macro perspective for the entire city, not just your neighborhood, not just your council district, but what it takes to move this city forward'",
        "'speaker_0': '. So I am. Excited to support this. And I have to say, our mayor, the point in which he got the budget from the executive committee, there are a lot of people upset and I didn't know how we were going to move forward because we had about five or six council members upset and about a thousand people in'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the public who felt like they their project should have been included. And Michael B Hancock did not sweat and was just open and invited Councilman Clark and I to the table. And we have watched you. We have the product of that before you today.'",

        "'speaker_10': 'Right. And so that's why that is in there. You know, there's been great work that's been done by the West Colfax bid. You heard Dan Schorr's testimony and you heard Leslie check out his testimony for Federal Boulevard. You know, these are areas where they're absolutely critical.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And when you look at the funds that that we want to keep in southwest Denver and Westwood, it's to do more than multi-modal improvements. And you heard that you heard that in great detail from Bukele West and from the folks that spoke there.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It's it's increasing Morrison road improvements to the funding level that they should have. It was almost like a little like a tennis match was going back and forth and as in this process, we were watching it get funded and decreased.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Funded and then decreased. And so in order for Morrison Road to Work, you got to fund, you got to complete the project. And when we were looking at this source of funds and you look at Federal Boulevard and you look at the.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The original intent of this for the for the transit study. If we really wanted to make Federal Boulevard, that transit corridor, we really wanted to do that. It's not going to take $9.8 million. It's going to take a heck of a lot more investment.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And it has to be programed. And that's why we picked that's why we saw this as, hey, what's going on with this? Asked these questions before and in previous council meetings and at this at this very floor without the detailed response.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'This is money that's not being programed. We don't know if it's for bus shelters. We don't know if it is for a bus lane. We don't know if it's. We've heard that it's for charging stations, for electric cars.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We just don't know for certain. And when we asked. There's no designs and there's not it's not programed. We can they can not tell us what's going to be funded. And the detail that we. Right. And it's frustrating because here we have that.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And on the other hand, we have these four projects that that absolutely are they we can program right away to complete four major projects in the city. Important transit corridor, important hubs. So that's that's you know, the one thing I really wanted about home and this is not money that we're allocated for another side of town or'",
        "'speaker_10': 'another. This is within the district. Right. And so this is something that a lot of the folks that you had here testifying, this is their work. This is the gaps that they that they realized. There's been tremendous work done.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But you know what? This is about details. And and we want to make sure we get we get it right. If we're going to do it, let's get it right. There have been terrible accidents on Morrison with terrible accidents on West Colfax Federal.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Seen a heck of a lot more improvement than what it ever had. And a lot of the things that talk about federal, you know, a lot of those actions that happened in that corridor and that stretch is not happening no more because of that federal boulevard reconstruction that we had.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So. Yeah. All right. I want to allow other folks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Councilman Lopez. Councilwoman.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes, I have said all right to be asking questions. Oh, yeah, yeah. Okay. Um, I'd like to ask Krissy to come up to the, to the thing. I just have a couple of questions. I understand that the Central Street Project, there was a question about whether it was bond eligible.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Has that question become more clear or. I don't know about bond eligibility.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So sorry for Central Laura.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Would you know whether.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So the initial scope of the project more focused on landscaping elements and streetscape along Central Avenue, and at that time we deemed that the useful life of that proposed project scope didn't align with on financing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And is that the case now? I mean, is it still maybe not eligible for bond financing?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There is more clarity needed around the scope of work that's required for that project for us to determine the answer to that question.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So if we were to approve this amendment and it was found to be not bond eligible. What happens to it? I mean, do we have some obligation towards it or what? What happens to it?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'If City Council approves the amendment, then it's incorporated into the bond. And we would essentially need to work to develop a scope of work that's in line with what is eligible for bond funding.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Thank you. And and now, Kristie, I was going to ask you about the federal transit project that's going away here in this in this amendment. Yeah. How many? How long along the corridor was that?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Transit.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Was the transit project or is initially the transit project was intended to be the entire length of the federal boulevard corridor from city limit to city limit. Through the process, it was reduced to from Evans to 38th Avenue.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'From Evans to 38th. That's quite a distance. Yes. And is it true that there were.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Not plans that were drawn up.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'For the project?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So one of the things we've been thinking about with regards to transit is just how do we do sort of the bus rapid transit faster? There are things that we can do from a programmatic perspective, an operational perspective to actually help transit move more quickly through the corridor.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And that's what we had in mind. So a lot of things with sign signals and markings and bus shelter improvements to actually enhance the transit along the corridor. It is the second highest ridership in the RTD system. It's on the Vision Zero High Injury Network system, and we thought we could bring a lot of those things together'",
        "'speaker_7': 'to actually address both transit and safety issues along the corridor.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. I think that's all my question is.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thanks very much. Thanks, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Sussman. Councilman Blair.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Unfortunately. I haven't learned that much about either of these proposals, the original one and the amendment. I had a brief meeting with Councilman Espinosa a few weeks ago, but most of what I've learned, I've learned tonight, and I trust Councilman Espinosa and Councilman Lopez for what they think should be in their district.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Just because I think I know what's best for my district, but what I'm concerned about is federal, because we're always hearing about what a dangerous street it is. And it concerns me that we're we're not addressing that. And I understand that that we want to hold out for a BRT.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But if we're spending 55 million or $60 million on Colfax, when are we going to have that kind of money? Again, for federal? We're probably not for another bond, which is in ten years. So I don't know how to weigh that decision.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So Chrissy, can you provide me any guidance? And we also have great speakers on both sides of it. So I don't I don't really know how to make that decision.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Well, you know, as you guys have all said this evening, there's there aren't a lack of projects that are good projects. It's hard.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Decisions that we have to.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Make when we're trying to think about transportation and how do we meet some of the goals that we have out there. And with regards to mode shift, several people have mentioned 73% of folks are driving to on their commute trips by themselves.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so how do we encourage people to move differently and meet the Mobility Action Plan goals that Mayor Hancock placed out there? We do think that enhancing transit and improving ridership are improving the service along these corridors will actually increase ridership and give people better options and serve a community that we're really working to better support and'",
        "'speaker_7': 'make sure that they through transportation, we're providing greater access to opportunity. We also know from our work with RTD that this corridor is on the first tier for improvements that they're identifying when they look at their system and where busses are getting stuck in the system and stuck in traffic just like everybody else, which makes it harder'",
        "'speaker_7': 'to prioritize transit and encourage that mode shift. So we do think that this project would give that opportunity to look at specific intersections where we would want to put in transit signal priority to jump planes if necessary, to a bus only lonely bus only lane that maybe in the peak period only.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But we could certainly look at 24 hour. Those are the types of things that we are looking towards to move this forward and increase transit capacity on the corridor. So if you want to think about it along the lines of what Broadway Lincoln have done in the past with signs, signals and markings and prioritizing transit in that'",
        "'speaker_7': 'corridor, that's what we wanted to start with. But we've also learned a lot since we have implemented Broadway in Lincoln. To see what else we might want to do will be testing the red paint the red markings on Broadway starting this summer.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Those are all things that would be eligible on this process, on this project, if we were able to move it forward.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. So Councilman Lopez and Espinosa, I guess my question is for you, are you willing to sacrifice that for these other projects?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'My short answer, absolutely. It's not a sacrifice. It's a reinvestment only because it's a pilot you talked to. There was another. So when you talk about Federal Boulevard as being a concern. Yeah. At one point it was the most dangerous strip in Denver with with that Alameda, it was identified from Alameda to Sixth Avenue.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Fifth Avenue to be to be to be honest. We addressed that. We widened it. You put in sidewalks, underground utilities. That was a big ticket item. And it was over 100. And I think. $36 million. It was a big deal just for that stretch.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That's a small stretch. Federal. Huge. Right. Ten point I mean, $9.8 million wouldn't even. I don't know how many holes we could have dug with that on that strip. The other thing, Kendra, is that we are. Councilman Black, I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Is this not over? We rebuilt. We reconfigured Sixth Avenue Bridges project, which was a big deal. Happened to tie right into that. And then what's going to be happening now is from Sixth Avenue all the way to Holden, where the Human Services Building is, that's going to keep widen third lane, put in medians, pedestrian refuges, things like'",
        "'speaker_10': 'that, better lights. That's another big ticket item. And you're only talking about maybe a mile or two max, right on Federal Boulevard. It's huge. You're looking at $9.8 million. I'd rather see hard cost. I'd rather see completed projects with those that that $9.8 million on Colfax, on those very intersections that we talked about rather than some pilot'",
        "'speaker_10': '. Right. That's not programed money. And no, here's the thing. I have a tremendous amount of respect for Krissy from Barnum. Right. We talked about federal a lot. It's a matter of priority. And for ten years I was in the West Side.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We know where the priority is there. Now, we appreciate that. We would love to have BRT, but you can't buy BRT on Federal Boulevard for $9.8 million. You just can't. So for us, it's just a smart investment on that side.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But it's a fallacy to think that Federal Boulevard is not getting any love. Oh, my gosh. We're getting crazy love coming out pretty soon. So much that we're all going to be receiving phone calls about the traffic jams.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. I would just like to insert one comment. Hampton needs a lot of love. And so to South Carolina. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'More for for this. All right. To the.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Chinese.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's the way. Oh, yeah. Councilman Espinosa, just. Just so you have the other half of that response as well. Yes. There is no design that were that were ready to go. That's shovel ready for for for federal. They're on this on this scale.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And a portion of that is pilot, which begs the question of whether that had hits the ten year requirement, because it's something that could be tried and pulled away. But the key thing on the one sort of supportive comment tonight was and it's crucial it's crucial to federal it's crucial to Colfax.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is transit supportive land use? We do not have land use that would sort of fill in and start bringing new, new high concentrations of users. We need to this is and so that is actually one of the crucial things the disconnects that we didn't do in Blueprint Denver.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We didn't follow through with Blueprint Denver. That Denver right. Update is going to be talking about. But we're a year from Denver. Right. Being adopted and we're two more many years from these neighborhoods being part of the neighborhood planning initiative.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we are.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Probably a good decade from having true, you know, land.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Use, transit supported, land uses, married with transit. So we actually have time. What we should be doing is for far less money doing the design, doing the studies and improving upon the recommendations of the plan so that we actually can can come forward and that can be done through our general fund.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'These other things are our long term needs. On West Colfax. We've we've have tall, very tall, high concentrations of senior living facilities. The city is now building one through DHS. So this is this is it is.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Is as one of the public speakers.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Put it, it's it's a Sophie's.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Choice, but it is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Actually one that is is valuable valuable to to the pedestrian commute walking communities. I have a very high concentration of Jewish community on West Colfax as well. So these are all things that it is not ideal situation, but it is actually a net improvement and we can build towards the Federal Boulevard corridor, which was just done last'",
        "'speaker_0': 'year. So. And follow up with plans over the coming years. Thanks. Hey. Thank you. All right, Councilman Black, I think that gets at it. Let's go to Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I'm happy to support the Councilman Lopez and Councilman Espinosa in Reprograming these federal funds and other projects in our district. And I just want to remind Councilman Lopez, when he talks about the west side being sort of forgotten, that the farther southwest you go, we're even more forgotten and that Denver doesn't end.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It doesn't go all the way to Sheridan. And in my district, it goes all the way to Kipling Street. And we had a neighborhood picnic there for Denver days just yesterday. And folks were reminding me there was a time when my predecessor, Councilman Hackworth, had to have the city issue, the folks in my neighborhood, Denver resident cards'",
        "'speaker_2': ', because no one believed at the Southwest Rec Center that we actually lived in the city and county of Denver. So so with that in mind, I think it's very good that the representatives from the West Side get to determine their own priorities.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I'm happy to support this. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right, Councilman Flynn, I'm going to jump to Councilman Knoop.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well, it looks like we're just equivalent over legitimate needs. Like Chrissy said, you know, it sure says something about a lack of a transportation system. So I'm hoping the Christie that you'll be supportive of putting this project in the operating budget for 2018.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And we obviously need both of these projects and I'm sure you'll hear what you hear up here tonight. You're going to find support for increased transit funding. So I hope you'll consider that. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilman New. Councilman Castro.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. President. And I'm really very pleased to hear all this love for the West Side, but want it want to give a yo for the East Side and East Evans Avenue needs a whole lot of love.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'East of Colorado Boulevard, especially. And I just wanted to add that Brandon is looking far too relaxed. And I want to I want to underscore a larger go for the minivan. So there you go.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Cashman, did you said the east side? Yes, sir. You know, the east side is. Anyway, we'll talk about that later. All right. Let's do. Councilman Lopez, I think you can.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Armando, don't do it. No, I need to ask a question.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Ask your question.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So I wanted to ask this question of David and possibly Laura. Now, although in the particulars that I asked, that, you know, that kind of renumbered stuff and adds Federal Boulevard Transit and all that stuff. So for the purpose and the intent of the amendment, even though it's not written in the actual language, how are we going'",
        "'speaker_10': 'to record and make sure that that that those those projects are actually the intent of the proceeds? And so I don't know whether or not I just want to make sure on the record that that that's the intent of.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes. The Department of Finance will absolutely reallocate the funds within the transportation purposed as determined by City Council this evening. As you know, Councilman, we have transparently posted summaries on our website which reflect those projects which comprise each of the purposes.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So we will certainly adjust all of our summaries to include the adjustment on Morrison Road. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It's like David's not in his head.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'David Broadwell, Assistant City Attorney The purpose of the councilman's question is, as you all know, each of the projects doesn't have a number, a dollar number attributed to it in the companion ordinance. And it was easy to delay one project, add three.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But the addition of the addition of the extra money to Morse and Road isn't really expressly in the language of the amendment itself, but is largest reflected that we understand the underlying intent. The budget for the Morris Road Project will be increased by the amount indicated in the explanation, even though it's not explicitly in the ordinance language'",
        "'speaker_2': '. So we thought we would put that on the record.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you. Thank you. That's all I have.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right, set it up. Sure. Okay. Uh, Councilman Espinosa. No, that was okay. Okay, great. We are voting on the amendment for a 19. All right. It's been moved and seconded. Madam Secretary, real call.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Lopez. I knew Ortega. Sussman. From Black Eye. Clark. Espinosa, I. Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Gilmore. I heard in Cashman. I can eat, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I police voting announce the results.'",
        "'speaker_3': '13 eyes.'",
        "'speaker_0': '13 eyes. The amendment passes. Now, Councilwoman Gilmore, we need a motion to publish as amended.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, President Brooks. I move that council bill 819 be ordered published as amended.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It has been moved and seconded, I assume no comments from the council. Madam Secretary Roker.'",
