    "A bill for an ordinance approving a proposed Amendatory Lease Agreement between the City and County of Denver and the Colorado Symphony Association, for offices used by the Colorado Symphony Association.\n (FINANCE & SERVICES) Extends a lease agreement with the Colorado Symphony Association by fifteen months to 12-31-16 to occupy 1245 Champa Street and raises rent from one dollar annually to $5,000 per month plus reimbursement of operating expenses (FINAN-201311017-01). The last regularly scheduled Council meeting within the 30-day review period is on 8-15. The Committee approved filing this bill at its meeting on 7-28-15.": [
        "'speaker_2': 'All right. We will put on the floor and then we'll go to comments. And I'll start with you, Councilman Flint and Councilwoman Candace. Will you please have 522 audio published?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes, Mr. President, I move that council bill 522 be ordered published.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It has been moved. We'll need a second. Who got the second? Thank you. Councilman Flynn, if you want to do a motion to hold in committee and then I'll go to comments after that, if that's the direction I want to go.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Go right ahead.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I move the council bill five two to be held in committee to Monday, August 24th, 2015.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That has been moved and seconded now. Time for comments, Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I did not have the advantage of since I'm not on finance and services to be at the meeting where this was vetted at first. But I believe there's still some questions unanswered in my mind.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Primarily, the question is why we are asking the Colorado Symphony, which is one of our struggling institutions, to go from paying essentially no rent to a dollar a year to $5,000 a month. When we do expect this building to be reimagined and perhaps repurposed and for them to be vacating the building at the end of 2017 anyway'",
        "'speaker_8': ', to me, $75,000 I don't need from the Colorado Symphony in that period of time. That's just one more musician on the street. And I think we have enough of musicians on our streets right now. So I'd like it to go back to committee and bring the symphony folks in because they were not represented at the first committee'",
        "'speaker_8': 'meeting. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman Flynn. Councilman, new.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'House. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I also agree with this, Councilman Flynn. I think those discussions in Finance Committee were really about the future development of this building and how the space is going to be used. And I thought it was a very good discussion and questions raised where we really didn't have the answer about the future planning'",
        "'speaker_10': 'of this building. So I think this will give us a little bit more time to understand how this building is going to be used, as well as the financial impact on the symphony as Councilman Flynn had brought up.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman. New Councilman Ken each.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I felt the need just to chime in, because I originally had asked this to go to committee, I think, along with Councilwoman Ortega and I, I was uncomfortable with the fact the symphony was not there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I you know, I did go ahead and with some consternation, move this out of committee. But so I'm not presuming that my my decision to allow this lease to go forward will change. But I do believe that given that we did not have the party there, I think it is appropriate to to revisit the discussion.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And in part, I think the concerns that I raised in committee, I won't go into into total detail, but we're related not just to the Symphony's ability to pay and the long term implications of their financial ability to continue providing a beloved service to our our patrons in the city, but also to the fact that if and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'when they they were to vacate the floor pursuant to the lease, that it would likely be taken over in what would be the typical capital investment. So I guess I would just like to say that if we're going to hear this in committee, it would be helpful to know from the partnerships specifically as well what the expected'",
        "'speaker_3': 'investment they will be making will be in the floor so that we can keep track of what is being invested in this building that has an uncertain future because that is a concern. So let's add that to the discussion as well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Leach. Councilman Flanders. Okay. If I go to a couple of councilmembers and ask what's great? Councilwoman Sassaman, you're up.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you very much, Mr. President. You know, Jeff Steinberg is in the audience, and I'd like to ask him if if such a postponement causes any other kind of issues with real estate transactions in the symphony? And is the symphony aware that this proposal is on the floor?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Does it interfere with any of their possible plans? Just like that's a lot of questions. But sure, I would like you to give us that. Give us some background on this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm Jeff Steinberg. I'm director of real estate for the City. And I'll try and take them one at a time, as I remember. I mean, if I don't remember.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm all right. You got the gist.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. So as the lease sits today, it expires by its own terms on September 30th. And at that point, it requires the symphony to move out of the space. I've been working with Jerry Kern, who's president or CEO of the CSO, and as his lease was coming to a term, he reached out to me to see'",
        "'speaker_0': 'if there is a way that we could extend the term and that if it called for paying rent, that he was willing to do that, that it was a far better opportunity to remain in the space, not have to pay for moving relocation costs and enter into the marketplace to identify suitable lease space.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So as we move forward, we ultimately came up with the $5,000 a month in rent, which was the same amount of rent that he was paying back in 2013 when they resided in Bettcher concert hall space. So that's why that number came about and he was comfortable with that number.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And postponing it. Does he know that this was going to happen this evening and is that going to cause any heartburn to the symphony?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, couple of things. Yes, he did know it was going to happen this evening. I mean, he and I have been talking about it since it went to committee mayor council and tonight to first reading the. Concern that I have is if it's postponed to the 24th, it would that essentially be first reading at that time if'",
        "'speaker_0': 'it were postponed to the 24th?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I suspect so is the first reading tonight, isn't it. Yeah. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. It's just making sure that whatever is put into place and agreed upon can be executed, fully executed by the 30th of September. Otherwise, the terms of their lease would cause them to move out of the space. The existing lease that they are.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Does this if it's postponed two weeks, does it give enough time for them to do this before the lease is up?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, again, I'm not sure what the outcome of that meeting is. So in other words, the bill that is before council is to approve extending them that $5,000 a month. If there is a meeting at the 24th and the terms of the lease were changed then I would imagine that a new lease would have to be executed'",
        "'speaker_0': '. I would imagine that somebody within the mayor's office or whoever would be sponsoring the change would have to sponsor it, create a new lease, and it would have to be sent out for execution or exchanged with the party that is going to enter into it, approved, and then come back through the council process.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I don't I don't know if on the 24th, if the terms of the agreement are changed for essentially at first reading, or if somebody within the administration would have to make the decision as to whether or not they're going to agree to that or not.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So it cuts it pretty tight, is what you're saying. And in especially if there's any changes or concerns. And as I understand it, the symphony was accepting of this lease. It's a lease they paid for in 2013. Same amount for the for the facility, right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, a different facility. But it was what they were paying back in 2013.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Thanks very much.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You're welcome.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Sussman. Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I met this afternoon with Ginger White from arts and venues, and we talked a little bit about this. So we really have two issues here. One is the issue between the Colorado Symphony and their space in the building and their their current lease or the need to renegotiate the lease.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And then the second is the use of this building and how it plays a role in the bigger picture planning that is going on with the performing arts complex, which I think is a bigger issue of concern, particularly if we allow further investment in this building.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That might require the city deciding we need this building and we want to use it for a different purpose. And as we were told in committee when it came, we would have to buy out that lease and that would more than likely include some of the major investment and improvements that would be going into the building.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So that's why I think it makes sense to send this back to committee so we can have a further discussion about the role that this plays in the bigger picture. And just as a side note, there are public hearings being scheduled.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'There's one this Wednesday, August 12th, and that will be, I don't know, the location, but you can go to a website called Deep AC Masterplan dot com. Denver Performing Arts Center Master Plan dot com. And they're taking public input from people who want to look at what's being proposed and be able to weigh in on the big'",
        "'speaker_9': 'picture. And so I think that is part of the concern that I expressed when we had the contract that came forward for the Denver Partnership. I think they're doing some incredible things in that building with the programs that they have brought forward.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I've had an opportunity to tour the building and to look at some of the agencies that are being housed there and the work they're doing with start up businesses. I haven't been able to determine that any of those startup businesses are from the creative industries or the arts community.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But this building has always played a vital role in the performing arts complex. And so I think it's why having this conversation that includes the symphony, but to really understand the big picture is important. So I'm going to be supporting this postponement tonight.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Ortega. Councilman Espinosa.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Jeff So you said that this is more of a committee thing, but I just want to clarify that while this is going back to a 2013 rate, what was the 2014 rate? So we had from 2014, actually, it was towards the end of 2013 because it was a two year deal that was that they were paying no'",
        "'speaker_0': 'rent, but they were paying operating expenses. So somewhere between operating expenses and $5,000, what I heard was some concern about the component of the well, this sort of notion of of taking an arts program and charging them a rate.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And you testified that they were okay with it, but we have yet to hear it directly from that agency. And so it would be nice to have them at the table essentially supporting what is being conveyed and also to hear whether somewhere between operating expenses and 5000 is actually some sort of compromise that would simply be a'",
        "'speaker_0': 'modification of the that line. Were there other items in that contract that also changed? It's an amendment to an existing lease that changes the lease rate. So it's just the rate. Yeah. Great.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman Espinosa. All right, Councilman Flynn, you're up.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I just wanted to point out that it was mentioned earlier, which is why I chimed in that by postponing this to the 24th, we can we can still introduce it, pass it on introduction. And then the next Financial Services Committee meeting is the following morning.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So it does keep it on track. It does not delay final adoption by the 31st, which is the 30 day deadline for this contract. Also, Geoff, my understanding is that the rent they were paying in Metro Hall was not 5000 was somewhat less than that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'About 4300. And is it true if you know do you know if it's true that because of the financial situation, they in fact, were not paying that or were not current and rent was deferred or forgiven.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'As far as the 40 $300 versus 5000, the information that I received was 5000. They were not paying rent to our agency. They were paying it to artisan venues. And the reason that they were caused to move out of that space was for construction that was going on.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Exactly. Yeah. Okay. So is there anyone here who does know whether that rent was deferred and whether it was actually paid? I just have a concern about the capacity of the of the symphony in the time they have remaining in that building to meet that obligation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm going to ask Mark Najarian from Arts and Venues to come up. But I will say that in order to be filed for the meeting tonight, the CSO had to sign the lease. So they have accepted it by hosting Natalie.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I understand that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Classrooms. Landmark Nigerian Arts Venues, Venue Director at the Performing Arts Complex. The symphony did eventually get up and become current with us. There was a short period where we worked out a payment plan when they were office in in Bettcher concert hall.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It was, if I recall correctly, was the 5000 or 60,000 per year. So this is the same amount. And when they did move out, they were current with us. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That's a different figure than than I was told.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Came from venue. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And finally, my understanding is that they may be asked during this extended period to relocate, to move out of the third floor. Is that so? They would have to incur moving expenses as well and consolidate on the fourth floor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The current lease that's in place with the downtown Denver Event Center provides that they have option to that space, the third floor, because there was a specific date in which the symphony lease expired. So in order to allow for the symphony to continue in the building, they needed to consolidate to the fourth floor.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Right. And they will do that. I mean, they've already exercised that well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I mean, they have signed the lease that says that they will consolidate to the fourth floor and they will pay $5,000 a month.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And what is the annual rental that the downtown Denver partnership is paying for the rest of the building there?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They are paying a dollar a year and they're paying operating expenses.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. They're paying a dollar a year? That's correct. All right. Thank you. That's all, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman Flynn. Councilwoman.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Councilman Flynn clarified my question, which is that the amount is not the only change in the lease, that the space being occupied is also a change from the existing. And that was not when you had answer, Councilman Espinosa.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You said only the amount is changing. So I just I think we're clear now. That is correct. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Councilman Cohen, each Councilwoman Sussman.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I just wanted to respond to Councilman. Thank you, Mr. President. Councilman Flynn. Yes, I understand that there is there are enough days between the 24th and the end of the lease, but if there are significant changes that take a bit more time there, it's a tight schedule that it still might not make it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I and I understand the concern that the symphony wasn't it committee or is not here this evening but that also means that we don't know whether they would want us to postpone it or not. They may be very pleased with it and hope that it continues forward.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We don't know that answer.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman Sussman. All right. In the comments on 522. All right. We have before us the motion to re refer to committee to Monday, August 24th, seeking to committee until Monday, August 24th. See no other comments. Madam Secretary, roll call.'",

That was council members Flynn and new. Um let me first either either I'll start with Councilor Flynn did you want that on the floor or do you have a comment or question?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Mr. President, I just had a question.'",

Moving on to the request we are considering the grh3 zoned district tonight. It is within the general neighborhood context. It is a row house district and it permits buildings with a three storey maximum height.'",

        "'speaker_11': 'And this is the building footprint that would have to be complied with for construction under par 624. PD 624 also includes detailed facade, facade elevations as well as materials, and it's really specific to very specific development contemplated under this Puddy dispute.'",
        "'speaker_11': '624 is an example as seen here as we've seen that many chapter former Chapter 59 Pdes are too restrictive often and too detailed, and are unable to adapt to the changing market and preference conditions that we see over time.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Specifically, this PD was approved in 2009 and has not been developed under. And we also see specifically, I guess, the way to explain it is that for a development to want to build anything other than what is specified in this building footprint and these facade elevations, we must entertain a resounding like we are here tonight.'",

And now to an overview of the process that's brought us here today. We notified RINO's and City Council members of receipt of application on April 7th.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The notice of the Planning Board public hearing was sent to R.A. and City Council on May 19th, as well as notification signage posted on the property advertising of the Planning Board public hearing. On June 3rd, the Planning Board unanimously recommended approval of the rezoning to City Council.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And then on June 24th, the Neighborhoods and Planning Committee moved the bill to City Council for final consideration. Tonight, and notice of tonight's City Council public hearing has been sent to all R.A. and City Council on July 20th, as well as notification signage has been posted on the property.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The following. Four registered neighborhood organizations have been notified throughout the process, and we have received communication from two of those registered neighborhood organizations. As of today, we received from the Denver Neighborhood Association R.A. position statement offering that the Denver Neighborhood Association did not take a vote on this particular issue.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'They generally don't involve themselves in such neighborhood specific matters, but did indicate support of the rezoning generally supporting rezonings of former Chapter 59 PDS into the Denver Zoning Code and I believe the G RH three was an appropriate sign district.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Additionally, we received a letter of support from the Cherry Creek East Association stating that the R.A. did vote in support of the application. So now I will walk you through the five rezoning criteria used to evaluate a rezoning request, the first of which is consistency with adopted plans.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And three adopted plans will apply to the subject site Comprehensive Plan 2000 Blueprint Denver, which is our Integrated Land Use and transportation plan as well as the Cherry Creek Area Plan adopted in 2012. The first is comprehensive plan 2000 and KPD did find that the rezoning request is consistent with Comprehensive Plan 2000, and we look to a'",
        "'speaker_11': 'number of different strategies to inform that determination, including environmental sustainability through the promotion of infill development, as well as encouraging opportunities for people to live where they work. The land use strategy again encourages quality infill development that is consistent with the character of surrounding neighborhoods, as well as the neighborhood strategy that recommends invest investing in neighborhoods through'",
        "'speaker_11': 'a range of housing types. Moving on to Blueprint Denver. Our subject site is called Out in the Yellow Box, and it just indicated that it is within an urban residential concept land use category where the plan recommends higher intensity, primarily residential uses and a variety of housing types, including single family townhouses, small multifamily and sometimes residential.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We do find that the RH three zone district implements these land use recommendations through that variety of housing types consistent with the existing character. And we also find that our subject site is located within an area of stability.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'You can see there is an area change located to the south at Alameda indicated by that hatch and of course blueprint. Denver recommends in areas of stability, maintaining character while allowing some new development. And we do find that the G RH three zone district is consistent with that recommendation.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Blueprint. Denver also includes a number of street classifications that inform the appropriate mix of land uses. South Madison Street is called out as an undesignated local, where it is more appropriate for local access rather than regional access. And East Alameda is called out as a mixed use arterial, and such an arterial would have a greater importance on'",
        "'speaker_11': 'regional traffic and distribution. We do find that the G, r, h three zone district is appropriate at this particular location for this on designated local street by allowing residential uses that are consistent with the existing context. And East Alameda Avenue and Cherry Creek North Drive are also identified as enhanced transit corridors, and these are corridors within the'",
        "'speaker_11': 'city that blueprint Denver recommends increasing transit ridership, improving service and efficiency. And this would primarily be achieved through a supportive mix of land uses. And we do find that the residential development that would be enabled by this RH three zone district would be able to take advantage of that transit corridor.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Now moving on to the small area plan. This is the Cherry Creek Area plan adopted in 2012. So this is after Pwds 624 is approval in 2009. The Cherry Creek Area Plan sets forth framework strategies that will apply to all of Cherry Creek, as well as sub area strategies that apply to specific geographies.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So our subject site called Out Here in Red again is reinforced as an area of stability where the Cherry Creek Area plan recommends maintaining a mix of low scale residential building forms and where infill development should reinforce pedestrian friendly qualities.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Additionally, the the plan recommends respecting the existing character of stable residential neighborhoods. And we do find that the grh3 zone district is consistent with the strategy through enabling development that is consistent with the existing context and character. Moving on to the sub area strategies.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Our subject site is located within the Cherry Creek East Sub area. It is called Out here in Red. And again, we see the same reinforcement of the concept from Blueprint Denver that the site is located within an urban residential area.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The Cherry Creek Area Plan recommends continuing supporting a variety of housing types in this particular area, including low and mid-rise multifamily rowhouses, duplexes, single family and accessory dwelling units. And we do find that the application of G, r, h three does provide for this appropriate mix of land uses.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The Cherry Creek Area Plan also recommends respecting the existing existing excuse me in character and scale of low resident low scale residential development within these residential areas. So this area called out here in pink specifically does have a maximum recommended building height of three stories.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And we do find that since the RH three recommends construction of no higher than three stories, the application of this Stone district at the site is appropriate. And within the Cherry Creek Area plan, sub area strategy. We also find that the plan recommends rezoning pods, that these aging undeveloped pods there are nearly 100 of them within Cherry'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Creek East are typically unable to adapt and provide the flexibility needed to react to changing real estate market conditions. And of course, the plan recognizes that the only way to remove this pool is through a rezoning process. So we do see the recommendation to rezone pods that as the opportunities arise with new development or property owner interests'",
        "'speaker_11': ', that we should seek an appropriate zone district to rezone into the Denver zoning code a request you see before you tonight. So based upon CPD's analysis, we do find that the request is consistent with adopted plans. And moving on to the second criteria.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Uniformity of district regulations. We find that the application of g, r, h three at the subject's site will result in the uniform application of the Zone District throughout the city. We do also find that the application of G, r, h three at the Zone District at the subject site furthers the public health, safety and welfare, primarily through'",
        "'speaker_11': 'the implementation of adopted city plans. Moving on to the fourth criteria, that there be a justifying circumstance for the rezoning as stated in your application. The land or its surrounding environs has changed or is changing to such a degree that it is in the public interest to encourage a redevelopment of the area or to recognize the change'",
        "'speaker_11': 'character of the area. And as stated in your application, recent infill and redevelopment of the area is consistent with the grh3 zone district and also according to the application. 624 Site and facade design no longer reflects the property owners desired character.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Additionally, CPD does fine to change conditions since the approval of PUD. 624 in 2009, including the approval of the Cherry Creek Area Plan in 2012. Setting forth a new vision for the area as well as the adoption of the Denver Zoning Code in 2010.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Introducing G, r, h three as a zone district tool that would not have been available at the time of. 624 approval in 2009 to implement the Urban Residential Land Use recommendation. Now moving on to the fifth criteria consistency with neighborhood context.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The general urban neighborhood context is described in the Denver zoning code as including a mix of residential uses and a variety of building forms embedded low scale residents, low scales, skinny commercial uses, as well as regular block patterns, a consistent street grid and detached sidewalks and the neighborhood context description in Article six actually calls out Cherry Creek'",
        "'speaker_11': 'East as an example of a prototypical general urban neighborhood context neighborhood. So we do find that it is appropriate to apply the grade three zone district to this prototypical general urban neighborhood context area. And finally moving on to his own district.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Purpose and intent. The RH three zone district promotes and protects higher density residential neighborhoods within the general urban neighborhood context, and specifically the grh3 zone district is a multi-unit district, allowing urban house duplex and row house building forms and specifically row houses no taller than three stories.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And we do find that the application of g r, s, r, h three at this subject site is consistent with these recommendations, as well as the recommendations that we have seen earlier in the presentation as represented by adopted plans.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So based upon CPD's review of the criteria, we do find that the rezoning meets all five criteria and do recommend accordingly approval of application 2015 IE 00033 from PD 624 to grh3. And I'm available to answer any questions you may have as well as the applicant is here tonight.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. We have one speaker today, Howard Kent. So, Mr. Kent, you can make your way up to the podium to begin your remarks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hello. I'm Howard Canton. I represent the new owner of the property of an architect here in Denver. My office is located over Downing and 17th Street and I reside at 2463 South Primary Street here in Denver. The simplest way to explain what these pods are is they're a zoning married to a very specific design.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The process was brought about because rezoning was so nebulous that designs were sold to communities. So that rezoning was allowed and then the person who did that would build something somewhat different and it made people very unhappy. So over time, particularly in the 1990 and early 2000s, the PDS and PBGC were developed with very specific design requirements'",
        "'speaker_0': '. The exact look of the building materials, the height, the size of the windows, location of windows, all of that. How much coverage was completely mandated by that zoning, which was fine if that zoning was going to be enacted at that moment and that development happened.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Remember, these pods were never built. And as market forces change, it changed or people's personal tastes changed. The PD might not have been what the person who owned the property wanted to build. In this case, a new owner has purchased the property, wants to build a townhouse similar in essence to the side by side townhouse that's in'",
        "'speaker_0': 'place, but with a different esthetic and different, different coverage. One of the good things about the Garage three is it's not allowing the lot fillers that you see around town. So we're actually going to end up with less coverage and less square footage in the new Grange three than would be allowed under the current PUD.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The current PUD has about a 59% site coverage, whereas the grade three would allow a maximum of 50. The current PUD allows a 35 foot height, whereas the Grange three only allows 30 feet and the rear third of the lot can't be built in for habitable space.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Whereas currently, as you could see from the original, the original PUD, there was a very small courtyard with the residents really pushing into the rear third of the lot. So any new development would allow for a backyard and less coverage.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But there is an opportunity with a third story to do some roof deck, which allows you to have a nice view across Pulaski Park. So a lot of what this pud change to a Grange three is getting at is a different esthetic and a different opportunity for the new owner of the property.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Are there any questions for me? We will.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Do questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'After. Sorry, that's all I have.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Thank you. All right, councilmembers. That concludes our speakers. Now it's time for questions. Any questions of members of the council? Councilwoman Ortega, you're up.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. Mr. King, can you tell me how many units then that allows you to get on the site to. Just to and under the pad. Did that allow two? Okay, great. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Ortega. Councilman Espinosa, you're up.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And it should be noted that the two units might be restricted to maybe the 6250 that you have. However, this could be assembled with either of the two adjacent grade three properties and then fit what is called the garden court form.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I actually have several questions for Ryan, if I could.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It is still.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So is the garden court form still allowed in the grade three?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It is correct.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Has that has the sort of garden court, the discrepancy between garden court form as shown and as permitted? Has that been cured yet.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'As shown as.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Illustrated in the zoning code? There's a very specific graphic content of what a garden court form looks like, yet how it's manifested in the grade three today is very different than how it's portrayed. Okay. Has that been addressed?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I'm afraid I'm not aware of that particular situation, but I can definitely follow up with you after seeing the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Reason why I bring this up is I listened to I watched the hearing, the committee hearing, and I'm actually going to pull this committee hearing and share it with my colleagues who weren't on council at the time. There was a very robust discussion about the fact that there's all these PDS, there's no project coming forward.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This is just a straightforward rezoning. And I can tell you that the Cherry Creek that we know and love grew up in formed in that old zoning code, and all of these pods created what is desirable today. And to sort of blame the PDS as being the fault, I would argue, is what sort of preserved and created'",
        "'speaker_0': 'what is desirable today. The reason why I'm saying all that is you cited several plans, B 1.1, where it specifically said single family duplex and row homes. The graphics showed the row home, single family character. The The Cherry Creek adopted 2012 Cherry Creek adopted plan A again sited single family duplex and row homes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then in your own slide note five talked about why grades three was appropriate because it allowed single family duplex and row homes, but you omitted garden court in the garden court form is a perpendicular townhome that is very different in character than a grade three.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I mean, than a single family duplex or ten row home form, which all orient themselves towards the street. And so why this matters is an appropriate rezoning should have waived in order to respect the small area plans in place should have waived the garden court form from this proposal.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I encourage CPD to look at an overlay that somehow addresses this discrepancy between what is desired and in the smaller plan versus what is allowed in the existing zoning. Why this all matters. Is. Page 14. The this is an area of stability.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It is outside the area of change. And if you're going to justify modifying an area of stability by virtue of the fact that the area has changed around it. When by Design Blueprint Denver calls those areas of change, then you've opened up the area of stability to change because you're justifying it by the very change that the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'plan is desiring. So there's a big this there's there's sort of an incongruence between what the plans support, what the zoning allows, and what you guys are moving forward. I urge my colleagues to take tell this to vote no and to send this back to CPD for a modification that that modifies this and consistent with the smaller'",
        "'speaker_0': 'plans that are in place, because that grades three will in fact allow building forms a larger and in or in a different orientation and row house.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you. Great point. One of the get to the photos. Here we go. Images of the existing form and scale within the surrounding area here in the upper right hand corner. We do see a multi-family structure that was constructed under the former Chapter 59, and it does closely resemble the garden core concept.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'There are some units that do phase out towards the street, but there also are inward facing units on that courtyard. So we do believe that the G RH Three Zone District, with its inclusion of single family, duplex, garden court and indeed row house is consistent with this existing context.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I do apologize. The exclusion of Garden Court was by no means intentional.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But row houses wouldn't allow street facing garages.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That is correct.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You know, there's there's a character and an intent in the zone, in the small area plan, and there's a community input that drove that. And that's codified at least to whatever degree they can, because there's deliberate attempts to remove prescriptive language out of smaller plans.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think if we looked back at those discussions, we would find that the neighbors were actually calling for something far more prescriptive than what got written. And so I don't think that perpendicular townhomes and and curb cuts is probably the future that they all saw in there in that write up.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We do see language also.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I just was saying, Councilman, I want to I want to make sure that we say are these you kind of going in a comment period or any particular questions you want to ask? And I'll certainly afford after the question a little bit, definitely give you your your opportunity to comment on that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So does zero three the proposed zone district allow for forms other than some single family duplex in row homes that do not have to face? Well, it doesn't allow for other forms other than those three forms.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It does. Correct. But I believe in the garden court form standard that a certain a number of units must indeed face onto the primary street.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And does that allow occupied levels above three stories? Not not habitable space, but occupied levels above three stories.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Occupied as in a rooftop space. I believe not occupy able space. I believe perhaps the applicant is more familiar with the zone district standards as he is designing the project. But I do not believe that third story does allow for Occupy able space.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It does allow for the doghouse, you know, a limited square footage on the fourth story. That is.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Not Occupy Wall space though.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But the decks that they then that's why I said not habitable but occupy wall you can have mean occupy the rooftop.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yes. An individual could spend time on that rooftop. Correct. But it's not habitable space.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right. Thank you, Councilman. All right. Any other questions on 410? Scene. Nonpublic hearing is now closed. Time for comments. Councilman New, you're up.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'You know, I respect my esteemed colleague there on his wonderful zoning knowledge. I do want to support this rezoning. I'm very familiar with Cherry Creek, which is a booming residential growth area. And this proposal fits along very well with that street.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It's just a wonderful location, though, right across from Pulaski Park. What a beautiful, gorgeous park it is. And and I'm so glad that some of the older pads are being converted to much more modern residential homes. And I'm so familiar with the neighborhood association there.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Talk to many of them and they're very, very supportive. And and so I do want to support this this rezoning tonight. I also think that Councilman Espinosa has a good point that we ought to be considering in the future and talking about how how this should be discussed further.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So. But I don't think they should delay that as the rezoning tonight. I support this rezoning.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman. Do any other comments? Councilman Espinosa.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I do have to respond in that my concern, Councilman new isn't there's a lot of very wonderful projects that can come about in this zoned district. And I have no doubt that this team is probably capable and ready to deliver that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'However, I don't know that. I mean, I wish there was more public input on this process simply because this does allow something that is consequentially differing significantly, formally different than what was presented today as the way the by it I mean the existing fabric and the desirability.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It actually allows far more intense development than what was portrayed. And that disconnect will always concern me. Thank you.'",

And specifically the general urban road house. Three storey maximum district accommodates the urban house, duplex row house building forms and the garden court apartment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And this would. The Southern District would reinforce desired patterns in the existing neighborhood. Cipd finds that all review criteria have been met and we recommend approval in this application. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. We have one speaker today, kelly choppin. So I knew. I'm sorry. Go right ahead.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hi, I'm Kelly Chauvin. I'm here representing the owner of 59 through 75 South Jackson and living in Golden, Colorado. Councilman New asked me to come up and talk about the plans for the site. The owner is currently under contract with a local developer on the parcel.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The developer's built several different projects, row homes and duplexes in the Cherry Creek East neighborhood. And so I can't say for sure exactly what that developer plans on building, but I do know it will be within the grade three design guidelines and specifications, and any new development on the site will be a drastic improvement over what's currently'",
        "'speaker_4': 'there and will for sure help improve the Cherry Creek East neighborhood. And that is why the Cherry Creek Base has given us their full support of this rezoning. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. That concludes our speakers. Now time for questions from members of council. Guys. We're gonna take it.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I did not hear Tim when you were talking. What? The amount of parking is that would be required for the seven units that are allowed on the site.'",
        "'speaker_0': '512 requires two spaces per unit or a total of 14.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. All right. And then on the design, sort of taking off with the questions that Councilman Espinosa was asking earlier. Will the. Design be allowed to have the parking where the driveway is off the street in the the unit, the drive, the parking is underneath the units and they face one another.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We've seen a lot of those built in my neighborhood, and I'm just trying to get an understanding. I mean, I see samples of what some of the housing looks like that has been done throughout Cherry Creek. And it looks like most of the housing in Cherry Creek has the parking that's on the back, usually off the alley'",
        "'speaker_9': '. But I'm not sure if. And I'm not sure this is the exact point that Councilman Espinosa was was trying to get at, but I think that would drastically change the character of this neighborhood if the parking was underneath the units and you drove into the center off the main street where, you know, they parked underneath.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Just looking here at the rowhouse design standards and specifically under design elements. An attached garage is allowed may follow the detached garage building form side street side interior and rear setback so. I can't answer your question entirely.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I can't. That's, I guess you.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'There's someone else in the audience who can. Would you please introduce yourself?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hi. Good evening. I'm Sarah Showalter, planner with Community Planning and Development. So depending the you know, how the parking is oriented and the units are oriented does vary depending on the building form that they chose to use, since there's a variety of building forms permitted in this zone district, but generally there that is an option of the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'sites large enough, there's not a there's not something that would specifically preclude that kind of setup, but it would probably be challenging on a lot of sites to do that design and meet some of the other design requirements, specifically if they use the row house form the requirement to have entrances for all of the units that face'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the primary street. So it'll be very challenging to meet that requirement and also have a design that you just described. So even though that is not specifically not allowed it, there are other design standards that would for that building form prevent that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. Thank you. And answering my question.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Ortega. Councilman Cashman.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Just a detail. Be sure I understand. I thought you said the P.D. says two spaces per unit required. What would the new zoning require? Is there any the minimum requirement of the new zoning code or the current zone district for three is one space per unit.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Minimum requirement. Good. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman Cashman. Councilman Espinosa.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. I just wanted to thank you for acknowledging that the garden court form is is also included in that, not deliberately admitting that. And so, yeah, to answer my colleague's question, it does depend on the physical nature of the site.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The only way they actually can get those sort of back to back garages is if they have enough land area to have essentially two garden courts where they then can stick a driveway in between them. So.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right. Thank you, Councilman. Any other questions for 24? Scene nine public hearing is now closed. Time for comments, councilman. New.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Yes. As the rezoning in their previously talked about, I'm in support of this rezoning. We I think from my discussion with the owner today I think the developers planning on building three duplexes. Not seven years, but six units.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And so I think they hopefully should have more room to work with. So again, it's converting the PDS to more attractive homes that we're looking forward to in Cherry Creek East. And I think it's going to be a wonderful addition.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And parking has been a big issue and all the Cherry Creek. Fortunately, a lot of the developers are building more than the minimum of one space per unit and I surely hope that the market conditions which will surely apply to these these town halls will probably dictate more than one space.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So, you know, I do want to support this. I think it would be a good addition to Cherry Creek East Community and and look forward to this development.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman. Do any other comments for 24? Katherine Espinosa Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I do think that it's it's just a it's a fundamental difference in, in, in economics. And I don't know how we address this, but I'm going to look forward to doing that, which is in your case, in your neighborhood, you have a demand for large enough units that sort of justify big duplexes on this on 18,000 square'",
        "'speaker_0': 'foot parcels. But in my neighborhood and that's going to be a rowhouse with a garden court and it's going to be essentially three blocks of eight or something like that. And that's what this zone district allows. So my perspective obviously comes from a less high dollar neighborhood, but it's fast approaching your neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So, yeah, so there's something about the economics that drives how, how dense these developments are from a. Occupant standard, but it's the same square footage. But that's where it gets really difficult is when you have two dwelling units or four dwelling units, you have less demands, as you do when you put eight units and 16 units or'",
        "'speaker_0': 'more on that same parcel. And there's something in that delta that it would be nice if we had the mechanisms and means to address. Because when you go from four and the parking associated with 4 to 8 and the number of visitors to 16 and the number of visitors that come along there, it creates different pressures in'",
        "'speaker_0': 'our communities and the zoning. So somehow is not real cognizant of that. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Councilman Espinosa. Councilman Cashman.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Just not a comment on really this particular development so much as piggybacking on Councilman Espinoza's thoughts on cleaning up our zoning codes and maybe being more descriptive. And it just doesn't make a lot of sense to me to have zoning accommodate structures, the size that we'll be building here, whether it's six, seven, five'",
        "'speaker_0': 'or whatever, and have one parking space per unit. So I'd love to see us start addressing a more sane set of parking requirements in Denver. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman. Any other comments for 24? Seen none. Madam Secretary.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Roll Call New Ortega Assessment Black Clark High Flynn I Gilmore Cashman. I can ege Lopez. Hi, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Uh, Madam Secretary, you do not see Espinosa, but I see Espinosa.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, I was going to vote.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You can change your vote or.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. In fact, I was clicking on something else and that thing popped up. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. You want to withdraw that and chime in, and then you can do your voice vote. All right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Madam Secretary, please cast your vote in the results.'",
        "'speaker_7': '12 Ice.'",
        "'speaker_2': '12 Eyes for 24 has been placed on final consideration and does pass. See no other business before this body. This meeting is adjourned.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Now. Denver, 82, New York City, your source?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Denver eight. On TV and online. Stay connected to your community, your city, your source.'"
