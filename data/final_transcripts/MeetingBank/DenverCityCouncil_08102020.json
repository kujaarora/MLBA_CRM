Approves an official map amendment to rezone property from PUD 240 and U-MX-2x to U-RX-3 (mixed use, to residential mixed use), located at 4228 and 4260 Kalamath Street in Council District 1. The Committee approved filing this item at its meeting on 6-23-20.": [
        "'speaker_0': '13 Eyes Council Bill 201 has passed. Or moving on to 20-05, four or five. It's an ordinance changing the zoning classification for 4228 Kalama Street and 40 to 60 Kalama Street in Sunnyside. Councilmembers say to Barker, Will you please put Council Bill 545 on the floor for passage?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I move that council bill 545 be placed upon final consideration and you pass.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Oh, can I get that second? Thank you. The required public hearing for Council Bill 20-054 or five is open. May we get the staff report, please?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Certainly. Good evening, counsel. I'm Brandon Schaefer, presenting the official map amendment application four 4228 and 4260 cattlemen streets rezoning from PD 240 and um x2x2 you are x three. The subject property is located in Council District one in the Sunnyside neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Again, this request is for you or X3 that is urban neighborhood context residential mixed use three storey maximum height. The subject property is currently an industrial storage lot and a residential duplex measuring just over an acre of land area and is requesting a rezoning to allow for future residential development.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Existing zoning on the site is primarily 50 to 40, which I will detail on the next slide. And um, matched to X which stands for urban mixed use two storey maximum height with limited commercial uses. Many of the uses allowed in this district are tailored to ensure compatibility with the established residential neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Adjacent zoning is new to you. See, you are age 2.5 and industrial mixed use across the alley in the form of I am x three. So Peabody through 40 was approved in 1988 and it is based on the former Chapter 59, a07 zone district that contemplates the construction of a building of no more than 15,300 square feet'",
        "'speaker_2': 'for light manufacturing and office uses. This beauty also includes maximum floor area ratio and height, a minimum primary street setback, as well as requirements for parking, sidewalks, landscaped areas and building coverage. Current land uses of the subject properties are industrial and two unit residential adjacent land uses include single and two unit residential, industrial and office.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'These photos give you a sense of building form and scale with the subject properties on the left, residential structures across columns on the bottom right, and a mix of residential and industrial structures across the alley that are pictured on the top.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Right. This table shows a side by side comparison of the existing zone districts versus the proposed zone district. The proposed zone district three provides the townhouse and shopfront building forms and allows for an increase in height of 15 feet for a maximum of three stories and 45 feet.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Speaking to the process. Informational notice of this application was sent in February and a revised application was submitted in late April. Planning Board voted unanimously to move this case forward at their meeting on June 3rd. Notice of today's meeting was sent on July 20th.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So after the preparation of the staff report in this presentation, we did receive three letters from nearby property owners in support of this rezoning. Now moving to the criteria. These are the four plans that impact the subject property, starting with comprehensive plan 2040.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The proposed rezoning is consistent with many of the strategies in this plan, which are organized by vision elements that would allow for an increase in allowed housing density near the 41st and FOX stations, consistent with the equitable, affordable and inclusive goals and strategies.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Similarly, the proposed zoning would allow for a broader variety of uses that in intensity consistent with the desire for an urban, walkable, mixed use community which fits into the strategies and goals in the strong and authentic neighborhoods. Vision element.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Lastly, the land use patterns mentioned are consistent with the number of strategies and the environmentally resilient element, and therefore staff finds the request consistent with Plan 2040. Moving to Blueprint Denver. The subject property is mapped as part of the urban neighborhood context.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This context is described as containing small multi-unit, residential and low unit, low intensity, mixed use buildings embedded in single unit unit residential areas. As the proposed zone district is primarily intended to accommodate residential uses, the request is appropriate and consistent with the blueprint context.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The Future Places MAP designates the properties as low, medium residential. These properties are. This designation, rather is described as having aspirational characteristics of the low medium residential area. Having a mix of low and mid-scale residential options and limited mixed use is allowed along some arterial and collector streets into intersections.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Consistent with this guidance, the proposed district provides for a variety of residential options and allows for limited commercial uses. All the streets that surround the subject properties are classified as local or in designated. And my street, which is one block to the west, is classified as.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'A residential collector.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'As your x three is primarily residential. Request to district is consistent with the future street types at this location. The subject property is also located within all other areas of the city and blueprint Denver. These areas are projected to account for 10% of jobs and 20% of new households in the city by 2040.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The proposed rezoning will provide additional housing units and offered the opportunity for additional jobs, which is an appropriate change given these growth goals for the rezoning is consistent with the blueprint. Denver Future Growth Areas Plan Direction. Moving to the station area plan.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This was adopted in 2009 and sets forth the vision for the creation of a diverse, transit, supportive and environmentally sustainable urban center in the Land Use Concept Map. Subject properties are mapped as urban residential 1 to 3 stories.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'These areas are intended to create an improved edge for the adjacent residences and calls for a range of housing types, including single unit accessory dwelling units, duplexes, townhomes and small condominium and apartment buildings. Therefore, this rezoning request is consistent with both the land use and building types.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Recommendation and station area. The last plan is the Sunnyside Neighborhood Plan, adopted in 1992 that identified the subject properties as industrial and estates, the need for increased or improved buffers to separate the industrial and residential areas. At the time this plan was written in the nineties, the subject property was owned up to 40, which allowed for the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'industrial and office uses and b one on the corner of 43rd and Kalama, which allowed for limited office. Therefore, the proposed district is consistent with this plan as it follows allows for a range of residential building forms and improves the buffer between the local neighborhood to the west and the industrial areas to the north.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And to these. Staff also finds the requested zoning meets the next two criteria, as it will result in the uniformity of district regulations and will further public health, safety and welfare for the implementation of adopted plans and facilitating increased housing density near bus and rail transit services.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There are two justified circumstances for this rezoning. The first being changed and changing conditions in the surrounding area. Recent physical changes include the opening of the rail station in 2019 and the multi-use path along the street that connects the neighborhood to downtown.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The second justifying circumstance points to the majority of the site, which is currently zoned 50 to 40, retaining former Chapter 59 zoning after the city adopted the Denver Zoning Code in 2010. Overall, the proposed rezoning is consistent with the urban neighborhood contexts that exist in the surrounding area and with the purpose and intent statements.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'City staff recommends approval based on planning that all review criteria have been met. I'm happy to answer any questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Brandon. Tonight Council has received two written comments on Council Bill 545. There are two submitted comments in favor of the application and no submitted comments in opposition of the application. All council members that are present have certified that they have read each of the submitted written comments.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Do any members need more time in order to read all of the written testimony that has been submitted? Seen none. Madam Secretary, let the record reflect that all written testimony submitted regarding Council Bill 545 has been read by each member of council, and all written testimony has been submitted to the official record of the hearing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have one individual signed up to speak tonight, Matt Giovanni. And I believe he is the applicant. And we were going to. See if he would raise his hand. There's one phone call. PARTICIPANT So we're. Trying to see if Matt is here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. It looks like we don't have Matt here, and so we don't have any speakers for this hearing tonight. Questions from members of council. We have Councilman Ortega. Well, your mutant. I. Okay. There we go. I wanted to ask Brennan a question about.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sort of where that line is. In the Sunnyside neighborhood, where the height and the encroachment of sort of ends, if you will, we know that the light rail stop shares, you know, both the sunny side and the Globeville side of that that rail corridor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I'm just curious. When CPD identifies that the 20% has been met by a specific neighborhood, for example, some neighborhoods are growing exponentially because of their proximity to rail. But does that take into account that 20%? So help me understand those two things.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Where's that sort of boundary line on the western edge of the rail? So really the sort of eastern end of the neighborhood, but the west end of rail, so that it doesn't just keep continuing to encroach into the single family fabric of the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then when is that 20% threshold met? Sure. So your first question.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Work at the stationary plan and then kind of as we see these resources come in piecemeal, I think that it's fair to say that the encroachments really stop that Chalamet Street, that's where we really don't have any plans to offer more guidance and free stories.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then it gradually increases as you move over a couple of blocks to the east. And I believe the most intense is along Inca streets.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So does that include the west side of Columbus or does it end on the eastern side of Chalamet? The stationary plant.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I believe ends at the Western. So that was east of Callum Street towards towards the rail track.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. And then to the question about observing, you know, growth and and housing and and jobs, that really I think is more of an aspirational number. And it's something that we try to keep track of at a city wide bubble every year.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we do an annual update or report to blueprint number. I don't really think that there's it's not really meant to serve as a calculation of when the neighborhood gets there that will stop, you know, supporting rezonings in that area once we see that magic number get set.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So for me, part of part of why looking at the 20% by neighborhoods where we're seeing a lot of growth happen becomes important is because historically KPD has looked at the project. Piecemeal project by project, not at a neighborhood holistically and looking at the cumulative impact and whether or not this results in major infrastructure issues that have'",
        "'speaker_0': 'to be addressed. This is along a corridor where we have the Utah Junction outfall, which is a storm drainage corridor, where a lot of that water sort of flows down towards this area. And so, you know, understanding how the city's looking at the infrastructure, not just roads, but what, you know, storm drain and any of the other'",
        "'speaker_0': 'issues where upgrades need to occur. And we don't wait and then just expect the city to foot the tab where we should be looking at the areas a little bit more holistically like we're trying to do at the 41st and Fox area.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So that's why I bring that up and just wanted to kind of hear what the thinking of CBD is as we sort of bump up to that ceiling of that 20% or really start to exceed it significantly in certain neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So thank you. I have no further questions or comments. Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilwoman Sandoval.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Madam President. So, Brendan, did you say is the applicant on the line?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I thought they were. Can we try to look for him again, Mac?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We can. Matt, if you are in the attendance, please raise your hand. All right. It looks like we have Matt and we'll get him. And you did. Okay, ma'am.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hi. Good evening. Councilman Sandoval had a question for you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Could you repeat that again, please?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Hey, Matt. How are you? Councilman Tannenbaum.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'How are you?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Good. Thanks for joining us tonight. So can you talk to us a little bit about the community process that this site has gone through and what the plans are for it?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sure. So we started back in October of 2019, really looking at what the neighbors wanted out of the site before we made any plans to the. We sat through several of the meetings. And neighbors Councilwoman Sandoval and that the community organization at large.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We held a couple of conversations with outside and looking at what we could do with the project itself, really trying to create that transition neighborhood as we step towards the to the library and to the overall community, what was going to be better served with a stepping up of buildings versus jumping up to five stories?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we also heard from that the number of streets for the second or third work are stronger piece for this because of people moving through the neighborhood to get to the. So what we've we've done extensive outreach and met with the RINO's multiple times and will continue to do so as we move through the SDP portion.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Our intent is to develop the property and we will be taking those next steps after this decision.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And did I miss it? Did you see what you were developing the property into?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We currently do not know what the project will become given the time of COVID. We have reevaluated some of the offerings as well as look at what is coming in the next several months from projects around the city to consider, condos to address, and larger spaces and potentially larger apartments to offer a diversity of product to to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then it was good. Remind me. Are you doing that for the affordable housing? Are you paying the linkage fee or did you guys come to a decision with the neighborhood about building an on site and affordable?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We have opted to go towards the addressing that at the time of SDP. We don't yet know what the final metrics of the building are because of the square footage. And we reach out to both and financing companies to understand how we could cover that affordable housing piece.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But we have not yet at this time figured that financial aspect of this project out.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And is there one owner or multiple owners of the proposed site?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There are multiple owners. We the the LLC that is we were representing controls 7/8 of the block. The last corner piece is a single family owner duplex property that we do not control, but we felt that was necessary to come into the council with a complete thought for the entire block so that there was not a small'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to parcel remnant of older zoning with the. Amex property.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And have they discussed about wanting to redevelop or are they okay with their use by right what they have going on.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Currently there are in use by right. And we've not made any overtures to take that property. We don't. We're not we're not trying to force them out of that property at this time.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And is the developer the funder is the developer or the person who's doing the building or would they sell it to a different developer? I mean, is the property owner the developer sorry.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'For a property owner is intending to develop themselves probably with a junior partner to help with the vertical.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Ortega. That raised a couple last last minute questions. So the single family property that is included in the red zone application and they were fully aware and okay. Being included. Can you clarify that?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. So we've met with several times at the beginning, back in October. We also looked at the adjacent properties on to the east on the other side of the alley to join us. At that time, they chose to not join us, but it was by the owner of that small parcel that they accepted.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'To join our our rezoning.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So we're up zoning their property, but they're not part of the assemblage of what would be developed. Correct.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Correct. The assemblage today is effectively a vacant parking lot that's used for industrial storage. So not of use really fitting within the neighborhood as it stands today, as it transitions to a more residential commercial district. But there is no displacement of existing homes and no change of that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We just need to move from the existing PD that limits us to effectively only building a warehouse building and move that to something more suitable for the neighborhood today.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And can you tell me if you all have pursued conversations with the Colorado Housing Finance Authority about low income tax credits as part of a way to do either? The affordable is that would be required under the city's linkage fees or to just incorporate more affordable housing on the site.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we did reach out to hosts to see what funding mechanisms they may be able to offer. The current construct of host only allows for 100%, 30% AMI so the entire building has to be serving some very low to no income product.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So it's really funding things like DHEA and other avenues that development is occurring.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So just interrupt. Host and the Colorado Housing Finance Authority or two completely different entities. And yes, oftentimes the city does have money into projects that go before. But that the question was about whether or not you had approached Chapel about the possibility of looking at an application to secure some income tax credits for the project.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we haven't gone very far with. A lot of them want to see our final project to understand what kind of gap they can provide for us, because we are so early in this process and we don't know what the final configuration of the building will be.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's very difficult to even show this to a lender to say, can we can we get financing right now?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And just the last question. So what prevents you from getting the zoning and then just flipping the property for highest and best value?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There are no mechanisms that stop us from that effort. But being that we've put through and worked diligently with the neighbors to establish this and in good faith, we. We intend to develop this project.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Great. Thank you. I have no further questions. Appreciate your answering.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Your.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilwoman. The public hearing for council bill 20 dash zero five, four or five. It's closed comments by members of council. All right. So, you know, comments by members of council or councilwoman. Okay. Just wanted to make sure I didn't miss anybody.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Building form where you double check that and and you don't have to get it tonight. But will you double check that?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Absolutely. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Madam President. Just a curious. Because I was looking. Virtually since we're not going out. But I. I was looking at this one along with the other rezonings, and I noticed that on the back part of the what I offer the alley, there is a six foot privacy fence that is.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Looks like it, maybe about 35% into the back of the lot. And it sort of marks off the back yard from the portion where the aid would go. And I'm curious if someone if the owners here, Libby, maybe you could explain why that is.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's actually the shed that's behind the house is now part of what's fenced off onto the alley. And I'm just curious about does the do you have to have access from the front, from the primary street? Is it necessary that access from the alley?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And do we know why that six foot fence is there? It apparently doesn't have from the image, it doesn't look like it has a gate in it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And the applicant to be available who could maybe answer that configuration a little better than I could.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I'm sorry, there is there is a gate there by the shed. I'm just curious, because I've never seen this before.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right or. Getting the applicant in.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm Ben Holtzman. Can you guys hear me okay? Yes. Thank you. Great. Thank you. When me and my wife purchased this property, that fence had already been built there. In the middle, there is a gate in the back.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I believe the intention of whoever built it was just to have extra parking in the back. So we do have parking in the front on the driveway and then two or three spaces in that space in the back.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that I guess having the fence there is what gave me the idea to get it back there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Excellent. Okay. Thank you. I would point out that it's not paved, so you can't actually park on it. So I mean, a better use as an aid to you. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilman. Councilwoman Torres.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Madam President. Hi, Benjamin. How are you?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, how about you?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Good. I didn't. I don't think I asked this question when it was in committee. But do you plan to rent it or is it for family use?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I would. Probably. Well, I haven't determined that yet. Probably mostly rental. Occasionally family. But it's kind of a long way off in determining exactly how I'm going to build it. Okay. No immediate plans to build it anyway, I think, especially after COVID.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm going to have to save up for quite some time.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we have we have a new one that just came up at the end of our alley. If you want to see some that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Have recently been built, give us a call.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But just wanting to make sure that, you know, because this was a question in terms of neighbors who opposed it, if you rent it, you're the primary occupants. Right. So you're not planning to move.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Correct. We are the primary occupants.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. Thank you, Madam President.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'I do support and our office does.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Barnum.'",
        "'speaker_5': '70%, 80 use. We haven't seen at least zoned for 80 years.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We haven't seen too many getting built.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Libby I'm not sure if that has come up for, for, for you all at all. But even those that are zoned, I haven't seen too many site development.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Plans come through.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So with that, with the option, we are still finding folks really wanting to enter into this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Space and we.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Want to encourage them to do that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I appreciate this application and look forward.'",

Approves an official map amendment to rezone property from U-SU-C1 to U-SU-B1 (Allows for an accessory dwelling unit), located at 1901 South Clarkson Street in Council District 7. The Committee approved filing this item at its meeting on 6-23-20.": [

And it's a bill for an ordinance changing the zoning classification for 1901 South Clarkson Street in Platte Park. Councilman CdeBaca, will you please put Council Bill 576 on the floor for passage?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I move that council bill 576 be placed upon final consideration and do pass.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's been moved and seconded. The required public hearing for Council Bill 20 20576 is open now. We have the staff report, please.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Go ahead, Libby.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'All right. I am the other Libby with community planning and development. And hopefully, can you all see my screen? Mm hmm. Okay, great. So this is 1901 South Clarkson Street. This is located in Council District seven. In the Plat Park neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And the applicant is requesting to rezone from urban single unit C one with a minimum zone lot size of 5500 square feet to urban single unit B one, which has a minimum zone lot size of 4500 square feet.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The site's approximately 4690 square feet. And it's located at the intersection of Jewel Avenue and Clarkson Street, a block north of Evans Avenue. And as I just stated, the current zoning is urban single unit C one. This does allow for the accessory dwelling unit use and the detached accessory dwelling unit building form, but it only allows the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'building form on a minimum zone lot size of 5500 square feet. And so as you can see, there's other you zoned district along Clarkson Street. And then as U.S., you see as you move farther east and then you SUV one to the north and the west of the site.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The existing land use is a single unit home. Most of this area is single unit uses with multiple. There's several duplexes scattered throughout. And then as you can see, there's more commercial an office along the commercial corridor of South Pearl Street.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The bottom right hand side is the existing home, but above it is another existing single unit home in the area across Jewel. And then there's the existing and existing duplex approx across Clarkson Street and then kind of the start of the commercial corridor on South Pearl with the restaurant.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This application was complete at the beginning of April. An informational notice was sent to neighboring property owners within 200 feet of the site on April 3rd. It went to planning board on June 3rd, where it was recommended unanimously for approval.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We have received several public comments. We received a comment from the Platt Park People's Association, as well as five neighboring property owners, all in opposition of the proposal. The Park Peoples Association said they are supportive of accessory dwelling units in the neighborhood, but they were concerned that this particular rezoning would lead to spot rezoning.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then out of the five emails that we received, several of them were concerned that this would actually make the neighborhood less affordable and as well as concerned with parking issues that this could cause. And then two of the comments were concerned that this could lead to commercial uses, such as a medical office on the site.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But this would not open up the site for commercial uses. There are five review criteria that must be met in order for it to be approved. And I'll go through each of each one. The first is consistency with adopted plans, of which there are two.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In Comprehensive Plan 2040. There are several strategies that this proposed rezoning meets. I'll just go over a couple of them. The first is it will create a greater mix of housing options in every neighborhood for all individuals and families, which will lead to a more equitable, affordable and inclusive Denver.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And it will also promote an environmentally resilient Denver by promoting infill development. And we're infrastructure and services are already in place. Now moving to blueprint the guidance for this area is the urban neighborhood context, which is a single and two unit residential areas with some multi-unit and mixed use embedded throughout the block.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Patterns are regular and there's alley access and then a high degree of walkability. The future place type for this site is low residential, which is predominantly single and two unit uses and accessory dwelling units are appropriate. The future street type for both Dual Avenue and Clarkson Street are local, which are mostly characterized by residential uses.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Blueprint also goes into further detail on when it's appropriate for rezoning to go from to request a smaller lot size. And so it says that it's only appropriate when there's an established pattern of surrounding blocks of smaller lots with similar uses that would that would be consistent with the zone district request.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So this map that's on the screen shows the sizes for the lots and the surrounding blocks. So you can see the lot. The subject site has the the red box around it, and the block that it's on is about split between lots that are under 5500 square feet, which would be more consistent with the US sub one'",
        "'speaker_5': 'zone district and lots that are greater than 5500 square feet, which would be more consistent with us. You see one once you cross Clarkson Street to the east side and then move further east, you can see if there's a pattern of the yellow and the kind of purple lots.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so that really does those are the larger lots that are more consistent with us, you see and see one. But when you go north, northwest and west of the site, you can see that there's a lot more of the teal color which is more consistent with the US.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You be one zone district size. So based on this, staff found that there is an established pattern of smaller lots. But because there needs to be both an established pattern of smaller lots with similar uses, the applicant provided this second map.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So this is they went through and found where all the accessory dwelling units are in the area. So the subject side, it has the yellow star and then you can see where all the black stars are, are where they found accessory dwelling units and most of them are on properties that are zoned sub one, but you have'",

        "'speaker_5': 'And then the growth area strategy is all other areas of the city, which is where we anticipate 10% of new jobs and 20% of new housing by 2040. Staff also finds it meets the next two criteria and that it will result in uniformity of district regulations and it will further the public health, safety and welfare, primarily through'",
        "'speaker_5': 'implementing city adapted plans. The newly adopted guidance and blueprint on when it's appropriate to rezone to a district with a smaller lot size serves as the justifying circumstance for this application. And finally, staff finds that this proposal is consistent with the urban neighborhood context, the residential zone district purpose and the US hub.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'One intent statement. So therefore staff finds that it meets all five criteria and we recommend approval of this rezoning. And that concludes staff presentation. I'm happy to answer any questions and the applicant is available as well.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'So and the dense dwelling.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Miss Paul. That concludes our speakers questions from members of Council. Councilwoman Sandoval.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Madam President, for the. I have a question for the Mrs. for right now. Do you. What's your zoning? Is your zoning as a rule, it's the same.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'As the farthing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So it's it doesn't allow accessory dwelling units or is it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I don't have the lot.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So is not large enough. Okay. So you're in the same kind of situation where you have connect. Whose baby is this? What is the situation where she has see one but the lot size is too small so she wouldn't be able to have an accessory dwelling unit.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Is that what I'm understanding? So I haven't looked at her lot size, but. So you can still have an accessory dwelling unit if you're under the minimum lot size, but you would have to be attached. So it's just prevents the detached accessory dwelling unit.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'If it's not 5500 square feet in the US, you see one district. But you can have it in the basement. Correct. Okay. Thank you. That clarifies my question. Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Sawyer.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thanks, Madam President. I think that clarifies my question, too. I was trying to figure out I guess I still need a little more clarification, Libby. The form based zoning code. This is the part that to me is like speaking Greek because.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I guess I need a little more clarification around the purpose of rezoning from the sea to the sea. Yeah. That have to do with the lot size and the requirement that it be attached versus the unattached 80 you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah. So I believe I mean the applicant is here, but I believe he would like to do a detached accessory dwelling unit and that you have to have the minimum lot size. But you then attached you don't. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. I was. So it's got to do. Can I is that is it okay if I ask just one more question, Madam President. So, Mr. Farthing, maybe could you explain or clarify is that is that your intention then to do the detached one and that's why you're rezoning?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah. Can everybody hear me?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right. I got awesome. First foremost, thank you guys for giving me the opportunity and consideration for this rezoning. But that to answer your question, yes, that would be our intent was to be a detached accessory dwelling unit, just like all the other ones that are in the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Got it. Okay. Thanks so much. No further questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilman Clark.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Madam President. A couple of questions, Libby. I looked through the staff report, and I saw the letter, which was very short from EPA. They didn't say that they oppose it. They said that they're not able to support it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Maybe I'm thinking more with the marijuana social consumption where there's, you know, support non opposition and oppose. Do we just treat anything that is not support as opposition or because it didn't say we oppose this, it says we are unable to support it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So talk me through. There's something that I'm missing there. Or is that just how we treat anything other than support?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'No, that's a great question. That was my assumption, which could have been incorrect because yeah, you're right. They said they chose not to support. So I assumed that meant that they opposed. But you're right, I don't know how I can ask as that's a question I can bring up to our reasoning team.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. I just read a lot like a letter of non opposition versus a one and I didn't know if we had that distinction when it came to zoning. You had mentioned this, but just to quickly clarify and get on the record, there were two of the comments against that reference, some sort of business operation, a dental, medical'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that is not allowed under any of these conditions attached any of that? Correct.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then there is also in the staff report, there is, you know, a couple of pages, I think starting around page 46 that show a map and then people are in support. And your staff report, you only said we received the you know, the letter from three V.A. is letters in opposition to we don't count that kind'",
        "'speaker_2': 'of stuff. Those are just other things. How does that get quantified? Because it's in the staff report, but it wasn't in the presentation. So just curious, but.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Correct. Yeah. So those were from the applicants outreach. So those were not letters that staff had received. The other ones were things that we have received, but the applicant can speak. That was from his outreach to the neighboring property owners.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Okay. I think those were the questions that I had. Thank you very much. Thank you. Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilman Hines.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Madam President. So I think Councilmember Clark, we are calling him that instead of President Clark. But anyway, Councilmember Clark, I was I've got similar questions. So thank you for distinguishing between the applicants letters and these letters.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Were you saying that all of the comments that CPD received were in opposition? Is that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Correct?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And how many comments was that?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We received five. Five.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. And and CPD believes this is worthy of acceptance despite the letters of opposition. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Correct. Based on the criteria, we do find that it is compliant with the criteria.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And and so I think that, you know, some of the concerns were about private property rights or the lack of privacy or. I am I am I kind of digesting the the letters that you received and opposition accurately.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah. So there I mean, there were concerns about parking as well as that this could make the neighborhood less affordable.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sure. Okay. And and so there is a rezoning in my district, which is not related to this one, about an area that I'm I'm learning a bit because so far we have never in in my you know, in my year on council president has been pretty clear.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We have unanimously accepted every area rezoning. And so I'm trying to trying to figure out how we might break that mold. And I don't really see how how we can do that, because our president has been pretty firm and pretty unanimous for all of them.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I. I guess. There is also a concern about private property rights. Like, as in, if someone build something that goes above my fence, then that impedes my property rights. But doesn't it? I mean, I guess I could also it's that isn't relevant for the five criteria because that's both plots that the owners of each of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'those plots have private property rights. And and so how would we necessarily correlate that? Am I barking up the wrong tree or the right six foot fence or.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah. I guess I did. Do you have a specific question?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I just.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Know. I know. I apologize. I guess I am asking a softball question that really doesn't have an easy answer. But I mean, I guess the question is this you don't see any place in the five criteria where private property rights of the current owner or the adjacent property owner meet or fit into any of those criteria.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Is that right?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Thank you. And thank you, Madam President. Madam President. Guy. Sorry. Go ahead. I just wanted to, I guess, reiterate the fact that, you know, I know there is some opposition, but we I have done my family. I've done all kinds all the due diligence we possibly can.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And and we want to make sure that all of our neighbors are happy and and bring a decision together that that makes sense. Right. And I I've spoken at length with with with Barbara, our next door neighbor. Next door neighbor, as well as all the surrounding neighbors.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I know that we can come to if there is any opposition or any discomfort, you know, it's something that we talk about constantly and want to make sure that everybody's happy. So, you know, we really want to reiterate the fact that that, you know, we're not trying to piss off any neighbors here and really do the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right thing. But, you know, according to the city's adopted plans, you know, everything undeniably does follow the adopted plans of the building to use. And I guess my, my, my, I guess approach would be kind of two pronged, right?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'One, the consistency of adopted plans, but then to I mean, regardless of and EDU is even to be built on this on this lot the lot is more like a U.S. would be want than it is a see one.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we're basically rezoning it to what it should be to begin with, which was out of my control when this thing got zoned right years and years and years ago. But, you know, at the end of the day, we really just want to be a good neighbor and and do the right thing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So that's.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'My little pitch.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Madam President. Mr. Farthing, as long as we have you here. Couple of questions as I'm looking again at the aerials. I noticed there's a garage that faces the side street, not the alley. Is there. Is your intention to build a detached adu in place of the garage?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. So that garages is built probably, what, 1905? It's not usable as a garage now it's a storage shed. And so that would be torn down and everything would be built to code and yeah, there would be a garage and then they do on top of it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. And because the, the zone and the size of the lot would allow an attached adu. Why are you not doing that?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, simply because of the size of our lot and the alley access. We want to keep as grass as possible. And I don't know. Then we got to deal with. Okay. Can we have a curb, side to side street access from door or have access in the alley?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So there's that option potentially. But we we we never really wanted to do that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But why? Because there is there already is a curb cut for the garage on Jewel.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But but it would have to be detached because there's the curb cut on the garages, I don't know, 30 or 40 feet from where my house is. And so I don't we wouldn't want to build the house that takes up the entire lot and lose every single square footage of grass.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. And are you or have you actually moved to Steamboat? Are you in Steamboat right now?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I am in Steamboat, yes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. So are you. And what is the plan for this? Well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know, the plan right now is just to be here for a year. You know, with COVID and everyone working remotely, my wife and I have been talking about moving in the mountains for since we've been together for seven years.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Ten years. And and so we said, all right, all right, now's the time to do it. And we have an opportunity. And so, yeah, we're up here for a year just to, I guess, see if you like it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But, you know, regardless of of our outcome in Steamboat, we still want to be able to have the opportunity to. To build the ADA and our Denver house. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Now, you just bought this house about a year and a half ago.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yep.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'November. And you're thinking of selling it already?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No, no, no. We're never going to sell our house.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Oh, you use it around and. Pardon me. That's my clock chiming on the hour. I apologize.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No one going to hear that. One more.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. So you're going to rent both the Adu and the house?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No. No. So we would never, ever, ever do that. The adu. If if if we move back to Denver. Right. And if we have the money to build the Adu. Right, then it would be a a place for me to stay when we're in Denver.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Because my wife's name is Endeavor and or option to write. We move. We don't like Steamboat and move back to Denver. And our current home kicked the renters out, though, did you? And now we have a place for Asian grandparents to stay in my home office.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Obviously, rental, rental opportunities and all the equitable, positive positives that their native will bring.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Thank you. Libby, can I ask you a couple questions now on the the zoning that is there now, the C1. Allows them attached to you? Correct.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But the lot size is too small for a detached. This is what I'm hearing, correct?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And the justification for it is the the ungrammatical. I'll point out, being an old editor, it is only appropriate to allow smaller lot sizes in the existing zone district if there is an established pattern in the surrounding blocks of smaller lots with similar uses.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we have a map with one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten black stars that indicate that there are 80 use of those locations. Are all of those detached or are any of them attached to use?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They're they're all detached.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They're all detached. Okay. Thank you. And, Libby, what is the is given the the footprint of the house? Are there any setbacks from the primary residence or the primary structure to the ADU that obviously on a smaller lot you might run into a problem like that?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But do they apply in this case?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so there's no set back that I'm aware of from the structure. There could be building requirements, but it does need to be in the back 35% of the lot.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So you don't know if the primary structure came close to that 35% line. Fire code would, of course, say you have to have some kind of setback. Yes. Minimum five feet, I imagine. Okay. Are there any rules about these to use in this zone district or in any zone district that say you must be the primary resident'",
        "'speaker_3': 'of the property in order to have it or do. I'm sorry. Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Oh, no, you can finish your question.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Or. Or can you rent both the house and the you two separate parties?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So in all single unit districts that allow ADU is this is city wide where regardless of what neighborhood context you do have to, the owner needs to live on the site.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Thank you. And are there any restrictions? I don't think there are. But confirm for me, can and Adu be used as a short term rental? Yes. And in all cases.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes, it can. Okay. As long as the owner is living right.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Thank you. That's all, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilwoman Ortega. Thank you, Madam President. Those were somewhat along the lines of my questions that Councilman Flynn was just asking. So first, I wanted to just ask Levy, when we have applicants coming in to zone their property for an EDU, what justification do you all use to verify that they are in fact an'",
        "'speaker_0': 'owner and occupant of the property that they own?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So for that I would have to get back to we don't I wouldn't actually review the request that would be with development services would be the ones that are residential team to actually review the zoning permit to make sure that the property owner does live on site.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I'm not exactly sure what they look at, but I can find that out and get back to you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, since it is one of the criteria that allows an application to move forward, it seems to me somewhere in that front end application process we should be doing some of that verification. And so I guess I just question how.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'An application is allowed to move forward if we have an applicant that does not live on the premise. This individual is the owner. But, I mean, he just admitted he's living for a whole year in a different city, and that is one of the criteria.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I guess I would just ask who from the city attorney office is available and I want you to weigh in on this question about how we can allow an applicant to move forward that does not live on the property, given that it is one of the clear criteria that has to be met to move forward with'",
        "'speaker_0': 'an ADU on your property. And we have Nate Lucero here. And so we'll get. So, Nate, can you help us into the.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah. Can you hear me now, Councilwoman? Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Great. So is the question related to whether or not. You can have an accessory dwelling unit and not be the owner of the property.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So two questions. The first is what do we do to verify that you are an occupied owner making the application to do an ADU? Because that is one of the criteria. Are we allowed to move forward knowing that we have an applicant that does not live on the premise?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Admittedly.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I think Libby is correct in that development services would have a process to ensure that any applicant to construct an accessory dwelling unit is the occupied owner. I'm not sure what their list of. Criteria is that they go through to ensure that the that the residence is owner occupied.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But there must be a way that they do that. So in this case. You know, with Mr. Farthing not living at the residence, he would not be able to apply to construct the ADU. So if he were to move back to the residence and make application for the construction of an 80 you, then he could move forward'",
        "'speaker_2': 'with that effort.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But let me ask my question differently. The fact that this applicant is not an occupied owner can be used as justification to deny the application for moving forward. Correct.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Are you talking about denying the rezoning because the owner doesn't live there?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's part of the criteria that has to be met as far as them being able to move it forward. So how do we justifiably approve it when admittedly the owner is saying, I don't live there? So I'm going to be there for a whole year.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I'm making the application and. I may or may not live there at any time in the future. But, you know, I want to move forward with this application and I get that we have to deal with every single zoning on its own merits.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Behind you brought up the question about, you know, this has been the practice across the city and yes, across the board. We've been talking about wanting to see more opportunities for ADAS to exist in our city because it's part of our housing solutions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right. But at the same time, if we have a criteria that comes through the CPD office, it seems to me all of that should be bundled into an application that is put before us, regardless of whether it's part of this arm of that arm of CPD, it should all be, you know, the same the same process move'",
        "'speaker_0': 'forward.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, so what we're doing here this evening is considering the entitlement of the property and whether or not a rezoning to the US you be one zoned district is appropriate. So we're not considering any development application in that city council this evening.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We're only considering whether or not it would be appropriate to rezone this property to a specific district.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We're creating that entitlement with a known property owner saying, I don't live there, and that's what I'm having struggle with in terms of the the process that we're dealing with here. Now, if he lived in the property and he was making the application, that would be completely different.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But he's admittedly saying, I'm not going to be there for a whole year, but I'm making this application. So that's that's my struggle with it. So I'll just have to vote as I may. It sounds like there isn't any other explanation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'For addressing my question.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, can I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Just a moment, sir. We need the city attorney to respond. Nate. Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So it's really a bifurcated question, Councilman Sandoval. One is. I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So. So one is the entire process, right? Like many developers that you see come before, you sometimes are just entitling the property and then they turn around and sell it to whoever is going to actually construct the project.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If not, all of those processes have this kind of criteria attached to it. That's the difference between this and those.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah. And I would respectfully disagree because all rezonings have the exact same.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Criteria that you have to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Consider.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. I'm not going to argue with you. I just don't agree. So thank you. The photos were the extent of my questions. Thank you, Councilwoman. Next up, we have Councilman Sawyer.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thanks, Madam President. My question is for Mrs. Poole. So you said you have 13 inches from your window of the back of your house to your property line. Is that correct? Oh, I'm sorry. You're muted. You can't unmute yourself there.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You're in there? Yes, that's correct. How did that end with setback? We have setback requirements. So how did that happen? Back in the twenties, maybe. I don't know. When these are old homes, it's. Okay. At some point it was re zoned.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This is it was this way when I bought the home that got it the property line. Okay. The reason I'm asking is because one of the criteria that we have to consider is health, safety and welfare of the community.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Right? So if we are looking at a rezoning and we are looking at a situation where a potential of 82 is being built and there's if you can pass a cup of sugar from one window to the other because there were no setbacks in the twenties when the properties were built, that is weird and potentially a safety'",
        "'speaker_5': 'issue, which is why I am asking the question. So I was just trying to mind around and I've been looking on Google Maps at the, at the at your property connections and trying to figure out, you know, where the property lines are.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So can you explain to me a little bit more what what your concern is about that? Well, I think just the I think the loss of privacy and the decreased property value, those are my biggest concerns with an EDU because right now we you know our backyard.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's you know, I mean they could look over the fence but I mean you know one I mean we can just enjoy it feels safer than having a renter in a unit that I mean and it's I know that that is not unique I mean that's people have that all the time, but that wasn't there when I'",
        "'speaker_5': 'bought the property. So it's just kind of a new.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Exposure that I don't enjoy. It's my daughter and myself, and it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Just makes me feel a little more vulnerable. Then the decreased property value is something else. So, you know, I'm not sure.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The impact, but I don't think it would increase.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So those are my biggest concerns. And then.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You know, if it is right now, they're, I think, three. Is that correct, Corey?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Three renters. Four.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So there's parking. There's, you know, so all that and then a few. And and have you talked to your next door neighbor about potentially, if they were to move, if they were to get the rezoning, if they were to move back from Steamboat, if they were to then qualify, move back into their house and qualify them for'",
        "'speaker_5': 'all of the criteria to apply for the ADU and be able to afford to build it. Given all of the financial challenges of COVID, potentially, maybe like putting up a privacy fence or some sort of, you know, have you have you maybe kicked around a potential compromise here?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We haven't talked the details.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's been a very.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You know, non contentious discussion with I mean, Corey's.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Been very respectful and I mean, it's been but I just feel like this is my last opportunity to protect myself and my daughter. And so that's why I'm taking it tonight. I don't know how with the proximity that the structure would need to be.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I mean, the privacy.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Fence would.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Have to be very.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'High, you know, so short of.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Not having windows on the south side.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm not sure how.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You could avoid.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You know, the losing privacy.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. All right. Great. Thank you. Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Clark.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Madam President. And Nate and Livvy, I want to be get this crystal clear here, because I think I think some things were getting inflated. There is no criteria within the rezoning that speaks at all to the residency requirement when it comes to 80 years.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That requirement lives in. If I'm going to rent out both units for a city. Stapleton You know, for a city I think was developed, Stapleton did not intend to live in any of those. They built units with 80 views on zoning that was allowed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They saw that, in fact, you can buy a structure with an ADU as a rental property and never live in it. You just cannot rent the adieu unless you yourself live in the property. But that is not one of the criteria when we talk about that criteria for rezoning that does not exist anywhere in the rezoning criteria'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that only exists in the if I am living in it and I choose to rent the Adu that comes into play at that point. But purchasing an entitlement rezoning that does not live anywhere in those criteria is not correct.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Can I get legal to also confirm that since I know Councilwoman Ortega was talking about the legal criteria that we are required by law to test this application against that criteria of whether someone will live in that structure does not live anywhere in the rezoning criteria.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Is that correct? Nate or I see your son on here as well? That's correct. Councilman Clark, thank you. Okay. So I just wanted to make sure that we were we were talking about two different things. One is, who will eventually own the property and what they will do with that?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And in fact, anyone could go buy a house that has an 82 on it and they could rent that unit. They just can't rent both units. They would have to rent the house with the idea that somebody could use as their office or or whatever.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But the only person who could rent that second unit is the person who lives there. And that does not live anywhere in the rezoning, which is what we have. Barbara, I have a question for you. You had mentioned that this hasn't been contentious and that you've been, you know, kind of evolving over time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I did notice as I was going through the staff report that the applicant had submitted, you know, kind of a petition with 12 people in support that I'd asked about. I looked closer at that. And you were one of those people who signed that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that is, in fact, true, that at that point you thought you were of you changed your mind. Not. You're not asserting that anything was fabricated incorrectly about your support at that point?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'No, I was hesitant, but I did sign.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And but as things.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Have moved forward, they've recently.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Moved and it just kind of blew it up. And, you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Know, the situation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Changed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I totally understand. I just wanted to make sure that because I saw your name on there is in support and then you're here in opposition that there was no you know, this wasn't fake. You that was you were was.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Not able known or whatnot.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I just wanted to be crystal clear on that point as well. Thank you, manager or Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Clark. Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hey, Madam President, I spend a little bit of time listening also, but looking at that map again. And Libby, maybe you can answer this for me. The some of the stars on the map that shows some of the existing arrows, some of which are fairly frequent, fairly recent, rather.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But none of those parcels appears to have been resolved. How how did all those on the north side of July along Clarkson, how did they get approved and built? Wouldn't they have needed a similar rezoning?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So those are already zoned for use, as is the subject site so that most of Platte Park.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And they're in their ones they're in the ones that are allowed on the larger the 5500 square foot.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'No they're on the ones that allowed on the smaller so used to be one which is what the applicant is a 44 flats is locus currently at the site of bus us ub1 to the north and the west.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I do want to put it I know that we've talked a lot about it to use, but because they can already do any of you, this rezoning is really more about rezoning to a district with a smaller lot size than it is about allowing an adu because it does already allow for an 82 use.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. And but in the with the smaller lot size, it has to be an attached.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Right? So because they don't meet the minimum zoned district, lots of size of the current that it would have to be attached there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So the ones the ones that I did see on Google Street View show that there are they are detached north of dual.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Correct. Yeah. So those would all probably that means so because those are all in the US U be one zoned district. They have a minimum lot size of at least 4500 square feet which is of the applicant is applying for.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. So they can do the the detached the ones that are in the C one.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They are. I saw one there that was also detached.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah. So that. Yep. So we would have to have at least a minimum zone size of 5500 square feet. And if you look across the street on Clarkson, a lot of those lots are around 7000 square feet and there's a lot of 60 to 50 lots in the neighborhood as well.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right, Councilman Hines.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Madam President. So. Is it possible that this was actually just an oversight in the 2010 rezoning or whatever the you know, whenever this particular plot was set up, that it was just a oops because it's it's right next to a whole bunch of other plot centers owned by one.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And this one happens to be C one.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah. Know, I'm not exactly sure. It is interesting how the lines are. There's a lot of you know, normally you'll see there's there's more rectangular where the district boundaries are but in plot park it is kind of very zigzag on where it changes from B to C and then B one to just be.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I'm not exactly sure what.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The I guess I'm asking you to say, did some of your team screw up back in 2010? So and I'm not trying to do that, but but it just seems to me like this might this might have just been a noose.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And and I do I very much respect your comment about this isn't about an issue. You can put an issue on his property right now. And I think that's a really important distinction because all the letters of opposition are about the ADA.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So at least as I understand it. So I think that's a I think that's an interesting and important distinction. So thank you. Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman. Councilman Flynn, I see you lowered your hand. All right. The public hearing for Council Bill 20 dash 0576 is closed. Comments by members of council. Councilman Clark.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Madam Chair. First, I wanted to thank Barbara for coming down and being our Sloan speaker on this. So thank you for that, for taking time for sticking with us. So 930 at night, really appreciate that. I also live in Plattsburgh and I also have a house that sits way closer to the property line than would'",
        "'speaker_2': 'currently be allowed under the zoning code because these homes were built before those rules. And so mine is I think I have a couple more inches than you. I think I'm 20 inches from the property line on on one side, which causes all kinds of interesting issues when you try to touch anything on your house because now'",
        "'speaker_2': 'your entire house is in the wrong place and you can't move a house over. It also, I think, creates a lot of we have a lot of houses. You know, the minimum lot size frontage on the block that I live in is only 25 feet.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so we're going about 25 feet, then another house, then another house. You have a lot of these issues of privacy, right? When you are only about 25 feet from width before one neighbor and the next neighbor. And it's not just around 80 use.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's also there are a lot of historic one story structures and then someone builds a two storey and it goes back further than the one story. And now you have a two story home where the third you're looking directly into somebody's backyard and attached to you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And this would certainly create that condition where an attached to you doesn't get rid of the privacy concern by being on the back. You're overlooking the alley potentially or the other garage. The extension of of an attached to you could be looking directly on to the backyard, which we see a lot in that park where someone has'",
        "'speaker_2': ', you know, a smaller house that started here. Somebody does in addition on the back. Another addition is looking two stories into a backyard. And, you know, it's one of the not fun things. We even have a couple of cases where people put solar panels on a one story home and the next door neighbor uses their use.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'My right to build up two stories and blocks part of their solar, how much energy they're creating during those winter months. And as part of that, you know, this is not an, you know, a suburban zone district. This is a is an urban edge, the urban zone district where there is all of that happening.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There's light rail stations and there's wood that don't have parking lots because they're walkable and there are embedded commercial districts, all of that causing conflict and turmoil. I think that what we are charged with here tonight is, is that those are issues that come with, you know, density in the kind of neighborhood that this is and has'",
        "'speaker_2': 'been for a hundred years. What we're charged with is, does this meet the legal criteria for rezoning? And beyond that, looking at, you know, taking into account what what do the people around think and feel? You know, I think that the three page letter to me was a non opposition letter.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It was that we can't support this. It didn't say we adamantly opposed this. And the reason that they didn't support it was spot rezoning, which was a very real thing that was not allowed in Denver until a couple of years ago, when the minimum lot size for a rezoning application changed and now it is legal to put'",
        "'speaker_2': 'forward an application for a single lot that is 4600 square feet. That was it three years ago. And so that that is some of the language that's still around. It's something that would have prevented this from ever happening a couple years ago.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But that is allowable in today. Of the five letters in opposition that were that were received by staff, two of them were about something that can never happen there. There's the medical office and the rest were about issues with a use in general.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This property is already zoned for an 80 it already could build in 82. Those problems are part of that urban fabric problem, that problem that we have as our city continues to see people move into it and change.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They're not necessarily problems with the change between the B and the C. We have over the time that I've been here, had big rezonings that take something that was single family zoned district and move it all the way to five, six, eight storeys.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then we have small rezonings, which most of the time look like I can't have a air to you, and now I can answer you by adding that one on the end. This one is even smaller than that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I can't remember a change that is smaller in in what it allows. The next 80 year old is allowed. It can be attached now. It has to be detached. We're not even adding the right for an 82 that's already there for everyone on this block and all the blocks around it, you know, in three of the four'",
        "'speaker_2': 'directions allow for this smaller lot size because that is the cadence. And if you look at the map, that's the cadence on this side of the block. When you get to the other side of the block, the cadence starts to be slightly smaller lots.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I think that this is tough because we all want to sit here with everybody happy and everybody saying, this is exactly what I want. I want to be clear that the the set, the unit rental, the renting of two units.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'At the same time, which again, was was one of Barbara's main concerns. That is not allowed. That cannot be allowed. But that is not a part of our rezoning criteria. Whereas in a different place, in the same way that, hey, I'm worried you won't bow your weeds or have too many dogs on site is something that is'",
        "'speaker_2': 'valid to be concerned about when you live next door to people. But it's not something that is a criteria for zoning. It is not something that is controlled by zoning. It lives elsewhere and we have to be vigilant as more and more to use come online in our community.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But it's not those use are not being abused in a way that they were not intended to be when we said, hey, you can't brant that out as if it was a duplex that is you have to live there if you want to rent the other thing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But the ownership can change three times in the next year. And that law, that's why that law doesn't live in the zoning because we're not zoning to one owner. We're zoning to everyone who will own that property after.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We'll all be beholden to that rule, and we have to make sure that we're enforcing it at the end of the day. It comes down to does this meet the legal criteria? And I think that there's clearly, as staff has demonstrated, thank you, Libby, for all your hard work on this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It does meet the legal criteria. I will just end by saying that the Councilman Hines point earlier. I don't believe that just because we haven't had an edu that's been turned back yet that we never will. Each of these applications is based on does this application meet the legal criteria?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'What we are what we are tasked with doing here, and we may get someone who comes and applies for an edu that does not meet the legal criteria and not one would get turned back. But I believe that this one has been clearly demonstrated that this small change from attached to you to detached to you from see'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to be is something that meets the legal criteria for rezoning. And for that reason I will be voting to support it tonight, and I would encourage my colleagues to do the same. Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman. Councilman Torres.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I really.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Appreciate all the back and.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Forth to clarify this, because it is more.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Complex than even the one.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That just came before it. And in my district and.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'A lot of things.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That get raised in.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Terms of what do we oppose and and and what's before.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Us right now, what I what I do want to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Say, because I do think the.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Criteria has been.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Met even elsewhere in this.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Neighborhood, is that this actually brings up one of.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The other needs that that Denver has, which is. Councilwoman Gilmore, you initiated, I think, a conversation around this last year.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And others, but.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'A rental registry and really being able to make sure that we know exactly where rentals are and who's allowing them, because I even in in in my district, what we wouldn't.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Want were for folks, whether it's in Barnham who have the entitlement to build a to use or elsewhere throughout the district who apply for.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It to then.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Rent out both.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Units and you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Really start to lose control of a.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Lot of the neighborhood character and.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Livability of.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Neighborhoods. When you don't have that primary occupant there who is the property owners.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So that's.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Definitely one thing that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I know we've got to get a handle on for Denver as we start to create more credibility throughout the city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think you all have. And. Q Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Madam President. I'm having a difficult time with the fact that an 80 and attached 88 was already allowed here, and the rezoning is being sought so that he can do something that doesn't really apply except for this particular guidance in a blueprint about is there an established pattern on the surrounding blocks?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And for that reason, under criteria too, that's one of those criteria that always boggles my mind. Uniformity of District Regulations. The proposed rezoning will result in uniform application of zone district building for museum design regulations. That's that's a tautology, right?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Of course, if we rezoning to this particular district, will will apply those rules. But the question is, you can add an aide. The issue for me is you can add an eight you already. It has to be attached because of the lot size.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And for that reason, I don't believe that it actually will conform with criteria to. So I don't know. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Sandoval.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Madam President. So two councilman talks points to the fact that the city is not auditing where owner occupied entities are going. I think is is it's a concern. And we've heard it tonight and I, I have these throughout northwest Denver.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They keep popping up. And what's really challenging for me is it's the zoning code is this was this was a 2010 legislative rezoning that we are just barely even ten years later figuring out some of the issues. So Councilman Quinn's point, I have some conflicts here.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So right now I continue to listen to other comments. But this one is really challenging. I think you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilwoman Sawyer.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thanks, Madam President. Yeah, I am. Along the same lines of my as my colleagues. You know, frankly, I 80 years are the compromise for the neighborhoods who feel very strongly about, you know, preserving their character for the neighborhoods who like, you know, the the grass and who like the the feel of old Denver 80 years are the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'compromise. Because we've got to add the gentle density. We have to be able to bring in the affordability somehow. All of the neighborhoods, you know, Blueprint says all of the neighborhoods have to share the burden of growth in our city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so to use or that compromise. But I am I'm incredibly concerned about the idea that we are not as a city doing more to ensure that as we are as we are bringing ADAS into our neighborhoods. We don't have eyes on whether people are following the laws that we have set forth around those ideas, because the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'buck stops with us and the responsibility lies with us to ensure and we are the ones who are going to hear about it when you know those laws are broken. And that is incredibly concerning. So. Well, I understand, you know, and then there's also this sort of health and safety issue and privacy issue around, like Councilman Clark'",
        "'speaker_5': 'was saying, around the fact that there are the setbacks in this neighborhood like there are in some of the other neighborhoods, which potentially I don't know, I would, I guess, have to go back and look at the legislative history.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But maybe that's why the these parcels were not zoned for detached dwellings in the first place. Maybe that's why they were only zoned for attached dwellings in the first place because of those privacy issues, because they're already they're already zoned for 80 use, but they're just zoned for attached to use, not detached areas.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I guess I am I have my concerns about this one in particular based on the specific facts of this case. But I think, you know, I'm torn because it is so incredibly important that we are bringing to use to to our neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But like you said, there are 80 is already in this neighborhood. It's not like they can't have one. This is not about yes or no 80 you this is about detached versus attached to you based on the specific facts of this case.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I'm uncomfortable with what we're looking at in terms of the information we've been given tonight. So I'm going to also keep listening. Thanks so much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilman Hines.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Madam President. We are a growing city. And where is the secrets out? And and people want to move to our beautiful slice of of the planet. And and as we can continue to grow is going to find a place to put people and I'm not trying to say that our five legal criteria are are about'",
        "'speaker_2': 'finding places to put people. But but I would say that I know that my district is very vibrant and we have a lot of people who to resist change, but we also have a lot of people who live in tents.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And and people are angry. They're angry that they that there are people living in tents at the end of their block and the right of way or across the street. Yet they also resist even the gentlest of additional density as in an area.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And this situation, this this isn't even about whether there is an idea or not. It's that, I guess to to the point, is detached or unattached and well an attached to you could also be above a garage that would be on the second floor and have the same privacy concerns or the same concerns about looking over a'",
        "'speaker_2': 'fence. And and, in fact, we're going to hear about that very soon. So that's you know, that is so I don't know if how attached or detached really solves the privacy concern. I, I also know that I'm not that that my world has to be everyone else's world.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But, you know, President excuse me, Councilmember Clark mentioned a bit about his house. I know that when I first purchased my unit in October 2011, I had a beautiful view of downtown, of course, feel the mountains, and now I have a view of a whole bunch of bedrooms.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that's not really exciting to me. I'd rather have the view of the mountains, but we also are in a growing city and and if we want to live close to the mountains, we want to live close to the national parks.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And if we want to live in a city that's vibrant, that has good economy, good jobs, we have to also recognize that that so we have to make some accommodations. And if we start turning down to and we're going to get more scrapes and and there are like Congress parks, the vast majority of the homes that are'",
        "'speaker_2': 'built in in Congress Park are built before 1940, as in the the the marker that, you know, the oldest identifier in the in the in the spectrum. And so if we start saying we're not going to have any use and this is just, you know, in general, there's a not specifically to the five credible, but just in'",
        "'speaker_2': 'general, we started saying no to eight years. We're saying yes to scrapes and we started saying no to a use. We're saying yes to destroying a historic character. And and so, you know, there's some value discussion that we that we should have outside of this particular conversation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But in this particular conversation, I don't see how this doesn't meet the criteria. And and I'm not saying that my colleagues are wrong. I'm saying that, in my opinion, this is meets the legal five legal criteria points that we have to we have to consider.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And and whether the person lives there or not is certainly irritating to me. Thanks for going after Steamboat and and kind of adding more wrenches into the into the mix. But but that's not part of the legal criteria.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I can be irritated and still say yes because because we are supposed to be arbiters or quasi judges right now, and I am not making decisions based on irritation. So thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Up next, we have Councilman Herndon.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The thing about a president I appreciate everyone's conversation is when you originally look at this. But sometimes when you have hearings, you think it's going to go one way and it goes in a different direction. I applaud everyone's comments and thoughtful considerations on this for me.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I don't want to reiterate the point of people will say so. I will I will tell Councilman Clarke, I really appreciate your comments. I think you're spot on. I do think the criteria has been met. And I would say I would say this to the name of Barbara.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Forgive me. I wrote the name down. Right. My apologies. You said you were concerned because you left. Well, the reality is, since he's not there, that the the timeline of this isn't even close, because as we have we have talked about a lot, this isn't giving him the opportunity to build the A-Team.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This is just as a property owner for the rezoning, and that is it. And so I don't believe that we should look at him, not be in mayor as a reason to deny that. I think the criteria is quite clear and I'm glad that we have to do that to we will be sticking to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I want to say for Councilman Sawyer, I thought you made a great point for making your questions earlier. The property owner now has to move back. Then they have to decide to do it. And then there's the financing financing issue.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then do they then they actually build. And so for my colleagues who are concerned about as a city, do we have the mechanism in place to better track this? Well, there's time if we're dealing with this particular issue that we're concerned about, this particular property, and this is probably happening elsewhere.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But let's let's have this conversation with the administration that this is our concern. Let's move forward with that. So I do believe that this is appropriate and has met the criteria. And I will be supportive and I would ask my colleagues to do the same.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I wanted to say this too. I really want to I was felt good seeing this is that neighbors disagree, but they weren't disagreeable. And so I hope that this can this can happen in other conversations, because usually when neighbors disagree, it's much more contentious than this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I wanted to applaud all the parties for being neighborly when it comes to this. Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman. And seen no one else in the queue to make comments, I'll share my own. This was a really robust, great conversation. I didn't know exactly what path we were going to go down and just appreciate everybody's contribution to it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And and I have to appreciate Nate, because it was really helpful to to hear you explain the entitlement process is through this rezoning and that really the owner occupied piece wasn't something that that we through our quasi judicial role right now in this rezoning we need to really look at those five criteria for the rezoning.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I do believe that those five criteria have been met for this rezoning. And so I will be voting in favor of it as well. And with that, Madam Secretary, roll call, please. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Flynn now.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Herndon. Hi. Hi.'",
