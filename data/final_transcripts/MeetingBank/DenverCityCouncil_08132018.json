        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah. Thank you, Mr. President. I'm always honored to, uh, to bring this proclamation forward. I think Brothers redevelopment does an excellent job there. You know, Jeff, I was looking for you. Jeff Martinez, CEO, does an excellent job of taking care of elders in our community and and doing the hard work to ensure that financing is in place'",
        "'speaker_6': 'for affordable housing for those residents as well. And, you know, Jeff and I met each other when I first got elected. And there are several affordable housing, senior affordable housing units that needed to be attended to. And, you know, you work with a lot of nonprofits and organizations who let's just say Jeff gets it and he cares'",
        "'speaker_6': 'about the community. And it was it's been such a blessing to have someone who understands the community and cares about it. And I last year next door to me, one of my neighbors who's been living in the whole neighborhood for 46 years, got her house painted.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so I got to see firsthand what that did. And what you don't know, Jeff, is that, you know, our neighbor lost her husband didn't lose. You know, he didn't he didn't die. But he was he's in prison and is not able to help out around the house.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so her house is falling into shambles. And when you all came and there's a whole team of folks from the business community and from the community painting and helping out. I mean, she had tears in her eyes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And you can never measure the impact that you're having on some of these elderly folks in our community. And so this is just incredible. And also, I want to point out that brothers redevelopment is part of. The Land Trust that received $2 million from Seedat to invest in affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I can tell you right now, it's great that the GSA coalition came together and got $2 million, the most money towards affordable housing from any community group in divorce history. But it wouldn't be possible if it wasn't because the brothers redevelopments all have anything but good things to say about this.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I'm excited about the number of seniors in our community who are going to be touched by this. So thank you for what you guys do. Thank you, Mr. President.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I just wanted to make sure that my name was added to this proclamation and just. State. What an incredible organization Brothers has been. They're one of the long standing nonprofit development organizations that's been in our city for almost 40 years, maybe even in excess of 40 years.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Started by Manny Martinez, who lived in West Denver, and Joe Huron, who was originally from my dad's hometown of Trinidad, Colorado. And, you know, it's great to see that it's an organization that is still around doing incredible things because we have seen some of our nonprofit housing groups that have.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That that no longer exist. And so to know that they not only continue to develop housing, but have continued this annual pain to fund program, it's been amazing. I've had the opportunity to participate and it's a lot of hard work.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But you know, the families who benefit are so grateful for volunteers coming out and assisting them with the improvements that they probably otherwise would never be able to afford to do on their own. So I just want to thank them for their ongoing work in our city.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'So right on. And that's the way, you know, so many volunteers feel after having painted a home for a deserving senior homeowner in our community, and of which there have been so many over the past decade, 12, 14 years.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This is Chad LeBlanc, our volunteer manager, who gets up there and coordinates our volunteers every year. And this is that the Saturdays would be such a tremendous opportunity again to work alongside City of Denver. Employees got about 400 City of Denver employees that are going to be out on those ladders throughout the city on Saturday.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And you're going to see them impacting every one of your districts, every one of your neighborhoods, from Ruby Hill to my neighborhood. Park Hill, Chaffey Park, Berkeley to Cold Whittier, Montebello, Overland. So we're going to be all over the city volunteering and you're going to have some great events.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we'll try to push our volunteers, their events when they're done on those ladders, helping our seniors. But it is a tremendous effort. We're so grateful, thankful that this is James who's come on up, James. He's working to bring up the Bring Together the City of Denver volunteers with Deveau this year.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And again, just such a tremendous opportunity to work alongside the city employees in this effort.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah. Hi. Like he mentioned, I'm. My name is James Warren. I work as a judicial assistant over in the county court. I'm also on the board.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'For Devo Denver Employee Volunteer.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Opportunities. As the name might imply. Our goal is to bring Denver employees into volunteer opportunities. We are. Our board is made up from people around the city, not just the county court, the public library, Denver Human Services, and the people who come to our events, our volunteers, our city employees, as well as their family and friends.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'For us on the board of Devo and I know for the other employees of the city and county of Denver, Civic Service doesn't just stop when we set our office. We have a sense of civic duty that goes beyond 9 to 5.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Devo serves to promote the opportunities.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That those people hope for.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That those people look for to serve their city on a deeper level. And paying a fine is no exception. If anything, it is actually our biggest event of the year. No surprise with that. For the past 40 years, Brothers redevelopment has been and a central asset in the lives of the people.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Of Denver, particularly.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Some of the more vulnerable citizens of fixed income seniors in our community. But in our partnership with them, which has been going on since 2004, we've been able to dedicate thousands of volunteer hours. Last year we painted our 100th home and we've been able to save.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'People of this city.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Fixed income seniors of the city, hundreds of thousands of dollars in costs. I think when people see volunteers from the city and county of Denver who work for the city in kind of Denver out painting homes or doing any of the other volunteer projects that we have throughout the year, they're able to see something that makes this'",
        "'speaker_2': 'such an amazing place that something that makes Denver an amazing place to call home. I think when you see civic spirit, civic service go far beyond the workplace and extend into the community and to service in that way, you get a sense of what sets us apart as a city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so we're excited to continue our partnership with the city of Denver, with TiVo and with with Brothers redevelopment this Saturday and in many years to come.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I hope to see all the letters with us this Saturday. You want to know where any of those sites are? Just feel free to give us a call and then we'll set you up to go out and visit those hardworking volunteers that are going to be on ladders, paint those homes this weekend.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So thank you so much. We appreciate you and can do without you.'"

        "'speaker_7': 'I would be happy to. Proclamation number eight, nine, eight. Recognizing the importance of securing an accurate and complete population count in the 2020 U.S. Census. Whereas the United States Census is a constitutionally mandated, complete assessment excuse me of the population and has performed.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Decennial since 1790. Most recently in 2010. And. WHEREAS, the Census determines the allocation of seats for the U.S. House of Representatives, redistricting of state and local government, legislative districts, and distribution of more than $675 billion in federal funds to state, local and tribal governments.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Whereas, Mayor Hancock has named three co-chairs Pastor Del Phillips, Dr. Jeanine Davidson and myself to lead the Denver Complete Count Committee that is in process of training key city employees and community partners to assist with this critically important citizen outreach effort.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And. Whereas, in 2010, Denver's efforts were a model that cities across the country worked to replicate because of our financial commitment to marketing, outreach and staffing that resulted in a high response rate. And we will be geared up to do the same for the 2020 census.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And. Whereas, Denver is a growing city and an accurate census count is vital to meet the evolving needs of Denver residents, Census 2020 will direct the amount of federal money distributed to Denver for housing assistance and rehabilitation, education and early childhood to higher education, transportation, infrastructure, senior centers, libraries, hospitals, facilities for people with disabilities and emergency planning'",
        "'speaker_7': '. In response. And. Whereas. Punitive actions taken by President Trump against immigrants and refugees from various countries will require our best efforts at the local level to be far reaching. And. WHEREAS, it will be challenging to alleviate the fear of hard to count communities and to educate and encourage full participation by everyone in the upcoming 2020 census.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And. Whereas, ensuring a complete census count is imperative because the data will profoundly impact Denver residents far into the future. And. WHEREAS, everyone, whether a United States citizen, a refugee immigrant or an undocumented worker, we all rely on the programs and services provided by local and state government, paid for in part by federal grants.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And we're as the Complete Count Committee should address various racial, ethnic, cultural and geographic considerations of the community to ensure residents understand the census process, trust in its confidentiality, understand its importance, and fulfill their obligation to participate as is required by law.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And. Whereas, Census data is highly protected and confidential, the Census Bureau is not permitted to release responses to the Census, furnished by any individual or on behalf of an individual or release information to other government agencies, including the IRS, Immigration and Naturalization Services, law enforcement agencies or welfare agencies.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Now, therefore, be proclaimed by the Council of the City and County of Denver, Section one that the Council of the City and County of Denver shall support and assist in the Complete Count Committee in fulfilling the goal of achieving a complete count of Denver residents.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This will be accomplished by formulating effective strategies to ensure Denver's response rate in Census 2020 through outreach, information, campaigns and community engagement. Section to the complete. The Committee will harness the local knowledge, expertize and influence of each committee member to design and implement a census awareness campaign targeted to communities throughout Denver with focused, structured neighbor to neighbor'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Ortega. Your motion to adopt.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I move for the adoption of proclamation number 898.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Has been moved and seconded comments by members of Council Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Most cities across the country have already undertaken their training for their complete count committees that are already seated. These are committees that are representative of broad sectors of our community. It will be important to ensure that we're recounting elderly folks, people who are homeless.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We have something like eight or nine refugee communities in Denver that did not exist when we did the 2010 census count. So folks who are considered hard to count are going to be where part of our efforts are focused in ensuring that we do the absolute best effort to count everybody.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Because if we do not, these are this is data that we're going to have to live with for the next ten years. And if we don't have a complete count, it may mean that we potentially do not get an additional congressional seat.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We potentially do not get the resources that are earmarked to your cities based on the census count that you have for your jurisdiction. So it's going to be critical that we all play a role, including our city agencies that have any touch points with community to be getting the word out.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And my hope is that we can look at trying to get a staff person on board as soon as possible and not wait until the 2019 budget, because so much of the foundational work needs to be happening right now.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And, you know, Denver is geared up to put about the same amount of money in the 2020 census outreach that we had in 2010. And I think with some of the fear mongering that we have seen happening in this country, it's just going to make this job that much more challenging.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so I thought it was important to bring this forward, to put this issue on our radar screen and be looking out for us, beginning to push out more information as as this work evolves. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Ortega. Councilman Cannick.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. President. First, I'd like to ask if my name can be added as a co-sponsor. I missed the email and I want to thank Councilwoman Ortega for her leadership on this. In the past, Councilman Lopez has also been a leader on Denver's count.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'He's he's been around long enough for two censuses. That's a huge accomplishment. I just wanted to underline Councilman Ortega's concern about our underrepresented populations in the sense that they are important and large pieces of our community. But some, because of the the events of the day and the inhumane policies of this federal administration have been, I think'",
        "'speaker_1': ', driven somewhat into more of the shadows. And that includes undocumented immigrants, folks who are here with visas or other backgrounds, because even some of those communities have been targets for this administration, even when they are documented. I did just want to add the fact that our city has issued a comment in response to the federal notice that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'they were going to add a new question to the census on citizenship. No such question has been asked and the short form since 1950, because it's not a best practice that we get the most information from people when they don't feel like they are being vulnerable to a federal administration that is not supposed to use this information'",
        "'speaker_1': '. But to convince folks of that is difficult, especially if the person at your door is asking a question about your citizenship. So to the council members, you know, this information came to us today as a copy of it from Gaby Corica, the legislative liaison for the mayor.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But for our community, I want you to know that we have protested this proposed rule that was was receiving public comment in the Federal Register, along with many of the organizations in our community. And we protested both because of our desire to reduce the fear in our community as well as to ensure an accurate count that there'",
        "'speaker_1': 'are, you know, in the letter well, documents, the almost 15% of our city is foreign born. And again, many of those individuals are documented. They have legitimate papers and all of the things that give them the right to be here.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But even they sometimes feel nervous. So it's our job to do both to fight efforts at the federal government that might create more fear and confusion, and then to assure people of the legal rights they have and to fight to protect them, to make sure that the rules are followed.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I want to make sure that our community knows that we're working on both those fronts. So with that, I will proudly support this proclamation. And then also I just want to add, I believe, Councilman Flynn, we're coming to government and finance for this topic.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I don't know if you know the date yet, but we're working on scheduling an update for council as well. So to make sure we stay up to date. Thank you, Mr. President.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'don't keep getting these big financial requests asking us to approve our needs piecemeal. I think it's helpful for us to know that big picture. I did receive some documents that I had requested from the administration and that that was somewhat helpful.'",

I just want to point out that, Councilwoman Ortega, you mentioned that this was the measure that appropriated the funding for the purchase that we've just postponed.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'Yes, that's a that's a great question. I'm 50 mills is our standard that we go to for our debt and operation in mill mill levies. That's what we start with. If we had a development that is showing that it has quite unique and community involvement with its public infrastructure and this this project doesn't elicit those kinds of'",
        "'speaker_8': 'pronounced infrastructure needs, such as revitalization of the river, including dredging of the river and an activities activation of the riverfront for an entire mile. And some of these additional community costs is what we considered when we were going through the extra 60 mills.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. So I'm assuming that that work will involve direct interface with urban drainage and flood control district to ensure that it's not creating any further impact downstream for communities that are already experiencing some flooding challenges like the Globeville neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Absolutely. I mean, this is the metropolitan districts don't are not addressing that tonight. There is definitely a tremendous amount of conversations that with many partners to try and solve those all of the city's problems and regarding flooding.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So Andrew, what is the percentage of open space that Denver is requiring with this particular proposed development?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I don't know the specific answer for that. I will bring up Stephen Ali from our Community Planning and development, who probably has that right off the top of his head.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Good evening. Members of Council Steve Nally with community planning and Development. As you know, in the Denver zoning code there is a requirement for a general development plan which requires 10% open space. We've had quite a bit of discussion with the community through the Downtown Area Plan Amendment.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There are a number of recommendations in that plan that talk about open space and engaging the river, the types of open space, not just one part but different typologies, a big central plaza, neighborhood parks, park pocket parks, dog parks.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so this is one step in the implementation process. There will be many more steps. We are working on a infrastructure master plan and development agreements and a rezoning that will be coming soon. And we will we love to talk about that at that time.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. So the 10%, does that include frontage along the river and does any of the river contribute towards that? Or they would have to create the the land that then interfaces with the river.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So the 10% requirement is for open space on their property. Got it. Okay. Now their property abuts the river, right? But it's got to be on. That's where things get fun. Yeah. And the activation of the river. And so, you know, it could.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It could in the future, the lines could be a little blurred. You may not know if you're on, you know, the former religious property and it may be a public park. It may be privately owned at that at that point.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There's a lot that we are working through, but it's 10% on the private property.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. The last question is just about the. Cumulative impact. And this is for you, Steve, because you're at the planning department. And this should be this should be what you guys are looking at in terms of the vast amount of acres that are on the west side of the river, that are all proposed to have pretty high'",
        "'speaker_7': 'density development, that will then have further impact on the adjacent infrastructure and the adjacent neighborhoods. So how how are you all at the planning department looking at that cumulative impact and ensuring that we're we're taking that view? I mean, I use the example of the 41st and Fox, you know, area where we were seeing all these rezonings'",
        "'speaker_7': 'come in. But nobody was looking at the fact that we've got one road into that site and we really had the need to look at doing more, requiring all the developers in that area to do more and contribute towards not just the roadway infrastructure, but even some of the drainage issues because, you know, 38th Avenue floods in'",
        "'speaker_7': 'that area. So as you look at adding this many more people in traffic and higher density to the area, how are we moving to address that?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That is exactly what we're working on right now. So we're working through an infrastructure master plan. We have basically every department in the city at the table from Denver, Department of Environmental Health to Public Works parks. We have urban drainage at the table.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We even have Army Corps at the table, Metro Wastewater. The list goes on and on. Multiple agencies.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'RTD is our is our Office of Emergency Management at the table as well.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So that is that is going to be part of the discussion. Not not yet. But that is definitely part of the discussion. You bet.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So the the how close we build to the railroad tracks, how we buffer and protect the buildings and the people that will be in them will be all part of that conversation. That's right. Great. Okay. Thank you. I have no further questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilman Ortega. Councilman Espinosa.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Steve.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Only because that line of questioning sort of made me sort of think about this. Right. There's current entitlement with the land right now. Are there any mechanisms? I don't see anything in the service plan that doesn't seem to be any sort of there's acknowledgment that we just did a master in a, uh, area plan update, but there'",
        "'speaker_6': 'is no sort of compulsory or some sort of requirement that, uh, future that this area be rezoning in a manner sort of more consistent with those plan objectives. So is there any way to sort of convey to us that, um, that the current entitlement will be used with this metro district and that this is essentially a preliminary'",
        "'speaker_6': 'step for what is being proposed in a sort of more master plan sense. Okay. So just to understand your question, you are asking, should the service plans say that the current zoning will not be used to implement this plan?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That would be great. I wouldn't go that far, but I sort of did so. So as you know, the downtown area plan envisions this future state. Right, this future neighborhood, and recommends that the site be zoned in order to implement or accomplish that vision.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The service plan is in the Met Districts. It's it's one of many implementation steps. It's more closely related to the infrastructure necessary for that buildout. Now, I'm doing interesting thinking, but maybe you know. But the answer I don't think I don't think it includes the rezoning that the the neighborhood or the downtown area planning amendment recommends rezoning'",
        "'speaker_6': '. And and we are, as you know, going through that process. So in. So where would we. This is getting complicated because. Right. They need that GDP in order to to start utilizing start doing infrastructure, sort of not do it willy nilly, but guided by the GDP.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So is that GDP going to sort of hold off for rezoning or are they going to be concurrent or, you know, since that's public works how I mean, that's so you guys so how are we marrying those sorts of components, the other things that will sort of release the ability to sort of make use of this metro'",
        "'speaker_6': 'district. So the current plan is that the rezoning will include or there will be a development agreement that will accompany the rezoning. And that development agreement will go through a number of topics, including the requirements of an infrastructure master plan and a number of the kind of big moves that would be necessary on the site.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's the current thinking right now. But, you know, we're I was in meetings. Today, we're we're working very hard on this infrastructure master plan to ensure that all of the major infrastructure moves are in place as this develops over time.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So. Those are those are great things because those things those all those documents sort of speak to how you might go about addressing the concerns that were already voiced in your prior questions. Maybe this is more of a question for you or Andrew.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But again, those tools developer agreement would be with the administration infrastructure master plan. That, again, is sort of a purely voluntary effort. GDP would be a document, but that would simply be adopted by the planning board. So the only sort of next step that this council will sort of engage on would be the the text amendments in'",
        "'speaker_6': 'the map amendments. Where do those where do you foresee those falling with regard to those other three documents? So we we actually envision the development agreement coming to council. There may be some vesting rights that the developer is pursuing.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I don't want to get into too much detail because this we're still working on this and you guys will be seeing this soon. But that that is the thinking that when we actually come forward with the text amendment and potential map amendment, that there will also be a development agreement.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah. So just because, you know, I'm not totally naive to this been part of many conversations that have gone down the central by that I've not been part of several as well. I understand that. But is it safe to say for the general public that many of these concerns will be some somehow articulated and in some degree'",
        "'speaker_6': 'codified where appropriate in ways that we have previously maybe not done at this scale or at least in this area. I mean, I think we have precedent examples. I'm pretty sure the Broadway station rezoning package and development agreement came before council because there were vesting rights as part of that development agreement, I think.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think we have examples of this taking place in the city, but that that's our current approach, as I described earlier. Right. And so I think I just wanted those, you know, have carried that conversation a little bit further.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilman Espinosa, Councilwoman Ortega. Rebecca.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes, Steve, just real quick. When do you anticipate that infrastructure master plan to be completed? Because that's looking at the whole area and not just this one site. Right.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So the infrastructure master plan that we are discussing right now is for this site.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Specifically not looking at the effect of all of the development.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We're certainly considering the effect off site. Okay. Of of this site. And keeping in mind the development of other sites, there is a lot of engineering, there's a lot of work that goes into an infrastructure. Master plan is very expensive.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so we anticipate that that coming after the rezoning and I don't want to put a date on it. So after rezoning.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Issues like roadway connectivity, I mean, you know, we've got the Burnham yards that are not far away from here that will soon be finished with the cleanup that the railroads are doing. And that's about 70 acres or so.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So when you start looking at all of the development opportunities and how people get in and out of these sites, they're going to be utilizing existing roadways like 13th Avenue, Colfax that runs, you know, alongside this location. And for me, it's looking at how how is that folded into the big picture conversation?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Because just like the North Denver Cornerstone Collaborative was created to look at the cumulative impact of all the projects that are going on in Globeville area at once here and along the Brighton Boulevard corridor, and making sure that, you know, there's some interface between how they all connect to one another as opposed to just dealing with each'",
        "'speaker_7': 'of them piecemeal. So help me understand how much that. Infrastructure master plan and that big picture look that the planning department is doing factors in all of those things.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Sure. That's our job. That's exactly what we're working on. You may not see in the infrastructure master plan recommendations for the next neighborhood. However, we're thinking about the impacts on the next neighborhood when working on the infrastructure master plan.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's not just the existing streets. There are also new streets and new connections that will be necessary. I would suggest to answer that question, looking at the downtown area Point Amendment and all of the connections that are recommended and the improvements to existing network that's recommended as well.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yeah, and that's important because that affects the connectivity to downtown. Excuse me. But then when you look at the effect to the Jefferson Park neighborhood, just to the West Side, you know, and I do know that you all work to ensure that 23rd Street was a major connecting route to the site, which I know is really critical'",
        "'speaker_7': 'for those neighborhoods, because that is an access road that not only Jefferson Park but Sloan's Lake and in those neighborhoods to the west utilize that road. So that was really important. That's right. Let me just get to my next question really quick.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And this is about freeze. Would you mind coming forward? Do you have any anticipation and I know we're not there yet, but do you anticipate using tax increment financing as one of the tools to do any of the development on the site?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We do not.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You do not. Okay. Has the community been talking to you about any kind of community benefit agreement that would look at ensuring that there is affordable housing, that there is a commitment to jobs, you know, those kinds of things.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Can you just talk about where you're at with those conversations?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yeah, we haven't had detailed conversations about those specific topics yet with the neighborhood. As Steve Downey.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Mentioned, the downtown area plan speaks to a lot of those things. I think specifically as it comes.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'To affordable housing. If I recall correctly, the downtown area plans for a higher level of affordability of affordability here or so, more units of affordable housing here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Should I say more correctly.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Than in other parts of the city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Given its strategic.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Location and its proximity to rail transit.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So let me make sure I understood that correctly. Was that a higher amount of affordable units or a higher level of higher, higher incomes that would be served?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I believe the area plan speaks to a higher number of affordable units. Okay. And just to finish that thought, we've been. Yeah, I know. I had to clarify it for myself. I realize I misspoke.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And we've been in some.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Fairly deep discussions with city staff on what that means and what that looks like.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Ortega. Seeing no other questions. The public hearing for Council Bill 797 is closed. Comments by members of Council. Councilman Brooks.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah. Thank you, Mr. President. I am excited to support this metropolitan district, primarily because of the systematic approach that we're in right now. We just approved a an area plan and went through a very in-depth time with our community and District one, District nine, talking about what we want to see in this at the 50,000 foot level'",
        "'speaker_6': '. What we want to accomplish, the drainage issues, affordable housing, day care, jobs. All of these things we want to see encompassed in this area. And from there, you've got to fund it. And so this is a funding mechanism so that we can start looking at how to take care of all the infrastructure needs.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I appreciate the city, CPD, the developer, all inviting me to the table and other council folks as well. And so I'm I am confident that this is going to be an area in which we all are proud of and an area which invest a lot into the social fabric of our community.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And in a development that we can be proud of. So I'll be supporting this and look forward to the coming months of negotiation of what comes out from this area. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilman Brooks. Councilman Espinosa.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If past is prolog we're we're this is just another step in a sort of incremental process to sort of realizing a very different future of those parking lots and and and sort of former railyard of Denver. So I'm just I'm encouraged thank you to Andrew and Steve and to Reece particularly, because, you know, it's not every day'",
        "'speaker_6': 'that a property owner, you know, invites a whole bunch of other stakeholders to sort of help them figure out what what to do with their land and sort of welcomes those comments and tries in earnest to to capture as much as possible.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so, you know, this is a tool that is if you heard me talk about it before, I'm not always the biggest fan of them, but this is the sort of exact situation whereby to me it's completely consistent but is bolstered by those other those other agreements and steps that still need to be done.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And and I look forward to sort of seeing some of those as much, if not all of those ideas and things that have been articulated to date are being captured in in master planning and and developer agreements and and the infrastructure that goes in with this with this metro district.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So with that, I'll be happy to support it and look forward to those future conversations to sort of continue to mold what Denver will look like 100 years from now. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilman Espinosa, seeing no other comments, Madam Secretary.'",

The Committee approved filing this item at its meeting on 6-19-18.": [
        "'speaker_0': 'I. Madam Secretary, please close voting and announce results.'",
        "'speaker_4': '12 Eyes.'",
        "'speaker_0': '12 Eyes Council Bill 797 has passed. Councilwoman Sussman, will you please vote? Council Bill 617 on the floor.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes, I move that council bills 617 be placed upon final consideration and do.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Pass has been moved and seconded. The public hearing for council will 617 is open. May we have the staff report? Technology kept catching up.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'My computer does that to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'To push through it. So Jeff Hurt, with your planning a development here to present a rezoning for a property in the area Swansea. And this is a Denver housing authority owned property working with Habitat for Humanity to to build 16 duplex units.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we'll be talking a little bit about the project. Actually, the applicant is here to, uh, to fill in some of the details. So this is a rezoning request in Council District nine, as I said, in the Elyria, Swansea neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so the request area is one city block. It's about 1.3 acres, and the rezoning requests is to go from E2 B So that's urban edge to unit, and the B stands for the minimum lot size, which is 4500 square feet, and they requesting to go to a PD.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so the PD it's Pdg 18. The G just means that the general PD and the 18 means it's our 18th beauty. So there's not much to the acronym there actually. And the purpose of the rezoning is to accommodate a redevelopment for residential units in the Elyria, Swansea neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And this is the site plan that the applicant handed out at Ludy. And it's a it's a an evolving site plan, but it does their plan is to build 16 duplex units for a total of 32 units in this neighborhood and for them to be alley loaded.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So the existing zoning, as I said, is to be the surrounding properties north of 43rd are also YouTube. And then you look south and west closer to the tracks, and it gets more into the industrial zoning that reflects the character of that area.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In terms of existing land uses, there's a mix again. So looking north of 43rd, there's a mix of different types of residential units, single unit two, unit multifamily and then south of 43rd to get more into the industrial land uses.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so on to some images of the subject site. As I said, it's one city block and this block has been vacant for really its entire history. There are two small structures there that were historically there. This area was platted in the 1890s.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Those structures were demolished in the early 1990. So it sat like this for quite some time. And so looking at the images of the subject property. And then looking at the surrounding property, you see the single family. Some of the original single family structures, again, 1890s era.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There's been a fair amount of some redevelopment of these houses, but it's generally maintained this character. And then this is an image looking south. So across 43rd, looking toward the both the freight rail and the commuter rail tracks and you get more into the industrial one story, uh, character of that area.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I'm going to talk a little bit about what you, what parties are, the purpose of them, why they're used. And then I'm going to get into the specific request of what their the applicant is actually asking for in speed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Speed is the city used to use them a lot more, but we've been a little bit more uh, we've used them lesson in recent years. The purpose of the party in the, in the zoning code at least, is to provide an alternative set of regulations on really challenging sites that have the term uses in unique and extraordinary'",
        "'speaker_2': 'circumstances. So in order to accommodate the proposed development, you would need a lot of waivers, conditions, variances, things like that. So the proposal and the reason for the PD request. So in these cases, staff works with the applicant to work through kind of all the zoning options to figure out if there's a base standard zone district that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'would work for their needs. In this case, it really came down to the width, the subject block, which is about half the width of the surrounding blocks. And it is, in staff's opinion, a unique and extraordinary circumstance to have a block that's this narrow and also to accommodate any type of development that's sort of consistent with the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'surrounding built environment in terms of two rows of of alley loaded of development. And so when you look at the current zoning ETB, there's a number of constraints. So the minimum lot size and in particular the setbacks, the front and rear setbacks, when you factor all these metrics together, it creates a really, really small buildable footprint.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If you did one do alley access development and so that that steered us toward the parade route. So I'm going to talk a little bit about what is actually in the PD. So the way that we do Pwds is essentially we start with the base zone district that makes the most sense.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And the PD itself sort of lists all the variations from that based on district. And so if you wanted to actually look at the PD itself, which would become the sort of the controlling zone district for the site that is in your packet in the actual application.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I'm just going to go through at a high level what those variations are, and they're all related to the building form and placement. There's no changes proposed to land uses or parking or anything like that. I think that's important to note.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So would maintain the the two unit and single unit allowed uses. So the variations at a high level, again, we could get happy to go in more detail on this, but at a high level, the variations are to address the narrow block and to accommodate two rows of alley loaded development.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So the first big variation is to.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Remove.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'A there's so there's a split in the zone district in the in the YouTube zone district where the front 65% of the lot has a two and a half storey allowable height in the rear. 35% has a one story allowable height.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So and then the bulk plan is calibrated by that front and we are split. Two staff does not believe that that split makes sense on this block because it's so narrow and these lots would be roughly about 60 feet deep.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So and it's also sort of creating its own context within one block. So there's some variations related to the building height and the number of stories and the book plane as it relates to that front rear split. And again, I'm happy to get into those details.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Another variation is the reduced minimum size. So that was a big issue with the current zoning, with a 4500 square foot minimum lot area that's actually out of character with the surrounding properties and how was originally plotted. The original slide had lots very anywhere from like 1600 square feet to something like 3800 square feet.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So 2100 falls within the range that works for the applicant and and it's consistent with the surrounding context. So that is in there as well. And then the remaining changes relate to the setbacks. So reduced front, rear and side setbacks.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And those are those are largely consistent with the surrounding development pattern, which has a lot of nonconforming non-compliant structures that were built well before zoning was in place. And then lastly and a really important one, the UTB Zone district does not actually mandate alleys and alley access.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You could technically do or theoretically do vehicular access off the street, which is inconsistent with the surrounding development pattern. So one of the changes in the PD is to mandate vehicle access by alley only, and pedestrian access certainly could come from the street, but we're talking about vehicular access.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So process wise followed our normal process. Planning and ordered planning board did unanimously recommend approval with a condition that was more of a correction or clarification. I'm happy to talk about that condition. And then that brought us to tonight.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So there are a number of Arnault's restaurant and neighborhood organizations for this area. All were notified and we did receive one public comment in support of the request and in support of specifically residential development and going to a PD from the Elyria, Swansea, Globeville Business Association.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's in your packet as well. And so I have a number of different criteria to go through and I'll I'll try to get through them concisely. But we've got our standard review criteria that apply to all rezonings, and we've got an additional layer of criteria for Pwds.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I'm going to go through each of those and highlight a couple that require a little more explanation. So just listing out what they are. So starting with the standard rezoning criteria, so staff looks at consistency with adopted plan.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we certainly have the two citywide plans to look at. And we also have a very recent neighborhood plan in the Elyria Swansea plan that we looked at that addresses the site. So in terms of comp plan policies, so the policies that staff called out and are elaborated on in your staff report are listed here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm not going to go through each one of them, but generally relate to the policy in the concept of encouraging infill development and places where services and infrastructure already exist, which is definitely the case here. It's it's embedded in the grid of this neighborhood, and there's certainly services and infrastructure around it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then there's policies related to encouraging residential infill development at appropriate locations. So staff does find the request in the request to go to a pretty consistent with plan policies. So related to Blueprint in Denver, the other citywide adopted plan.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The subject property is in an area of change and has a land use designation of single family duplex. And so the area of change really points to encouraging infill development in areas where services, infrastructure already exists and also areas that have not realize their full development potential.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so staff finds the request consistent with these policies because as a vacant block in a in an established area, it certainly has not realize its full development potential. And, and as a duplex single family duplex zone district, it is consistent with that single family duplex classification.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So on to the Elyria Swansea neighborhood plan. So this is the area specific neighborhood plan adopted in 2015. There are a number of policies related to encouraging or addressing the decline actually in residential population and residential dwelling units in this specific area.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And there's actually a number of policies that point specifically to encouraging residential infill. And even looking at this specific site, it was actually called out in the plan as an opportunity site for residential infill. And so staff does find the requests consistent with the obvious ones in neighborhoods plan for those reasons.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I'm going to go through each one of these. I did want to highlight so these are the rest of the criteria that stuff looks out and making a recommendation. I did want to highlight criteria number four, which is related to the justifying circumstances.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So Steph doesn't need to find or the city needs to find a justifying circumstance in support of the rezoning. There's a number of changes going on in this area that that support a rezoning and staff's opinion. One of the Illyria Swansea neighborhoods plan in itself is a change that sort of, you know, set a path for this'",
        "'speaker_2': 'neighborhood in this community in the future. And secondarily, also a big one. So with the central I-70 project and the expansion that's happened, there's been a number of residential units that have been taking out of the of the housing stock for this neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so that's a big change that this rezoning in this Pudi, I think, looks to address in terms of attempting to replenish some of those lost housing units. And then related to the last criteria, again, standard rezoning criteria, the staff does find the property is consistent with the neighborhood context generally because the poverty itself is customized to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'reflect the surrounding context in terms of setbacks, building coverage, accessing off of alleys, things like that. So Steph does find it consistent with what that criteria applied to a library at any of these. Okay. Last set of criteria is the PD rezoning criteria.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So these are the criteria specific to PD requests. And so I'll go through these as briefly as possible. So the first criteria is if the PD is consistent with the purpose and intent of parties themselves. So looking at the zoning code language for when and why and how the city should use parties, it generally addresses, as I'",
        "'speaker_2': 'said, where there is a unique and extraordinary circumstance and a physical constraint in this case. And this one I think is pretty straightforward. The physical constraint is the narrow width of the block, at least relative to the development proposed in a development that could go in and be consistent with the surrounding contacts with the alley loaded in'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the two rows of development. So stuff does find it consistent with that criteria. And so the last three criteria here. So I won't go through each of these, but um, I guess to highlight CPD criteria, see, so again, the development and looking back at that site plan and the applicant is here to, to elaborate on it, but'",
        "'speaker_2': 'looking at that site plan, there really is no standard zone district available, as I said, that that accommodates the type of development that kind of fits in with the with the surrounding context, without multiple variances, waivers, conditions, things like that, where you really get into this funky, customized situation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So PD is really designed to be since staff's opinion for situations like this and then last that the PD addresses uses that are compatible with adjacent properties, there's no change. As I said in the beginning, there's no change to the uses set forth in the zone district in the YouTube.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So all of the single family unit and kind of ancillary use, as you would typically see, would remain the same as with the parking requirement. So it's really only about the building form and siting. Oh, there is another one.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sorry. So this is something like a bit of a broken record, but. So. So the last criteria is about users. This is more about building forms. And so stuff does find the party request consistent with this criteria. Because it does it it is calibrated.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The party is customized and calibrated to respond to sort of the built environment around this block, which is highlighted in this aerial a bit. You can see with the parcel boundaries are in pink. If you can see you can see the original buildings and some of the newer buildings are not built to, you know, a 20 foot'",
        "'speaker_2': 'setback and a five foot side setback. They're really building out these these these parcels and they're alley loaded. You can see that the YouTube is on this. Without this pudi customized approach would be a real challenge to develop anything consistent with the patterns of this area.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So with that, staff does recommend approval of their rezoning requests, and I'm happy to answer any questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. We have four individuals signed up to speak this evening, so I'll ask all four of you to come up to this front bench so we can get through things quickly. As soon as I call your name.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There will be a slight delay for your time to start as you step up to the podium and then your time will start elapsing. So first up, we have Bruce O'Donnell.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. President, members of council. My name is Bruce O'Donnell.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I am at 386.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Emerson Street in Denver.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm here this evening representing Habitat for Humanity, the applicant. And I'm joined by members of the.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Habitat team.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Who are here to provide some additional context and answer any questions.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Should you have any? We're eagerly engaged in this process and feel that in this instance it is the perfect tool to address.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All of the unique site.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Conditions that were discussed in the staff report.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And staff did a great job and was excellent.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'To work with to kind of solve the riddle.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'To maximize.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The opportunity on this crazy.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Narrow block.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'To get as dance as we could.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'To provide a permanent deed.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Restricted for sale, affordable housing. We're here this evening to request your approval and vote of approval for Pdg.'",
        "'speaker_2': '18 and are available to answer any questions you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Have. Any. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next up, Katie McKenna.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Council President Clark, and thank you, council members for having us here today. I'm Katie McKenna. I'm from Denver, and I'm the director of community development at Habitat for Humanity of Metro Denver. We're here today to request your support for the rezoning of this block in Swansea, a neighborhood at Habitat.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We believe that housing is the foundation from which everything else is possible and affordable. Housing is such a key piece of infrastructure and critical component in our communities. The global area and Swansea neighborhoods have been an area of a special focus for Habitat for Humanity over the last six years.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'With that, we we help home as Habitat for Humanity. We help homeowners achieve strength, stability and independence that they need to build a better life for themselves and for their families and for their communities. In our recent homeowners survey, we learned that 98% of people who grow up in habitat houses graduate from high school.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's compared to 79% of that's our statewide average is 79%. To me, this is important in our neighborhoods. We also learned that two thirds of our habitat homeowners have a budget and can stick to it. And seven out of ten aren't worried about paying their monthly bills because their housing is affordable.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's financial stress that's lifted from a low income family because they have an affordable place to call home. Hey. Here. In Denver, Habitat has worked with 843 families since our founding just about 40 years ago in Globeville, Leary and Swankier.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We've invested more than $16 million to serve 200 families through our home repair and our homeownership programs. We're committed to these communities and to finding continuing to evolve, to find solutions for affordable homeownership. And this block is a really important part of that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I often say that I have one of the best jobs at Habitat because I get to work with all of the people. So I have the opportunity to connect with people through our community engagement efforts. We've hosted community meetings, we've attended other organizations meetings.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We've connected with. R.A. is in local employers. We've canvased door to door to talk with people who don't often go to community to community meetings. We've walked around the neighborhood with residents to hear their thoughts about this vacant lot, and we're hosting homebuyer readiness classes and working with local groups to make sure that people in the area'",
        "'speaker_1': 'know how to buy the houses and when to apply. We're committed to making this project a source of neighborhood pride and hope and opportunity. And of course, we need to rezone it first to make that possible. So that's why we're here tonight.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I thank you for your time and consideration, and I hope you'll support it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next up, Cory Whitaker.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think we're just available for questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If you want to, just go ahead and introduce yourself and say exactly that and then you can answer here.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. Corey Whittaker I'm the real estate manager with Habitat for Humanity. Address 3 to 4 or five Elliot Street. I'm here to answer any questions about the site plan, and thank you for your consideration of this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And last, Kate Helberg.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Cahill, Rick, director of real estate development.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'For Habitat for Humanity.'",
        "'speaker_1': '3245 Elliott Street. And just here to answer any questions that the rest of my colleagues can't.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Great. Thank you. That does conclude our speakers questions from members of council. Jasmine. Jasmine.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Jeff. The planning board recommended unanimous approval with increasing the height to 2.5 storeys on the rear of 35%. Sorry if I missed it, but what's. What's the logic to that?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah. So I almost think of it as an oversight. So the, um, the proposal that was before planning board had, um, I believe it was if it's 30 feet in the front instead of 17 feet in that rear, 35%, it was 30 feet in the rear.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So the, the, the package that planning board saw was to increase the height uniformly across the site and sort of get rid of that 6535 split. I think by mistake, honestly, we admitted that the rear 35% would also be allowed to go up to 2.5 storeys.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we had, if that makes sense. So. So the way it was, it was put before planning board the rear, 35% height was increased from 17 feet to 30 feet. But the number of stories didn't match that. It stayed at one story and it should have gone up to 2.5 storeys to match that 30 feet.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Inside is uniform the full length of the property.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Correct. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilman Cashman, Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Jeff. That's okay. The alley. Because there is no alley in the original subdivision. The alley width is 16 feet. I'm just. I just want to verify. Is that our standard alley width?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So believe so. I believe that there may be some allowance to go narrower, but I think that that is that is the standard.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. You're not certain whether 16 feet is our standard alley. I'm just concerned about, you know, services. Do you know of trash and recycling and composting pick up can be done from the alley with that with.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah. I mean so that's and this is punting on the question. I know but it is typically handled at the State Department planning stage. We did coordinate with those folks to make sure but 16 feet sounds right. I'm just I'm thinking that we've made allowances for narrowness in some cases, but I can't I don't think that that's'",
        "'speaker_2': 'been decided yet on this site. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. That's all.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilman Flynn. Councilman Brooks.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. How you doing?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Excellent. How are you?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm doing great. Thanks for leading this time, Parky. Your favorite subject on this. I remember when this came to commit. Council president. Are you laughing over there? Okay. Just make sure you're okay. On the. When this came to committee, it was an issue around parking.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Can you just address and I know that came up a planning board as well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The issue of whether or not they could provide parking.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yep. Each because each of the units do not have to provide parking in the back of their in the back of the townhomes are.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I believe they do. And they they do have one space per unit proposed as part of their site plan, a surface parking space coming off the alley.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. So and the number of units there, they're they're you 32 total. Okay. So each unit has one parking space?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That is correct, yes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. There was some. There was some. I'm okay with that. Matter of fact, I'm okay with none. But there was some pushback on there, and I just wanted to make sure there wasn't any issue. Do we not talk about that in the party when we were in committee?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I don't believe.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It came up explicitly. I apologize if it didn't. I'm forgetting it. But, um, I didn't have it in my notes that it was a specific issue.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay, great. And then I'm going to have come back up, Katie, and just tell me real quick, in the public, the am I level that these 32 units will be at?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah. Habitat for Humanity works with families, 80% of the area, median income or below for Globeville, Leary and Swansea residents where we're building three and four bedroom homes. So targeting larger families and expecting the income to be right around 47 to $49000 per year, which is also the average income of the neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. So right, about 60% of my kids are okay and all of the units are right at. How many bedrooms did you say?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Three and four bedrooms.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Awesome. All right. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'See. Thank you, Councilman Brooks. Seeing no other questions. The public hearing for House Bill 617 is closed. Comments by members of Council. Councilman Brooks.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yep. Thank you, Mr. President. I'll be supporting this number one, because the criteria is aligned with our plan documents. And I'm very excited to see these parties begin to work in our community and especially addressing all the site plan issues.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But I'm really excited about this because most of the affordable units in and in the District nine area are what a lot of elders in my community say dormitory style. And these are three or four bedroom homes for families.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so hats off to, you know, Habitat for Humanity. I was there at many of the outreach meetings. You did a fabulous job. And this is one city block. You are. And I'm just this is a is a cool night in my district thinking about one side of my district, Elijah's 62 acres, all of this crazy new'",
        "'speaker_6': 'opportunity and exactly the other side of my district getting new opportunities for 32 families. Today with this rezoning. So it's a good night. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilman Brooks. Councilman Nu, I just want to thank Habitat for developing this project. You know, you're probably one of my favorite organizations across this country. You do such great service in every area, whether it's in a disaster area or just a redevelopment area like this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I just want to say thanks for what you're doing for for Denver and for the low income families like you. Thank you. Councilman new councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I also wanted to thank Habitat. They've done excellent work. They've been down in southwest Denver as well. And this is a project that will it's hard to believe that this block, even efficiently platted as it was, could have sat for.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'A century and, you know, 101, almost 130 years without being utilized, while meanwhile being surrounded by, you know, by a vibrant neighborhood. And so it's very good to see see it finally be able to host 32. Good sized families.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And on a historical note. I wanted to point out that the original subdivision plat was signed by then city attorney John Schaff Roth, who went on to become U.S. representative. Senator and Governor of the state of Colorado. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilman Flynn and Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you for that, education Councilman Flynn. I want to excuse me express my support for this rezoning tonight. This is part of my old district. District nine. And, you know, to recognize the fact that there are so many changes happening in the area and that these neighborhoods are actually going to be losing residents to have a focus'",
        "'speaker_7': 'on new housing coming into this community is really, really important. And, you know, I don't know how many of the residents in the community have gone through the application process and actually qualify for any of the homes. But I know there's a there's ironically, there's a strong homeownership concentration in these neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But for those who are renters, they're sort of at the mercy of the the landlords. And we've seen a lot of people that have been displaced as a result of landlords being able to, you know, increase the rents and and get higher, you know, people with higher incomes that can live in the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So that's having the, you know, displacement effect on the people who who are, in fact, there today or have been there. And so knowing that you all have made a commitment to targeting the LMI levels of the neighborhood as opposed to the entire city, is really important to trying to keep people in that community.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I appreciate those efforts. And you guys have done a great job in Globeville with all the housing that you built over there. And I know you have a lot of trust and respect of people from these neighborhoods, so keep up the great work.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you for what you're doing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Ortega. Councilman Brooks Becker.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah. Just a tidbit here, Mr. President, if you allow me, I think this is kind of a big deal. We didn't do this before, but I just want to have Kitty McKenna, who works for Habitat. For folks who are watching and want to know how to get involved and get on the list and see if they can'",
        "'speaker_6': 'get in on some of these units. Can she provide some information?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'She's also a Globeville resident, by the way.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah. Thank you. And for anyone watching, we would love it if you apply, if you're interested. The best way to get information is to visit our website at WW Dot Habitat Metro Denver. Georgie.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. All right. And with that, seeing no other comments, Madam Secretary, roll call.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Sorry, I got one thing wrong here.'",
