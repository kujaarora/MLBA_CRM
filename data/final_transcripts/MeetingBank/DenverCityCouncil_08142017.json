And the first one is Proclamation 17 092 to recognize in the annual Brothers Redevelopment and Denver employee volunteer opportunities. Paine Nathan Day in the city in county of Denver on Saturday, August 19th.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Whereas, through the Partnership of Denver Employees Volunteer Opportunities Deveaux and Denver Redevelopment 100 plus Denver City employees will volunteer their time to paint homes of deserving senior homeowners in the agency's 39th annual paint a thon, whereas all painting will be completed free of charge for homeowners saving the city's fixed income seniors thousands of dollars in home maintenance'",
        "'speaker_1': 'repairs. And. Whereas, volunteers will be beautifying homes and preserving home values in Denver area neighborhoods as a result of their participation. And. Whereas, the paint often is a great way to show the city employees take pride in the community and take care of their residents that they care so much about.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'It has been moved by me. And second it I'll make a couple of comments here. I first of all, you know, I want to give a lot of credit to brothers redevelopment and all of these city employees that are so involved in their community.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I got to tell you, you don't realize how many elderly people who are not connected with folks are shut in their homes until you start going door to door. And this summer, I spent a lot of time going door to door.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And just this last weekend I was in North City Park in the Skyland neighborhood, and I could not believe the number of elderly individuals who lived in the neighborhood 40, 50, 60 years, but just alone and no one spending time with them.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I know there's several folks on this council. I know we do this with the Hiawatha Davis senior luncheon and things like that, where we try and honor our elders in our community. But something like this where you fix up an elders home in their community, can transform your life, can be so incredible because they just'",
        "'speaker_1': 'cannot get out and improve their home like they used to. And so I want to thank Brothers redevelopment. I want to thank the 100 plus city employees who will get out of their cubicles, get out of the building and hang out with some constituents and really give back.'",

        "'speaker_11': 'For the city and county of Denver. And with that, we're able to partner with area nonprofits.'",

        "'speaker_11': 'Please contact Deveaux. Deveaux Denver Gov dawg.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And then moving on to the program or.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'To the proclamation itself in Pennington, I want to make sure I say thank you to Brothers redevelopment for the work that they put into this event. We went from painting three houses last year to now eight houses.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This year, and we couldn't have.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Done that without them. Additionally, with our DEVEAUX board, it's the same thing. We have unpaid board members that are out there putting in their time and effort extra curricular work to make sure that we can do events like this.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And we've had about 140 volunteers sign up for this event. So it's a big thing for us. And it's also our 100th home with brothers paint a thon. So we've now.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Done 100 homes.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'For 12.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Years. So. Right.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Good evening. Thanks for having me. Council President Brooks in Denver, City Council, we appreciate the opportunity. This is a big weekend for the paint athon and the historic milestone that we're gonna surpass in our partnership with the city employees and city of Denver.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so we're really excited and we're just so grateful to be in this spot to provide a place for employees to serve. And they've certainly taken us up on that for more than I think this is our 12th year, 12th straight year that we've worked on this.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And yeah, we're going to surpass this huge milestone this Saturday, the 100th home. I think it's going to be next door to Councilmember Brooks. Right? I think it's next door to you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We're coming to you. So to see you on a.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Ladder with a brush, some gear, getting, you know, full of paint on Saturday.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And we're looking forward to it. And we're going to be painting. There's eight sites, I think I counted in several districts and several neighborhoods over the past 12 years that we've worked together with city employees. We've painted 99 homes and we're going to make that milestone on Saturday.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But that's total savings, collective savings for those homeowners of $225,000.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And for fixed income, low income senior.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Struggling to make ends meet, living month to month. That gives them the ability to use those resources toward grocery bills, utilities, going to the doctor, paying for prescriptions, whatever. And so we're just so grateful. And this really underscores and demonstrates the spirit of service that exists among our hardworking city employees, but also that exists here in the'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Mile High City. So, again, we're just so appreciative and looking forward to seeing you on Saturday at a house near you and see on those ladders.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'And it's some it's some cool stuff that we're doing in the city that doesn't get a lot of coverage. I mean, $225,000, we're saving elderly individuals. So thank you, guys for what you do.'",

And finally, see that I shall have the right to review all plans for the Twin Basin Drainage Project, including the Early Action Drainage'",

        "'speaker_10': 'And the same is true for the 60% and 100% design period. I believe that Court could indeed have provided the needed redundancy for the I-70 project on their own dime, but I believe they've chosen not to do so because it's in their financial interest to partner with the city.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'But now everywhere I go, I see drainage basins and ditches that the city and urban drainage and government entities have built in order to protect our neighborhoods and our city from a serious rain event in 2013. We all remember the horrible floods that we had that destroyed a lot of communities and a lot of homes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I do support these projects. They will protect our city and our neighborhoods. There's been a lot of misinformation out there, and I just want to be clear on some things. Number one, the city park golf course is not going to be destroyed.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It is going to be improved into a more beautiful and accessible course. Q Alumnus and Hall of Fame golfer Hale Irwin is designing it so that players of all abilities can play golf together. The new design will attract younger players, and it will be more inclusive.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It will also incorporate facilities for the first tee program for children. The historic character of the golf course and views will be preserved. And of the 824 existing trees, 561 will be preserved and 660 760 new trees will be planted on the course or in the area with a net gain of almost 500 trees.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We actually have our city forester here tonight who can answer more questions about the trees, but many of the trees that will be cut down are already stressed or damaged. They also will replace the tree canopy. So if you think of a large tree and the size of the canopy of the branches in the leaves, they'll replace'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that with as many smaller trees that will create that same area of canopy. Many of Denver's parks are already drainage areas to mitigate floods. Just this morning, I rode my bike around Bible Park, which is a drainage area.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The other day I ran in Paul Cashman's district on the Harvard Gulch, which is a great plant path and it is a drainage area. Also in my district we have the Goldsmith Gulch that goes through Wallace Park, Rosamond Park and Bible Park, and it's a drainage area.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Using parks and green spaces for drainage is a natural, smart way to mitigate a major flood. So with that said, I will be supporting these contracts.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. Thanks, Councilwoman Black. Councilwoman Gilmore.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Thank you, President Brooks. Protecting people and property from floodwaters is of the utmost importance. I know that we all agree on that. And I'd like to humbly share a little bit about my background so that you can put into context my next comments for close to 25 years.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I worked within the field of natural resources. I started out at the Colorado Department of Natural Resources when Ken Salazar served as the executive director. I have also worked for Colorado State Parks and the Colorado Division of Wildlife, which is now merged into the Colorado Division of Parks and Wildlife.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I began my career when the number of women and people of color within federal, state and city natural resource agencies were in the single digits. And sadly to say, we are, we still are. I have dedicated my entire adult life to educating people and advocating for responsible and science led management in regard to our precious natural resources'",

I started in far northeast Denver, which is dedicated to educating a diverse population of youth and their families in science, technology, engineering and math and natural resource issues.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'During my tenure with Elk, I researched, wrote and implemented many U.S. Environmental Protection Agency grants related to environmental justice and environmental education. I have supervised and directly implemented educational programs involving watersheds, water quality, including point and non-point source pollution, and monthly analysis of local creeks, including westerly and Sand Creek for page hardness, alkalinity and other environmental variables'",

        "'speaker_9': 'Is not a native.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Ecosystem, a native ecosystem. In this geographic location, as the majority of Denver is a short grass prairie, it would be rolling fields of prairie grasslands with a historic Montclair creek meandering through the prairie landscape. This creek is where the rain and snow melt, which would go on its way to the South Platte River.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'The historic Montclair Creek riparian zone would move water through this landscape and slowly help the water filtrate through riparian vegetation, much like a sponge would work to clean our water naturally before it drains into our rivers and becomes the drinking water for folks downstream in northeast Colorado.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Where my family lives in Brush, Colorado and on out to Nebraska. This design will help recreate the historic ecological representation of what was here, and it will consist of riparian areas and prairie uplands and will sustain cottonwoods, willows and other trees and vegetation that will create a wider diversity of wildlife habitat.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'The City Park Golf Course is a human created, over watered ecosystem, created to sustain the non-native turf and the trees that have been planted. The majority of trees that you see in a native prairie habitat would be cottonwoods growing along a creek because of their need for a reliable water source.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We have an opportunity through this stormwater management project to create a more naturalized native landscape, which will highlight what was here historically, along with creating a more historic environment. The most recent email from Public Works shows that their team, along with the design team, have worked incredibly hard to not only mitigate the loss of trees, but to'",
        "'speaker_12': 'enhance the urban canopy with the addition of hundreds of trees. This landscape will be more sustainable and will consist of wetlands, areas that will filtrate stormwater drainage, which many times can contain oil, pesticides and fertilizers. Pretty much anything you put on your lawn or in your driveway or on the streets when it rains.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We know the roads flood and all of that stormwater has to go somewhere. We will improve upon the non-native environment of the City Park Golf Course, and this is good, sound natural resource management. The bottom line is that along with properly implementing this stormwater management project, we should also stay focused on the public safety and safety of'",

        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Gilmore, Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Pro tem. So I think it's important to go back and talk about the fact that we had not only an IGA between Denver and Seaport, but there was a proclamation that was brought forward on the preferred alternative that was approved by City Council before the supplemental draft of the Environmental Impact Statement was released'",
        "'speaker_9': '. I did not support that at the time. I did not support the IGA nor the rate increase that was followed, which included a $300 million increase to the rate payers in Denver. I believe there is a need for drainage in the Cole neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The Montclair Basin was one of the twin basins. There is a separately funded effort or planning process that's underway right now for that particular basin. But I think it's also important to note that when this Twin Basin project, which is now called the PDP Plat to Park Hill Project, was brought forward.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'This was not in the wastewater five year plan. It was pushed to the front of the line. And, you know, clearly it was to look at how to coordinate the two projects. And I actually had advocated that the $40 million court originally was going to spend on drainage for I-70 should be utilized because the city started talking'",
        "'speaker_9': 'about trying to address the coal flooding problem. But the project went from $40 million to what I just mentioned, 300 million. And I'm not sure we've seen the end of the costs just yet. Now, eight short years ago, the Globeville neighborhood had been taken out of the flood plain because of work that the city had done to'",
        "'speaker_9': 'make changes to the river corridor. And those low income residents no longer had to purchase flood insurance. Now fast forward to seeing a lot of the new development that's going on in this area. Anything that is less than one acre does not have to do any on site storm drainage, that's runoff that goes into our sewer system'",
        "'speaker_9': 'and into the river. We now have a new 33rd outfall that was done as a result of the RTD projects for the A-line. So that's additional water going into the river. And then when you add all of the water from this particular project, that's even more water that now dumps into the Globeville landing outfall, which is a'",
        "'speaker_9': 'little park right behind the Pepsi-Cola plant. For anybody that's trying to develop in the Globeville neighborhood, they are now having to build four foot high. Detention, not detention, but four foot high foundations to protect their buildings from, you know, being from from being flooded.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So when this project came forward, we learned that Globeville will now be called an inundation area. This is not they're not calling their back in the floodplain, but it's an inundation area that is now requiring anybody who comes to our community planning and development agency that wants to build in Globeville on the west side of the river'",
        "'speaker_9': '. They have to have a four foot high foundation. My understanding is that residents will also be required to have to start getting flood insurance again until that problem is resolved. I had asked our public works department to address this problem for Globeville.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Given the fact that this project was put to the front of the line, there was no reason we couldn't solve the other problem at the same time. That didn't happen. So we were told we want to wait for the Army Corps of Engineering study that's being done on the river.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And we're looking at probably ten years before Globeville may see some relief to this problem. We're talking about a community that's being impacted with national Western, with I-70, with Brighton Boulevard improvements, with all the development going on in these neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We're going to see Washington Street redone. There will be an Excel pipeline that will go down the Washington Street corridor. So we're talking about a lot of impact to just this small neighborhood alone. Yet we made no effort to try to figure out how to solve this problem.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So for all of these reasons, I have not been on board. I do think there is an issue that needs to be resolved with drainage, but I am not supportive of these three bills being approved to move forward.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Has nothing to do with well-qualified people who have been selected to do this project. I actually have friends that are part of the team. But those are the reasons why I will not be supporting these three bills tonight.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Ortega. Councilman Lopez.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I. Look, I know we've had this topic in our chambers a few times, and. Of The Jetsons.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To those viewers at home. There was a weird noise that happens like this.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The catcher don't know the Jetsons. So I this topic has been in front of us a few times and I have a very intimate relationship with with it. You know, back in the day and in 2003. I was one of the folks I went door to door with with the survey, knocking on doors, getting the community input'",
        "'speaker_11': '. Kevin You know, you remember this? Yeah. I think Kevin wrote the story that I was quoted in. But I was a young guy, and we knock on every single door from Globeville all the way to Green Valley Ranch.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Every single one of those. It took us about seven or eight months to do. And we got, you know, everybody along that I-70 corridor. And we got valuable input from folks who said, we don't want this highway in our neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'You don't want the housing in our neighborhood. Right. But if we had the choice, right, we reroute it or bury it. Right. It's better than this thing that is just above our neighborhood. Separating, creating this, casting the shadows.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So. So I get it. You know, ever since then, you know, I look, I went through the process, and I saw that it took almost a decade just to make a decision on something that was obvious, right? I mean, it is it is a big deal.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But and, you know, a lot of the advocates then are no longer around, but a lot of the residents still feel very strongly about it. And when this proclamation came in front of us, I voted no. Because I still.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I believed in a reroute. Now. It was very unfortunate that we didn't go that direction. I think it was a tremendous mistake historically from a state in the city to tend to not fight for the root. Now we have what's in front of us.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And I look at this through another lens. And that is a lens of someone who has chaired the urban drainage and flood control front flood control district for two years. Now, I never thought that I that this would be exciting or fun.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'You are talking about hydrology, you know, drainage. But I learned a heck of a lot. And I chaired this for two for two years, and I chaired it through the floods that we had and in in Boulder County and and Longmont.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And and realized that the infrastructure that had that they had that the lack there we had in Aurora and the eastern part of our metro area. And we were even hit harder than they were. But if you if you remember the pictures, their houses were they were the ones that took it.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'They're the ones that got the the the hard that they were the hardest hit, lost their property, lost their homes, lost some, lost their lives. That's what happens when you don't have the infrastructure in place. They weren't part of the FCD or they weren't part of the urban traditional flood control district.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'They decided not to opt into that a while back. So in looking at at this through that lens, it is absolutely critical that we have the infrastructure in place for those neighborhoods right now. Um. I find myself in a hard position because here I am thinking about my work.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And as somebody who went door to door in my work as a councilman and our vote against the current plan and I vote against the proclamation. And I come to realize that. Even if you vote no on this, it's not going to it's not going to bring back the reroute.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Voting no on those. On these bills will not magically bring back the out. And that is what the primary thing that the residents wanted was the reroute or it lowered. And you absolutely is is my absolute truth. That is right.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And what I remember from that, all those doors, 8000 doors that we knocked on. Right. People who I sat in interviews for almost 45 minutes a piece. Those are the two things. If it's not rerouted, put it under.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'If there's no drainage. Let's say that this is all for the let's say, folks. All right. This is all just to support, you know, what's going to happen on I-70. All you're going to have is another bridge for another 100 years.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And you know, I get it. I get that there's folks that don't live there, that stand in solidarity with folks that are concerned about the the the golf course and the impacts that it'll make to the golf course.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I get it. I respect that. I respect the solidarity. But you don't have to live with another bridge over your head for a hundred, 400 years. The folks in Elyria, Swansea and Globeville do. And all those neighborhoods all the way up to like around Colorado.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That's what they said. That was the the thing that stuck in my mind. And I have to tell this story over and over because I see a lot of new faces that that are in the room and new colleagues.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And, you know, I make this decision not lightly, but just with that intimate knowledge. Another elevated option cannot exist there. Not on my watch. It is. The I-70 was a grand mistake a long time ago, and it still is a headache.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But the killing, the drainage for it isn't going to bring back the reroute, guys. And I fear that killing the drainage only if it does go through. And if the you know, every all the stars lined up. Right.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'You're only building another elevated bridge. And that is the absolute last thing that should happen on that road. So I will be supporting the the three bills ahead of us. I didn't also support the delay. And because that is our right on council, that was something that was made clear to us a long time ago.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And, and and we we should always have room for that dialog in that process. So thank you. Mr. President, it is about lives and property everywhere, right? Both in Elyria, in Swansea and Globeville with the immediate remediation and.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And areas that would be impacted by flooding. So. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilman Lopez. Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Last week I was I joined Councilman Espinosa and others in supporting a delay in this final consideration of this contract, because I believe that we should always take the time any member of this council wants to take.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Within the time we were allotted to look over these contracts, we get such precious little time as it is. And I hope that with Councilwoman Ortega, we can take a look at that as a group very soon, how we do contracts.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I also wanted to thank Councilwoman Ortega for reminding everyone that this plot to Park Hill I always thought it should be Park Hill to because water flows downhill doesn't blow up at all. But I didn't get to name it that the project grew way too much, too fast.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And as I said last week is by a significant factor larger than anything wastewater has ever done in a single bite. And it just gives me heartburn to have seen it grown from, I believe it was actually 134 million.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'When you combine seed out in the city to nearly 300 million without, without full and without enough engineering being done, without 30% design being done on every element that was going to be built, which I regard as normal process.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so I wish that it hadn't happened that way. I voted against a stormwater fee increase. Councilman Cashman reminded everybody how just two weeks before the seven new members were sworn in, I believe I was sitting out in the second row there and watched the council pass the IGA that that kind of locked us into this direction'",
        "'speaker_6': 'and I regret that. And but at this point, I think to use these contracts as a de facto substitute for the plaintiffs in the McFarland case to file and seek an injunction after we passed the contracts, I don't think the Council should act in the place of the plaintiff and and give a de facto injunction by killing'",
        "'speaker_6': 'these contracts. So I look forward to the trial in, I believe, two weeks. And I am reminded that despite and I mentioned this last week, despite the optimism of our staff, I'm reminded of the City Park Pavilion case where the Friends of City Park defeated the city's plan to convert the pavilion into parks headquarters.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And how shocked everybody was at that. And I remember the headline show, I was a judge, I think Judge Flowers in district court who said that that was not an appropriate use of a city park land. So I look forward to the trial, but I just don't think that this council should substitute its judgment on these contracts'",
        "'speaker_6': 'by handing the plaintiffs in what, in essence, is an injunction that they have not yet sought themselves. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilman Flynn. Councilman Clark.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you, Mr. President. First of all, I just want to say thank you here to all the constituents who've reached out, engaged with me, sat down over coffee and had great conversations with me, were really smart, passionate people on both sides of this issue.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I really appreciate that dialog. I spent my entire career prior to this working along the South Platte River. That's why my water bottle serves as PR for South Platte River on one side, and Greenway Foundation, the nonprofit dedicated to the river on the other side.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I carry it not just on my water ball bottle, but in everything that I do. And it's Denver's river. I carry it in my heart. So I also take issue with the name of this, but not for the same reasons that Councilman Flynn took up.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Because the Platte River is not Denver's River. The Platte River runs elsewhere. This is the South Platte River. And so we should stop calling it Plot to Park who should be South Platte when we were considering the fee increase to our stormwater to our stormwater fees.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I met extensively with city and with the folks who I think the absolute world of at the urban drainage and flood control district. I dug in deeply into this, and there was one thing that was glaring for me after having those meetings.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And that was that it is better for. The South Platte River to do this drainage project in conjunction with what is happening at I-70. I won't get up here and talk about it has gone past or whether I-70 redo is a good idea or not.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'What I know is that if we don't do this, we will once again be turning our back on the South Platte River. And we did that for a really long time and we destroyed the river. And it has taken since 1974 when the Greenway Foundation built the first park in the first trail.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Imagine that a Denver with zero parks and zero trails along the South Platte River and the Cherry Creek. I can't imagine it in part because I wasn't alive in 1974, but also because it's not a city that I would want to live in.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And we have been clawing our way back since 1974 and a hole that we dug and a vote against this drainage project does not stop the I-70 project. But what it does do is it will directly lead to dirtier water in the South Platte River because the I-70 project can continue on without this and they can put'",
        "'speaker_11': 'dirtier water in the river. And so for that reason, I am that I wanted to highlight why I will be supporting this tonight. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman Clark. Councilman.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'No, thank you, Mr. President. Even though, you know, I think this project has a relationship to us, I think the most important thing to me is, is the flood mitigation part of this this whole project aspect. You know, my background was hospital management for well over 30 years, for a long, long time.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And I went through several floods with hospitals that I managed. And it was devastating. The amount of damage to buildings and all the residential areas around our hospitals was just incredible. So I just have the greatest respect for the flood mitigation part of this that's going to be helpful to all those residents in Cole and and all'",
        "'speaker_13': 'along that whole route of appear to be. So is this flood mitigation is extremely important to me. Also keep in mind this is I think it's like a over $300 million project, but it's only part of a $1.5 billion plan of mitigation for our city.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'This is like deferred maintenance. I mean, this stuff we need to be doing. This plan was developed a couple of years ago. So we've got to be respectful to what our city needs in terms of total flood mitigation.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And I think that's extremely important. Now for my golfers head on and I'm an avid golfer and I played saved par golf course and it can be improved and needs to be improved. It has the most wonderful views of our city, but this is an opportunity to make it a better course.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Hale Irwin on Colorado, a Buffalo golfer, again, is going to do an incredible job of redesigning that course and make it into something that's notable. Our golf course right now is not notable. It's a good public golf course, but it's not a great course.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'It could be something that could be much more important to our city and and to all the people who play golf like myself. But the most important thing is flood mitigation. We've got to we've got to implement this total $1.5 billion plan over time.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And this is the first part of it. So I'll be supporting these tonight. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. Thank you, Councilman. New Councilwoman Sussman.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thanks to.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'My colleagues for their comments.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And thanks to all that wrote emails to us all. First of all, I'd like to. I also sat on the urban drainage and flood control district for four years, and like Councilman Black, I never knew that I'd really be interested in.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Drainage and outfalls and.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And all the vocabulary that I learned.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Certainly.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Learned a lot about this particular issue down in the lower Montclair Basin. Councilman Flynn, the reason why one would call it the South Platte to Park Hill is while water flows downhill, you always start a drainage project from the outfall from where the water is going.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You don't start a project from where the water starts. So that's why I think since the engineers probably named it, they did South Platte to Park Hill. We have known on the urban drainage flood control desk. We have known about, of course, the lower Montclair Basin is the biggest flooding issue we have in the city of Denver'",
        "'speaker_3': '. We have had it for years. We have on the on the EDF. We didn't know how we were ever going to really manage that flooding problem, a problem that we have there. The while the I-70 project is kind of related, it's because they were going to bury or put below ground part of their highway that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They were going to run into the Lower Montclair Basin issue and they were going to spend the money to help the drainage. On their little part. On their little part. And if we don't and instead they decided to do to partner with the UDC, UDC, FCD and with Denver and to use the dollars that they were going'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to use to give to the city to also work finally on the Lower Montclair Basin. I've really appreciated that. Comments that Councilman Lopez made that not voting for this doesn't mean the I-70 project goes away. I'd like to turn that around and say.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Whether the I-70 project is built or not, the drainage problem is staying. If the I-70 project were rerouted, the drainage problem is going to stay. If the project goes through, the drainage problem is going to stay. If we stopped I-70 and made it a boulevard, the drainage problem stays.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We have the drainage problem regardless of what I-70 is doing. And most important, and most importantly for my district, although this isn't related to the Lower Montclair Basin, I firmly believe we need to fix that basin and this is an opportunity.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'To do it. The large project that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Councilman knew referred to is going to help my district, which is in the Upper Montclair Basin. And I don't know if those those of you are aware, but not every two or three years we get a flood up in at 14th in Jersey and Jasmine and Carney, where we have cars floating down the street.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I spent the summer of part, a night of the summer of 2013 with.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'With.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The first responders.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Saving people that were floating in their cars. If you can imagine down Jasmine.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And 13th and.'",
        "'speaker_3': '14th.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And the larger project.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is finally going to help us address the Upper Montclair Basin. But I will be supporting this tonight because.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Of the serious.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Need that our Lower Montclair Basin needs, whether or not I-70, we're going to be enlarged. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Dr. Sussman. Councilman Newt, you look, you didn't pop back in the just system. You're okay, Councilman Espinosa. Sorry. I feel like I should chime in since I called this out last week too. Specifically to ask the administration to consider essentially postponing and putting in a clause or something for tree protection.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We did get a. I did. I did. So I just want to know that I did make an ask specifically. I said that I pointed out that the highest inundation levels north of City Park in a 100 year event as model and in that stormwater plan is 2 to 4 feet and that and because in so what'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I asked him is because of a known breach in the Platte River levee, there's a levee called the Globeville Levee that's on the on the Western Bank protects Globeville. There's a known breach in that. Because of that known breach, there are several hundred year events that can occur upstream from Globeville.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Remember, the South Platte River runs south to north. The there are several hundred year events that can flood Globeville to an inundation level of 15 feet, and that can happen multiple ways. The only way you do this in the Lower Montclair Basin is through a hundred year event in the lower Montclair raising and the.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I asked the administration to help me understand how even in a $386 million commitment to urban drainage, an $863 million commitment to the National Western Center, and now a three $934 million go bond ask. So those doing the math, that's over $1,000,000,000.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Closer to two. How We Didn't Address Globeville. And then I went on to proceed in in and I don't understand the rationale because that stormwater management plan that was referenced didn't include these solutions. As Debby Ortega had mentioned, it did include some solutions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But you don't need you don't need a 39th Avenue channel. You don't need City Park. You don't need them both.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You need one.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And either one of those solutions solves both basins because the waters today that go through City Park, they actually outfall at the Globeville Outfall Landing or the Globeville Landing outfall. But because we're now taking water from a different basin and cutting that off through the 39th Avenue Channel, we have to hold that water.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Somewhere in order to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Preserve the 100 year capacity of that channel. Not for the park, but for CDOT. And so, you know, I appreciate my colleagues in council sort of bringing this up and bringing this to light the sort of sense of urgency and connecting it to the Platte Park Hill.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Because the response to the council to date and publicly about why this was needed was because there was a sort of finite window in which you can do this work and deliver this thing and still keep golf course sort of viable because of the growing season.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And when you have to plant and plant sod and plant trees and what have you. Well, guess what? That happens every year. So we haven't done this to City Park since its creation, and now we have to do it in this window.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We can't wait till next year's window or the next year's window. Why? Why is because of somehow something we're not talking about, the administration is not talking about, but this counsel is very clear on it. It's because this is needed in order to preserve its capacity to use stormwater capture the stormwater capacity of the 39th Avenue Channel'",
        "'speaker_1': '. Four sedan for the highway. And so I argued, you know, I pushed back.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I got a.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Response. It was no. I pushed back and said.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You know, because I was asking.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Why not just complete the design were 30% design involved? Because, again, this is not the administration is not talking about the connection here. So I just pushed and I said, why not complete the design work with the community, complete the course design, hire Hale Irwin to do a fantastic job on the future of City Park.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Maybe we could do more tree preservation in the process, get that clubhouse nailed down in the interim while you're preparing to do this project next year and then hire Saunders capable contractor. Very, very good to do this work.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The answer was.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And it's because of.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Like I said.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'What we're talking about here tonight. And so this was not about, you know, this is somehow going to kill I-70. It's not you know, and I don't think anybody who's really trying to fight for city park and the preservation of that asset is saying that this is this thing is going to kill I-70 because, no, they will'",
        "'speaker_1': 'then put in their stormwater detention that they are not getting from 39th Avenue Channel into their project. They'll have to. And guess what? They'll have stormwater mitigation and water quality requirements for that for that detention that they put in their 100 year thing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I can assure you that if a 100 year event hit City Park or the 39th Avenue Channel, the water quality measures go away because at that level of inundation, there's water just moving. The water quality measures are there for lower flows.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so the reality is, is that we could actually drain these flows that go through city park and inundate areas north of City Park, directly into the 39th Avenue Channel today. He helped, you know, actually solved the drainage problems per the master plan for both the the two basins with just the 39th Avenue Channel and some additional'",
        "'speaker_1': 'work. And then city park flows will go exactly where they always were going historically to Globeville, Alfa. Our global landing. We are.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So it's sort of a.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Fallacy that we have to do this per an IGA. The Twin Basin solution is still solved. It's just not solved to the degree that it would want us to. In order to do that, we're taking on this additional work and we're obligating merely, you know, a significant portion of the $400 million which you are getting through your'",
        "'speaker_1': 'stormwater fees, which you did not vote for, and not solving real flood issues in Globeville and in other neighborhoods citywide, because we have taken on this agreement to sort of leverage. So the thing is the right thing to do is for City Park is to say, no, let's complete the design and move on.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But if you vote for this, you're basically saying, look, I am putting the priorities of CDOT over this asset of the people of Denver.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That I will be joining my.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Colleague, Councilwoman Cashman, in voting no. And that's it. Thanks. All right. Thank you, Councilman Espinosa. I will go last to the cheering of the audience. I am. This is my district, and I represent this deal. And I got to say, from the very beginning, I was very frustrated with the administration for how they came talking to the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'community around this thing. It was it was not well done. It wasn't well communicated. And we had a lot of intense arguments and conversations about it and a lot of open meetings that were very frustrating. Since then, I feel like the administration really began to turn towards the community and reach out to the community and set up'",
        "'speaker_1': '. We're talking about City Park here. I know we've talked about a lot of different things, but the city park folks, the North City Park, the city park west neighborhood and put together a stakeholder committee to begin working through the issues around this golf course and this drainage problem.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so let me let me start by saying when we talk about the the lower Montclair Basin. It's it's been said in ways but let me be very clear. It's the worst basin in the city. It is the worst base in any city.'",

The site is located in Council District nine. The urban redevelopment area was occupied by the Emily Griffith Opportunity School, a Denver public school, for nearly 100 years prior to its closure.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The vocational school was named for Emily Griffith, a local teacher who advocated that persons of all ages and races should have the opportunity to learn and better themselves. The school was expanded several times and continued to operate at this location until its programs were to reload.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Relocated to 1860 Lincoln Street beginning in 2013. Since relocating, the buildings have remained vacant. In May of 2016, the Emily Griffith Opportunity School was designated historic at the local level and restrictions were placed on the amount and nature of the possible redevelopment.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Most of the structures fronting the Welton Street must be retained and setbacks were established for new development to ensure that the appearance and massing of the Welton Street buildings are preserved, any future development on the site will be subject to the design standards and guidelines approved by Denver City Council with the designation and must be approved by'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the Landmark Preservation Commission. A fundamental consideration in approving an urban redevelopment area is a finding by council that the area is blighted as required by the Colorado Urban Renewal Law. To this end, Durham commissioned Matrix Design Group to conduct a study to determine if the area is blighted.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That study, dated July of 2017, has been filed with the city clerk as part of the record of this public hearing. In summary, the Blight study found the following five factors that constitute blighting conditions. Slum deteriorated or deteriorating structures.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'At the time, the field study was performed in September of 2016. Structures in the area were found to be in fair condition. Most issues found were related to broken windows in the school buildings. These broken windows were fairly widespread, but all had been boarded.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Suggesting that ongoing maintenance is still occurring despite the vacancy of the campus. The frequency of broken windows continues to increase and the campus buildings are becoming increasingly dilapidated. An additional area of concern was noted with the concrete window lintels, which were severely crumbled in many locations, creating small piles of rubble on the ground underneath them.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'While the buildings on the Emily Griffith campus were not found to be in an advanced state of deterioration, it does remain ongoing and the buildings are receiving only stopgap maintenance rather than repairs. This situation leads to a finding of slum deteriorated or deteriorating structures.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Predominance of defective or inadequate street layout. There is relatively poor circulation in the vicinity of the area relative to the rest of the central business district and civic center area. The area is immediately adjacent to the Colorado Convention Center, which is a sprawling structure occupying more than six full city blocks.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The sheer size of the convention center breaks the continuity of the street grid in the area, with the exception of Stout Street, which passes underneath the convention center but does not serve any of the property in the study area.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The Convention Center is one of the largest super blocks in the downtown area, but it is also important to note the presence of the courthouse and the detention center to the south, as well as the Denver Center for Performing Arts and Area Campus in the vicinity to the west.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'All three properties also break the continuity of the street grid, creating dead ends and a lack of redundancy that felt funnels traffic onto certain streets and creates longer walking distance for pedestrians. Overall, the urban renewal area encompasses an area of downtown that is somewhat isolated and removed from the surrounding area, both physically and psychologically.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Pedestrian activity and private investment in this section of downtown is far lower than the rest of the central business district to the northeast. Although none of these isolation issues are expected to be corrected by the urban renewal process.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They do represent a challenge to the redevelopment of the area because of the lack of connections to the surrounding street grid and poor provisions for local traffic. A finding of inadequate street layout has been made. Unsanitary or unsafe conditions.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Records from the police department show that over the past five years there were 91 reported crimes in the area and in the surrounding rights of way, not including minor traffic incidents. Emergency responses are more frequent still, with one in fact being observed during the field study by our consultant.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But it was not recorded as a reported crime of incidents that were recorded. Nine were various forms of assault. Three were street robberies, 23 vehicular hitting runs, and three were business burglaries. The remaining crimes were mostly related to drugs, criminal trespassing and larceny.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'These crime statistics represent an elevated of both violent and nonviolent crime, given the study area finding of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. Environmental contamination of buildings or property. The condition study notes the former Emily Griffith Griffith facility had an onsite body shop, including paint facilities, which is a use that is commonly associated with environmental contamination.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The use of hazardous substances over many years technically represents a recognized environmental condition. In addition, an appraisal commissioned by the city and county of Denver in 2014 noted that, quote, The building contains asbestos and lead based paint, and the cost of remediation and repurposing while retaining the existing structure would be very significant and economically counterproductive.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And quote the former presence of the auto body shop and the noted presence of asbestos and lead based paint support. A finding of environmental contamination of buildings or property. The existence of health, safety or welfare factors requiring high levels of municipal services or substantial physical underutilization or vacancy of sites, buildings or other improvements.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Elevated crime levels revealed in police records already discussed coincide with high levels of municipal services. Emergency responses from the Denver Police Department are common in the study area. Additionally, relative to the rest of the central business district, the study area is substantially underutilized.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The formerly the former Emily Griffith campus is a full city block that lies vacant compared to the rest of the central business district. There is very little history of private investment in the vicinity of the study area. Therefore, there is a finding of the existence of health, safety or welfare factories factors requiring high levels of municipal services'",
        "'speaker_3': 'or substantial physical underutilization or vacancy of sites, buildings or other improvements in the study area. These blight factors individually and collectively impair or arrest the sound growth of the municipality and constitute an economic and social liability and a menace to the public health, safety, morals or welfare of this area.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In bringing forward this urban redevelopment plan, Drer has sought to align the goals and objectives of the plan with the existing city plans and their approved supplements for the area, including the Denver Comprehensive Plan Plan 2000 Blueprint, Denver and the 27 Downtown Area Plan and reviewing the Urban Redevelopment Plan.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'City planning staff found that the Urban Redevelopment Plan conforms to Plan 2000 by furthering several citywide objectives, policy and action in the plan, including the conservation of raw materials by promoting efforts to adapt existing buildings for new uses rather than destroying them.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Conservation of land by promoting infill development within Denver at sites where service and infrastructure are already in place. Encouraging quality infill development that is consistent with the character of the surrounding neighborhood, that offers opportunities for increased density and more amenities.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And that broadens the variety of compatible uses, promotion of standards and incentives for design that enhance the quality and character of the city, including the preservation of significant historic structures and features. Preservation of Denver's architectural and design legacies while allowing new ones to evolve.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Leveraging city resources to protect Denver's landmarks and eligible historic buildings. And to avoid their demolition. And ensuring downtown's future as Denver's preeminent center for business, tourism and entertainment, including through continued support of the re-use of historic buildings in and around downtown.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Blueprint. DENVER Denver's Integrated Land Use and transportation plan adopted by the City Council in 2002, identifies the urban redevelopment area as being located within within an area of change with the concept land use of downtown. Blueprint Denver recognizes downtown as the centerpiece of the city and region with the highest intensity of uses in Colorado.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Blueprint Denver further states that downtown has the most intense land use, development and transportation systems, and the vision is to continue more of the same type of high quality office, hotel, retail, residential and mixed use development. The Urban Redevelopment Plan is consistent with the intent and vision for areas of change and the downtown concept land use.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The Downtown Area plan identifies several strategies and objectives to serve as a tool to help community leaders, decision makers and citizens build upon downtown's assets and guide future development. The long term vision seeks to achieve a vibrant, economically healthy, growing and vital downtown through a sustained effort in each of these elements.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Prosperous, walkable, diverse. Distinctive and green. The Urban Redevelopment area is located within the cultural core, which is generally defined in the downtown area plan as the area encompassing the convention center. Denver Performing Arts Center, Civic Center Park, Denver Public Library, Denver Art Museum and various municipal and governmental buildings.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'A key recommendation identified in the plan calls for the creation of a mixed use public private development that includes the Emily Griffith Opportunity School and other complementary uses. Though the Opportunity School moved to another location. The Urban Redevelopment Plan is consistent with the recommendation for mixed use development in this area.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The proposed urban redevelopment plan seeks to eliminate blight through the creation of the Emily Griffith Upper Opportunity School Urban Redevelopment Area. Creation of the area authorizes Dora to seek property owner and developer interest in redevelopment projects within the area and provide tax increment financing in support of those efforts.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The main goals of the Urban Redevelopment Plan are to eliminate blight, renew and improve the character of the area, encourage commercial, residential and retail development. Encourage and protect existing development more effectively. Use underutilized land. Encourage land use patterns that result in a more environmentally sustainable city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Encourage land use patterns where pedestrians are safe and welcome. Encourage participation of existing property owners in the redevelopment of their property. Encourage high and moderate density development where appropriate. Encourage the re-use of existing buildings, including historic preservation and adaptive reuse.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And improve. And provide employment centers near transit. This urban redevelopment plan does not include any approved projects. The entire site was purchased by Stonebridge Companies in May of 2017. Stonebridge, who is a hotel developer, is in the process of working with a variety of stakeholders to determine the optimal development plan for this site.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Once this process is complete and to the extent the proposed project is determined to require tax increment assistance, an amendment to this urban redevelopment plan, along with new agreements with the other taxing entities, would be required to add an approved project in order to preserve the opportunity to fully utilized tax increment.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The plan approves the use of sales and property tax increment financing. The plan is presented this evening, approves a property tax increment area and sales tax increment that is coterminous with the urban redevelopment area. So it's really important to note that even though we are asking you to approve the plan and approve the use of tax increment'",
        "'speaker_3': ', we are not authorized to use any tax increment until such time as we would come forward and ask for an amendment to the plan to add an approved project. We are preserving the opportunity to allow for the tax increment to be an available tool.'",

Written notice was mailed first class mail to all property owners, residents and owners of business concerns in the Emily Griffith Opportunity School Urban Redevelopment area at least 30 days prior to this public hearing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'No more than 120 days have passed since the first public hearing before City Council on the plan. Tonight is the first public hearing before Council on this plan. This is the first consideration of an urban redevelopment plan for this site.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And this the city council has not previously failed to approve an urban redevelopment plan for this site. Again, this is the first consideration by City Council of an urban redevelopment plan for this site. And as such, the requirement to wait at least 24 months into any prior public hearing is inapplicable.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Conformance with the Denver Comprehensive Plan on July July 19, 2017, the Denver Planning Board unanimously found that the Urban Redevelopment Plan conforms with the Denver Comprehensive Plan and applicable supplements. A letter to the effect has been submitted as part of the record of this hearing, and Dura would request that City Council concur with that finding.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'And again, while we are not requesting approval of a project tonight, the site is owned by a private entity that intends to redevelop the property once a redevelopment project has been determined.

        "'speaker_3': 'There are two other property taxing districts. Denver Public Schools and Urban Drainage and Flood Control District during has negotiated agreements with both DPS and urban drainage, which allow DAERA to collect any increment in any incremental property taxes generated in the urban redevelopment area, but does not authorize the use of their respective portions of the property tax increment'",
        "'speaker_3': 'on any future project. Similar to the way that we would work with City Council at such time, if ever as a project is identified. These agreements will be renegotiated to reflect the impact the project may have on the their respective ability to deliver services to the urban redevelopment area.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Additionally, if the Urban Redevelopment Plan is not amended to add a project by December 31st of 2020, the agreements terminate and any amount of incremental property taxes collected by DRA would be returned to the original taxing entities.

        "'speaker_3': 'Yes, sir.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. So you made this abundantly clear. But I think it's important for folks who are, you know, at home listening and been following this project that we are simply setting the base for the tax increment financing option, but we are not actually focusing on a project.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That is correct. I just want you to and tell folks what setting the base actually means.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sure. So under urban renewal law, we are able to capture the incremental sales and property taxes that a project area generates in order to provide a mechanism for financing a future project. This is a fairly unique circumstance where the property right now is is tax exempt and is is has been has a taxable assessed value of zero'",
        "'speaker_3': 'because of its previous ownership by Denver Public Schools under the law. There are two times when the assessor looks to determine what the actual taxable value is. One is in late December, the other is August 25th because the purchase transaction occurred in May.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'By taking action tonight, they at the assessor will look back to the value last certified in December of 2016 and find that the value is zero. If we wait until after August, that sale transaction will be recorded against the property and the property will have lost its tax exempt status.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So the value related to the sale will then instead go into the base as opposed to the increment.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's right. All right. Thank you, Joan. Okay. Okay, great. That concludes our questions. Counsel Bill 818 is now closed. Look for comments by members of council. So this is this project is in my district. I have been a part of it from the very beginning, working with stakeholders, working with the Denver Public Schools and historic Denver to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'ensure that the preservation of this building stays intact. Yet revitalization and opportunities are also a part of it. I am in favor of this because I think this is a good, good move for us as a city, and it allows us to move forward with possible plans of expansion of tourism and our downtown revitalization in this part'",
        "'speaker_1': 'of the area. So we want to remind council we get another crack at this when a project is actually before us, a project is not before us. Again, we are just setting the base. We are setting the area.'",

The current level of passengers, along with the projected growth, is straining our existing infrastructure.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'To construct and finance this project, we have chosen to enter into a public private partnership with the Great Hall Partners, an association of three firms bringing equity to this project Ferrovial Saunders and Magic Johnson Enterprises Loop Capital. This team will take full risk to bring the project in on its price and schedule.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'But and let me be very clear the airport still owns and maintains control of the terminal. The Great Hall Partners will bring to us their expertize in running award winning concessions programs, community outreach and training and development. And they will bring $378 million in equity and debt to the deal.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'They will guarantee price and schedule, and for this they will get a license to operate the terminal concessions for 30 years, retaining only 20% of the concessions revenue. The airport will invest $480 million, which is approximately the cost of the non concession construction.'",

        "'speaker_10': 'Significant progress has been made, but we remain concerned with the proposed level six design. We respectfully request that the DEA and United teams continue to work through these significant and outstanding operational concerns. We simply cannot afford months or years of operational disruption for additional construction or projects if the proposed level six design fails.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'While we do not diminish the value of the simulation work that was undertaken, it is virtually impossible to predict real world customer and operational behaviors with complete certainty. So it's best to plan for contingencies. Day's last round of simulations indicate that the current level six design does work.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'However, as we've previously articulated, computer simulations focus on a future single standard day that can rarely capture changes over an extended period of time, let alone anticipate the numerous variables in the highly complex environment of an airport. The simulations for the checkpoint area requires a 28 of the 34 plan lanes and the current design must be open'",

We ask that any cost associated with day two construction to alleviate congestion or additional address additional problems created by the level six design be borne by DIA and their design partners.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Airlines should not have to bear the burden of additional costs to fix the operational deficiencies in for Louisville's Great Hall design. As these issues have been brought to the day's attention in the pre-development stage. Finally, the proposed P3 deal with FERROVIAL requires the airport to maximize the amount of concessions revenue available to Ferrovial.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'To accomplish this, the airport needs to maximize the amount of available space awarded to Ferrovial and the concessions program.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'All the profits will leave our state. Rather than being reinvested in Colorado. And why are we guaranteeing for over a profit? We should be guaranteeing a living wage for the citizens of Denver and affordable housing and affordable health care.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We should never guarantee a profit to a corporation in a commercial venture. We need 100% assurance that the jobs created by this project will pay a living wage. A prevailing wage. Excuse me. Paying less than a living wage means those workers will require city or state services to live in the metro area.'",

Our union reached out many times to engage Ferrovial in a discussion about our members most important concerns. Number one, after being laid off, will displaced workers receive the first right of refusal?'",

Subcontractors respect the decision of a majority of workers on whether or not to unionize. Sadly, over the past year, Ferrovial did not seriously engage with us, let alone come to an agreement on these concerns.'",

        "'speaker_15': 'houses of people trying to become refugees there. And the human rights abuses there have been well documented. So that's something you should consider.

        "'speaker_15': 'So I really think that that that needs to be that needs to be looked at, really. The person who spoke for for me the clearest was former city councilwoman Joyce Prince. Okay. And her comment about how this place is going to be run and who's going to be running it.'",

        "'speaker_10': 'You said that the private partners assume full risk. And I'm wondering if you can explain what you mean by that.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'They assume full risk for price and schedule. So they are giving us a firm fixed fee of $650 million to build the project. And they have a schedule that has us opening the fall of 2021 for completion.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. So and I think at least one of my colleagues will talk a little bit more about this. But the one area that seems to be left open is change directives that that Dan might require of the project.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I understand we have $120 million set aside to cover that. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'That would be for changes that happened in the industry. Ferrovial takes responsibility for opening the ceiling and finding a surprise that's on them. But if something changes in the next couple of years about how you use your phone to process, and that means we need to redesign part of the Great Hall.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We would pay for that out of our contingency, right.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Or any other design changes we want to make along the way. Okay, Mr. De Vere, I have that right. Would you mind? And Mr. President, I've got about 90 questions, but I'll ask three and then give it up, if that's okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes, sir.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Go ahead. Q Thank you. 11,800 jobs. That sounds like an awful lot of jobs from one speaker talked about 500 carpenters jobs, I think. Tell me more how you get to that number.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Councilman. We commission as the electrical contractors, the sheet metal contractors and the mechanical plumbing contractors. Every other year, an economic impact study that I can send you a copy of with Colorado State University. They're the only accredited construction management program in the state.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'They do a research project for us. And this January they conclude or we release the last installment of that for every million dollars you spend in construction. It creates 18 direct jobs. What I didn't quote you was the indirect figure, which brings that closer to like 28.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So if you just take 18 times 650 million, you get to 11,800.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And are we talking a job year, a construction jobs?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So for every six, every million dollars you spend, you create 18 construction jobs. Direct construction jobs. Indirect things would be items like suppliers, downstream partners, other other supporters that feed the industry. I can get you the exact study with all the metrics that are used in order to calculate that, if that would be helpful.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Well, I'm not going to beat this. And I'm just like I said, I'm trying to understand what a job means. You know, as far as is this the length of the project? Is this someone who may show up during the project for a limited period of time?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So there are sometimes in projects like this, there could be upwards of 60 contracts with construction firms. Mechanical and plumbing would be either one, or in this case, it is one. But everybody who hits that job site, the way that the economic multipliers work is it calculates a job is created, eight of them for every million dollars'",
        "'speaker_7': 'you spend. I'll make sure that we get your copy and everybody else on council copy of that as well.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That's okay. I'm guessing after tonight I'm not going to want to read a lot about this project. Thank you, Mr. President. I'll pass the microphone.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman Cashman. Councilman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I've had lots of questions that have been answered, and I appreciate all of the folks who have been involved in getting my questions answered, but some of them have raised additional questions. So let me first start with safety and security.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I asked a question and I got a response back, and I'm not sure it was completely accurate about what our safety or security rating is for the city of Denver's airport in terms of the vulnerability of our airport and.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Not necessarily just related to checkpoint, but in general. Um, and I don't know if this is, what's the word I'm looking for. Maybe protected information, but. So so the question I want to know the answer to my question is, are we at the highest level of the security rating on the scale that is used by federal government'",
        "'speaker_9': 'agencies to rate the security risks of airports around the country?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I'm not aware of any particular rating system that is used that's applied to our airport. What I will tell you is that the TSA every I believe it's three years, does a vulnerability assessment. And the last two or three of them, they have pointed out that our Great Hall is indeed a vulnerability that we need to address'",
        "'speaker_12': '. Not sure that directly answers your question.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yeah, I'm just trying to figure out where we are on that scale, because I understand there is a a rating, if you will. And so that's why I'm asking the question.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And none of us here at the from the airport are aware of a rating scale for the airports.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. Well, let me go on with my next question. So it sounds like the issues have not been completely resolved between the CIA and the airlines in terms of concerns about throughput traffic on level six and how those will be resolved.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Is that accurate? And it sounds like there are still ongoing conversations.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I'll let Mr. Malloy come up and tell you from the united side of things. But I think we've worked really hard the last couple of weeks. I think they're planning team agrees that the simulation showed that it all works.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'What we are focusing on now is if it shouldn't work and let's just say things change, right? There are there are other aspects that could happen in the next couple of years that we have not anticipated. We are looking at what we are jointly calling relief valves, ways that we could add even more capacity.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'But I think it might be good for you to hear directly from United on this.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That would be helpful. And in the meantime, it's my understanding, if you would just please come to the microphone that the. What I heard pretty loud and clear was that the open TSA lanes that are managed by non airline or airport employees are federal government employees would require 28 of those lanes to be open and staffed.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So if you can help address where we're at in the process and whether those issues have fully been resolved or are there still ongoing conversations with DIA about addressing the concerns that were, I think, pretty eloquently expressed when we had our committee meeting about.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Backup and co-mingling of TSA check in traffic along with passenger ticketing and baggage check in traffic that would be all located on level six.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So to answer your first question, conversations are ongoing. I think we've been encouraged by those conversations in the last couple of weeks. We do have an ideological disagreement about when you pull the relief valves. We would like to see those valves incorporated into the Great Hall Construction Program so that we don't have a situation that the design'",
        "'speaker_8': 'fails. We'd prefer for those relief valves to be built now so that if something does happen, they're ready to go. And we don't have congestion. We have a genuine operational concern here. We want to make sure our customers can get through the airport efficiently.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Your question, in terms of TSA, the simulation study does say that with 28 lanes of the 34 lanes, that the queuing should not back out into the lobby. That's only six lanes that can be unstaffed by TSA. And we have seen through our implementation of checkpoint projects throughout the country, that's pretty aggressive staffing by TSA.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So we remain pretty concerned. I know the the airport feels pretty convinced that we can work with TSA and solve that problem. We have not seen that in reality in other airports.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So can you and Kimmel ask you the same question? Help address what we see as normal staffing levels today? Are we are we operating at 100% or are we at 80% with TSA lines open?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So it varies. Every day we review the schedule of the day with TSA as to the ebbs and flows of traffic, and so they attempt to staff it as best they can in terms of using their resources. I think they do a fairly good job.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We have had amazing growth in the last year and we have had occasions here recently where we have been beyond the queue. But it is not because they're not staffing lanes, it's because currently we don't have enough capacity for this growth that we are seeing.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I'll also just to comment as as Mr. Malloy said, we do think the TSA is going to want to staff this facility. This is their new prototype that we have an IMU with them. They are working with us on the design and developing this new concept for screening, and it is in their best interest to make sure'",
        "'speaker_12': 'that this doesn't fail. So I think they have a an unusual commitment to staff this airport that they may not have in others that are in the United System.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And Kim, just from having the opportunity to travel and review the technology that we're going to be utilizing it, it is very apparent that that would assist with the traffic throughput, but it's still contingent on how many lanes we have open.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Correct?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Absolutely, yes. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Mr. President, I do have other questions. I know you've got people in the queue. If you could just put me back in. I'll come back later with some of the other questions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Councilwoman Ortega. Councilman, New.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'York, you. Let's just talk about the project review process. Can you describe how the proposed projects are going to be reviewed on an ongoing basis and reviewing the cost and the schedule and the quality of construction?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Certainly. Well, we are at 30% design right now. So with with the optimism that this will be approved tonight, we will take that 30% to 100% between now and next summer, working very hard with our our partners here.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Once we begin construction, then things change a little bit. Gisela has a third party who relates who directly reports to her, who will be overseeing the construction in terms of change orders and anything financial. On a regular basis, they'll be doing that oversight.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We will also have an executive committee that will have representatives from this body, as well as representatives from the mayor's office and other city agencies that will be briefed on a regular basis on the process, both in terms of the construction and the cost.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'You also know we have an elected auditor that has the responsibility of making sure that everything we do at the airport is done in a legal and efficient manner. And I am assuming that Auditor O'Brien will periodically put this project on the list of things to audit.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So there will be that outside audit as well. I'd also say because of the structure of a P3, there is additional oversight from the investors on the Ferrovial side who are very concerned about the investment and making sure there's a return so that there's that level of oversight.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And then additionally, all the bondholders put yet another level of oversight. So there are a number of layers that will be looking at this project for the next 34 years.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And I should say the Finance Department will be involved with that review process as well as the auditor. You know, they own their they on your review committee are the guys learned and the individual the structure of the project manager is going to be part of that with the finance department.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Yes. The Brendan Hanlon, our CFO, is actually a member of the executive committee.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And the person in Portuguese. Is that more of a project manager person that will he actually this person be going to the site or is it really more of a financial individual is looking at the financial details review.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'It's more from the financial part perspective.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Well, there'll be a person, a project manager that will be looking at the construction as it goes along and working with partners and and everybody. That gives you reports about construction progress. And.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'You know, Stu Williams, well, he will be living and breathing this job 24 seven.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'One of the things that's been very effective with the National Western Center is is Kelly and his staff coming and giving quarterly reviews to our city council committee. And I just want to know, would you be willing to do that for our Business Development Committee to just brief the city council so that all council members can, you'",
        "'speaker_13': 'know, get an opportunity to to listen to how that things are progressing during the construction period.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We'd be delighted to do that.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Be great. Thank you. Now, my colleague brought up change directors, you know, being a cause that, you know, the city may occur if it happens, if you start getting into the 100 million, $120 million contingency, is a red flag going to go off or what's going to happen with them?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'When you start thinking about when you start getting into that contingency, especially if you if you if a if some major design situation occurs where you may even exceed that 120 million, that's the you know, we want to safeguard that.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'How do how do you plan on monitoring that?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Well, first off, we are going to be very transparent about any use of the contingency. Let me start there. If we were to exceed it, we would actually have to come back to this body and get an amendment to the contract, because the contract has a maximum amount that we can spend.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'But yes, we are going to be monitoring it closely. I think these are not going to be little teeny things that add up. This contingency will be used for large issues that we have to deal with large industry issues.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So they will be very obvious and transparent to all of you.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Okay. Ask very good question about the concession agreement. You know, if if Ferrovial decides that it's not working out for them, do they have the right to transfer this agreement or or move this agreement to a third party outside of this?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Or do they have the right to discontinue as a company and allow the rights for concession management to a third party?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I'm going to ask City Attorney Dan Reamer to answer that one, if I might. Counsel.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Good evening, Dan Ramer, City Attorney's Office. The short answer to the question is that the the developer's ability to transfer control and equity investment in the project is quite limited. There are two specific time periods. One is between the effective date and two years.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'So within the first two years of the development agreement, the ability to change and change control is subject to the city's essentially sole discretion. And after that two year period, it is up to the city's reasonable discretion. And there are conditions that have to be satisfied, such that the the substitute entity is equal or better capable to'",
        "'speaker_14': 'perform the services of the development agreement.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Now, you know, we're not talking about construction. I'm talking about the concession agreement. That's what you're talking about, right?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Okay. This concession group and with city council being involved with that process of approving that change of responsibility.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'It would not technically be an amendment to the development agreement because that power is conferred upon the city in the authority that the council would be granting this evening. So it would not require that the airport come back to the city council for that change in control.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Would that be brought to a city council committee at least for discussion? So the city council would be apprized of that before it occurs?'",
        "'speaker_14': 'I am I am sure that it would in the ordinary course, but if you asked the CEO, I'm sure she would agree, just as she did a moment ago, to bring it to you, regardless of whether or not it would be standard.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'I think that's comforting. Last question for Gisela one. This I appreciate so much the last three weeks providing financial information to me to understand the deal, and I think it's a very attractive arrangement. So I appreciate stuff. Just a real simple question.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'I know the answer to this and I trust you explicitly. I just want to make sure that all the cost information that you've given us is accurate. And then in all the 15,000 pages of addendum or appendices, there's nothing in there.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'There's a hidden costs. It's going to come out all of a sudden later on down the road that's going to exceed the cost of this contract. That 1.8 is a good number, billion dollar number for our project, right?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's correct, Councilman. All of that is contained in the development agreement. And in that 1.8 billion other than the airports financing costs that we've discussed. But yes, nothing else in the 15,000 pages.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Brown.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. Thank you, Councilman. New council mechanics.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you very much. I so appreciate the responsiveness that Kim, your team has had very, very responsive and prompt. So my question I think for is for you in the discussions you've had with the airports, airlines so far, have you agreed to any changes in the construction projects that differ from the plans to date or whatever it'",
        "'speaker_3': 'is that's being considered tonight?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Not at this point, no.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. And do you have any sense or can you estimate for me what the potential total risk is? So there's things they may want that are not even on the table. And then there's a range of things that, you know, that you all might be discussing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I guess what I want to get at is what is the maximum risk for cost changes related to the negotiations that are going to continue after this contract is approved.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So I wish I could give you a number. We are not there. I will just tell you generally what we are talking about. We're talking about extending the baggage system to level one are the hotel and transit center so that they could possibly have a group check in at that level.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We are talking about the possibility of locating some additional ticket counters on level four of the HTC served by that same baggage system that I just described. That would require some modification to level four, which right now is is empty, as well as an escalator that would come up from the from the level one up to level'",
        "'speaker_12': 'four and then also an escalator that would then get you up to level five. We're also talking about something that we refer to as modern zero. If you could imagine the area on both, you could do it on both east and west side, just to the north of the end of the ticket lobby that, you know, today'",
        "'speaker_12': 'we could add on in that area there. We could add not just ticket lobby space, but we could potentially add the level below so that we could add more bag claim space. All of those are just conceptual ways we might expand, and we are truly just doing, you know, freehand drawings at this point.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And over the next few weeks, what we hope to do with the United is to refine them more and get to the point where we actually have costs, but we don't today. I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. And then this may be a question for Diane, but I want to understand, if we assume that some or all of these changes get made, are these all eligible for and with the costs come from the contingency, considering the fact that none of the costs would be known until after this contract were executed.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So to be.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Clear, owner changes are changes in scope.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'They are not unforeseen circumstances. They are decisions made by the owner to change the scope of the project. The kinds of things that Kim just described could be added to the developer's scope or could be treated as entirely separate projects.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'It depends upon when the triggering event might be. If it's within the four year construction period, they may be owner changes and the airport may call upon the contingency in order to fund them. If they are simply plans that are that are developed and then put on a shelf that could be procured as an entirely separate construction'",
        "'speaker_14': 'project due to be resurrected when they may be needed. Five years, ten years, 15 years from now.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Thank you for that information. A different set of questions. And this is one that I guess is a little less technical and a little more philosophical, because one of the fundamental questions we are grappling with is the role of the public sector and the role of private sector.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So Kim, I guess I'd like to start with you and then I'll follow up with the similar questions for Ferrovial. But, you know, this is don't I don't expect you have a real number, but how many outside stakeholders would you say that you know, that you have met with throughout this process, as in people who are not'",
        "'speaker_3': 'part of the airport or the city family, but external stakeholders. People with an interest. People with an opinion.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'From the public.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Well, I. Stacey is here somewhere. She might be able to tell me how many public presentations we have given. It's. Maybe 30 public presentations.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm thinking more about meetings where you've really met with groups, whether it be CAF or whether it be contractor associations, folks who've said to you, I have an idea, I have a concern, I want to sit down and talk.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And it may not be you personally if there's someone else. George I don't know if that falls more under your team, but I just trying to get a sense of how the airport as an entity operates as it relates to stakeholders.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So I would say both ourselves and Ferrovial, independently and sometimes together have met with multiple groups, whether they are formal or informal groups here in Denver. You heard earlier this evening from CAF, we have met with CAF. You've heard from a number of a number of groups who have special interests that we have met with.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We have tried to touch anyone we could. I would say that I don't know how to quantify it, but we have tried and tried very, very hard to do broad outreach. And do you want knowledge or do you want to say anything?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I want to just follow up with you first. Okay. So would it be safe to say that in some of those meetings you've heard ideas that you didn't agree with or met with groups who have publicly criticized the airport?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I think that's fair to say.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I guess this you know, again, I'm just trying to get a sense of our role as a public entity. Why do you keep meeting with folks who might criticize you or who have ideas you don't agree with?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So I think it's fair to say we also hear ideas we do agree with. So it's not all negative. And I think that's really important. And even if we don't agree, I think it's very important that the public understand why we're trying to do this.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We are a public agency. We are your airport. We are everyone's airport. And while we're not going to get everybody on board, we certainly like to take the time to explain why we're doing it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Thank you. So I will now ask some similar questions to Rovio. And then after this set of questions, Mr. President, I, too, will see and let someone else take a turn. But so you heard our airport director talk a little bit.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So is it your sense that if you all are awarded this contract, that you will be stepping into the role of, in some ways serving as a liaison or representative of a public airport, that you will be no longer just a private company, but you'll be doing something in the public sphere.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is that with that? Would you agree with that statement or.'",
        "'speaker_16': 'Every every public and private transaction that we carry out, we always take into account that fact that we will be working in an asset that is heavily exposed to the public sector, to the public service. So we are totally aware of that and have a long experience providing services to the public in the context of our concessions'",
        "'speaker_16': ', lease leases and privatizations.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So you you know, we had a mr. de Villa and a couple of others mentioned how very many meetings they had with you. Did they share some ideas with you that you maybe didn't agree with or that you weren't quite able to act on, but you kept meeting with them and found other things to talk about?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Would that be?'",
        "'speaker_16': 'We have held many meetings with different stakeholders in the community with respect to construction, development, concession management and training centers. And we have found many ideas very interested or that can be accomplished. And developing this project or their ideas perhaps are less interesting or cannot be achieved in the context of this project.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There's one particular community organization that has tried to meet with you and, you know, had one meeting and was told that you wouldn't meet with them any more. And that is you might hear the representative of the service workers, which is different than the construction workers.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I would like to hear your explanation as to why you didn't feel that you had an obligation to continue to meet with them.'",
        "'speaker_16': 'Yes, we we have held at least three meetings and a number of conferences, a number of telephone conversations without a specific association. And what I would like to confirm is that Rubiales, a company that guarantees the rights of employees, is an employee of Ferrovial.'",
        "'speaker_16': 'I have the right to strike the freedom of association, collective bargaining, having the right to collective bargaining through representatives of employees or unions. I have access to prevailing wage framework agreements we consider trade unions as our partners. We have signed agreements with more than with more than 350 unions representing more than 12 million members, including 35 countries'",
        "'speaker_16': '. So we are a friendly company with respect to unions. What has happened with this company is that the approach of this association was a good result into removing the right of choice of the union that would represent the future employees of the concessions in the Great Hall.'",
        "'speaker_16': 'And that's something that we will not be sympathetic or could agree with.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So there was something you couldn't agree on. Did they ask to continue to talk and meet again?'",
        "'speaker_16': 'Excuse me?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Did they ask to continue to meet and talk? Have they asked for meetings that with you?'",
        "'speaker_16': 'After the three meetings that we held and that meeting at Boeing that we could then. Except with decided to stop having more conversations, especially taking into account the aggressive approach of that association against the company they represent.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is there any other community organization or business that you've refused to meet with?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'No, no, no.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Just one representing workers?'",
        "'speaker_16': 'That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The community for airport fairness. Have you met with that organization? Sorry. The Committee for Airport Fairness. Have you met with with that organization? It's it's a group of folks interested in contracting and other.'",
        "'speaker_16': 'I think we held a meeting with then. I was not there personally.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes, that's correct. Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_16': 'Sir.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilwoman Cami. Is that okay? My screen is open. Councilman Espinosa sort of along that line, Tom Allen and any of the other union people that spoke. Could you.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Come up?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Are you all familiar with the Unite Here 23 group? And their requests for worker retention provisions.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'No. We're now more in the construction industry and those are collective bargaining.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'When you speak into the mic, please, whoever speaking. Councilman, identify yourself.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I'm Ralph Llewellyn with the National Electrical Contractors Association. And we hold the bargaining rights for our electrical contractors who sign letters of assent to our agreements. I'm not familiar with that organization that you mentioned. Our main focus is with the IBEW electricians.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Do you feel that workers that have that have worked at DIA and made it successful? I mean, you one of you cited its rankings and it's currently very well ranked in the world and in the nation. Do you feel that there should have been worker retention provisions in the contract for people that are currently employed out in'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the airport?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I have to say I'm not that familiar with the demands of the players in that group. So I. I really have no comment on that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Go ahead, sir.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Sure.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Councilman Espinosa. Council. Mr. President. So, actually, I met Dave, DVR, contractor, exec and myself. Got to meet early on with representatives from Saunders and Ferrovial. And before I did that, I knew I had this meeting coming on and I did talk to Unite here.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I talk with Kevin. I talked with the president of the Denver Area Labor Federation, Josh Downey, and told them I was going to have a meeting with Rossville and Saunders and ask them if they're just exactly what their what the problem was.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If there was an issue there so that I would I would send them I would carry the message for them. When we met and I did that, I said, well, what I was told was that they were the they being the unite here their main their to me they only had two main issues then.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'One was that they is that they would not be interfered with if they tried to organize the workers in the new shops. And the other was that the workers would have jobs still, so they wouldn't lose their job if they if their shop moved out of the terminal to above or moved out to somewhere else in the'",
        "'speaker_6': 'airport. And I carried that message to Ferrovial and to Saunders. And what they told me was that they would not stand in the way of the workers if they wanted to organize. They wouldn't, they wouldn't. They would stay neutral.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They wouldn't get involved in that. And they any of the people that were union out there now would still be union. If they wanted to be in the union, they would not interfere with those guys. I what I understood the main crux was the, the shops that were going to be built that weren't built yet.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There was some disagreement over whether they would require them to be union or not. I think that was what at least what I understood was the crux of the conversation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I appreciate, you know, sort of putting you on the spot. But, you know, as somebody who's, you know, an architect by trade, I'm not a you know, I.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Wish architects had.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'A union. Right, because we worked long, long hours for lower wages despite what everyone thinks or what you see in the movies. The the so I'm trying to figure out how we got to a situation where there's union support on the labor, the on the construction labor side, but actual organized employees or, you know, struggling with this'",
        "'speaker_1': 'this with these terms or getting terms. So I appreciate the background. I probably still don't understand it the way I do. I'll probably ask Kevin later to sort of come up and collaborate.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I think there was an agreement with the hotel out there that they wanted to model agreement with for political reasons, as I understand. But I don't really understand all of that. I know the issues. That's what I was told.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So yeah, but there is no sort of blanket brotherhood across unions to say.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Look, we're.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Labor is labor.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We know that we're in the construction phase of it. Certainly we I would like to see everybody via the union. I would like see everybody, even if they're not in the union, have good wages and fair pensions, health care.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Those are things that we should all have as people here in this great country, in our great city. It makes our it makes our city better. It makes our communities better when we have those sorts of things. So I don't think that I think from what my perspective was, this was a contractor that was going to offer'",
        "'speaker_6': 'those types of jobs for the construction industry. And I think that's great.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Well, some of that I right. I respect it. I mean, I understand that significant portion of the responsibility actually falls on us. We could have we could have as council sort of made provisions of that, that they would have to sort of incorporate into their agreements.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we didn't do that. So now we're in a situation.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Where we're looking.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'For voluntary compliance. So I mean, our inclusion into their their agreement. So thank you all very much. Sorry to put you all in the spotlight.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Anyone anyone else have something to say?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'A quick comment. Councilman Espinosa. Yeah. As a as a union, we do support dignity for all workers. We support that. And we'll fight for that. I will state that, you know, all of our construction trades issues have not been addressed as of yet.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And still, you know, we're looking to all on the apprenticeship language as well, which is being talked about, concerned about timeliness of that. But as far as unite here, we haven't met with them, but certainly we support their them and their workers in their fight for dignity.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Great. Thank you very much. So. Sure.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I am here representing small businesses. I'm also an electrical contractor. Electrical contractors or small businesses usually are not union members. So. I guess that the city of Denver is kind of like to try to accomplish a perfect balance to give opportunities to small businesses and big businesses and working together.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I ask for the consideration of this job not to be closed just to union members, because that will take a big chunk of the small business community.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Out of the participation of this job. Thank you. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So to Ferrovial, did you. Did you at some point do an analysis and have some sort of understanding of the economic impact if you had made sort of any sort of concessions or labor agreements.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Of some sort?'",
        "'speaker_16': 'Council Member Yes, we analyzed the proposal made by Unite here. You know, to understand the terms and conditions that they were proposing. And the first point that I would like to clarify for the benefit of everyone is that our great hall partners will not be the employer of any of the workers that will be working, hopefully, if'",
        "'speaker_16': 'this project is approved in the future. Concessionaires of the Great Hall. We are not that we are not going to be a master concessionaire. We are just developing procurement. Those units and the future concessionaires will have to hire to recruit those employees.'",
        "'speaker_16': 'What we have always stated from the very beginning, more than a year ago, we proposed creating a training center for those future employees of the concessionaires in order to help in the development. And we even committed ourselves to injecting money on day one.'",
        "'speaker_16': 'And I'm sure you will have seen in the financial model money contributions on an annual basis in order to foster the development of those future employees of the concessionaire. So we are very well aware that having those employees being developed, been retained that can develop an excellent career in those units is critical for the community.'",
        "'speaker_16': 'But what we cannot do, what we cannot accept is signing on behalf of those future concessionaire exclusivity agreements, to have those employees of the concessionaires being represented by one trade union, because that would neglect the right of those employees to decide who is the right representative of those employees.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So do you have.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That number on what you thought.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It would, the economic consequence it would be to this agreement?'",
        "'speaker_16': 'We don't have I couldn't estimate the number to the economic standpoint of that agreement and.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I'll finish this line of questioning and I'll see.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I had other topics, but.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So you did the grant, the analysis in the green. So where I struggle with that, having read the entirety of the contract not I will admit to not in all the appendices is that there are that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You there are a.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Lot of.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Provisions that you are requirements that you are obligating any of your concessionaires to adhere to through the terms of the contract that are flow that are, you know, carried out. I mean, carry.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Through pass through from.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'From Denver to your.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Concessionaires.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Writing additional provisions is not prohibited.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So long as they don't they don't.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Jack mean they're not illegal. So there certainly would have been the capacity whether, you know, it's not something it is. I want to stress that it is your choice to not have.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That is not.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There's nothing that we're.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Doing that's preventing you from from making those requirements of your concessionaires. You simply do not want to put.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Those sort of requirements on your concessionaires. That is correct. Correct.'",
        "'speaker_16': 'You understand that we we must keep the right of choice, of the right of the representatives that the future employees of those concessionaires want to want to have.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Thank you. Councilman Espinosa. Councilor Lopez.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yeah, thank you. I wanted to continue the line of questioning with with Labor and in particular with the conversations with the concession workers and well, I guess the know here and not sure if they will be I mean drivers at all.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I guess so. I want to come back to this. The the situation where you said you've met with the folks from Unite here. How many times?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes, we we.'",
        "'speaker_16': 'Had a very long conference call with then in order to understand their approach with a representative from the East Coast. That was a very long meeting in order to understand what they were proposing. I had a physical meeting in in the Westin Hotel at the airport with three representatives from Unite here.'",
        "'speaker_16': 'And after that meeting, I had a very long conversation again in order to provide feedback about that meeting.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Now, do you. Were there any kind of middle ground that was achieved? Was there any kind of I don't want to say this is believed to be redundant, but was there any kind of concession made or any kind of middle ground achieved?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I mean, it seems like there's been ongoing conversations. Has there been any proposal?'",
        "'speaker_16': 'Basically, we council member. We received an email you. From Unite here. What we were told was that if we were going to if we could accept that you. Completely that John would support from really in this process. There were a number of clauses in that MRU that I don't understand if could be cited through negotiation or not'",
        "'speaker_16': '. That's that's something that we don't that we've been approached that would not be acceptable, especially neglecting the rights of the future employees of those concessionaires to decide who is the right representatives of those employees.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Now I understand that ask for unique exclusivity. I want to get away from union exclusivity. And, you know, I don't want to it's a slippery slope. And when it starts using language that third parties, workers in the union, I don't like that.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I think it's. You mean we don't throw our third party ourselves as folks in the United States? Right. As one union. And I want to in unison and I want to focus on that word, but I. I mean.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Were there any counter offers or proposals? It was. I mean, we understand that retention is an issue. We understand that that wages are an issue. Have there been anything any commitments to those issues? Not necessarily to to an organization.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But to have those issues out there that they are bringing up. Right. And what are those what are those proposals or what are those counter ideas or offers?'",
        "'speaker_16': 'We we understand with respect to jobs that the issue that the concessionaires are going to have in the Great Hall Project is to attract and retain talent, as far as we know. In the airport, there are more than 400 job opportunities available.'",
        "'speaker_16': 'So we all understand that the problem is going to be job destruction. There is going to be job retention and attraction. That's why we are focusing all our attention, commitment and investment in developing that training center. That is an obligation for our team according to the development agreement that you will have seen.'",
        "'speaker_16': 'With respect to your second question. Could you please repeat your point?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Councilmember Yeah, I'm wondering since in talking about the issues of retention and talking about the issues or mostly job retention, then and then, you know, the living wage piece, right? Aside from exclusivity with a union? Yes. Right. Have there been any commitments to meet those two concerns?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Right. And what commitments are those are those written commitments? Is there something in writing that says that this is something that you will honor? Right.'",
        "'speaker_16': 'But prevailing wage obligations are included in the development agreement. As you know, council member. So that's an obligation that our thing will have to comply. That's an obligation that we are used to complying in every year where we work.'",
        "'speaker_16': 'As I was explaining to Council member Kanis before.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And that that applies to the concession workers.'",
        "'speaker_16': 'As far as I understand those, cos those workers are workers of the concessionaires and they will have to deal with their employees the kind of salaries that they will have.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Access to and as those jobs are coming up. The retention issue. Is there a commitment of ferrovial or operators to those employees to keep them? To give the first right of refusal, what they brought up is their commitment.'",
        "'speaker_16': 'We have a commitment to make interviews, at least three interviews. That is going to be done by the future concessionaires to those persons that have lost their jobs because of this project.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'What would be in a circumstance where they would not be employed anymore? Like you said, it's three interviews. Is is there something that would prevent them from gaining employment if they've been working at a concession in the airport for a long time?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And let's say that the concept changes or whatever. Is there anything that would prevent them from getting that?'",
        "'speaker_16': 'As far as I understand, the issue in the airport is retaining. So having an employee that is available to be recruited, that has experience working in the airport, that has been but not not getting a job when there are now more than 400 job job back answers.'",
        "'speaker_16': 'And we are going to develop through the future concessionaires on 800 positions. I think that is a very unlikely scenario, taking into account the skills of that worker that has been there for ten years. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I understand. I just. And, Mr. President, if you look. I understand that. I just want to make sure that that that that that that employee that worker knows that because, yes, there they're going to be 400 jobs. As you guys are talking about.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'There will be 400 jobs. Like, hey, man, there's there's a bunch of jobs for you to choose from. Don't worry about it. But that doesn't necessarily get the guarantee then the first right of refusal. Is there any been any kind of agreement that addresses the first right of refusal?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Right. Aside from the three interviews.'",
        "'speaker_16': 'There are no more counter guarantees in the development agreement on their behalf.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. Thank you. Thank thank you so much. And, Mr. President, if I just have one more on another topic, that's fine. This has to do with contracting with mwb and also well, in this case, activity. Right. The program and I don't know who's most appropriate to answer this question, but 34 years, right.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We we all talk about, you know, 34 years. I think, you know, my daughter's ten now. She'll be 44 when this when we have a next the next crack of this. In those 34 years as minorities and as women, we would hope that, well, as the population grows.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We would hope that the the number of entrepreneurs that are women and minorities also grow. What are we doing to make sure in that 34 years that where we're at right now, that that number, whatever it is, 33%, whatever percentage that that number doesn't stay flat.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Those 33, those 34 years that it grows with that. And what are the determining factors and what's the commitment from the airport and ferrovial, I guess, with this with this contract to ensure that that stays in pace with population changes and growth.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'So Councilman, to answer, I just want to separate the maybe be ordinance from the act.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And that's why you asked it in both the MWB and then KDB program.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'So that the maybe ordinance clearly applies to the design and construction, the four year design and construction phase, the $650 million project that the CEO described before goals have been established 33% for design, 18% for construction put forward by the Office of Economic Development and presented by the Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'So those goals apply to the design and construction phase of the project as KDB, the AC, KDB, the Airport Concession Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Program, which is a mandate of the Department of Transportation. That is what will control active participation in the concession program going forward during the 30 year operating period.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'That goal has been established within the development agreement at 26%.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So would you say that the feds control that? We don't we don't determine that.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'That the number is a locally derived number based on disparity and other factors. The program itself is overseen by the Department of Transportation in the Federal Aviation Administration. So that goal has been set at 26%, but that goal will be revisited.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'So what I'm trying to get at is the answer to your question with respect to KDB. The goal will be revisited during the operating period and we've set that that period at ten years to correspond to the likely length of the individual concession agreements.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'The contract requires that concession agreements be no longer than ten years. And so we've set ten years. So the AC DB goal will be revisited during the operating period.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. I appreciate that. And, you know, council president, my concern with this questioning is that it would I'd be hopeful in 34 years that there is no more disparity to have to argue about. But as you've seen and the disparity continues and I don't want to pretend like there wouldn't be disparity in 34 years.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Right. It hasn't gone away recently. And I don't want to I want to make sure that we keep that in mind. So that's an important value of the city in this council. And I want to make sure that that's reflected in every movement that we do in this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Thank you, Councilman. You're getting in the comments there. All right, Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I don't see the fellows here from. Ask me, are they is anyone still here? That was Nick Hostetler. Okay. He had made a statement that I maybe I wanted to make sure I understood it correctly, but he seemed to indicate that there were city jobs that were in jeopardy.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'He left. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah. There's Kim. You don't know what that was about, do you? I can't imagine that we would be reducing the number of city jobs on this.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'No, not to my knowledge. Is there any discussion around that?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. And Mr. Jack Quinn from United might be able to answer this along with Kim. In your talks, you've made some progress. But if we vote on this tonight, the agreement is is approved. And what I'm wondering is, do you see is there room within this agreement after it's approved, assuming it is for you to conclude'",
        "'speaker_6': 'what the matters that you are after? Within the framework of that agreement. Once it's at once it's approved, because once it's done, we live by those rules.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'This.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So to make sure that I answer your question properly, just to restate what you said. Are we comfortable that if approved tonight, that there's enough within the existing format to be able to affect the change?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes, of course. I wanted to reach to reach a satisfactory conclusion to your issues.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Yeah. Actually, Gavin would probably be better for that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think the short answer is it will require change orders. If we were to implement any of the levers we have identified, they are not in scope of the current contract and I know that they could be treated as a different project, but at the end of the day, there's one payer for that and that's the airline'",
        "'speaker_8': 'community. So it will cost more money to implement any of the changes that we've suggested.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Kim, would you agree with that?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'If. If we were. If we get to the point that we believe we need to implement them. Now, that would be true, I think, though. Well, let's start with we're still working. We're still trying to define them. Number two, the question is, do they need to be built now or not?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I think we as the airport have a great deal of faith in the work that we've done with the planners in the simulation that we can't see today, investing millions of dollars into something as a relief valve when when we don't see a need for it.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Right. We also because this project is being done in phases. The ticket lobby will be up and running while we're building the the checkpoints. So I think we feel there is a period down the road where we can evaluate this and see how it's all working.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So I would say to you in our mind, it's not something we would do to modify the contract today. More likely, if a few years from now we decide we need to do it, they would be standalone projects if indeed they're done.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. And I think what I'm hearing is there's a couple of ways to do that. We could do it as a separate project. We could do it as change ordering through the through this contract. But either way, approving this tonight doesn't stand in the way of resolving these talks.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'It does not. And I'll just remind everyone, you know, United is our major carrier. We know they're our future. We know they're growing here. We want it to work and to succeed with them. So we're not fighting that.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We don't want United to be successful and grow and have the the space that they need. We just don't agree on how this plan impacts them right now. But we will do everything we can to make sure united to successful here.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Thank you. Kim, on the in the concessions development and the management program, there is a every two year review of market trends and ability for ferrovial to modify the direction it's going in consultation with with us as the owners.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I correct.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So. So in approving something that will be in place for 30 years of the of the on M period does not mean that whatever is there on day one is there on year 30. In fact, would probably be highly unlikely that it would.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Absolutely. And we are sharing the benefit of the revenue. So both parties have incentive to work to continually improve what we have there in the Great Hall.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Mm hmm. And could you describe briefly, just briefly, the recourses that the city has for nonperformance or, you know, for. My understanding is there are penalties for nonperformance. And remarkably, in my view, there's no bonuses for for better performance.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm reminded that you might have negotiated that.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'So to take the last part of your question first, with respect to bonuses, there is only one bonus, early bonus, which is early completion of the TSA security screening checkpoint. That is the only financial bonus with respect to payment deductions.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'There is a scheme in place where if the developer fails to perform in the manner that's prescribed in the development agreement, then there will be payment deductions made against their supplemental payments. So they they do have to perform.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'There has been some confusion about the guarantee of their profit. It is not guaranteed in the sense that if they fail to deliver and make the project available according to their standards, they will not achieve that anticipated rate of return.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Right. And just one word of advice. I won't use the word scheme when talking about this. Kevin Abels calculation. I've I've met with you several times. I've also met with the concessionaires in the airport. I'm having trouble understanding.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I keep hearing that the principal problem with the concession operations is keeping people there in the first place. And the concessionaires are telling me that they can pretty much guarantee that workers will be displaced and terminal will be able to be positioned elsewhere.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And if it's not on the airside, if that person can't get an airside badge for some reason that most concessionaires have operations in town and would be able to place them in town. Do you have any notion of how many workers you think unite here?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Things might not be placed.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well, I mean, this the renovations in the very terminal will impact between two and 300 existing workers. Mm hmm. Whether or not they are placed or not is now, you know, totally at the hands of chance. The agreements that we've come to with other, more responsible airport companies like the Westin and midfield create a pipeline and a'",
        "'speaker_8': 'system for people to land in a job that they're qualified for that that simply will not exist in the Great Hall Project, unfortunately.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Thank you. That's all for now.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilman Flynn. Councilman Black.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I have three questions, but I'm going to add one for a fourth to follow up on Councilman Flynn's last question. Can someone from the airport comment on what Kevin said about there not being a pipeline?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Because I thought there was a direct pipeline to provide jobs for the displaced workers.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'For.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. I'm George Merritt with Airport Government Affairs. So we spent last fall working with our concessions association and to look at the number of employees in the Great Hall and working with them. What we found is that most of the concessions there were part of an ownership group that were ready and willing to bring those'",
        "'speaker_10': 'workers out onto the concourses, or, as Councilman Flynn said, moving downtown. And for those that were not part of the of that of an ownership group, we even instituted programs at the airport specifically with those people in mind.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So we created that website that all of you have seen a job website at the airport to bring people out there. And then again, our concessions association is eager to talk about. There are 400 vacant jobs ready for people to fill at any given moment.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So I think it's fair to say that our concessions association has embraced this challenge to make sure that the people that want to work at the airport, particularly those that are badged, are valuable commodities and we want to keep them out there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And number two.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That? No, that one didn't count. Okay, one. I know I've heard about three different opportunities for professional development, the Great Hall Academy, which is in cooperation with Metropolitan State University and Emily Griffiths Technical College, and then apprenticeship programs.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then also about an engineering apprenticeship program with the Colorado School of Mines. So is there someone who can just talk about some of those professional development opportunities?'",
        "'speaker_16': 'Council member and I can talk with respect to the Great Hall Partners Training Center. That's a. And a training center that will be developed, by the way, told partners that that that activity has been included in the development agreement.'",
        "'speaker_16': 'As part of the document that was referring, Councilmember Flynn of the Council of the Concessions Development Management Program. So that's an obligation on our site, although was something that we already proposed one year ago as part of our proposal, our bid to the airport of our to Denver International Airport, that training center.'",
        "'speaker_16': 'I would say that if this project is approved is a reality. There is a budget already allocated. We are committing $100,000 on day one and 50% of the marketing fund to that training center. We have the tools and the partners, the tools we have been working.'",
        "'speaker_16': 'Without different associations, the concession associations and the existing concession as the airport, in order to identify the right framework and the right needs to recognize that training the standpoint of the future employees of the concessionaires. And secondly, we also have the tools with respect to the partners.'",
        "'speaker_16': 'We have been working with Metro State University, with Emily Griffith Foundation and with the community college in order to have the right partners that can help us put in a facility standpoint, logistics and also to put the courses together.'",
        "'speaker_16': 'We have also had discussions with the airport in order to have venues available in the airport, in order to get the most efficient training and avoid that the concessionaire employees can use, that time can waste time going from one place to the other for training purposes.'",
        "'speaker_16': 'We think that we can develop these 14 years ago. We start something similar like pivotal right now that Heathrow Academy has been able to put into work more than 30, more than 3200 employees because of our efforts putting that together.'",
        "'speaker_16': 'We also have an internal university call for our university that has a massive institute and developing this training center. So with the right partners, with the right assessment and with the Budget Committee, that we think that this can be a reality if these facilities of.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Is there someone who can comment on those other. Apprenticeship and car. School of mines.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think I think Howard talked about apprenticeship.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Councilman. Councilman Black. Councilwoman Black. So apprenticeships are a great, great tool for us and for a lot of people. And really and I'll speak specifically about the Pipefitters because I know about that apprenticeship more than I do the others, although they're they're all based pretty much the same way as I understand it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And what happens there is is it's a five year apprenticeship. It costs the student $200 a year for books. The local union subsidizes the rest of the cost of that school year. And it's an accredited course. It's an accredited college course.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So at the end of five years, they have 45 college credits for about $1,000 and no student debt. They actually get a raise every year, a pretty good raise to 10% a year, which and 15% the last two years.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So it's a really a pretty darn good deal. You could actually get your associate's degree with just the general education classes. There's 17 general education classes that that if you could take them, Simon Tinsley, if you'd like to, you could also come out.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And if you get the right jobs and you hit their breaking up over time in the right places, that you can make a pretty darn good living. $100,000 is not unheard of. So it's apprenticeship is a great a great opportunity for a lot of folks.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So are you going to be actively recruiting people to be apprentices to do work at the airport?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes, ma'am. We already are in airport in many other places, too. We are actively recruiting every day. So that that's one of the reasons we have a grant with the state to do community outreach, specifically to reach out to folks that have been disadvantaged for one reason or another, whether it's where they live, whether it's they're a'",
        "'speaker_6': 'minority or whatever that might be. It lists people into the middle class. This route is truly transformational, and not just for that job. Oftentimes for generations down the road, it's made a difference in people's lives. And we had members here today that could tell you that they retired and went home.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So but I hope that answers your question.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. I think that's great. Right. Thanks. That was only two. So the last question is for someone from the airport. And it's a two part question. Eisenberg said his is the Union Station public private partnership was 99 years.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And at the committee meeting we talked about how, for example, the Elway's concession agreement was for ten years. So can someone come in and why this agreement is for 30 years?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So, Councilwoman, typically when you invest in a project, you depending on the size of the investment, you need a certain amount of time in order to recover that investment. So if you take some of our smaller concessions that may be, let's say, 100,000, 200,000 or even up to a million or two that we'll invest to outfit a'",
        "'speaker_5': 'concession at the airport. Typically, 7 to 10 years may be adequate for that. But if you're talking about a project that's in the hundreds of millions, it is not unreasonable to have a 30 year return. If you think about the bonds that we issue at the airport to fund our projects.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Those are also in the hundreds of millions. Those are 30 year bonds. And that gives you the appropriate period of time to ensure that you can recover your investment and make the payments. So it really is tied size of investment, length of return.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. You're welcome.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Ah. Anymore. Okay. Uh, kill some black councilman Clark.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Sorry to keep bringing us back to some of these. First of all, I just want to thank the entire team for being available for questions and helping us navigate through this contract. I want to start with airport.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I'm guessing this will be a George Merritt question, but I'll let the airport team pick back two workers at the airport. You've heard a lot of questions about this is obviously something that's really important to a lot of us.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And, you know, I had had the opportunity to meet with people, some of the awesome people who work at our airport and make it the great place that it is out in the Great Hall. Also concerned that Great Hall closes for four years.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That's a long time to wait in line to have a new job in that same space. So I just want to get real. You know, we've talked a lot about it, but people right now who are employed in the airport, in the Great Hall, will they have a job when this construction goes under?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'When this goes under construction?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you, Councilman. So the short answer to that is yes. We worked very hard last fall with our concessions association to look at, and you've.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Already covered that. I'm looking for a commitment here in public. Well, the workers who are in the Great Hall, who want to continue working, will they have a job.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Particularly if you can pass a background check to or B badge to go out on the concourses? You know, if you had to move from a from a great hall out to the concourses, that that would be the hurdle.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But, yes, I think if you are ready and want to keep working at the airport, we've put in place several systems. So that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes, that is absolutely correct.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. And then for Ferrovial. Yes. I know that there were issues and negotiation and things that you didn't want or feel comfortable committing on behalf of future concessionaires. But will ferrovial respect workers rights to organize and form a union should they choose to?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So will Ferrovial respect workers, the workers right to organize and form a union should they choose to. And will ferrovial interfere in any way with the workers rights to organize and form a union so that you.'",
        "'speaker_16': 'Will not.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Interfere? Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Wow. Councilman Clark, that was quick. Okay, we are back to the top. Councilman Castro.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Someone from the airport. About the concessions. So, as I understand it, part of the agreement is in the Great Hall. No one can have more than 20% of either the restaurant side or the retail side, and no more than 30% combined.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Is that correct? My understanding that correct.'",
        "'speaker_16': 'Yes, that's.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Correct. Okay. And for for someone from the airport. So does this agreement allow Ferrovial to be a concession owner in either the Great Hall or on the concourses?'",
        "'speaker_14': 'No, it does not. So two part question. With respect to the concourses, the development agreement has it says nothing about and provides no rights, contractual or otherwise, to the developer in connection with concourse concessions.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But it doesn't prevent them from bidding for the concourses.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'No, it doesn't prevent them from from bidding on on any concession contract. But the second part of your question, the development agreement does prohibit the developer from being an owner in concessions in the Great Hall. So they are not, as the representative from Ferrovial explained, they are not a master concessionaire.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Typically a master concessionaire is the owner and operator of some number of the concession locations. The Great Hall Partners will not be the owner and the operator of individual concessions.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. And I think you alluded to it before. Michael Kiley made this statement. Why are we guaranteeing of overall a profit? Are we guaranteeing for overall a profit?'",
        "'speaker_14': 'No, we are not guaranteeing ferrovial a profit. One thing I would be clear on is that there's always mark up in construction contracts and various contracts. So we do guarantee profit in the same sense that we are guaranteeing profit here.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'But my point before was simply that the 10.8% return is realized only if the Great Hall Partners team performs at the level that is identified within their baseline financial forecast, and that includes their 20% of the concession revenue.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'So that is doesn't come close to being guaranteed. They absolutely have to perform in order to get to that rate of return. Even with respect to the 4.8% rate of return, that is contingent upon great hall partners delivering and making the facility available and satisfying the performance standards.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'And if they do not, then there will there may be performing payment deductions that would take them below that 4.8%.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. Thank you. And one question for Ferrovial. One of our speakers alluded to the fact that you may be ending contracts at UK airports. Can you address that?'",
        "'speaker_16': 'Yeah. Thank you for the question. Council member Ferrovial led the consortium that took over a company called B.A. in the UK in 2006. That after we after that transaction was completed, the antitrust authorities in the UK forced our company, that consortium, to divest a number of airports in that country because of a potential monopoly, because of a'",
        "'speaker_16': 'potential monopolistic situation in two areas of the UK, in southern England and in Scotland. Because of that decision of the antitrust authorities, we were forced to sell two airports in England, Gatwick and Stansted and one airport in Scotland, Edinburgh.'",
        "'speaker_16': 'So yes, there were those divestment, those day when this happened that we were forced to sell those airports because the antitrust authorities of the UK forced us to do it. And that's right.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'When was when did you get out of Stansted?'",
        "'speaker_16': 'Stansted transaction if I am not wrong happened in 2000, late 2012.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. Thank you. That's all for now, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. Thank you, Catherine. Catherine, council member. Take a back up.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. So I want to go back to the. Issue of potentially solving some of the airline concerns by looking at level four of the hotel and transit center. So I would like to know and know it's something that I was able to see and it was talked about when I did a tour of the airport as'",
        "'speaker_9': 'a potential future project that may come on. But it was not part of the discussion of the build out of the Great Hall. And so, number one, is any of that covered in the existing costs for the Great Hall right now?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'If that ends up being a solution for how to address some of the throughput issues raised by the airlines?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'No, it is not in this contract.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. Does that require TSA approvals and or financing? What if we move down to to proceed with that?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So any time you inject baggage into the system that then screens baggage, we would certainly be working with TSA to make sure that they agreed with the system that we designed and built there. Not sure if that answered your question.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Well, we would need their involvement if we're looking at any TSA check in point under level four or are we only looking at baggage? We are only one point. There was some discussion about potentially some TSA lanes, if you will.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Level four two, we are not looking at putting in TSA lanes that would actually check people in. That's not part of what we're talking about with the United. We're talking about ticket lobby, space and kiosks. That's what we're discussing.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'What you're talking about in terms of TSA use of level. Four years ago when we built out the HTC, we thought that the fourth floor might be a place where we could relieve TSA by adding additional checkpoints. Right now, using these automatic screening lanes that we're proposing, we don't need to use that space for checkpoints.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So we're talking about ticket lobby space in level four.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. And in doing that, it would free up some of the space on level six if that were to be done as a.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Potential no, this would be in addition to what we're building on level six. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'All right. Let me go to my next question. I had a comment on that one, but I will leave that for later. I want to ask Diane Durfee if she wouldn't mind coming to. The microphone. Deanne was brought on to assist some of us who had additional questions around the review of the contract.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I know you had an opportunity to look at that. So my first question is related to a comment that was made earlier by Mr. Reimer about. Let me make sure I've got the right question in front of me.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So transfer of concessions. And I think Councilman New asked this question. It's my understanding that any concession that would be. Transfer the ownership would be transferred would require our DSB office involvement. Is that correct? Because I know you work directly with our oversight of our DSP office.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Can you can you respond to that?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Greenly Diane Durfee with the city attorney's office. We have, as was discussed earlier and Mr. Reamer already discussed, this contract involves both the CDB program on the concession side and then on the construction side, our MWB program and has established goals for felt for both of those aspects of the project.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The activity is a federal program, as Mr. Bremer identified.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The MWB as our local program.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So with respect to your question on transfer of concessions, I think that the concession and I'm not as.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Familiar with the A.C.T. program as I am with the MWB.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Program, but my understanding is that they would still have to comply with all the federal requirements.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Regulations regarding how the ACP programs.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So nothing is being done in this contract that alters the federal requirements.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And rules and regulations that have to be followed.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And same with our BWB.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And that is true. We added as part.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Of the contract a compliance plan on the Mwb side for the construction.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Establish the goals for that, and we have not altered anything in that compliance plan that runs with our current laws on the MWB program.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. Thank you, Dan Reimer, if you wouldn't mind coming back up. So I want to get back to the issue of concentration of ownership. Someone who currently may already meet that threshold, that 20%. Limit for concentration of ownership.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'If they meet that on A, B or C, are they then allowed to also have a concession in the Great Hall? So are we playing with two different standards for both locations?'",
        "'speaker_14': 'So we may need to call up Patrick Hecht, the chief commercial officer, who's more familiar with how that concentration of ownership would would work under the development agreement.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. As a practical matter, that will be helpful, because one of my concerns is that we have ongoing changes that happen with how we have regulated the the concessionaires. We've had changing rules, I guess is is the terminology I want to use.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So can you help clarify the answer to my question?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Sure. Thank you. Councilman Patrick Hecht, chief commercial officer for the airport. We have a concentration of ownership policy that dictates how much a any one concessionaire can own of our concession program that we have under our control and concourses.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'A-B and C for OVL is going to have a very similar.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Program, but the two don't have.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Overlap. So someone has 20% on A, B and C and couldn't necessarily bidder would have to divest in order to bid on A, B, and C, they could actually get 20% of the program in in the Great Hall as well without having to divest in A, B and C.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So the two programs operate separately from that respect, but they're modeled very similarly so that any one person in Great Hall can't.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Control, say, 80%.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Of the Great Hall Project under under for obvious proposal.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But potentially somebody could control 40% and total at the airport 20% on the. Main terminal and 20% on A, B and C.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yeah, but the the main terminal isn't even.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Remotely close to half of the.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Concession.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Space at the airport, something a bit closer, say 20%. So you're talking about 20% of 20% that they could control. So they wouldn't control 40% of entire airport space. They'd still be limited to what would be 20% of the airport space in that case.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yeah, I guess I'm talking concessions as opposed to space.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But I'm in our our programs are built around space, so it's built around square footage.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. Thank you. And I do have just a couple quick more, if I may. So. Mr. can stay home, if you wouldn't mind coming back up. So it's my understanding that some of our labor unions have been in conversation with you there.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I don't know that there are actual agreements, but I'm not sure that all of our trades, both labor and non union and nonunion apprenticeship programs, have sort of received the green light permission approvals, whatever the right terminology is that Ferrovial will work with have have your contractor work with all of the apprenticeship programs that exist in the'",
        "'speaker_9': 'city. So can you tell me if this is something that you all are asking your contractors who will be doing the work to be working with our trades? And this is this does not take away from any of our in the DWP programs.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'This, you know, I see this as complimentary. So.'",
        "'speaker_16': 'Thank you for the question, Councilmember. I would calling someone from the BJP that can help us to address this question. With respect to apprenticeship programs. With respect to apprenticeship programs that are sort.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So what I'm asking is if Ferrovial is committing to. Ask your contractors who will be working on the project to work with the Colorado approved. Apprenticeship programs. And why this is important is because we have a labor shortage of skilled workers in this city with all the construction that's going on and where we can ensure, especially with'",
        "'speaker_9': 'publicly financed projects, which I consider this to be, we should be doing everything we can with all of our trades to. Develop those skills, ensure that folks in our community who are sort of left behind have that opportunity to be raised up.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so I'm asking the question of you, because you've selected that team of contractors and subcontractors that will be working on this project.'",
        "'speaker_16': 'Okay. May I ask? My understanding is that. That's correct. But if you can please confirm.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Good evening, council. I'm Angela Berry Robertson, the director of diversity for Ferrovial. I can say that we've worked with the apprenticeship programs and workforce initiatives for this project, so I can say that we will definitely actively work with the apprenticeship programs as well as not in lieu of and in consortia with the MWB programs that we have'",
        "'speaker_12': 'on the project.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So any that are not already connected to you all, you you have that open door is what I'm hearing you say. To work directly with them as well.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Between ourselves as well as our contractors, we would definitely encourage the utilization of apprenticeship programs and understanding the Labor needs as well as initiatives here in this in the city and county. So. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. Thank you. You're welcome. My last question is, it's actually for Gisela. Who wouldn't mind coming up? So I know Councilman New as sort of a version of my question, but I'm wondering exactly how DeLay plans to track the spin on this project, especially given that part of the funding for.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Some of the build out is being included in bond financing that has moved through this council. I want to make sure that we're able to track it in a similar way that we did with the Hotel and Transit Center, even though it may have different funding sources.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So can you just sort of elaborate on that in a. I mean, you may have already said it and I just didn't hear it in the same way.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Absolutely. So we'll be tracking the expenditures of this project like we do any other project. We have a number of requirements through accounting standards and the city's fiscal policies, which require us to track the value of any asset we build, regardless of how it's funded.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So whether it's airport bonds, airport cash reserves or actually funding that the developer brings to the table, much like when the city has developers put in infrastructure that then comes to the city as an asset to maintain. The exact same arrangement exists here and we will make sure that we track every dollar spent on the project.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We'll have a project controls team can mentioned earlier that will be very much engaged on a regular basis to review all of the invoices that come through the project design and construction phase. We will be paying our portion of the progress payments on a monthly basis.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'A requirement of that is a very stringent report that we placed as a requirement on the developer that they will need to provide to US monthly because we will not make the progress payment until our construction team is assured us on the financial side that the work that the invoice represents has actually been done to the performance'",
        "'speaker_5': 'standards that Dan mentioned earlier. So there's a number of checks throughout that process. Performance standards, construction standards, financial spend, all of that will be reviewed on a monthly basis during the entire four year construction period.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So is that a city team or does that a combination of city and consultants working with us to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'A common mission?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. And then this is just part of this. So. In addressing the issue of change, order or change directives. In the past, there was someone who had served on that committee that was actually the requester of the change orders.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I know there were changed recommended changes by the city auditor around that. So can you tell me who the Change Management Committee is made up of that is supposed to look at those change orders or change directives?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And again, this is important because this is where we begin to eat into the $120 million jersey.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I agree with your concerns as a CPA and a prior auditor myself. I share that concern and separation of duties. I think all my colleagues at the airport can tell you and probably a pain for them on most days, because I do have that concern.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we will have a committee that has no one from the construction side serving on the committee, which includes our internal staff. I respect very much to William and his staff, but they will not be on that committee.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There will be finance staff from the airport. There will be a representative from the auditor's office. There will be a representative from the Department of Finance within the city. And we will also have some outside experts yet to be identified.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But to your point, there will be no conflict of interest.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay, great. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. Thank you, Councilwoman Ortega. Councilman. Councilwoman can eat your up.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I would like to go back about, oh, I don't know, 20, 30 minutes to clarify something that occurred in the exchange with Councilman Lopez. So I think it was you, Nacho, where he asked about the cause that you mentioned this not a question for you, actually, but you stated that the prevailing wage applied'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and he asked. That covers the concessionaires and almost the whole front row nodded. And you said Yes. So can I get please Dan Durfee or Dan Reamer to clarify what, if any, wage policies apply to the concessionaires at this airport?'",
        "'speaker_16': 'One sec. Sorry. Then I said. I didn't say yes. What I said is, as far as I understand, those salaries would be negotiated between the concessionaires and the employees. The prevailing wage, according to my understanding of the agreement, will be explained by by but would apply to the NC works and on M works.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Okay. So there are a lot of different workers and there's a lot of different pieces of the project. So what I think we've tried to work through is the application of the prevailing wage ordinance during both the design and construction and the O&M phase.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'And what I have assured the Council and we've worked through the development agreement with the developer is not just agreed. The prevailing wage ordinance in the development agreement clearly applies to the extent it applies during both the design and construction and the onam phase.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'So great hall partners will have workers, they have O&M responsibilities, there will be janitorial contracts, there will be other classifications of workers who are subject to the prevailing wage ordinance. And so prevailing wage will apply to them. Prevailing wage right now does not typically apply to the concession workers themselves.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'That's not a category of worker that is subject to the prevailing wage ordinance. So again, I don't mean to sound too much like a lawyer, but the prevailing wage ordinance will apply through the development agreement to the extent that it applies, but won't cover additional workers beyond what's provided for in the ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. And I think that's a really important distinction. So and here's my shorter way of saying it back. If concessionaires do construction work. You know, to build out their space. They will be covered with that wage ordinance. But their servers, their retail workers, the folks who clean their they're they're they're bus people, the service workers who are'",
        "'speaker_3': 'employed in concessions do not have any wage standards at the airport at this time.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'They do not have wage standards. They have market forces. And market forces right now affect wages and are right now in the process of increasing wages at the airport.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But correct over 34 years, I think we can be guaranteed that market forces will change. And so I want to ask Kevin Abels to come up. I know a lot of my colleagues have been asking a lot of really detailed questions about proposed agreements and what folks liked and what they didn't like.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I actually am not interested in that so much. I've approved many contracts in this chambers where there were no agreements. What really I'm trying to get at and I still am not quite satisfied with, is understanding this idea of whether or not people are expected to meet and talk.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so I just want to ask you very clearly, did you receive any ideas, proposed changes, suggestions or any constructive ideas from Ferrovial or the airport and how the ideas you had proposed might become more acceptable?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'No, we didn't. And we specifically asked for them. We told them that the agreements that we were offering and the ideas we had were but a starting point and that we would really look forward to a constructive conversation.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But they chose not to give us anything concrete back.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thanks, Kim, and I appreciate that. So, Kim, I want to just chat with you a little more. And so I have seen you all meet with concessionaires who have sued you. I've seen you meet with groups of minority contractors who have done press conferences and rallies criticizing the airport.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm imagining a scenario whereby you would say to United, I don't agree with your idea that we shouldn't move, you know, some of this security to to level five. And so therefore, I won't meet with you. I've never seen the airport say because I don't agree with you or because you've criticized me.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I have no obligation to be in dialog. I've never heard the airport say that. And so here's my question. You're asking us to approve this partner stepping into your shoes. Who else are they allowed not to agree with or to meet with?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Who else might they say? I don't have to meet with you. You've criticized me. I don't agree with you. I guess I want to understand where the limits are, because we now have one situation where there wasn't. They didn't agree with the first idea.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There was one in-person meeting, two phone calls, but there was no desire to continue. I guess I want to understand who else would that could that happen to in the course of 34 years and how or why? Or help me understand.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Are we okay with that when it's not the way that you all do business? I am struggling and I want you to help me.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So. So. I was not part of any of those conversations. So I can tell you what went down there. What I can tell you is in the last two years, as we have worked with this developer, we have found a group that supports our value system that has ad nauseum held meetings, listened to people, listen to us'",
        "'speaker_12': ', allowed us to change things. I think this is a very open team of people that we have a great deal of confidence will be a good partner for 34 years. I just can't comment on this specific thing because I have no personal.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I wasn't there. I just don't have any.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'What if it became a pattern? I mean, is there anything and if they if there was a pattern of them refusing to meet with and I mean, we've all in my six years, I have seen more concessionaires and groups of contractors criticize the airport and criticize the contracting process.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's going to happen when they start choosing who's didn't do business with them and who's not. There will be folks who are upset. And I guess I guess I just want to understand, is this what if it became a pattern?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So what we have to we have the right to terminate for convenience. And that might be, you know, one of the reasons it's since us to that termination. I hope we never get there because I truly do have faith in these guys.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'But we do have outs. We are not we are not stuck for 34 years. That's not what you're doing tonight. You're you're voting on a contract that has lots of out if things do not turn out the way we anticipate them being.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I just want to ask one more question in our show, and then I think most of my questions have been answered for tonight. So can you tell me. Yes. Do you believe you have an obligation if you step in and serve as our public airport manager, do you have an obligation to meet with external stakeholders with'",
        "'speaker_3': 'whom you may not agree or who may have criticisms about your company? Do you have that obligation under this contract?'",
        "'speaker_16': 'And I have had that obligation for the last two and a half years in which I have been working in this project.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Will you meet with Unite here following this meeting, regardless of the outcome?'",
        "'speaker_16': 'We have met with Danica as explained before, the point that you were making with respect to trying to develop or making counterproposals. The core part of their agreement proposed by that association to us was forcing the future concessionaires to have an exclusivity with respect to the session or the choice of those employees that will be working at'",
        "'speaker_16': 'the concessionaires. That was the whole point of that union. So that was something that we could not accept. Secondly is very easy to say that there cannot have a meeting. In a meeting that we are not taking as many meetings as we are requesting and simultaneously having a campaign in the press against our company and simultaneously having'",
        "'speaker_16': 'that union protesting and picketing in the airport against our company. So in order to have meetings, you must have a friendly approach for both sides. And we didn't see that friendly approach from Unite here.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So you will not meet even after this meeting, regardless of the outcome you will not meet, is that. I just want to make sure I understand.'",
        "'speaker_16': 'We are happy to take meetings in a friendly way, you know, to understand the request of anybody so we can address their concerns and try to reach a common position as simultaneously we are continuously attacked by that party.'",
        "'speaker_16': 'Can be difficult to have a meeting in that context because you are being threat.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Through the meeting. We know a little bit about having meetings with folks who are mad at you and attack you up here. So that that's a part of what we do every day in the public sector. We take meetings with people who have really harsh things to say about us.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And if you have this contract, that is what you're signing up for.'",
        "'speaker_16': 'And we have taken those meetings despite those attacks.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Council members, it is 11 p.m. and we're starting to get down to the nitty gritty. So now we have council managers gone. Councilman Espinosa, you're up and then Councilman New. This is that's interesting. This talk about this conversation or lack thereof with Unite here sort of illustrates one of the core problems with this whole.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Structure. People go to their representatives on council in the elected government to listen and hopefully affect change and answer the question in that. Well, no, but. So remember that I'm going to come back to that because, you know, it's it's worth saying.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So the question I have. Let's start with this one. This and you've mentioned that you've been working with them for two years. This RF process predates my time on council. So the wheels were set in motion for ap3 years ago.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Where were those? The RFP is that you you obtained and you shortlisted and got to ferrovial. Were any of them at this to this magnitude on cost? You know, at the 650 to $770.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Million range.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And delivering essentially the same thing, you know, because we have this issue of going from 400 million to 770 million is the top end. What did you see back then that did that mean was there any indication on those prior proposals?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So maybe it's worth me just taking a second to explain the process we've been through for the last two years. We first put out a request for qualifications. We asked for teams to submit their qualifications. They came to us as entities that had a contractor and equity partners.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'From that RFQ process, we then a short there were, I believe five five that that first applied and we shortlisted to four. We then worked to work independently with each of the teams over the course of nine or ten months.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We met with them independently. We told them what we expected in terms of the physical plan. We told them what we expected in terms of the agreement we would have to operate it. We specified certain things like the length of term.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We eventually got to a point where we specified some physical requirements, but we basically let each of these teams develop an independent design and put in an independent proposal to us that had a deal structure that they preferred, a financial structure that they developed.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So we didn't lay out a requirement necessarily. We then took the proposals and evaluated them. Out of all of that process came our selection of the Ferrovial team to be the best person partner for us to then go to the next phase, which was the pre-development agreement, which was an attempt for us to negotiate exclusively with our'",
        "'speaker_12': 'number one choice to see if we could get to a deal that we could then bring before this council. And that's where we are today with this deal that we have negotiated with Ferrovial all of this time. My point in going through that is this is sort of evolved and the design has been done together.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'The $650 million construction cost is related to a project that we have designed with FERROVIAL over the last six months or nine months. I hope that makes sense.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah, that does. But what worries me in that process is not seeing. Having not been privy to all the work that you did with all the four that were shortlisted and seeing essentially.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You know, where they ended up and how you ended up selecting Ferrovial.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is, is, is, is sort of concerning because, you know, last year you came to us with a different sort of end game, essentially a much lower cost total project that would have had a much lower cost to two, you know, much lower impact to your bottom.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Line.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This and we ended up here and so I just wonder if if there was any information in what was submitted back then that would have given us any indication that this is this is where we would be.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Where we would end up.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So let me say we can. My recollection is there was no real cost talked about when we brought the PDA contract to you at that point in time. We so I'm not sure where this 400,000 or 400 million is coming from.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'There was a there was a letter by a proposer that we did not choose that had some numbers in them, but we did not bring you a cost when we brought you the Ferrovial team because we didn't have a design at that point in time that was finalized.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'What we wanted to do during this period, which we have used in the last year, was to design the right project and then price it out. I will say we've had independent review of this price. Stew Williams, who is the program manager, has brought in an outside third party.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'They have sat for hours and hours and hours. They've gone through unit cost and and refined the scope and made sure that this is a tight price and a tight project.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Why don't we? So, again, you've made a commitment to to calcium and knew that you would do some sort of update. The fact that we are.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We weren't updated when you were doing the maybe you were. I wasn't here.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And the fact that it feels like we were not updated during the negotiations about the different models and the different things that were being presented, we weren't.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Updated about.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The the order of magnitude that might be in the final. The proposal, as this thing was being developed over the last six months, I mean, we could have done a monthly report or even two quarterly reports that said, look, are the scale of this project is is on the order of magnitude of this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But this is we're only 15% designed.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And we still have all these unknowns.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The you know, to me. Might be indicative of how transparent you will be going forward with with the.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'With.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The amount of latitude that we're getting. Can you because of lot in the contract for OVL is required to do a lot of this reporting on a monthly basis in a sort of real time. Could you commit to a sort of written report on the contingency, a written monthly, monthly written report on the contingency status, along with'",
        "'speaker_1': 'a quarterly report at Committee on the Status of the Contingency and Construction Progress.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'A happy to do that. I do want to clarify two things you just said, though. So last year when we brought forth the contract to negotiate with Ferrovial and the PDA, we showed you in the in the in the business committee at that time that the other proposers designs, we have not hidden that from anyone that's been'",
        "'speaker_12': 'that's been out there for anyone to look at. I would also say that what we've been doing in the last nine months is negotiation. And so we have not been sharing this information because it is a negotiation. It is confidential.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We have allowed various sources to participate after signing a non-disclosure agreement, but we really have had this under wraps for a very good reason, and that is so that we could negotiate the best deal for us going forward after today.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Yes, everything is public. Yes. We're happy to give you a monthly report. We're happy to go to the committee and brief you on a regular basis. We'd be more than happy to do that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'What's frustrating there is, is even members of council after the contract was was in our position, it was in our wheelhouse for consideration. Members of council asked for essentially the let you not issue enter into the non-disclosure agreement to sort of review everything that was reviewed that was never offered, you know.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So I'm not sure what was offered, you know, in the reading room we had.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You had everything.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We had extraction. We had financial models.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah, but people were doing other people in the city were reviewing these things over the course of those nine months that you were doing and negotiating. And no member of council was and no member of council will be part of the committee, as far as I know, unless you're going to commit to it right now that a'",
        "'speaker_1': 'member of council will be part of the committee going forward.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We have had to, I believe both council member Herndon was and Councilwoman Ortega have been serving on the executive committee for this project. And we we will agree to go forward with that same group.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Wow. Why don't we have an updated maybe. Maybe I'm in the wrong committee to have gotten that update. So then one last question on sort of related, Debbie Ortega. I mean, Councilwoman Ortega had a.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Question.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In writing that said, I am reading the contract. Am I reading the contract correctly? That Den will pay ferrovial $1.8 billion.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Over the life of the agreement, plus 20% of the.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Concession.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Revenue generated by the Great Hall.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The answer was yes. The airport will pay $1.8 billion over the life of the development agreement. Airport payments were split. Well, then there's detail on the airport payment. The a member of the administration just this morning in response to a similar question, said the developer takes all the risk for the price of the schedule and construction.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The airport pays back the developers $380 million investment for it at a return of 4.8. Is that. Is that summary, get us to $3.8 million. Is that accurate portrayal?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Does that get us to the 3.8 million billion.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Three $1.8 billion. So 380 million at 4.8%.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So the 1.8 million is the construction cost. It includes our contingency. It includes 30 years of operating repayment, of financing, which is the 4.8% return, plus us reimbursing them for operations and maintenance. That is what is in the $1.8 billion contract.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Can you elaborate on maybe.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Where the number is, 380 million and a return of 4.8 came from is a response to.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'The developers investing $378 million. I think we have rounded that up to the three eight.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'That's a combination of equity and debt.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. I just take it that the rest of that will go into comment, but it just seemed to imply that that was essentially it was sort of minimizing the cost of this when instead we are proving if we approve, this is a $1.8 billion payback.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'That is the contract that's before you tonight.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Thank you. No further question. All right. Thank you. Councilman Espinosa, California.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Real quick, Gisela. Please. Let's go over some numbers real quick. Okay. If you split this the split contract into the construction piece and the concession fees. Okay. And we're looking at our contribution of, say, 600 million and the partnership put in 170 million for the seven services, assuming we spend all the contingency.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Okay. And that's so our contribution is about that 78%. You know, on a on a non P3 contract, what would that percent be? 100%?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It would be 100% unless it's funded partially by the FAA via grant or another granting agency.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So strictly from a financial viewpoint, that's the vantage of the P3 agreement that we're actually spending less on the construction than we normally would in a street construction contract.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's correct. That allows us to use our resources in other projects.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Of a concession agreement where, you know, it looks to me, you know, the numbers we've been working with, the profitability is coming out of that concession agreement. And so and FERROVIAL has value. It looks like what what I've been told is, you know, we're on the existing concession agreement.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'We're getting about a dollar $0.41 per square foot.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In the Great Hall concessions. That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And Froebel is going to be able to generate $3.34 about, you know, two times.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'What, approximately.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Less so. And we're going to get 80% of that increase in the revenue that they're going to generate through their rental arrangement.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes, 80% comes to the airport.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So in a normal. And in what kind of arrangement is there with the concessionaires on the concourse? Is it what percentage do we give there?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So the percentage of the sales that the concessionaires generate is approximately the same collected by the airport versus the developer. The difference is the airport retains 100% of the percentage that we get from the concessions in the concourses, and we receive 80%.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In the case of the Great Hall via the current arrangement under the development agreement, so approximately 20%.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Okay. So just from an existing standpoint, we're going to earn more money from the concession agreement through the Great Hall. It looks like to me and you're estimating about $100 million profit on this whole project. And, you know, which I think is typical CFO, very conservative.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And I think it's going to be a lot more than that, but it's going to be I want to assure the public this is a very profitable arrangement that we're entering into with this great hall. So correct.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's correct. So we are able to generate revenues that flows into the top of our waterfall, which gives us additional capacity not only to cover our current debt obligations, but also to reinvest in our facilities. And then we make the payments at the lower end of our waterfall or the way our funds flow through, which again gives'",
        "'speaker_5': 'us the flexibility to make sure that we can use our resources where best deployed. But yes, we do anticipate currently, based on the base financial model, that we will have additional funds that will be generated as a result of this project.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We will then reinvest in the remaining programs, which includes gate expansions for our airlines, widening of Penn Boulevard and other projects that will help make the customer experience at the airport much better. All right.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman and Councilman Cashman.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I know maybe the third time's the charm. You know, sometimes you're in the game and you're watching your teammates strike out, but it's your turn up. So I'm going to give it one more try. Ferrovial. The whole thing with Unite here.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It feels like a schoolyard fight. It's where somebody says something and the other person gets hurt. And that's it. You won't talk anymore. And I'm aware of the aggressive campaign that Unite here has waged against your company in an attempt to stimulate negotiation.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Yeah. I'd be angry, too. It got pretty tough. The problem that I'm struggling with. Is that Mr. Ables and the management of of. That union represents several hundred people. That have legitimate concerns. Over their future employment. So I'm going to ask.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Is there any way? That you. Recognize that sometimes things get heated. And that you can agree. To reopen. Communication. You're an open spirit to try to hear their concerns at a new level. Or if you just refuse to talk.'",
        "'speaker_16': 'We are happy to open any channel of communication and understand their requests and try to address them. That's why you have our commitment for that, for communication, collaboration and trying to understand and address the legitimate needs of every stakeholder in this community.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Including you. I appreciate that. I feel like that's some degree of movement. But I want to be real clear, because I think it's important. Would you say? Commit to. Six meetings, one a month. Six one hour meetings one a month with unite here with an open spirit.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Putting that. Difficult time. Behind again. If it were just one person involved. I probably wouldn't be as concerned. But it's a few, several hundred families. And while I understand there's processes, I mean, I look at the job market and I figure it's going to be a lot of jobs.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But I'm also looking at as counsel McNeil said you as the face. If not at the airport of the Great Hall of somewhere. And I'm getting lost in the in the in the number of 10 to 20% of the concessions in the airport, depending on when we build out the the concourses.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So yeah, six meetings, one a month, one hour in person sitting down with.'",
        "'speaker_16': 'Mr. Abels you have our commitment for that council member and I understand your query.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you very much for that. That's all, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you, Councilman Cashman. Councilwoman Ortega, I'm not sure we've heard from Councilman Herndon yet. Are you? That's fine. Has been heard in.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Kim Are we asking Ferrovial to do our current concessions that we have at the airport? Do they require worker retention with the concessions?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So what the current policy is right now at the admin, we're asking for over all to do the exact same thing.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Yeah. In fact, we were we were very careful to do pass through of all the requirements that you have given us. We have passed all of those through to Ferrovial.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So Unite here is trying to get ferrovial to do above and beyond what every concessionaire on A, B, or C concourse doesn't do right now.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So cancer. I haven't been in those meetings. Understand? Tell you what, you might hear us.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Asking, but that is certainly mine. So if there if there's an issue, why wait? I'm going in the comments. I'm done. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I, i respect the ability to catch yourself. Councilman. All right. Councilman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay, this is my final question. And it's you know, I've raised a lot of questions about the risk to DIA, and I would like to know what contingency plan the airport has if the Great Hall does not operate as designed or simulated.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so what I want I'm aware that we have step in rights for the contract, but. I want to know that we actually have a step in ready plan if you know the wheels fall off the bus and we have to step in.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Do we have the wherewithal, staffing expertize to to be able to do that? At whatever stage we happen to be in, whether it's, you know, during construction, during the operations, do we actually have a real plan that we can just step in and do that job?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So I'm to let the city attorney talk about, you know, our rights in terms of the contract. We are not sitting with 20 plans in the drawer that we can just pull out. But things like this don't happen overnight.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'If we see a trend that something is happening, we're going to go put a plan together. That's what we do.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So so Kim, let me just address that briefly, because we rely on certain aspects within this contract to. We rely on self-reporting. And if things are happening and they're not reported, how do we know what's going on?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I'm not sure we're looking each other. Maybe you could ask that again. We're not really understanding.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. So if there are, I don't know, breaches of the contract or we're not meeting the I don't know the goals of what is anticipated to be collected in terms of revenues or you know, I'm just making some of this up, but under the management of these concessions or oversight.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We rely on self-reporting from this contractor. From the from the developer. But if those reports, those self reports are not being forwarded, we were not aware of certain things going on. That's what triggers any of the step in rights if there are certain things that are not.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Reconcilable. Right. So my question gets back to what contingency plan do we have that? You know, in place to be able to step in and take control. I mean, I get we have step in rights, but what is what plan do we have?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Do we have the expertize in staffing and in. You know. Just the skill sets to be able to keep this we'll keep this bus rolling if some of the wheels do fall off.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'So I just I want to be clear about the manner in which the wheels may fall off. So first, the airport believes that they have a plan that will work and can be implemented. The developer's responsibility with respect to the level six improvements is simply to design and construct those improvements.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'And they walk away from those areas outside of any warranty work. So if future changes are required, particularly to level six, the ticket lobbies, the security screening checkpoint, the airline offices, and those improvements on level six, public circulation curb that all remains within the discretion and exclusive authority of the airport to bring another contract to develop it'",
        "'speaker_14': 'through the AIM team to engage in planning necessary to put forward a construction contract and a plan that would be presented to this body. That is not a matter of step in rights. That is a that is a question about the termination of the developer's responsibilities.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'So with respect to level six improvements, their responsibility will terminate upon substantial completion and the expiration of any warranty work. So if the wheels come off of that bus, then the airport would deal with that through a separate contract with.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So we're looking at them exclusively then. Is what. What I hear you saying in terms of the construction of the build out of level six. From the construction of the build out of the concession area so far.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Correct. So with respect to level five and the island that the developer will be responsible for, they will be responsible for both designing and constructing those commercial areas, as well as managing those commercial areas during the operating period of the agreement.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'If there are shortfalls in revenue, the development agreement provides mechanisms by which the airport and the airport's consultants can review the plans and the documents and that concession development management plan to try and establish why the developer is not making the revenue that they had forecast.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'So there are there are provisions for both minor shortfalls and material shortfalls, and the airport's responsibilities obviously increase in the event of a material shortfall. So if the wheels come off the bus in the sense that developer is not performing and the sales are not what what have been anticipated, and that is attributable to acts or omissions'",
        "'speaker_14': 'on the part of the developer, then we know precisely what will happen. It will be a combination of the airport and its consultants that will review the plans and develop a remedial plan to try and get those revenues back up to where they should be.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'It is also important to note that the Concession Development and management plan is intended to be a living document. It's already been mentioned here, but with respect to brands and brand mix and and performance and what's working, the airport and the developer will have that opportunity on a on a two year basis every two years that CDP'",
        "'speaker_14': 'document will be updated and that will be an opportunity to review maybe, maybe not terrible deficiencies, but sort of minor tweaks that may need to be made in the program in order to make sure that it's achieving its maximum potential.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So if for whatever reason. We've got legitimate reasons to terminate the contract because of all the out clauses that are in it. After that point, if there is some new entity brought in, does that reengage council in the process?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Because technically this deal would be null and void at that point, correct?'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Well, there are a couple of different termination provisions. We've already talked about termination for convenience. So that's the airport's option to terminate at any time for any reason. And there is a formula for calculating what would be owed to the developer in the event of termination for convenience.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'If it's termination in the event of a default, then there is a separate formula that would be established for for termination. But the short answer to your question is it if the agreement if the development agreement is terminated.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Then the airport has every right to do whatever it wants, whether that's to take on the management of the program itself or to find a master concessionaire, to find a new developer, to find somebody who would who would satisfy the need, whatever it may be at the time that the development agreement terminates.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Can I just add one thing? Sorry. I just wanted Patrick to come up. We obviously do have the talent and the ability in-house to run a concession program. And so, Patrick, maybe you could talk about stepping in if we had to.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So, Councilman, I think to Dan's.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Point, there's a number of different ways. If we got to a point where Ferrovial is no longer involved in not running the program for us, that we could go you could certainly replace Ferrovial just with someone else who is very similar to Ferrovial.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But I think in the case where from a contingency perspective, how we would actually step in, we run 150,000 square feet of concessions on the concourses. Now in this contract, we have required for OVL to have a lot of things that look and feel a lot like us.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The concentration of ownership we talked about PDC program as a number of things were required.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I think very importantly, a contract that has a number of provisions that are exactly like our provisions in our contracts that have to.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Be in their contract with their concessionaire. So if we take it over, it is now essentially.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'One of our contracts and we have staff because we do that on the concourses that can now take it over. Would I maybe need more staff potentially to run this program now as part of it? But in all ways, it's.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Going to look and feel a lot like what we do today. So I feel very confident that we could take over and run this program because it's very similar to how we actually operate in the world today. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah, thank you, Councilwoman Ortega. Councilman Espinosa. Two tiny one, tiny one. One ones are the single standard de. The model. The mountain. The model with the single standard de. Does does that. What was mentioned in the comments was at 28, you require it requires 28 lanes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is that true?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So. So we. I'm not sure exactly how to answer this. We're designing a facility that has 32 automatic screening lanes. They are they have a lot more throughput, almost twice as much as our existing checkpoints. Do we believe that with the 32 lanes, we can get to about a 30% increase in capacity over what we have in'",
        "'speaker_12': 'our terminal today? It's not based on a given day.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So when you model it, you don't model for a typical day and model for sort of different conditions.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And so when they do a simulation, they do simulations for different conditions, right? Peak peak hour of an average day, things like that. So they model all of those elements.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So how many lanes are needed on a typical day?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I wish there was a typical day. That's the problem with this question. It isn't a typical thing. We don't designed to a typical day. We designed to a peak hour of an average day.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so how many lanes in a peak hour on an average day.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So to get a 30% increase in the capacity of the terminal, you need 32 lanes, which is what we're putting in, 34 lanes, I'm sorry, 34 lanes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'On an average day at your peak.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Our peak hour. Your average day.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sorry that got they got to five.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And each day of a peak month.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So my concern is.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I'm looking based on.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'A lot of the conversation. I'm looking for a commitment from built in which always does it and ferrovial who's new to this game to work with the airlines. It sounded today or in our earlier conversations that, you know, there are concerns that we're close to resolution.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Since you have 70% of the design to still complete, can both Dan and Ferrovial agree to absorb the changes needed to address the concerns that have been raised thus far with Arrow by the airlines?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So we're continuing to try and get to a place where we understand the plan and how it works. We've done simulations. We are looking at these relievers, but there isn't. There is nothing that I can stand here today and say we could invest in and that would solve the problem.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We are still in a study phase. So I can't commit to you that we are that any of these elements are going to be built. We're just not there yet. What I will commit to you is we have spent the last two weeks working very closely with United.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We will continue to work with United. It's really important for us that they agree with us that we're building the right thing and that this is successful for them. We will get to that point. I can't tell you, though, what the answer is to get us there, whether it is changing the design or building something else or'",
        "'speaker_12': 'just doing 20 more simulations so that we all agree. We've tested all of the possibilities and we feel comfortable in it. And as I said earlier, that the ticket lobbies are going to open before the security screening checkpoint.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So we have it we have an opportunity there to test it, really to make sure it works.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So that's your that's the track record. I mean, we obviously care very deeply about United as the given the number of gates that they have. And I assume Ferrovial is also very much aware that the traffic that goes through that the main terminal is largely driven by United in their success here.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Can I hear the same comments from Ferrovial because that has been the concern today.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So just keep in mind, we will contain ownership and operation of the ticket lobby. All they are doing is building out what we are asking them to build. They really don't have a dog in this fight.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So you're going to continue to listen and capture these needs. Okay. All right. Think they don't have any more questions? Thank you, Councilman Espinosa. Most of my questions. It's my turn and most of my questions were answered. I have some very specific questions for you, Kim Who is actually the dad PM on this?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Williams Mr. WILLIAMS Great. Who is the security consultant on the project?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Who is the security?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So when you, when you, when you start looking at the security lines and things like that, not that TSA, but are you do you have a consultant that you're working with to for the feel of the rooms, the you know, the esthetics of the location?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Stu Williams.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Senior vice president of special programs in the Great Hall. So, Councilman, to answer your question.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'On the Ferrovial design.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Team, they have a company that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Is done all the modeling and has done additional modeling.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'As we've been working with United to try different scenarios.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'To come up with this. So they do.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Modeling of both ticket.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And security lines nationwide. You answer it. Thank you. That's what I want to know. We didn't get to that. And I wanted to make sure. And so last question is around equity partners. And so, Natalie, I think I'm going to ask you this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So, I mean, we've been asking questions for 2 hours and we really haven't got into the equity partners. And I really want to answer I want you to answer this question of the equity partner Saunders and Magic Johnson Company.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'What kind of role will they have play in shaping the airport? Are they silent partners or they just investors? Obviously, Saunders is doing construction as well, but what kind of role will they have?'",
        "'speaker_16': 'Thank you for that question, Mr. President. We have a set of hold this agreement executed among federal airports, GRC and Sounders, and that agreement is confirm that we retain 80% of the equity and 20% is owned by a baseball owned by GRC.'",
        "'speaker_16': 'And Sounders GRC has 95% of that vehicle and 5% is owned by Sounders because of the agreements that we have as part of that sort of hold this agreement, Sounders FC through that they call, we have a number of rights in the corporate in the future corporate governance of the SPV that will be the developer signing the'",
        "'speaker_16': 'the concession agreement. That is.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right. So what I'm trying to get to the crux of it is Sounders a local company? Yes. Well, they. And I'm assuming this is. Yes, but will they have the right to get their subs? Get their folks connected who are connected here in Denver?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Make sure they're employed? Are they they're okay to do that?'",
        "'speaker_16': 'Sanders is also is not only part of the developer, he's also part of the DJT that's design and build joint venture. Get that so they can hire.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They can either subs down.'",
        "'speaker_16': 'Joint venture is owned 70 70% by federal agreement and 30% by Sanders because of the algorithms that they have among the two companies. I'm sure that Sanders will be heavily involved in the future development of the program. That's why that was the most important reason why more than two years ago we decided to work with then and'",
        "'speaker_16': 'they decided to work with us.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Will Magic Johnson's company be able to with concessions and folks like that? You know, I want to see will they be able to have influence over the concession individuals that we bring on specifically with AC DC.'",
        "'speaker_16': 'That's our intention and commitment. And I would ask you to, you know, to confirm that because we have.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Great.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Councilman. Jim Reynolds, managing partner.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'With Johnson Loop Capital. We have approximately.'",
        "'speaker_8': '19% of the equity asanas as 1% of Rossville.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Has 80%.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think my partner.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Magic Johnson came and addressed this body around our commitment to Mwb and HDB at the airport and in the city. And we expect to have a very prominent and active role and working with, selecting, speaking to and encouraging the growth of Mwb businesses here in Denver.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's our view that just as this will be an absolute showcase.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'For the Denver International Airport.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We expect that for Mwb participation, it will match that same standard.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Great. And specifically, the folks in the community want to know. Access for black businesses. Access for Latino businesses. Access for female women owned businesses.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well, it's not lost on me that nine nine out of your 13.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Members are minorities and women. And in my conversations with the mayor, he made it very clear that this is one of the most important issues on his plate. And we absolutely agreed that it is one of the most important issues on ours.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I had an opportunity to speak to maybe a couple hundred folks that either were concessionaires wanted to be concessionaires, wanted to grow their concessions.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I know my partner, Magic Johnson came and also spoke. I know several of the council people were there.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'With also groups that wanted to be.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Concessionaires.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so we have been very.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Active in that role. Magic himself also owns concessions at airports and has built them. As you know, I'm an investment banker and has built businesses. We also are both mwb businesses that both started our businesses from scratch and built them to pretty substantial businesses today.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So we understand how is done. We understand the commitment. We also understand that the biggest impact on the city of Denver is going to be growing those businesses here in Denver. It's not our expectation that you will see a lot of mwb come from outside of Denver, although you may see some.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's our expectation that the growth will come from right here, from every forum that we've given.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And there have been several. The appetite and the energy around the minority and women owned businesses around this project has been about the highest I've ever seen, and the focus and the commitment from them is here. So I think you'll see an amazing result from from this project and our participation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mr.. REYNOLDS Thank you. You answered my question. Thank you. All right. The public hearing is now closed. Comments by members of council. Councilman Herndon.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes. Okay. So don't get too excited because this is the easy part. Thank you, Mr. President. I need to offer a technical amendment to this resolution so I move that Council Resolution 820 to be amended in the following particulars.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'On page one, line 18 Strike City Clerk's Filing number 201735867. And Replace with City Clerk's Filing number 2017-0375.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It has been moved and second it. Tell us what happened. You want explain that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes. Thank you, Mr. President. The purpose of this amendment is to correct the clerk's filing number and to fix a typographical error in the development agreement.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay, great. Other members of council. Can we correct this without going into comments or.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Is that right?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Um, I have a question about this because I think it was more than just one typographical error.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilwoman. Well, other folks have questions on this. Okay, let's do. I'm going after them. Councilman Cashman. No question. FLYNN okay. LOPEZ No, not on this. Uh, Councilman Gilmore.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'President Brooks, I have a comment I need to make.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Go ahead. All right. I will be abstaining on voting on this due to my.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Brother in.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Law having an interest in the Great Hall Project. Thank you, President Brooks.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. And thanks for sitting through this public hearing. Okay, let's see. Council. Councilwoman Canete. Councilman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. So I'd like to ask you, if you wouldn't mind coming up, because it's my understanding it was a result of your review and finding some of the issues that resulted in this change, this amendment. So will you just clarify that it is more than just a typo?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There were a handful of typographical errors that were found in our review that were cleaned up as a result of discussions between myself and Dan Laycock. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But. It's my recollection from our discussion that involved a little more than just typographical.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm going to defer to Mr. Remer, if there was one there change that was made with respect to the last section in the contract regarding the delegation.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'There were maybe two changes in the amendment that are. More than typographical errors. One has to do with the proper articulation of the nondiscrimination requirement to make sure that it it it accurately captures the the the direction that the city is moving with respect to gender variance and gender expression.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'So that may or may not, depending upon your point of view, be a typographical error. And the other change that borders on substantive or materiality is a request to simply delete a provision about council's delegation, something that is already covered within the Denver Revised Municipal Code.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'And it was something that we was put into the development agreement to add clarity and turned out to increase confusion. And so we've struck that provision. I think they could generally be within the realm of typos, but that I understand that's a subject of discussion.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But I think that is. I appreciate you explaining that because the last two items clearly explain that it's more than just typographical errors in in wording that is in the contract. So I think it was just important for my colleagues to hear that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. Thank you, Councilwoman Ortega. Councilman do. Councilman Herndon, I think. Okay, it's been moved. And second, it we're voting on the amendments. Madam Secretary, roll call.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Herndon. The freshman carnage. Lopez. I knew Ortega. Sussman. Did you say no? I like black eye. Clark, I. Espinosa, I. Flynn. I feel more.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Than.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I police force following announced results.'",
        "'speaker_5': '12 one abstention.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. 12 eyes, one abstention. The amendment passes. Councilman Espinosa, we need you to make a motion to adopt an amendment amended. Sir. Bill number I. I move that we. Eight 2230 a move the council adopted Resolution 822 as amended.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's been moved and seconded. All right. Now we are commenting on this bill as amended. Councilman Herndon.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mr. President. And I know what you all are sitting there thinking at almost midnight. That was a great video Councilman Herndon showed at the beginning of this council meeting. You know, so everyone has experience with the airport, but mine is pretty substantial.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I represented the airport for four years and I worked at the airport for for two with United Airlines. So I know the airport extensively. I could tell you a bunch of boring facts that would be great at trivia.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'If you're wondering about the spinning fans as you drive through from the Great Hall to the different terminals, we have 5280. In case you're wondering, because we're 50 to 80 mile high. So I've been at the airport and I think about how good of the how important of the project this is what?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Kills organizations is complacency. The belief that you don't need to improve and that you need to continue to find ways to better yourself. And I applaud the airport and the team that we've had over the two decades that the airport has been around, because we have always sought ways to better our airport.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And the amazing thing about this is that we have a huge reason why we cannot be complacent when it comes to the Great Hall Project. And that's my first reason why we need support. This is safety and security.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And you cannot overstate that the vulnerabilities that we have with our current configuration need to be immediately addressed. And that is the main reason why this should move forward just from a safety and security standpoint. I think of many days that I've walked around that airport and I just stand on level six as a veteran and look'",
        "'speaker_7': 'around and thinking we have some challenges that need to be addressed. And shortly after getting elected to represent the airport in District 11, sitting down with Kim as she explained her vision for how this needs to move forward, it was very refreshing.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So safety and security is, number one, why we need to move forward with this project. Number two is modernization. We have a 1990s configuration and a 2017 and beyond airport. It just doesn't fit. And there's not a lot of minimal things that you can do to fix that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I thought a great slide that came out in committee was when Dan showed the other airports that are investing billions of dollars in infrastructure. Los Angeles, 14 billion. San Francisco, 6 billion. LaGuardia, 8 billion. Billions of dollars in their infrastructure because we need to improve that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The airlines have given back 150,000 feet of ticketing space, 15% that they have given back to the airport because they don't need anymore. You see that when you are walking on level six, all of this empty ticketing space.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'What are we going to do with that? We have to modernize. Kansas City, where I'm from, is having a conversation right now about creating a one main terminal. And I remember being in Kansas City. I was either reading about us talking about on TV.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'They were talking about the pros and cons and the con was not to do it. They said, We don't want to be Denver because you have this idea when you come out to level six and you look down and this is my third reason why this is important for efficiency and improvement, because when we take TSA and'",
        "'speaker_7': 'move them up to level six, we're not using the same technology that we're going to have right now. We're using state of the art. We will be the first airport to use this technology in this country. As Kim was talking about working with the TSA to make sure that this works.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Had the pleasure of traveling overseas to Europe to see how modern it is, how efficient it is, the throughput we will move people through quicker. So from an improvement and efficiency standpoint, that's why this is so important. Airports create experiences.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's more than just people getting on a plane and traveling. We are competing globally with airports. The Houston's the LA's. They're not our competitors. We are going against Munich. We are going against Incheon. We are going because those international airports, because that's who we want to be.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The world class airport. If you think about Skytrax and if you're not familiar with Skytrax, that is the standard when it comes to airlines and airports, when it comes to ratings. If you think about the top ten airports in the world, none of them are in the United States of America.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'If you think about five star airports and none of them are in the United States or in this country. But when Skytrax did the 2017 top airports, one I want to congratulate then because they were fourth when it came to regional airports.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But number nine of the best airports in the world was London Heathrow. Guess who runs a terminal at London Heathrow? Ferrovial. If you want to be the best, you hire the best privately. Now, let me quickly talk about some of the reasons, if you will.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This is a great deal. But if you're striving for perfect, we're not going to get there. Do not let perfect be the enemy of great. And if you look sure, there are things you can find wrong with this.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Why is it 30 years? I think he's like, I have a great answer for why, for that time period, this council in 2012 approved a ten year contract for L.A. and also threw down 2012. This council will not weigh in on that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The next council is not going to weigh in on that. So we have already made decisions that future councils aren't going to be invested in. We don't choose every retail right now. Provenzano The seven year contract. 40 kiosks right now in our airport.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This council has never weighed in on it. So the implication that we always make decisions is not accurate. But if we are going to give away that ability, we have hired a partner who knows how to run and manage airports, and their experience is a testament to that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And the last point I will say is this. The concessions. Why would we ask a ferrovial to do what we don't ask of A, B and C concourse? If you enter with all due respect to the unite here, what they are asked are they are trying to do is change policy.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That is our job. Sit down with council members and push for a new policy with concessions that does that. Let's have that conversation. But to make Ferrovial do that and actually not ferrovial future concessionaires, because as they said, we're not going to run them, but we're going to hire companies to do that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Why would they do that? Why would we create that double standard where it's one standard on the main car, on the Great Hall and not on A, B and C. But that's a good conversation to have. We have had it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Previous councils have talked to us about it because I remember those conversations and briefings from David Rodwell. So that's why to me that doesn't make sense. Yes. Sit down and have a conversation with them. And I appreciate you doing that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But if you reach a fundamental disagreement. I'm not sure how you go forward with that. But I appreciate you having those meetings and explaining why this is why you're choosing not to do that. So thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'm a huge supporter of this. I would urge my colleagues to do so for the reasons that I noted. And I look forward to voting, hopefully before 1:00. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman. We all hope to do that. Councilwoman Black.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. President. And I only wish I could be as in as energetic as Councilman Herndon just was, but I'm a little more tired than he is. Last week I met here in this room with students from our sister city in France, the city of Brest, which is a very old city in northwest France on the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Atlantic Ocean. And we talked about the similarities and differences between Denver and Brest brass. Entire history has been formed by the fact that it's on the Atlantic Ocean. It's a port. It's a naval city. And we talked about what it means to be a landlocked city like Denver in the center of a continent.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And how does Denver connect to the world? So a century ago, it was railroads and later interstate highways connected us. But it was our visionary mayor, Federico Pena, who asked Denver eight to imagine a great city by investing in our city and in a new airport.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm a Denver native and I grew up in southeast Denver near Monaco. So for a lot of my life, when we went to the airport, we left, I don't know, an hour before our plane left, drove down Monaco, jumped out of the car, random airplane.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I thought it was great. I didn't understand why we needed a new airport. But it didn't take long for me or the critics to see that Mayor Pena was right. Our new world class airport put Denver on the map and it connected us to the world.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It invigorated our economy. And according to an article in the Kansas City Star, DIA is the linchpin of Colorado's tradition to a global 21st century economy flush with high paying jobs. The airport is our port. After 22 years, Denver remains a world class airport, but the world is changing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It is much more connected. Airports are different today. Just as Councilman Herman Herndon pointed out, retail is changing and airports are more than just places that you pass through. They're becoming places that you want to be with movies, bowling, beer, gardens, and so much more.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Investment in infrastructure pays off, and it's important to maintain and update our airport to keep it fresh so that airlines and passengers want to fly to and through Denver. Like Mayor Pena, our airport leadership is visionary and is anticipating the future and planning for increased security and for 80 million passengers just to go over what we've been'",
        "'speaker_3': 'going over for 3 hours. First and foremost, security is the driving force of this project. But there's really two parts of it. And I have explained this in phone calls and emails to constituents who have contacted me, but there is the remodeling of the terminal, and I explain it as a 66, $650 million gutting of your house'",
        "'speaker_3': '. You're redoing your bathrooms, your floors, your walls, your stairs, your elevators. You're redoing it all. And most importantly, we're moving and redesigning security to increase. Safety. As we've already said, Great Hall Partners will manage the entire project and guarantee the $650 million price tag and a completion date.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The risk is theirs, not ours. The local construction company, Saunders, who will hire local subcontractors, will build the project. They are honoring prevailing wage, minority and women owned business contractors. Trade unions are in support. We talked about the professional development opportunities, which I think are really terrific and also any future changes, as Councilman Herndon pointed out, to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'any policies that we might make about minimum wage or any labor agreements would apply to this contract. In addition to this. The airport is also doing other capital improvement projects. And when Councilman Herndon just listed how much all the other airports are investing, we're investing more than the 1.8 billion.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think it's three and a half billion because we're we're adding 26 new gates. We're widening Pena Boulevard, major runway maintenance, name maintenance, redesigning baggage systems. Lastly, the other part of the contract is for the Great Hall Partners to manage and maintain the concessions.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We've we've already talked about it. They're motivated to to succeed. They only make money if it succeeds. So what's best for them is also best for us. Lastly, I know you all have met with us so many times and have answered so many questions and I have a lot of confidence in you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I also know you have relied on the top experts in the world and the country. You hired the top three law firm in the country to develop the contract you're working with to, say, the airline's top engineers and designers.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I have confidence in our design team to do what's best for our airport and for Denver, and I will be supporting it. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Black, Councilman Cashman.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you, Mr. President. And I was right. I was telling people yesterday we would not be voting on this Monday night. We're not going to be. This. This has been a fascinating process of trying to come to yes or come to no on this contract.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I've spoken to people I have great respect for who think this is a terrible idea. And I've spoken to people I have great respect for who think this is a spectacular idea and that complicates things. I've spoken to experts on legal matters, financial matters, labor issues, business practices, both on city staff and outside of city staff.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I'm pleased to say, you know, my my friend, Councilman Herndon and I often find ourselves on different sides of issues. But what I agree with him wholeheartedly is and have from from the first time I heard about this is this project needs to get done.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'As has been talked about, our security process has for flaws as far as crowd safety and control. Our screening process compared to other airports we've seen is antiquated. At this point, we can get people through the TSA lines more quickly and with so much less stress.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'With with new with new technology. And to use the the entire floor of the Great Hall for a travel related cattle call is is offensive at one level. I mean this is a world class beauty. You know, the are the jets and terminal is just stunning.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And we it should be a place where people can relax, wander, shop if they care to have a drink while waiting for someone to come in off a plane. The interior of the Great Hall should at least begin to approach the elegance of the roof above it.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So as I said, I'm clear the project needs to get done, but the project is only part of the equation. The big thing is the deal and trying to understand if this is or is not a good deal.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I mean, first of all, what kind of lunatic would sign a 30 year contract? Right. Many of us, many of us buy our homes on on 30 year mortgages. And over the course of that mortgage, you know, I'm still I think I have about eight years left to pay on my home.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The past couple of months, I bought a new dishwasher. I'm paying off my mortgage. I bought, you know, a new a new refrigerator. And I'm going to paint my house. And in the course of the 30 years that this contract runs, God knows what's going to happen to that airport.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I mean, we may be building an entire other terminal within 30 years. It's almost assured we're going to build at least one more runway and things are going to break and need to be repaired while we're doing this.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So that concept is not all that far from. The good thing that I've come to to believe about this contract is as opposed to my mortgage, there's a lot more protections built in for the airport in this contract than I have in my mortgage.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'If the economy goes south, I could be in a big time jam. If I get sick, I could be in a big time jam. I doubt any of the staff sitting here today is going to be here working at DIA in 34 years.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But there are protections for the airport during construction. If something goes awry there, there are protections for the airport. If three years into it, Ferrovial decides they've got another project and they want to head south. So I think that is awfully important.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The taxpayers. This is important to me as I look at this contract is DIA and I excuse me for a day and then I'm still back in the old school days of DIA. The airport is an enterprise, and this project, if something happens that we can envision and it becomes a big problem, that does not roll back'",
        "'speaker_10': 'on Denver taxpayers. And right now that's important for me because this for me is a test case for P3. And I know we've had others, but this is this is a whole different level and. You know, I look at the fact that and I appreciate ferrovial expressing a willingness to reopen contact with our friends at Unite here'",
        "'speaker_10': '. But, you know, I don't know you guys. And if this were a contract where Ferrovial was going to have control over 40% of the concessions or 60% of the concessions, I don't think I'd be considering this contract. This this is, as I understand, this Ferrovial will be looking at around 15 to 20% of the concessions.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. We we've got full ownership over the airport. We've got full ownership over the Great Hall. We're trying this out to see how this goes. I remain I have concerns over. Giving up that oversight. While I fully agree with Councilman Herndon's interpretation of exactly how much oversight we have currently, but it is a give.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We're all learning about P3 and what that means, and I've said it before, but I feel it's important. I mean, I see this as a major alteration to the way we do government. You know, we we've added to the judiciary and the executive and legislative, and we're bringing private business into an area making decisions that previously have'",
        "'speaker_10': 'been legislative. And we're going to have to see how that goes. So. You know, I came in here tonight leaning towards. Yes. And that whole discussion of the labor issues. Your answer, sir, was really important to me. And I appreciate that.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'As I said, the project needs to get done. I feel we have enough assurances that it's financially sound, that the airport's protected and the taxpayers are protected. So. I'm leaning towards? Yes. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Castro. Okay, Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. President. And I appreciate Councilman Herndon's recounting as he represents the area where the airport is. He's naturally very familiar with it. I could probably tell him where the where the aliens are hiding out, though. Councilwoman Ortega and I probably recall the groundbreaking back in 89 and going out there almost every day.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'When there was nothing but a Grange Hall at some lonely country crossroads. And this this last major airport to be built in the United States. Since then, no other airport has been built new from the ground up. And it's become, what is it, a $26 billion economic generator annually for the state of Colorado.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I remember those first years. I remember those some boneheaded decisions. The toll gates. Everybody remembers the toll gates. Everybody coming into the airport had to pull a ticket even if you didn't have to pay on the way out.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It took about an hour to get out. I remember I remember asking the mayor why you were putting a fountain in the middle of the terminal overtop of a 25,000 volt electrical train system, and they ended up putting a stainless steel drip pan under it so that it wouldn't short out the train.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But by and large, it turned out to be. You remember that, right? By and large, it turned out to be a very good decision. And and I think it proved it refuted most of the criticism. It didn't go financially belly up after 18 months.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You know, we've had some issues with the soils. We've replaced a lot of concrete, but it is 22 actually the concrete's, about 25, 26 years old when that went in. And Councilman Ortega probably remembers going out there in the first years and enjoying the gypsum terminal as this wonderful place to go and sit and wait for your'",
        "'speaker_6': 'wait for your party to arrive. And and then one one day in September of 2001, some al Qaeda terrorists hijacked four jet airliners and changed our world. We designed an airport for the days before 911. And suddenly that airport had to adjust and we couldn't use the jets and terminal for the way it was meant to be'",
        "'speaker_6': 'used anymore. It became, as Councilman Cashman so aptly put, a cattle call. When I look when I look in there and I don't remember the days where we used to be able to go out and enjoy that space, it's just amazing that we're we're cramming this function into a space that was never designed for it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So for the folks who think that we're changing the Great Hall and we're messing with the airport. The Jeppeson terminal already was messed with. It was messed with on September 11. And I see this project as us reclaiming the Great Hall and making it better than even than it was in those first days.'",
        "'speaker_6': '911 changed where the hotel went. You know, I wasn't real happy when the whole I actually ran into Kurt Fentress last night and I knew who the architect for the airport. And I'm not real happy that the hotel went there, but where we were going to put it initially, 911 said, we can't do that anymore.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we had to adjust to make changes. So I believe what we're doing today is taking the Great Hall back to what it was supposed to be when it opened in 1995. Long term contracts, as Councilman Cashman mentioned, the 30 year mortgage.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The same thing applies to the $1.8 billion cost because that's not $1.8 billion today. That's over the 34 years, just like my home mortgage. In addition to paying the mortgage for 30 years, I'm also paying the heat, the light, the gas.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm fixing the roof. I'm changing out the kitchen over time. This that 1.8 billion includes 38 years. When you go out, the other three, the one on which I worked after the newspaper closed and I worked at RTD, the Eagle three project, the train to the airport, the 34 year cost of that concession agreement is significantly more'",
        "'speaker_6': 'than this $1.8 billion paying for 30 years of operations and maintenance, running electric trains in and out of the airport, and then Arvada and Westminster. So it does not scare me that this is 30 years. It has to be 30 years.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There's a reason mortgages are 30 years in. Car payments are well, they used to be three. I don't know what they are now. Seven year car loans. There's a reason for that is because you need to earn back the investment.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We have made long term deals before. Bill McNichols, when he was mayor, made a 99 year deal with the Winter Park Rec Association. Are we still in that agreement? No, we're not. We've renegotiated that, I think, twice now.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The Denver Broncos are no longer playing in Mile High Stadium. But guess what? The lease that they signed in when they added the skyboxes was supposed to expire next year. That stadium hasn't been there in 15 years. Walter Eisenberg stole some of my script earlier today when I was going to point out that the Union Station Alliance'",
        "'speaker_6': 'has a 99 year lease on on Union Station with an extension. In 1990, we entered into an agreement with the National West, with the Western Stock Show Association for the Stock Show to keep it in keep it in Denver for 50 years.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And right now, we're renegotiating all that as as we speak. We've renegotiated the Winter Park deal in 2002 with interest, and that's now a 50 year lease. So the long term nature of this contract is is just an essential part of it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's not something that should scare us off. If you were troubled, if you're out there watching or if you're sitting here in the chamber, if you are troubled by some of the cost issues, the cost increases on the hotel and a transit center project that we did.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You should like this deal because now we're turning that all over to Ferrovial for a guaranteed maximum price, and they are responsible for any of those cost increases unless we add some scope out of that contingency. You should like that because hopefully you won't see those kind of headlines from our management of this project as we deal'",
        "'speaker_6': 'with the inevitable changes. When Ferrovial takes down a wall and finds something that. Is that their risk? That's their issue to fix. The biggest concern that I had going into this was that this takes away the city council's authority to approve or disapprove concession contracts for the 30 years of operations and maintenance.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And as I sat down, I read through the concession agreement and found it is a living document that the the pyramid that the Ferrovial and the airport will sit down every two years and say, where are the trends going?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'How can we changes? How can we maximize the return on this project that makes more sense than what we're doing now because we lock in our concessions for much longer than that. And they're all staggered. This is a much more coordinated approach to doing to redoing that great hall and managing it in a more holistic way.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It makes makes much more sense. Great hall partners can have much more flexibility and be much more nimble in responding to market changes than we could be even out on the concourses. And then I realized that for as long as I've been here covering airport concessions here on the council or at the newspaper.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We have never turned down a concession contract at the airport brought to us. Not that that's a reason to turn it over to you. But the only two contracts concessions I can recall being pulled were two concessions in 1993 that that I and my partner, the Rocky Mountain News, wrote about some some kind of issues that had'",
        "'speaker_6': 'that existed with the proposals. And I see you laughing again. And Mayor Webb pulled them. Those are the only two concession agreements I've ever seen not go through and had nothing to do with the council. So turning this over to Ferrovial for that 30 year old M period, along with the parameters and the safety that we have'",
        "'speaker_6': 'in the concession development and management program. I have a lot of confidence that that this will be a very good and beneficial project for the city. And so, Mr. President, I'll be happy to support this. And I'd ask my my colleagues who are still on the fence to consider all the all that I've just said and vote'",
        "'speaker_6': 'yes. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilman Flint. Councilman Lopez.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you. Council President Brooks. I had to struggle with this decision and have made my myself clear to the folks in the airport community. The advocates. For me, having a say is a big deal. Not because. Because of a power dynamic.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Because it's public. Because this is a public airport. It was our time as a public that built this airport. And it is our oversight over the years that built the airport, the public. At this council and one previous but us.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And that that's that's who we are. You know, I did get an opportunity to see some of the other airports. And I was impressed by so. But their private. And we cannot compare apples and oranges when it comes to private and public facilities.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I want to make something very clear before we start and before I make some additional points. Being that we are a public airport. However this shakes out. We are the public. This council represents Denver. That's the interest that we have at this table.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And it's nothing to laugh at. It's nothing to sneer at. It's nothing to be taken lightly. This is something that is sacred to us and our say. In these matters are absolutely sacred. And that's something that you can't take lightly.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And not only affirming that we are public, but we are also watching. A Labor violation, we will know about it. Discrimination either as a concessionaire. In a contract, an unfair process and unfair labor practice. We're watching. And we have the authority to act and we will maintain the authority to act.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And that's something that we will always have. That is the difference between a private entity and a public. And let's not get that confused. Right. This is a contract. But we don't give up our ability to make policies that govern the our our our asset as a public.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So I want to make that absolutely clear. And knowing that, have a little bit more assurance. Of our role. Now, 34 years is absolutely a long time. My baby girl will be 44. Right. But what are we getting for those 44 years?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'You know, I know some houses that I wouldn't. But I would detest. Having to pay for for 34 for 30 years on a loan like that. There are some bad deals that we can get locked into just because, you know, there are other deals out there with the same amount of time doesn't mean that we can.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'My other issues labor. And it's dear to me because I've organized workers at this airport in my previous life. I know what it is like. I've seen it. But I also know what it is like when somebody is respected on the job.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'You've had a lot of different fights. And every single one of them, they've been settled. Why? Because it's public. We don't have the. The the. If you would call it. Right. We don't we don't have the the luxury.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I wouldn't call it a luxury. They just ignore it. Right as as some practices are in the private sector, I will just ignore them, let them scream their lungs out. We'll have security deal with them. Absolutely not. This is a public airport.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And in this public airport, the dishwasher is going to get the same amount of respect as the ironworker, as the greeter. A job is a job in the eyes of the airport and in the eyes of the public.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And it is with the exact same dignity that we treat those jobs. So although I very much applaud the what's written in the contracts, the prevailing wage, you know, the incentives, the benefits, the apprenticeship opportunities that's given to one part of labor.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I would expect that to extend over to the folks that are making a third of the way. Your dishwasher's. Your cooks. Your preps. The cashiers. We brag all the time about how our airport is beautiful and sparkling clean.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Well, it doesn't happen automatically. It doesn't happen with elves at night. These are real people. My father was one of those real people in downtown. Let me tell you a little story. Every time my dad and his company as a janitor making minimum wage.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Would be outbid at a building. They'd have to leave. He'd have to find another job. And with that, we'd have to find another house. I look at George because he wrote about this one time when he was a reporter.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'There's no secret. That I bounced around from one place to the other to the point where it was actually an issue when I was running for office, because they couldn't determine exactly where the hell I lived. That is because my father had to change houses every single time to the point where we actually moved in a home'",
        "'speaker_11': 'where I didn't fit anymore. And with that was a new level of poverty. To the point where I was out by 17. That's what happens when you don't have retention. That's what happens after ten years of or a few years of working.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And then all of a sudden you're let go and you've got to start anew again. Making minimum wage. These aren't just issues of ideology. These are real lives that we're talking about. And in 34 years, that's a few generations.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And are we going to sign a contract that's going to be 34 years of poverty or 30 years of 34 years of prosperity for people who are working at the airport. Right. These are the maintainers of our airport.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'When it comes to the concessionaires. I want to make sure and I've made this clear. That if you're a CDB. You or a small business person in Denver. Whether you sell burritos or hamburgers or yoga or whatever, you have that idea.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'When somebody asked me, Hey, how can I get into the airport? How can I work at the airport? Oh, my God, that seems like a killer opportunity. I said, Well, first you got to win the lottery. You have a better shot at winning the lottery than working at the airport.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I'm sorry. As a concessionaire that needs to change. And this this program needs to be. Impartial. Right. When I go to different airports, I don't want to go to the same old stores at every airport in every city.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I want to see I want to taste that city if I'm if I am there just on a layover. I want to experience Denver. Right. That's what it's about. I. I wasn't. No. I want to make sure. Ferrovial.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'You were on record. People here testified on record. When it comes to somebody wanting to organize. I don't believe in exclusivity, but I believe in Fox's opportunity and the right to form a union. I don't care if it's at an airport.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I don't care if it's at a farm field. I don't care if it's in one of our buildings in this very building as well. That needs to be maintained. That needs to be defended. And again, in the public sector, there are other practices.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But here, that's not our practice here. That's a value of our city. Right. And you're seeing this over and over again. And I've been part of different councils to see how this has grown. It is essential. That freedom, that opportunity.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Right. And. With that. And we have our job to do as council now, as council members announced to be that check and balance. Now, last thing I will end with. We will have a retention ordinance. If you cannot create that policy.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Which was told to us in committee. We will. And as a matter of fact, we have begun. And so that is something that is that is essential to us. I don't want to wait till you have to do it.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I want to see the steps being taken before we have to make it policy. And that goes. Also, it surprised me that the prevailing wage that we offer for some folks in the building aren't extended to the least among us.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The least paid. Right. There's a lot of people that look like me. I want to make sure that they have that that. That opportunity as well, too. We can we shouldn't pick and choose what jobs deserve, prevailing wage and what don't.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So I think that's something that I really, really want to look into at the end of the day. I am leaning towards a yes. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. Thank you, Councilman Lopez. Councilwoman Cannick.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilwoman Candace, let me just say this real quick. The air is off in here and we're working on getting it on for you. Incredible people. Okay. One thing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I noticed that as I took my sweater off and it's a very strategic move, Charlie, to get things get things.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Going. Turns off it at midnight.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I've got zero steps up here for the this state in August. So thank you to all those who testified. Thank you to the contractor and the team and to to the good good questions from my colleagues there, I think, are three things that we're obligated to explore here.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'One, is this the right project? Two, is this the right contract? Three, is this the right partner? And I think that from the questions we had, you may not think that we're concerned about some of the financial components.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That because for me personally, I didn't ask a lot of questions about that. And that is because I spent about 6 hours of time, both with various members of the team and talking to other folks and experts looking at that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And what I found was really encouraging. Councilman Lopez described the checks and balances, and I start with a fair bit of skepticism about P threes because they throw off the balance of the public sector transparency, accountability, ability to control and evolve.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so I start with skepticism about that loss of balance in that check in the system. But here are some of the features that that I think are important to note. We retain ownership, right? We're not turning over the asset.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We get approval over a number of components, the concession plans and other things. That is not a feature in all of these agreements to be able to have approval rights over some of these personnel and especially over policies.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Our key policies do apply, be them contracting policies or the auditor's ability to audit worker policies. I shared a lot of concerns in committee and probably spent a lot of time asking questions about the compensation event. One of my top concerns with privatization of public assets is the fact that if we have to change our approach, then'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I it appalls me that we have to pay a contractor for things that we have to do to protect the public interest, safety, whatever it is. So I spent a lot of time and even as late in the day as I forget what it was.'",
        "'speaker_3': '420 today learned that the compensation events do not require us to pay this contractor if there are changes in policy that apply to the entire airport and aren't just focused on them in terms and it took six definitions sorted out at the exact same time to get there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So in my defense, that's why I didn't get it till 420 today. But but because it looks like we'd have to pay for those things. But when you sort through the definitions, we can change the policies we need to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To Councilman Herndon's point, there is responsibility on the part of this council to take responsibility for policy, not just on worker issues, but it might be on other issues, safety, for example, in the future. But we will not have to pay for those changes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That is a key. I could not vote for this contract if that were the opposite. And we are going to have public auditor access, which means beyond my expertize during the years of this contract, if something's going awry, there's an.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Expert team that can have.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Access. So that is a fair bit of protection, control, influence and standards for a deal like this. So I appreciated Councilman Herndon's comment that no no deal is perfect. The part of this deal that is concerning is the lack of a final design on the airport pieces or the airline pieces.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's a concern. If there were support in this council to delay this contract to get that resolved, that would be the prudent thing to do. The prudent thing to do would be finish your design, enter into your contract.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This is not a best practice to be knowing that you're looking at changes when you sign a contract. It's just not. Having listened to the comments tonight and watched the vote in committee, I don't think there's the votes for that delay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So this contract isn't perfect, but but I am weighing that risk right about that piece. The design. Is this the right project? So we talked about the deal and it's a it's a better deal than many public private partnerships.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is this the right project? I share the analysis of my colleagues about the need for the redesign of security. I spent, what, 36 minutes waiting for it for a6am flight to get through security? That's not an acceptable wait time, I don't think.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think that I was not a fan of the walk through retail. I will share the key factor that got me there because I and I heard from constituents on this, I probably heard from more constituents on that fact than any other aspect of this deal.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Right. And there are wide walkways and we actually have a written standard about how wide the walkway has to be. So people actually aren't trapped in a sense that they can't get through with their bag. They are trapped in a in a narrow mall place that they can't get out of.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's not like an IKEA. Right. And so I don't love that piece of the design, but I am satisfied that we have a standard so that people who are in a hurry can get through quickly. And so I'm there on that piece of the design.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Obviously, the airline piece applies to this project as well, so then we get to the point of the partner. So I was surprised how far I was able to come on this contract. Coming into this meeting today. But I was stuck on is this the right partner?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And, you know, again, I just want to clarify for members of the public who may not be aware, why is the council asking all these questions about workers and labor? There's values involved, as Councilman Lopez said, but there's actually an economic interest.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The airport is a revenue generating economic enterprise for the city and county of Denver. We have a labor dispute going on. That labor dispute has resulted in bad media. It has resulted in protests and, you know, other actions at the airport that are, frankly, a turnoff to the traveling public and they represent an economic threat to our'",
        "'speaker_3': 'asset. Right. A major I mean, in fact, labor disruptions are such a risk. They're named in this contract as an economic risk. So we have this financial interest in the airport and disputes, lawsuits, things like that are a risk to us.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I believe that risk needs to be managed. We are neutral on what the outcome of these conversations are, right? That's for the parties to figure out. But the fact that it's my expectation that public entities sit down and talk and they sit down and listen.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's the kind of partner we need to be doing business with. And I you know, it's rare to see a conversation move in this chambers the way that this one did tonight. But but I think that is is really for me, the important part is that I got to know because we I mean, I meant what I'",
        "'speaker_3': 'said. There will be people mad at this contractor. There will be there will be legal threats. There will be disputes. And I need to know that no matter who those parties are, if they are minority contractors, if they are my active contractors, concessionaires, that this partner will do what our airport would have done, which is to meet'",
        "'speaker_3': ', talk, listen and not a not not shut the door. And so so that's the part I was stuck on and I heard move movement on that tonight. So. So I am ready to support this agreement. It's not perfect, but it is strong.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And the agreement, you know, the project is strong. And I got to get to know this partner better. Councilman Cashman, I hate following you because you cover everything, but I too, you know, need to get to know you better and know that this commitment isn't a fleeting in the chambers kind of moment, but that it's really who'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you are and that you are going to stick through hard conversations. So. So, you know, I'm taking that leap of faith, but and I expect the folks you meet with to do that in good faith and to call a cease fire on, you know, negative press and other things and have a quiet, private conversation.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I expect that of them to. Okay. With that, I'm ready to say yes. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right, Councilwoman, can each thank you. Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I'm sorry that we're spending all this time doing what most folks would observe as committee work on the floor. I appreciate the time that we are taking because we actually only had 30 minutes of discussion when this came to our committee, and it only came to committee one time for us to actually see'",
        "'speaker_9': 'the. Tales of this steel. So the fact that we're having that we have this many questions and we're having this much discussion is a result of of feeling like this was a rushed process. We did extend this contract one time at the request of the contractor because there were some things that were identified that resulted in, you'",
        "'speaker_9': 'know, having to make some additional changes to the design. And we could have done the same thing by this council asking for an extension to allow us to get all of our questions answered. I think the fact that we had an extra one week delay because the public hearing was postponed until tonight, gave some of us a'",
        "'speaker_9': 'little bit more time to get our questions answered. I do appreciate the time that airport staff has spent with me and and others within the city to get my over 70 questions answered. I tried to do my best to plow through the contract.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'There were several of us who. We're really feeling under the gun. So we actually hired an attorney or we consulted with an attorney who had followed up with our city attorney's office until we were told that we had no jurisdiction to.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We didn't have the authority to do that. But that's how how. I guess uncomfortable some of us were in trying to really understand the details of this legal document, this legal contract. And it was very much written in legal terms.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You know, you read one page and it refers you to several different sections. And unless you had a hard copy in front of you, it's hard to do that. Or you have to have multiple screens to be able to jump back and forth to the different sections to really completely understand what we were obligating the city to'",
        "'speaker_9': '. I have no doubt that Ferrovial brings the expertize to the table. Having seen the work that they do at the Heathrow Airport, and I appreciate the fact that DIA took several of us to see the security systems in both Heathrow and Schiphol Airport to understand what we were looking at as part of the new technology for this'",
        "'speaker_9': 'airport. I think that will be. An incredible. Improvement in addition to to our airport that will, to a large degree, help with some of the throughput concerns that were expressed by our airline folks. But I think we're still sort of at the mercy of TSA to have adequate staffing to ensure that we can move and process people'",
        "'speaker_9': 'quick enough to ensure that we don't have the backup and the co-mingling of traffic on level six. Everyone that I've talked to that's had any direct involvement with P3 deals has been very clear, and we've read this in many of the articles that it is more expensive to finance these deals privately than it is to use our'",
        "'speaker_9': 'public financing tools to do them. I understand why DIA is looking at this because of the other improvements that we're looking at that will add more debt to to this important asset. I am the sole member on this dais who was actually here when we built the airport.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I serve on this council with a team of colleagues who believe that this. Airport was going to be the economic engine that it truly has become and will continue to be for for a very long time. And I don't think there's anyone here that's more committed than I am having, you know, had that history and involvement.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And, you know, I take the time to go out to the airport and to meet and talk with some of the concessionaires and to to better understand what some of the issues are from from their perspective, as we have, you know, those contracts that move through our process.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Councilman Herndon mentioned that. You know, we shouldn't have complacency. And I don't think anyone here who is raising questions about this particular long term deal is is saying that we're settling for mediocrity or that we're not committed to some of the changes that I think are important that need to be made.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And, you know, over time, we've seen many changes to this airport and will continue to do so. As we expand, we build the seventh runway, we add the extra gates to keep growing as this airport has. So I don't you know, and when you look at the fact that we have had some ten year contracts, those are'",
        "'speaker_9': 'basically for those concessions that are doing restaurants because of the capital investment that they have to make and looking at the opportunity to recoup some of that investment over over time. Some of the key elements of my concerns have.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We're raised around transparency and the process. Councilman Herndon and I did sit on a committee. This was completely different than a negotiating committee that Kathy Reynolds and I sat on where we were basically closing down McNichols Sports Arena and working with cranky sports to open the Pepsi Center.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We were actually members of that negotiating committee. We were thoroughly familiar with the details of the deal. We were keeping our colleagues, you know, informed of the changes as they were moving through the process so that we didn't get so far out, that we had to take, you know, ten steps backwards to bring everybody along.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'This process was informing us of some of the timing changes that were that were happening, but we were never involved in any of the details of the deal as it was moving through the process. I think that might have been extremely helpful to, you know, better understanding this.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Obviously, taking the trips, looking at the the technology we were looking at was extremely helpful in understanding the the technology that that we wanted to install at our airport. That, again, I think, will will move traffic quicker. But.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The fact that we're only at 30% design, we still have not addressed the airline concerns thoroughly. I'm concerned that we will begin to eat into our $120 million contingency fund. We don't know what that is going to look like until those discussions and those issues get resolved.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But the fact that we're. Moving this forward with that completely unresolved is is very concerning to me. The fact that we had a 15,000 page contract that we basically had a week to review before it came to committee.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That was part of why some of us looked at, you know, trying to get some additional assistance to help us figure out, you know, what this this obligation meant. I appreciate the fact that there are provisions in the contract that provide greater protections for the city of Denver and for for the airport as.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'This project moves through its various phases. But I, I don't have that comfort level that some of my colleagues do in terms of. Where where this deal is at. And I appreciate the work that everybody has put into it.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I guess the last couple of things I want to say is that. When you look at the fact that we've got additional expense that we're going to incur at this airport, we are extending a lot of debt on this project and would.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You know, and again, it's part of evolving and the airport wanting to. Be able to be that magnet for the region and be able to bring in more more airline traffic. Both. You know, domestically as well as internationally.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But. I want to see that our concessionaires. So so one of the issues that we talked about earlier is the fact that we will allow a concessionaire who may already be at that concentration of ownership in our terminals will in our concourses will be allowed to bid.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I would love. I think it's important that people who have concessions on A, B and C can bid to be operators on the main terminal. But at the same time, if you already have a concentration of ownership, you know, I think that gets to a place where maybe we're looking at more of a monopoly for some'",
        "'speaker_9': 'of our concessionaires. And I don't think that's fair as we want to bring in more of our local businesses to participate in this airport. So I you know, I could probably go on and on with some of my concerns.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I've been very vocal in this process during. You know, during committee in when this came to us last week about some of those issues. But I am just not there taking counsel out of having any review. And in really it's future mayors and city councils from being able to look at the concessions that will be selected.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I just want to say, having having met the folks that are part of the Ferrovial team, I think you all are nice people. I appreciate having had the opportunity to to meet with you, to ask questions. But.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That that doesn't have anything to do with where I've landed on this. And so I just am not going to be supporting this tonight. And again, thank you, everyone, who has taken the time to be here until this late hour.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But. I will not be supporting it tonight. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman Ortega. Councilman Nu.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I think we've had very little discussion about the safety improvements. There's no question we're all comfortable that it's going to be a much safer environment for all our passengers and residents. So I think we're all very clear about that.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'The also, we've had very little discussion about the quality of four wheels merchandizing. I think it's going to be a higher level of quality operation there. And so to me, a safer environment and a greater customer satisfaction to me is going to lead to greater profits in that and this whole deal.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So I think it'll be a better experience for all customers. It will lead to greater profitability. And to me that profitability is the future of our airport. We need those resources to help develop our airport and accommodate our growth and expansion.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So I'm just pleased with the deal and are pleased that we're going to manage it because most important to me and to our citizens is this whole review and evaluation system and this process we're putting in place. I'm very pleased with Gisela and her financial staff.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'I trust them. They're going to be very good to help monitor this. Our CFO, Brendan Hanlon, is a great guy and he's so sharp he's going to be involved and our city auditors, unbelievable. He's going to be ordered in.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Right, left. Paul, for Kim I to stay up late at night worrying about what he's going to look at. And most important to me is, is we're going to include the city council in this review process, give quarterly reports, answer our questions, everybody monitoring issues.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So I'm very comfortable with this whole arrangement. And and I think it's going to be the Air Force, just such an asset for our city. And I think this investment in infrastructure is just going to bring us up to a higher level of quality and recognition of the city, which we deserve.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So I'll be glad to support us tonight. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman. New Councilman Espinosa with 3 minutes before one, you know.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Sorry, Chris.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilman Herndon. I'm going to eat up here. Your goal. First, I want to thank Dan, Kim, Stu.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Aaron, George Keesler, everybody.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You know, if you've anybody has seen me in meetings.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'No, sort of.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm I'm fairly abrasive at times. And that was no different here. But I appreciate you sort of entertaining me time and again, both here.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'At my own home and out it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Out at the airport to sort of scrutinize the design.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You know, like, you know, I've.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Lamented not having a similar sort of time with the contract, not that you guys haven't been available.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But it's just that and my district has a.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Lot of things going on with it and a lot of irons in the fire, no different than anybody else, but I really still wish.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I had more.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That said, I don't think it would change anything because.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I want to also.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Extend some appreciation to the Ferrovial team. Talking with you guys on the three occasions that we did sort of more in detail dialog.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I felt like I always got.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You know.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You know, very, very.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Quick, capable answers from very professional people that understood what exactly what it was that they were trying to deliver. And and so I just want to before I go further in my comments, just to express my complete and utter appreciation for the the involvement in this very intense time period.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And you're willing your willingness to sort of accommodate us in the capacity that you did. But for me, private money isn't cheaper than bonding with our stellar credit rating. I know that we can pay the $9 Million termination fee, then design and deliver this project without a P3 arrangement.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That position is actually a consequence of your work. Denver Airport near the victims of your own success. This is not the first time I said that you put it best when you said regarding capital projects, quote, Dyn is extremely well positioned due to its size, thoughtful planning and financial stability.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You guys Denver Airport achieve that without any P3 arrangements. Today, Dan is ranked by industry publication, their World Airport Awards ninth. Best airport serving greater than 50 million passengers. Third best airport staff in North America. Second best domestic airport.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Second best airport in North America. Third best regional airport in the world. And first best regional airport in North America. Those are titles, you know, that you guys achieved today without any three arrangements. And so congratulations and kudos.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We really appreciate that because it is the economic engine that it is and vital to this area. I agree with the landside concept completely. You know, the physical design of this in approach and solution is, is, is, is.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is. Is, is. Stellar high, but its success is vulnerable to TSA performance, and that is an unfortunate reality. The contract is not an issue from a technical standpoint as it is very, very good. I mean, I have no issue with the documents that I have reviewed.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And the whole thing as as stated and presented here today is very, very, very doable, exactly as promised in the timelines and the terms. And there is a clear availability for the airport to avoid a boondoggle or to address any impediment.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I don't fear going forward with this. But given the strength and given the strength of Din, if I was the seventh vote, I would be hard pressed not to support you guys in this request. But admittedly, I have the luxury of being able to vote my conscience on this one.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And because not every loop is closed.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Labor Airlines.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'TSA design and the transfer transfer of risk means an expensive delivery method. This approach is not about to me. This approach is not about saving money. It is simply providing predictability at the expense of hundreds of millions of dollars.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Now I get why you would want to do it this way, but I still don't see any need. Cutting out council is to me authority like. And it puts distance between people and their assets. And that is not what my constituents are asking for.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm glad that the analogy of the House was brought up, but to me it's more like giving a contractor with worse credit than you a bedroom in your house to operate an Airbnb for 30 years and to all to help pay for the kitchen remodel you really need.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That is to me in a nutshell, what this arrangement is and unnecessary.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So again, everything I've said it for that I'll, I'll be voting no. But it's not, it's, it's not lightly. And so I do. I don't fear going.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Forward if council chooses to move in that direction. Thank you. Thank you. Guzman. Espinosa. Guzman. Clark.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Councilwoman Kennedy said about five people ago how hard it was to go because people have covered everything that you had to say. And I think people up here have covered a lot and it's late.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And so I just wanted to say thank you to the air. I guess it's technically early. I really want to say thank you to our airport team. It is it was not an easy process to get this put together.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It was not an easy process to get to here. And it certainly was not an easy process to get the 13 of us with our unique personalities and unique needs and how we needed to dove into this all of the information that we need to be able to vote on this tonight.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I remember one day after having a bit of a mini meltdown on how many trees were being killed with the pages of print documents that were being brought to me. And I had a little mini meltdown on air and back there.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And then I ran into him in the hall the next day with just boxes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Full of binders.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And I my eyes got this big and then his eyes got this big and he said, There are other people who asked for this. There's not one here for you. And it just put into clear perspective just how hard a job you have and in getting us what we need.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And you did a spectacular job of of that and making yourselves available at the Duffy role in the spare room here. And so I just wanted to say thank you. I will say that I don't think that it's.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Possible that any of us could fully understand the 15,000 pages. It needs experts. And you are experts. I think it's even challenged Councilman Flynn, who generally catches all of our typos in the back parts of the document. And so anyone who's voting yesterday, as I will be, is doing it in large part because we are putting a'",
        "'speaker_11': 'lot of trust in our airport team. And and I think that you have shown time and again that you have earned that trust in running the airport and how you've brought this forward and the hard work that you've done to help us understand this work.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So I just wanted to say thank you and thank you, Mr. President. All I have.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman Clark. All right. Say a couple of words in this. Thank you all for being here. You went through security. Some of you pay for parking and you sat and wouldn't seats for a long time. So I really appreciate you all.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think on behalf of all the council, we really appreciate you guys. You know, I think about what we've done tonight. We approved $937 million in a very equitable and inclusive fashion for the entire city through our go bond.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We approve over $300 million of of wastewater redevelopment opportunities for the worst basin in the city of Denver. And we're taking the sixth busiest airport to the next level in the country. And there's a lot of concern over those things.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And the community is obviously alarmed because we're going from a small town to a small, big city. We are becoming an international destination. And this is what international cities do. They make bold moves. And this is bold. But in the in the grand scheme of things of of international destinations, New York, LaGuardia just approved a $4 billion'",
        "'speaker_1': '. And they need to do it a $4 billion improvement to their airport. So I know a lot of us keep doing those comparisons to our homes and our living rooms. It's not apples to apples. We're on a new level.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We are competing globally. So the vision that our great mayor, Mayor Paine, you had is coming to fruition. And so it's hard for all of us, but this is the right direction. Let me just tell you why I'm supporting this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Authority versus influence. See, we have authority over a lot of things. A city council. And we think we have authority. But really, what we do is have influence and this P-3. Gives us and remains, you know, maintains that influence.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think. The authority of having every ten years a concessions agreement come through city council. We will lose that. But the influence for me to sit with Nacho and his business partners and say, I don't like how this is being run, I will still have that ability and I don't think people understand that or get that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I still can go to any. Even though they may not come through city council, any agency, head and even business in the city and say we need to get this done for our community. And that is the influence which we hold as City Council.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So to say that you've taken our power away is not accurate authority versus influence. We still have an incredible influence. I talked about the world class airport, Sanders construction as a kind of clean it up a little bit in Denver and I love what you guys do.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I love that you connect with local contractors. I love that you connect with local unions. And to have these contracting unions come in and speak about you being connected to them, I mean, that already had me so excited.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So thank you guys for being a local organization that is serious about employing local folks and contracting business. And then no one really has been talking about this. And I think people are afraid to talk about magic. And but I'm a I'm going to tell you why I'm excited to talk about an African-American investor in this city'",
        "'speaker_1': 'for the first time at this level, I am a static because there are African-Americans in this city to do not feel like they are a part of the success in Denver. And I'm holding on to it because now there is an there's a gateway.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There's an opportunity. And we have. Research Magic Johnson, not just when he played, but his actual business and his actual dealings in other cities. And we're excited about that opportunity in Denver because it's much bigger than just the airport.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's about the community. And thank you for already coming to the community and engaging in the community and Ferrovial, I appreciate you being honest and working with the community. I think Councilwoman Canete had some points of, yeah, we got to continue to work with folks even when they're not.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Being the best. You know, they're they're protesting against us and things like that. We deal with that all day. I got people protesting me right now. Right. But we continue to engage because in public life, it's our duty to be kind to people in their misunderstanding or their understanding of us.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right. And so that's the way we want to be. That's who we are as Colorado. And I sense that you're going to do that. I sense that you're going to be a part of that. And so to the airport, thank you so much for your hard work.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I feel like you guys worked like crazy. But now the real work begins to get this thing done. So thank you all for being here. We are going to move this thing for. Madam Secretary, roll call.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hi.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Clark.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hi.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Espinosa. Hey, Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Hi.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Gilmore.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Abstain.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Herndon high fashion can each.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Lopez right.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You. Something happened. Okay. Ortega. No, Sussman. I. Mr. President, I.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Got the following results.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Ten eyes two. Nays one.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Abstention two. Nice to net two names. One Abstention Council Bill 822 has passed. Congratulations. See no other business before this body was manager.'"
