        "'speaker_0': 'Why, certainly, Mr. President. Thank you. Proclamation number 682 Recognizing and Celebrating Denver Sister Cities International Worldwide Festival on September seven, 2014. Whereas, following the mayhem of the World War Two in 1948, Denver Sister Cities International was founded with a relationship with Breast France and Denver and now has two friendship cities and ten sister cities, each of which'",
        "'speaker_0': 'have a public part name in its honor as a tribute to the importance of these relationships. And. Whereas, Denver Sister. Cities International is seeking to raise its visibility, grow its awareness and its global relationships and programs in concert with the city's expanding international economic and cultural studies strategy.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And. WHEREAS, Denver Sister Cities International Worldwide Festival on September 7th will celebrate the art, music, food, dance stories, culture of our ten sister cities and into friendship cities, as well as the beautiful diversity of Denver itself. And. Whereas, Denver's Worldwide Festival will entertain and educate in an accessible and inclusive manner, as befits the mission of Denver Sister'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Cities International. And. WHEREAS, Metro delegates from each of Denver sister cities have been formally invited to participate in Denver Worldwide Festival. And. WHEREAS, The City and county of Denver and Denver Sister Cities International have a strong and mutually supportive, cooperative relationship.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Now, therefore, be a proclaim by the accounts of the city and county of Denver, Section one, that the Council heartily endorses Denver's Worldwide Festival as a celebration of the cultures and diversity of Denver sister cities, friendship cities and Denver itself.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And section to that. The Clerk of the city and county of Denver shall attest and affix a seal of the city and county of Denver to this proclamation and transmitted copy thereof to Denver Sister Cities International.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Councilmember X your motion to adopt.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, Mr. President. I move that proclamation 680 to be adopted.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It has been moved in. Second comments from members of council. Councilman Brooks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I many of my council colleagues know this, and some of the folks in the city of Denver know that I'm a strong advocate in and support of Denver sister cities. It is an organization that has has a lot of history in the city of Denver.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But right about when Mayor Web went out of office, there was such a city that kind of went dormant because he was such a strong advocate of it. And since Mayor Hancock has been in office, it has it is it is gearing back up to really grow and be an effective multisector approach type of organization.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I've been really involved and I actually got excited about the research of cities because of some nonprofit work that I've done in Nairobi, Kenya. But after seeing how relationships actually catalyzes, development catalyzes a strong tie with cities, I've become a believer, a wholehearted believer in Denver sister cities, and have been able to participate in some programs with'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Denver Sisters City International in DC sat on a couple of panels talking about what? What does it mean to have a meaningful relationship with another city where it's not just cultural engagements, but it's also talking about outreaching to young people, talking about exchange is talking about economic development opportunities.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I'm a I'm a believer. And, you know, we get this program. This is a nonprofit. They are not what the city of Denver, you know, some people think that they probably should be, but they're not with the city of Denver.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They're a nonprofit program. And we invest probably anywhere in the neighborhood of $20,000, somewhere around there. I think Beth Hendricks, the executive director, let me know. And I believe that is a steal, because just for one delegation to fly here and stay in Denver, a delegation of 15 folks like we have with Nairobi, it is $50,000.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so it is a return on investment to begin building relationships with other other cities internationally. Someone who's doing a great job with that is San Francisco. San Francisco has 26 or so. They say we'll take what anybody wants to be a friendship city and a sister cities.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Come on. And what they do is every time there's a delegation from one of their sister cities or friendship cities, they fly the flag right outside the mayor's office. The mayor greets them and then they go meet with folks from economic development.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They go meet with the folks from visit Denver, they go meet with the cultural institution folks. And I said, Man, that's a great idea. And because of that, they're finding that these countries and these cities are beginning to invest into San Francisco.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I hope it's something that we can grow into. And I want to say one more thing on one of the trips. That we were trying to build a relationship with Kunming, China. There's so much interest from China, especially in Denver, because they feel like the port cities are oversaturated and they really like the availability of'",
        "'speaker_0': 'DIA. And this has gotten. Paul Washington, our executive director of the Economic Development, so busy that he has hired someone over international trade, Abdul Sosa. And and so this, you know, this these little relationships with these places have kind of grown into a serious effort, economic effort for a city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we need to continue to encourage our Sister Cities International. And so I'm excited for this worldwide festival where we've invited every Denver sister cities, officials and mayors. I hope I hope we get maybe five, ten mayors to come by here and enjoy Denver and we'll show them a good time, do another proclamation if they all come'",

    "Proposed amendments to Inclusionary Housing Ordinance (IHO) (SAFETY & WELLBEING) Presentation will be followed by 15-minute public comment period The Committee approved filing this bill at its meeting on 8-5-14.": [
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes, Mr. President, I move that council bill 625 625 Series 2014 be.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Ordered.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'By Microsoft on final construe.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'By.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Consideration and.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Do pass. Yes, it has been moved and seconded. Councilman Brooks, your motion to amend?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, I moved to amend council with 625 in the following particulars on page seven 931 under section 27, one of three definitions sub paragraph Z, Special Revenue Fund. Add the following language to the definition. Not withstanding the foregoing, the director shall adopt as part of the rules and regulations a reservation for a portion of alternative contribution payments'",
        "'speaker_0': 'paid by applicants from high need downtown areas as as defined in the rules and regulations. This reservation shall be held for payments for MPD use created in the same or approximate neighborhood. The reservation shall take priority over all other purposes of the Special Revenue Fund for a reasonable time as defined by the rules and regulation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Thank you, Councilman. Books for the amendment in those particulars is now time for comments from members of Council on the amendments. Councilman Brooks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I'm going to I'm going to read. The purpose of this amendment first, and then I'm going to some other comments and also some questions. First, I want to start off by saying Councilwoman Canete has just been very gracious.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And after all of the comments last week, we had a great conversation. And I just said, you know, there's still some issues that that I would love to work out. And it's about ensuring that we have these downtown units in downtown.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I'm going to read some some some particularly, but she's been great in helping me get to this point. The purpose of this amendment is to direct the Office of Economic Development to adopt the rules that define a high need downtown area, that require a portion of the payments made in lieu of building affordable units from the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'area. To be set aside, it directs that fund. Those funds will be set up for a reasonable period of time for the purpose of preserving or creating new affordable housing and paying incentive payments for projects that build affordable units in the defined area, downtown area, or proximate to the don't define downtown area.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This this amendment is based on historical data that we receive from OED, as they reported in their annual report for the council record, demonstrating that more than 50 to 52% of its units that were lost in the cash in lieu payments came from the downtown area.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Developers in all areas are treated exactly the same under this ordinance. They receive the same incentive payments. If they build, they pay the same buyout amount if they pay in cash instead of building. The only thing this amendment does is to prioritize how the city spends the dollars after they have received.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'After they are received, we have lost more units to buyouts from downtown than any other high area. So the amendment prioritizes dollars from the downtown for the use of the vicinity when we can in the hopes of making making up for that loss.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I also want to point out that in the high zone, if you look at all of the High Zone as proposed in councilman, can each the downtown area is disproportionately affected by that high zone, meaning it's 1800 acres and it's larger than any other high zone in the city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so for those reasons and many others, I put this amendment forward in working in partnership with Councilwoman Canete, and I hope that my colleagues will support it. I will also say in the particulars that will be in in the rules and regulations, what we're looking at is that this fund, we cannot tap into the existing FHL'",
        "'speaker_0': 'fund, but this is going forward any, any new projects that buy out in cash in lieu, 50% will be set aside just for this area. It would be set aside for two years, 24 months, and seeing if there's any projects that are in the pipeline, if they're not there, be distributed just as obviously economic development will do'",
        "'speaker_0': 'any other project. So with that, I'll take questions or comments. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Councilmember Councilwoman McHugh, Councilman Councilmember Councilwoman Canete.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. President. And I want to share, as the sponsor of this of this ordinance, that I support this amendment. I do appreciate Councilman Brooks working with me. And I think the spirit of allowing some of these particulars, the number of months, the percentage to be again in regulation, just like the other metrics in this ordinance'",
        "'speaker_1': ', is a good way to keep consistency that we are allowing us to be more responsive. So I want to thank him for his effort. And as a sponsor, I will be supporting this amendment and urge my colleagues to do the same.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilwoman Lemon.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I will be supporting this amendment as well, because my goal is affordable housing is to get affordable housing near jobs. And this amendment does just that. However, I will be voting against the ordinance because I don't think that it is structured to make a significant difference.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Lemon. Councilwoman.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. I'd like to ask the sponsor just to clarify crystal clear what proximate means. So does that means it's like the statistically. Just explain for us what that means. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So the approximate neighborhoods would be Union Station would be Arapahoe Square, it would be civic center as as defined in the bill. You know, this is you know, we can have a larger conversation. And I think this is why we wanted to not specify it and make it too prescriptive, but we wanted to make it reflective of'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the downtown area plan.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I just want to be clear, are are you using a broad definition of proximate are you actually trying to target a few specific neighborhoods but that you're not? We're using them within the context of the amendment. May I as as the ordinance sponsor.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mr. President, to clarify. Go ahead. Yeah. So, Councilwoman Shepard, I'm chiming in because this word proximate wasn't created for this amendment. It actually exists in the other portions of the ordinance that I worked on. So and the intent really was to allow for logic, really.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so the idea is that it's not strictly defined because what happened before is it used to say the same or adjoining statistical neighborhoods. So for example, Union Station is part of the downtown vicinity, but it doesn't touch Civic Center.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so you couldn't take a unit from Union Station and build it in Civic Center. You wouldn't you would be prohibited because it wasn't close enough. It didn't touch. So the idea was to kind of eliminate the requirement that the statistical neighborhoods have to touch and instead allow the department to make a determination.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so like many things in law, you know, it gets defined either in rules and regulations or through policies of the department. And it's specifically intended to allow for the vicinity of downtown. As as Councilman Brooks said, the downtown area plan, you know, it encompasses a area and it encompasses Arapahoe Square.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So if it kind of looks and smells like it's in the area, then there's no reason for us to prohibit units from going from one part of that area to another part of the area. Thank you for the clarification.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Sheppard. And Councilman, can each. Councilwoman Sussman.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I like Councilwoman Lehman. I'm going to support this amendment, though. I'm not going to be supporting the I. So I do see this amendment as addressing one of the more serious weaknesses of the I show.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I'm happy that Councilman Brooks brought this forward. But still, I think there are other weaknesses that make me feel like I cannot support the whole I echo.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Sussman, do we have any other comments on the amendments seen on voting on the amendments? Councilman Brooks. Move forward, ma'am. Secretary Roll call.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Brooks I round.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Five.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Fights no carnage i liman i Lopez II Montero I nevett i Ortega I Rob I. Shepherd i. Susman, i. Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Couple of thoughts. Madam Secretary, please close the line. And then after a lot.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Of advice, one day.'",
        "'speaker_2': '12 hours, one day, the 65 has passed as amended. Now, Councilwoman Lehman, we need to put 65 on floor to do pass as amended.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I move the council. The council. It's 625. A series of 14 be placed on the floor for final consideration and do pass as amended.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So it has been moved and seconded. Do we have any comments from members of Council?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Councilwoman Ortega It's a question for the city attorney. Do we need to republish this? Is this enough of a substantive change that it requires that?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'David Broadwell, Assistant City Attorney. Since this floor amendment changes neither the title nor the description, the charter and rules do not require republication of the bill. You are free to adopt it tonight.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Great. I'd like to just make a brief comment.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Go right ahead.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'First of all, I want to thank Councilwoman Kimmich, the members of the committee that worked with her folks from our Office of Economic Development, Larry Hagman from the city attorney's office for all your work in bringing forward these changes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Councilman Brooks and I had a conversation earlier today about the amendment. The language, I think, reads that gives enough flexibility that if there is a project close enough to downtown, that will benefit workers who work downtown. I think there's that flexibility that our staff will have to ensure that we're not letting projects go by the wayside and'",
        "'speaker_6': 'have funds in a pot where we can't get these projects done. Again, it does not tap into the existing funds that sit in the pot of money. I think these changes are good. I know we had testimony from people who were here when we had our public hearing expressing concerns.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Again, without the ordinance, we wouldn't have seen the Affordable For Sale units created that exist in the city today, many of which were. Offset, if you will. And there are units that are at some of our larger residential development at Lowry, I mean, at Stapleton and out at Gateway.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But, you know, we have families that are living in those units now that have benefited from the funds that were created that help offset the cost that got families into those units. Sorry, that's my family. So I just hope that all of my colleagues will allow this to move forward.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And the changes that are made, I think, will be good in terms of giving greater flexibility to our city staff to assist in the creation of units, which is really the bottom line of why this ordinance was created in the first place.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It was not to encourage more people buying out. It was to encourage units to be built in this city. As we were starting to see high density development and we were starting to see units high density happen all all across the city.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So thank you again, Councilwoman Canete and I will be voting yes for this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Ortega, Councilwoman Canete.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I will keep my substantive comments brief, but I do at the end of this process, need to thank some of the folks who really are here tonight and some of whom are not. But it involved many people getting to tonight, all of whom are critical, all of whom worked hard.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Regretfully, more than one of whom missed a piece of their vacations to hit key deadlines or to be at key meetings. Please don't raise your hands. But I need to thank my staff, Laura brzezinski and Fabian. That's on it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The Office of Economic Development. Many of them were here till midnight last Monday, but they pulled data. They educated us on their internal processes and gave feedback along the way. Economic and Planning Systems. David Schwartz was here last week, our legal team, Laurie Heideman and Adam Hernandez, very integral partners every step of the way, not just in'",
        "'speaker_1': 'drafting, but in every step community planning and development. And we had, you know, industry groups as well as foundations that funded the economic study because we as the city didn't have the funds to fund the studies. So we fundraised for that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I appreciate all the stakeholders, many of whom voted on both sides or commented on both sides, but all of whom I appreciated being at the table from the beginning. And also the constituents. They came to meetings, they sent emails, they made calls, they engaged, they got educated, added a degree I haven't experienced previously.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In my three years on council, I heard from a lot of individuals and to my colleagues who voted yes last week and to whom I hope will also be voting this week. You know, it is it is not easy to make policy without unanimity, but it is an important obligation of government.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And it's one that I appreciate my colleagues joining me in. We make this policy tonight and I'll just you know, the two summaries from last week were one simply stated, without this ordinance, homes would not be built at this income level.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They just wouldn't. So we know that zero homes we built at this income level, without it, we can debate how many, whether there could be more. But period, no homes would get built at this income level without these this ordinance, the complex part, this ordinance does balance a bunch of interests and it lowers production requirements in ways'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that benefit developers. And that balance is a hard one to achieve. And this is the best balance that we could do in this city. We could create a lot more units if we gave up some of those pieces that impact developers less.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But we've chosen not to intentionally, out of respect for the role that private development plays in our economy and the importance of them being able to produce the market rate units. So it's a tough balance, but this ordinance does achieve it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The last thing that I think it requires underlining is the phenomenal thing that occurred in this chambers a week ago, which is that out of 23 speakers, almost every single one of them was unified in the importance of this city.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Taking a bigger next step for resources. We have heard from our residents. We every year survey thousands of residents about the city and county of Denver, and we asked them what they like about the city and what their least favorite characteristics are.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And last year, the least favorite characteristic our residents noted was the affordability of housing in this city. This is not just about poverty, it is about poverty, but it's not just about that. That issue resonated with all of our constituents.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thousands, thousands of residents were surveyed. The mayor's housing advisor. There have been many mayors and there have been many advisory committees, and each and every one of them has said we need to focus on a revenue source as long ago as 2006.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That has been a priority from advisory experts. This council has spoken twice in our annual priorities, stating that revenue is really important. We have a moment, can't create a moment, but sometimes you find yourself in a moment. And, you know, I think that I really have to call on the mayor.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We're going to debate in a few minutes his first investment, $3 million into a new fund. And that's really important. But I call upon the mayor to hear the moment that's been created, to hear the unanimity among diverse voices, and to help lead us.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have many ideas. There are many paths we can take, but we do need him to lead us that next step. And I think that we'll have plenty of others that have, at least in the debate last week, said, I'd love to serve on that issue committee or work on that topic.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we have new leaders emerging to join you and that but we need you and I implore you this week that that be something we don't wait on. There are many things the city is always working on, but you don't get moments like this very often.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I hope that we take it this ordinance tonight. This is about school teachers. It's about security guards, and it's about some of the folks who make our city run. And it's about homeownership. And I am proud of that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's one piece of the puzzle. And for that one piece of the puzzle, I ask for your votes and support tonight. And I thank all of you who work to help us bring it. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Kennedy. Councilman Brooks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Councilwoman McKinney, I feel bad that I didn't mean to get the last word. I wanted to say something before you did, but those are beautiful words. I'll just say this. You know, I met with a lot of folks around this bill, those who were in favor and those who were in opposition.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And unfortunate thing. I met with them all in the last week and a half. And I would love I would love to have this be a serious conversation going forward, because the leading thinkers on cities, the the the the urban, the urban ideologists all talk about affordable housing being the number one component to sustainability of the city'",
        "'speaker_0': '. And if we don't figure this out in Denver, we're going to be in trouble. And so I want to just put a public service announcement out to all those folks that I met with, many who emailed me, let's figure this out and let's do this together.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I know some folks feel like they want some folks feel like they lost in this debate. But there's a bigger there's a bigger call coming up. This this housing trust is is the big one for the city of Denver.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we've got to figure it out. And so, you know, I just I really call on those folks and then, you know, I echo Councilwoman Canisius call to to the mayor for such a time as this. Now now's the time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We need you. We need the mayoral administration to be on board. This is going to be a big deal. And we need to come to the table. And and I thank you for all those individuals who who came last week who said that they want to be at the table and you will be called on.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So thank you for that. And I will say that the mayor has brought a small group of individuals to start looking at the sustainable funding, looking at sources to to get this trust fund going. And and so he has done that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I think that conversation needs to be brought out into the community. I think there needs to be key stakeholders at the table to make this a reality as well. And lastly, I just want to just highlight comes from can each you know, and this is leadership.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You don't always agree in leadership. And and Councilwoman Canete has taken some serious arrows. And as a leader, I just appreciate the way that she's she's kind of walked in the midst of this. And so I want to thank you for your leadership.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we are up here at the dais will not always agree, but we we certainly have to respect leadership and we certainly have to respect those who move from a deep place. And she's certainly done that with this bill.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I think all of my colleagues as well the conversation although we. Beat this council. Bill, what is it? 625. Like a horse to midnight. The the the debate was rich, and it made me proud of my colleagues up here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So thank you all for for really taking this serious.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilmember. Councilman Brown. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Just as a reminder to my colleagues. Affordable homes are being sold every day in our city. Every day. According to the MLS, what is known as the metropolis. Who keeps tabs of this last year in terms of attached and detached residential properties in Denver only not metro Denver and Denver only.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There were 13,724 sales, 13,724 attached, and these detached residential property sold in Denver. Of that number, 7861 were below $300,000. That's 57% year to date. There have been 9039 attached and detached properties sold in Denver. Of the 9039 sold so far this year, 4993 were under $300,000.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's 55% affordable. Homes are being sold every day in our city, to be sure, these are not brand new homes with huge H-2A fees, I might add. Many of these are being sold as fix ups. People buy an ugly duckling and turn it into a swan is called sweat equity.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that's how many of us, including me, got into initially buying homes. I've never lived in a new home and everyone I bought, I fixed up. I saved and fixed up. Saved and fixed up. But that term sweat equity, you don't hear.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that's part of what made our country great. And it's missing. And that's why I'm not going to support this bill. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman Brown. Councilman Lopez.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I really appreciate the comments of the folks who went before me. And I really appreciate Councilman Brown's comments as well, too. I would just reply with a challenge, and that would be another question. Affordable for whom?'",
        "'speaker_4': '$300,000 is still a lot of money for a home, and there's a lot of people who in Denver cannot even afford that. There's a lot of folks in the recession. In oh eight, oh nine and 2010 that lost their homes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'After all that sweat equity, they lost their homes, everything they had. They lost those folks when we saw those names. And I met regularly with Stephanie O'Malley, who was our Kirkland recorder at the time. I saw the list.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'A lot of people of color and in neighborhoods that were hit the hardest. And it was to neighborhoods to tell to the neighborhoods that really, really got hit hard. Two areas of town below Green Valley Ranch in Westwood and Barnum Little Park.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And these are neighborhoods that we think had affordable housing. Well, in some of those neighborhoods during the recession, it was $90,000 for a home, 100 and 110, I think I remember buying my first home on that home now is over $200,000.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And do you think those folks who lost their homes in foreclosures can come back and buy that house that they bought for 110 or 90 or 120? I'll come back and throw down 200 grand on a home. I don't even think they'd be able to walk in and get a loan.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'As a matter of fact, there's a lot of discrimination and a lot of a lot of unethical practices at the bank. When you walk up and you look like somebody from the West Side or from East End and try getting a loan.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There's still a lot of uphill battles. There's still a lot of issues that this bill does not address. We scratched the surface with this bill, but let's be real. There is a huge lack of affordable housing for a lot of people.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And these are folks who originally have called Denver home for decades and no longer can call Denver home because it's unaffordable. I'm sure I absolutely believe in sweat equity. You folks the opportunity to make things happen, to build the American dream and their home, and they will do it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But unfortunately, a lot of those old homes that you're seeing that are being bought up, folks are renovating, they're not staying there. They're turning around and selling it, making a lot more, and they're not selling it. The folks I'm talking about.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And it's become increasingly hard. And it is a problem in Denver when you cannot afford a house in Westwood, Farnham or Globeville. Oh, that is a problem in Denver. And we have a problem. That's just the for sale market when it comes to rentals.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Somebody's got to pay for all that granite countertop they put in there and those new homes. Someone's got to pay for that. And that goes on the backs of the renters. It is impossible to find a one bedroom apartment or a two bedroom home or even a three bedroom home.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's impossible to find a three bedroom home for a thousand bucks. And some of these neighborhoods. This is a family. And that's why we need these units built. That's why this is important. I did not like the bill at first because it lets people opt out and lets themselves buy their way out of this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I don't like that idea. But as my colleague, Councilwoman Kenney, said, this is a mixture of values. This is a reflection of everybody at the table. This is sausage being made. And I as much as I am unhappy with some components of the bill because I don't think they address the problem even one bit.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think this is better than the current. I show that we have that everybody loves to complain about. Everybody takes their kick. This I might as well be happy, not the hanging for everybody to hit with no treats in it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we might as well if there's something in front of us. And it's not perfect, but it's a fix. This is better than the status quo. This isn't a vote to reauthorize the H0. This is to improve it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You like it the way it is, which I don't know anybody that does. Then vote no. If you want to improve it, if you want a little bit better than what it is and vote yes. The status quo is unacceptable.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I am in full support of this bill.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman Lopez. Councilwoman Commissioner.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. President. And I want to thank my colleague, Councilman Brown, for raising what's a really fair question about the number of market rate homes. We actually did ask the economists this question and you know the results.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'BBC research has clearly documented the drop in housing below 300,000 each year that's occurring so that the trend is a downward trend. A number of the new homes being built, infill homes. And you all have seen this in neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right. Are replacing those homes. So the duplex that used to be 180 is now gone. And instead there is a large, you know, 600,000 duplex in its place. So that is a documented trend. And then lastly, sweat equity doesn't buy you a new furnace and it doesn't buy you a new sewer, which as an old homeowner, I'm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'living my life today. You know, I can do some things yourself. But old homes and and our Denver Urban Renewal Authority knows this very well because they administer the program where moderate income families who have major failures on old homes go and they have ten times more demand than they can serve.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Moderate income families may be able to get into a fixer upper, but they can't repair their way out of it. And so so I appreciate the concern and and the point about the older home stock. Lastly, I will just say that, you know, the you I just want to give everyone a really specific amount.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This ordinance builds homes beginning at $140,000 for a studio. All right. And, you know, 150 for a one bedroom, 190 for a two bedroom. So that's a world of distance between those numbers and 300,000. So if you were to look specifically at those price points, which are economists did do the age of the housing stock is extraordinarily'",
        "'speaker_1': 'old and the repair costs are pretty astronomical for moderate income families in this price range. So it's about the trend, it's about the actual price and it's about what you can really afford to maintain. So we did look at those questions because I do think they're fair and they're important.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so this is this ordinance reverses the trend of new production because eventually new production will be where the market is. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Candace Romney and the comments from members of council CNN that we are voting on the motion to pass 625 as amended. Madam Secretary, roll call.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Can each by layman. Lopez. Monteiro Hi Nevitt. Hi, Ortega Hi Rob no. Shepherd I Susman no Brooks Brown no. Fats, no. Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Kim No. And I think Councilwoman Laney wants to vote again.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I do. I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I meant to vote no.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Go right ahead. All right, Madam Secretary, please call the vote. And now the results.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Seven, eight, six, nine.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Seven, nine, six. Nays Councilors 4.5 does pass on final consideration as amended. All right. Our next one, Madam Secretary, I believe, is 596 count out, called out by Councilman Lopez on bills for introduction. Councilman Lopez, what would you like to do with this?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I just wanted to make some comments. Go ahead. I thank you, Mr. President. 596 as you recall, colleagues was called out last last session so that the parties around the table can meet and confirm, make sure that small details are ironed out.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They are in the process of ironing out those details. I just wanted to let you all know that this is okay for moving forward because of its honor. It's on a tight schedule. Any deviation in the process of this bill will kill.'"

        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. I move that council bill 620 series of 2014 be ordered published.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It has been moved and seconded. Comments from members of Council Councilwoman Fox.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mr. President. This is an ordinance that creates a special revenue fund, which is an affordable housing revenue fund. If one were evaluating this ordinance only on the design of the special revenue fund it creates. It's thoughtfully constructed to combine numerous sources of money toward an affordable housing goal.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The Office of Economic Development delivered what the mayor intended. However, funds don't exist in a vacuum. This one presents several problems and issues, and I like to talk about what I see as those problems and issues. First was a massive disappointment to me.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The intention stated by OED, the Office of Economic Development in committee to seek more general fund money to seed it contradicts what I have been assured by the administration during the last budget cycle. You know, when a person goes to great lengths to compromise, you really expect that compromise to be upheld.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'What was postured as one time funding in the 2014 budget now has morphed into a way to potentially siphon off millions each year short in key basic city functions. A second issue is just I want people to understand this is not the only effort that we are doing about affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Many other funding sources exist just to name a few. There's housing for persons with AIDS, home funds, community development block grant money, inclusionary housing funds, still private activity bonds, Denver's Road Home, and the Denver Housing Authority, which actually does perhaps the best job.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's not as if the city isn't making headway. The third thing, though, and perhaps is most important, especially given the conversation of some of my colleagues tonight, is the conversation about affordable housing. Now, when I hear terms like the unanimity of all these task force, I can guarantee you, based on what I'm going to say, that a'",
        "'speaker_7': 'number of the mainstream people from my district were not a part of that discussion. This fund is based on the premise that our citizens feel it's the city's responsibility to supply taxpayer subsidized housing for workforce housing. That's a higher income level than any of the other sources allow.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And because of the social engineering aspect that the city likes to put in place, we can expect to see subsidized housing built on more expensive land. Driving up construction costs. One of the reasons taxpayers around the metro area, including Denver voters, funded fast tracks, was to give access to work places for more affordable metro areas.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Billions of dollars have already been invested with more to come. But city officials want Denver workers to be able to live in Denver. That's one of the key premises of this. This is not just about housing, about shelter.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There's another agenda afloat. I wanted to assess what my constituents think about the city's role in affordable housing. So on this your citizens survey, I asked this question. Housing prices are rising, inventory is low, and wages remain stagnant, making Denver increasingly unaffordable for many people who work in Denver businesses.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Now, I think most of you would agree that's a very fair statement. Is it the city, the city's club? Is it the city government's responsibility to see that housing is affordable for people who work in the city? The survey just went out, so I have only a week's worth of responses, but that already equates to 1287 individuals'",
        "'speaker_7': '. Only 21% said yes. It's not a scientific survey, but it clearly shows the trends and an internal thinking of the majority of people in my district. And I know from having done these surveys in the past, how to expect those numbers to move when the remainder come in.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I also asked if the city should provide developers financial incentives to build affordable workforce housing. Now, that's exactly what this fund does. 30% said yes. To understand that, I mean, 70% said no. Moreover, some of the people in my some of the people who live in my district earn less than the people intended to be subsidized by'",
        "'speaker_7': 'this fund. Remember, it's workforce housing. It's not very low income housing. Which brings me to where I started. Using general fund moneys means they are subsidizing people who earn more than they earn. And money will be taken away from city services they thought they were paying for.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I cannot support this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Thoughts, Councilwoman Canete.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I wanted to invite our new housing director, if I may, to ask him to describe the families that will be served by this fund so we can get that clarified before I make a comment.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Just go ahead and introduce yourself for the record.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I sure will. My name is Rick Padilla. I'm the new morphing into the recently hired housing director, and we are further into the job than it was last week when I was called up. So I will do my best to answer your question.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Describe those folks. So thank you and good evening, council members. And thank you, Councilwoman Kenney. For folks we're talking about in a 40 to 60% area, median income we're talking about, I think it was mentioned earlier, we were talking about lab technicians and nursing assistant making approximately 29,000 a year, a construction worker making approximately $31,000 a year'",
        "'speaker_4': ', a vet technician making approximately $31,000 a year. Those are the folks we're actually talking about, security guard, senior citizens, the folks that make the a large percentage of our of our households in Denver, folks who want to remain to live in Denver, people that want to move into Denver.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then when one question the comment was made that we're making headway on the need for housing. And I was just wondering, is that what the data shows? Are we is the knee are we catching up to the need for housing in terms of how many housing units we need to serve families like these or who earn'",
        "'speaker_1': 'less?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'As we all know, you know, I'm a Denver neighborhood native. I was born and raised here. We all know that Denver's a landlocked city. We have a couple of large developments when there where there has been production on a limited basis.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But most of the housing that we see going in is infill housing. The the condominiums are 4 to 6 units. It's not really meeting the needs of production where, as you stated earlier, we have a shrinking inventory in this city as well as across the country.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So from a production standpoint, we're not seeing new construction come up to meet the needs of these households.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. And if I may, Mr. President, a comment. So I you know, I was listening to my colleague who I respect and differ from on this issue, cite the number of people who said they were willing to pay for housing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I've seen recent surveys that asked people their willingness to pay for roads, and I think only slightly more, maybe 30 or 40% willing to pay for roads. Yet we as a city stay in the road building business because it is our job as a public sector to serve public needs.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I do believe that there is not just a benefit to these households when we build this housing at this level, but there is a benefit to our economy. A recent survey from the Denver Regional Council of Governments of major employers across the country, found that Denver's housing prices were reaching the level where they were giving relocation pause'",
        "'speaker_1': '. Because when you relocate from Cincinnati to Denver, your employees don't want half the house that they had or half the apartment or to commute for an hour because their salary is the same. But the housing costs twice as much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so it is a threat to our ability to recruit new employers. Right. This is it's not a charitable issue solely. I do think that it is a humane thing to do to try to keep people in homes rather than homeless.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But it is an economic strategy as well to attract employers who hire those workers. I'll go back to transportation is one example. When workers travel from large distances, they lose productivity, they lose time. And yes, the transit system is wonderful.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There is precisely one transit stop that's, you know, funded in Adams County right now. Many of our workers travel from that area. They don't have a fast transit option. Even when fast tracks is fully built out, it doesn't reach every community.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so what you have then is people who drive cost more for transportation, even environmental impacts. And then lastly, I will say something about my opinion of the growth of Denver, people coming to Denver. I mean, every time you see a new battery, 621 or industry, one of these new great business incubators and they're relocating high tech'",
        "'speaker_1': 'smart jobs, folks are choosing to come to the city because they like the diversity of the city. It is something we sell. We sell the mixture of incomes, the mix of people, the mix of racial backgrounds. And so I believe that it is really key to our economy that we invest in this housing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It is not just for the human benefits, although there are many. And so I would say that I very much appreciate this fund as a well-designed structure, and I really do think it's an important first step. And I will hopefully continue the conversation about funding it in the future.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But it is very much a city's role and we are a city and a county and we're one of only eight cities that doesn't have a fund like this that we fund with our own dollars. So our competitors are doing it where it counts.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We're responsible for all the human services costs. So I just can't accept and there is no evidence to support that this is not a city responsibility. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Kinney. Councilman Lopez.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Councilwoman Canete, you took the words right out of my mouth, except for the one analogy I wanted to use. Was it? It all depends. And the example I want to put out there and just you can visualize it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It all depends what you believe. Our values are in the city. Some people believe when they look in the mirror as a city. When we look in the mirror, we see Manhattan or Coronado or Beverly Hills or even Martha's Vineyard.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And you look in the mirror when you look out and look what Denver is, it's Denver. It's none of the above. It is Denver. And it's always been of a very distinct city, an incredible county. We've taken a lot of pride, especially nowadays.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And you see this. I even see old Raiders fans wearing t shirts with Colorado flags all over them because it's cool now. We have a very strong sense of locality. We put a lot of pride. Those of us who are from here, we put that little native sticker on our car and it's much more than just putting'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that sticker on your car that says Native and saying, Oh, I'm a proud Coloradan. Well, we also have very strong values that are locally grown as well, too. And making sure you have access to affordable housing and making sure you have a good job and able to raise your family.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's those values. That's all folks are asking about. And, you know, I do agree with one thing with you, councilman. Fights wages are stagnant and that is a problem. But that's another discussion that we have to have. Housing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There's a housing crisis in terms of affordability, affordability, affordability, affordability, sorry. And there is a crisis when it comes to wages, a crisis when it comes to folks who are working, spending 12, 13, 14 hours a day in two jobs.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They don't have health care and they don't have a decent wage. And you pair those two together and you mix that up. You do not have a city that reflects the values that it was built on. It's not the Denver I remember.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so we have to correct that. And, you know, if if I'm wrong, then those folks who vote for these things won't be back. But if I do remember correctly, some of these policies have been here since the eighties.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You seen a little bit of tinkering. So. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman Lopez, specifically. You can go ahead and take your seat unless someone else calls you up. Thank you, sir. Councilman. Never.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. President. As is so often the case, Councilwoman Fatima, I read the details in the same way, but come to radically different conclusions. We both look at city expenditures with a gimlet eye, but where she sees wasteful social engineering, I see a really smart investment.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And it's worth remembering here that this isn't just a fund to put general fund money into affordable housing. This is a fund whose purpose is to close the gap for 4% low income housing tax credit deals. So the 9% low income housing tax credit deals are incredibly competitive.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'All that goes like hotcakes. But 4% low income housing tax credits go wanting projects don't even get built because they can't pencil with just the 4% low income housing tax credit. So this fund is designed to close that gap so that the.'",
        "'speaker_0': '4% low.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Income housing tax credit projects can actually get built.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So what this is, is using a.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Little bit of our money to leverage a whole lot of somebody else's money. And that, it strikes me, is exactly what a smart city does. Figure out how to spend other people's money in making our city a better place.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So for that reason, I'll be supporting them.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman. Are there any other comments from members of council saying. No, Madam Secretary. Rocco?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilman.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Oh, councilman here. I'm sorry. Go right ahead.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. I just couldn't click fast enough. I just. I just wanted to make a comment about the idea of social engineering and the negative impacts that it's had in my council district nine. What I've learned over the years is that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Is that whether it was the intention or the an intention. In my opinion, the way that the land at one point of Denver's history was divided and zoned created a big gap in terms of inequity. And and so when I think about the concept of social engineering, I would say that many of the low income neighborhoods in'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Denver didn't fare so well. And that with the zoning code update, as I said when we went through that, we really zoned a lot of the the parcels in in this city to try to create some equity around the land.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Now we're talking about you're saying why are we talking about this? Well, here a simple way that I want to say it is that this revolving affordable this revolving affordable housing loan, in my opinion, will help to hopefully minimize the gap between people living, wanting to get out of poverty and having a job and having the the'",
        "'speaker_6': 'ability as these units are being built or if they already exist, but not in my council district yet, just they have the ability to have a more equitable life. And by that I mean if, for example, I'm Brighton Boulevard, our hope is to create more workforce housing so that the people that can't really afford to live in'",
        "'speaker_6': 'some places in downtown Denver for were many of them may have service types of careers. They can actually live very close to downtown and be able to walk if they'd like to, or also the ability to create communities where workforce housing can be part of the tax base and also to create schools and create all of those'",
        "'speaker_6': 'things in a community where we can see the diversity that Councilman Kinney just talked about. So I would say that social engineering is a very, very strong word in my opinion. And I don't agree that this particular revolving, affordable housing fund creates that kind of community.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'In my opinion, it helps to minimize the gap that we're all talking about that we have seen created in in the city of Denver. And so I just want to say that for me, in the time that I've served, it's always been about the land and who owns it, who can afford it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And we're just simply trying to have more opportunity for funding to be able to look at workforce housing. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Monteiro, Councilwoman Fox.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes, Mr. President, I wanted to clarify my perception of what I mean by social engineering, and it's why I voted against the Burke's amendment that he brought for the inclusionary housing. The to me, if you're talking about affordable housing, you want a structure around as many people as you can.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You want your money to go farther. And when you try to be sure that you are building it in every economic level throughout the city, you are not going to get as much housing if you are building it downtown or elsewhere.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That would be of a high income nature because the land costs are so high. I believe we have a responsibility if we are using the taxpayer dollar to get the most we can. And if what with the issue is housing, then build the most housing you can.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And it is not on the land that is the highest real estate in Denver. That is my perspective on that, obviously. I mean, I was just being interviewed earlier today about my impressions between the legislature and here. And one of the biggest things is there there was there were a number of people of different philosophies.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so you could have it wasn't just me against the row here. You had other people who could bring in their experiences and their perspective, and you had a good philosophical discussion about the very basis of policy making.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That is what I miss here. I mean, just having some kind of real discussion, not one against many, but many of as far as what. Is our role.

        "'speaker_5': 'In 2013 we began the city processes for planning the redevelopment of the Buckley Annex and that began with a general development plan that was approved by the city in 2013. I'll be talking a little bit more about that in a bit.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'We don't know what it stands for. It's an old code zone district that allows a weird mix of uses, which I can tell you a little bit more about, but it didn't really fit with the vision for the redevelopment.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'back. And then finally, the third waiver has to do very specifically with a proposed pattern of development that's more of a courtyard, single family development that faces an internal open space rather than a street. So there was need for a waiver regarding limits on the number of primary structures on the zone lot.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. We're actually going to talk through that last waiver, first known as waiver number three. Generally in a single family zoned district on any zone lot in the city of Denver that zoned you as you say, you get one house on one zone lot and that's pretty norm.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And that works really well for established neighborhoods in the city of Denver. But what we have here in Lowry is a desire shown in the slide to do some creative site planning still single family, but turning some portion of single family homes to face not a public street, but a neighborhood green or park.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So in order to accommodate that that new pattern and bring a bit of diversity to the site, a waiver has been requested to allow a single cell not to contain more than one house. So that's what waiver number three does.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's it's confined very specifically to this new type of pattern. You can't do this if you have a zone that that can, you know, face that doesn't face a common green waivers one and two, which are two the urban house building form and the detached accessory structures are summarized again on page six of the staff report.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And here on this slide to boil it down, it essentially allows these homes to be a bit taller and a bit bulkier, sit more shoulder to shoulder and not necessarily step down in height from front to rear, as we have in our more typical urban single unit zone districts like Congress Park or Wash Park, it does allow'",
        "'speaker_5': 'a more bulkier form. So you'll see the change between the standard USDA standards and the first column of the slide versus what is proposed in the waiver. Shown in the second column, we have an increase in height for the rear third from 17 feet to 35 feet, and essentially allow that two and a half family or two'",
        "'speaker_5': 'and a half storey building to fill fill the lot, not break from the front two thirds to the rear third nobo claim we have a shallower setback allowance reduced from. 2210. Again, because of this infill condition we have, which is more of a a wide open slate, you're not trying to fit in the House to an existing'",
        "'speaker_5': 'context. There's a little more flexibility they needed on that primary street setback, which I'll talk about a little bit more rare setback, similarly has been reduced when there is an alley from 12 to 5 feet and building coverage present lot in terms of a maximum has been removed through the waivers again to allow more coverage, less deliberately'",
        "'speaker_5': ', less open space, a different style and type of housing that's relatively low maintenance and deemed desirable by certainly some market segments. In Denver, what you get is very similar to what's already been built in Lowry East to Quebec and not too dissimilar from a lot of the single family development in other greenfield communities like Stapleton.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Again, changes in waiver number two are to that detached accessory structure. These are typically garages found in the rear the lot here again, we the waivers allow a bulkier, taller, detached accessory structure, noble plane. It can be built essentially to the same height as the main house with a reduced side street setback.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Waivers are still enabled by the Denver zoning code. It is an option that can be used in this case. After a lot of deliberation and talks back and forth between the applicant and staff and the counsel office, the applicant chose to go with waivers.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We consider it at CPD a bit of a case study in what to do with an infill greenfield site like this, where a more dense form is required without change in the overall single family density. Most areas of change, as this Buckley Annex is designated in Blueprint, Denver typically call for mixed use, high densities.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And as I'll talk about further, we didn't really have a zoned district on the books, a standard USDA that fit exactly what the redevelopment plans and the GDP called for. It's interesting to note as a bit of a sidebar and as to why CPD felt comfortable with waivers in this case, is that the code already has built'",
        "'speaker_5': 'into it a lot of flexibility and provisions to do these same types of modifications to building form, grant a little extra height, play with the ball plane, step up that rear height if it matches an existing context. We have something called a primary block sensitive primary street block sensitive setback where if you're tearing down a house in'",
        "'speaker_5': 'the middle of a intact block face, you've got essentially match what's already there. And that might end up being less than a 20 foot setback as required in the otherwise uniform standards. And that's perfectly all right to again facilitate context sensitive development.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Similarly, the code allows staff to make administrative adjustments again to height in storeys and in feet to allow some flexibility on a case by case basis to someone who wants to build something that, when they look around, looks like everything else and it's neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But the code, you know, built and drafted at a more higher level didn't get down to that. We knew couldn't get down to that level of context sensitivity, but we enabled it through a procedure. So it's just an interesting sidebar that this is not that new way of approach to thinking of what we do with building form'",
        "'speaker_5': 'standards in the code. But we need it in this case because there is no existing context. We've got a 70 acre vacant site that's being built. We need to build in that same flexibility and that's why we chose the waivers.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'One of the reasons we chose the waivers. Every rezoning application goes through a city review. In summary, there were no substantive negative reactions from our sister agencies and departments in the city. The first submittal from the applicant did spark a substantive comment from CPD and that was the first submittal included a request for a waiver to require'",
        "'speaker_5': 'parking spaces for a single unit development. Right now in the entire Denver zoning code, as it as it exists today and the former Denver zoning code as it existed prior to 2010, Denver has never had a minimum parking requirement in a single family zoned district.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So the old are zero one the new RSU. You start at zero and developers build what they what they think is new. Needed. So speed felt strongly there was no no reason to shift that policy in this particular zoning request.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so we provide a comment that this was inconsistent with the intent of the code in our plan recommendations, which sparked a recent middle that remove that waiver. And then CPD offered its support of the application to move forward.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This is a summary of the public review just after it went into the city process. I'm sure the applicant can speak more about its own outreach efforts, but the city review process, we get notification out at certain key times when we receive the rezoning application.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So in April 2014, when it went to Planning Board Notice again was sent out for Liberty and again now for City Council, there are a number of our nos that have stated an interest in this property and they were all notified throughout at this various points of this application.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Moving forward, you have attached to the staff report and in a supplemental package that was delivered tonight, no pilot apologized. We just realized today that was left out of the original packet. All the various emails and written comments that CPD has received.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There may be additional public comments that you received directly as city council members that should be in your packets or I'm sorry, sit cya. I want to say serious, but that's the Apple phone approach. CYA as well for the single zone at REZONINGS, we had a pretty fairly unanimous or almost unanimous support.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Generally, there was a lot of support for the single unit rezoning applications that you have in front of you, primarily because it does provide more of the same of what we already see in Lowry. There were some opposition.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Generally this had to do with that discarded parking waiver with a request to seriously consider putting that back into the application. Of course, every rezoning is held up against review criteria that are stated in the Denver zoning code.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There's a bit there's a new one that you don't often see when we have a general development plan preceding rezonings, the city council is authorized to take it into consideration. It's not a shell, but you may take the approved GDP into consideration in reviewing the rezoning applications.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The other criteria we're all familiar with our shells. You have to do this. You have to look for consistency with adopted plans, uniformity of district regulations, whether the rezoning furthers the public health, safety and welfare, according to the Denver Zoning Code, whether there are justifying circumstances, and whether the request for the specific zoned district is consistent with'",
        "'speaker_5': 'the neighborhood context zone, district, purpose and intent. Looking at the GDP again, this is an illustrative of how the GDP invasion, the land use mix and intensity of development throughout the entire 70 acre Berkeley annex. Again, we're just looking at that top left hand corner, the northwest corner closest to Monica home first.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But you can see how we have the existing neighborhoods to the north and to the south.

        "'speaker_5': 'the GDP. This area was designated the First Avenue Residential, and it was described in terms of its future land use plan and intensity as a single unit detached area, maximum building heights of two and a half stories lot sizes, a smallish 3000 square feet with relatively shallow setbacks.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's exactly what the proposed usou a with waivers proposes to provide. You could only do single families the most intense residential you can do under a U.S. way. So it will enable that GDP vision to play out with a mix of single with with single unit detached houses.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The height is capped at two and a half storeys. The zone lot sizes match up with the GDP starting at a minimum of 3000. And with the waiver, that more shallow setback of ten feet versus 20 feet is allowed next.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Looking at consistency with Adopt a plans blueprint Denver which is our guiding combined land use transportation plan designated this particular sub area an area of change and called out for future land use concept as employment again noting importantly that the plan blueprint Denver was adopted prior to the closure of the Air Force uses and therefore really is'",
        "'speaker_5': 'of limited applicability in terms of a guiding document. But Blueprint Denver does have a lot to say about areas of change. And so we can look to it for guidance as to what's envisioned generally in an area of change.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Again, these are areas where we we as a city, Denver, intends to channel growth. It does call out Lowry as a whole as an area of change and speaks specifically for the potential to create new neighborhoods within its boundary.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Transitions between existing areas of stability and and areas of change are very important and stressed in blueprint Denver CPD staff feels that the you as you a requested zoning with waivers does encourage housing development with characteristics of Denver's existing urban neighborhoods, but provides and does provide that transition to the existing single unit, Mayfair and Crest more neighborhoods'",
        "'speaker_5': 'to the north and east. The waivers allow for development pattern similar to what would be allowed for existing established neighborhoods through other special provision described earlier. And then the future land use employment does but does provide some guidance.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Even our planned employment areas speak to the potential for residential to be part of that future land use, calling particularly for special attention to design and buffering between any residential near the employment centers. So other rezoning applications you'll see in the next few months will deal with that Lowry Boulevard corridor and other mixed use areas planned, and'",
        "'speaker_5': 'we'll really carry for that employment recommendation a little bit more clearly. But as a as the proposed USDA with waivers, it does provide a land use and building high transition between those future planned more intense core areas of mixed employment and residential to single family to the north.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Uniformity of district regulations is a review criteria that staff through more detail in the staff report believes is met here. It is a unique zoned district because of the waivers and therefore will be uniform with within itself essentially and that it furthers the public health, safety and welfare through implementation of the city's adopted land use plans and'",
        "'speaker_5': 'the Buckley Annex General Development Plan. Finally, we look at justifying circumstances and consistency with neighborhood context. What happened to justify in circumstances? Well, let's skip to consistency with neighborhood context, own district purpose and intent. Don't let me forget justifying circumstances though.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Anyway, the proposed neighborhood context is urban neighborhood. Urban neighborhoods, as described in the Denver Zoning Code and Article five presumes an existing or planned pattern of fairly rectangular blocks broken up by local streets in a fairly grid pattern to make connections easier.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It provides a vision of walkability in the form of detached sidewalks with garages and other vehicle access, typically taken from rear alleys rather than from the street, and with plenty of opportunity for other modes of transportation. Then then the vehicle, the zoned district general purpose that the residential zone districts are intended to accommodate variation of residential development'",
        "'speaker_5': 'by virtue of the different zone district types within the urban neighborhood context to reinforce desired development patterns in existing neighborhoods while accommodating reinvestment and then the zone district specific intent. Specifically, the USA. A Zone District does allow and facilitates development on relatively small blocks for Denver, as small as 3000 square feet.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This district allows the most shallow setbacks and highest lot coverage within the urban neighborhood. Context. CPD staff believes that the proposed rezoning is consistent with that stated intent. The base U.S. Zone District provides a land use and building form that recognizes common residential characteristics, such as two and a half storeys and a minimum size of 3000 square'",
        "'speaker_5': 'feet. The proposed waivers allow for shallow front setbacks, higher lot coverage and no bulk plane, which does accommodate a variation in residential development patterns and reinvestment in this part of Denver. These waivers reflect patterns in other established neighborhoods that were built built either pre zoning code or under former chapter 59 under are two or other.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Multifamily zoning with waivers and other site planning flexibility that was built in. Accordingly. Oh, and let me just say justifying circumstances, since for some reason my slide didn't pop up there. CBD stuff is as detailed. More specifically in your staff report finds that there are justifying circumstances, namely in the fact of the changed conditions that have occurred'",
        "'speaker_5': 'with the departure of the Federal Air Force Office complex from this park. 70 acres. That justifies a reconsideration of the old zoning oh one to a new zone district. You issue a with waivers altogether. Then CPD recommends approval of Council Bill 14 522 that would resume property located at approximately 90 Monica Street Parkway from 012 U.S. way'",
        "'speaker_5': 'with waivers based on finding all review criteria have been met. Well, look at that, right? The next one. I could. I completed my presentation on Council Bill 1405 to 2. Next, we'll move to the staff presentation on Council Bill 1405 to 3, which is for property located at approximately 7000 to 7300 Archer Park Place.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Again, we're honing in on the Buckley Annex Council District five, part of the larger Lowrey statistical neighborhood. In this case, we're talking about a relatively small sliver of a little more than four acres in the southeast corner of the Buckley Annex.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Again, just a portion of the entire 70 acres. Um, here we we abut Lowry Southwest, which is part of the Lowry development. Single family homes on larger lots. We also about a portion of an existing older multifamily townhome and taller apartment building complex called Park Heights.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And there you have some pictures of those adjacencies. And then across Qubec Street, an existing Lowry neighborhood of single family homes facing Quebec. Again, this is a picture from the general development plan showing that area highlighted in yellow.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Property owners, again, as the Lowry Redevelopment Authority here. The intent with this rezoning is to redevelop into new single family, and specifically a rezoning from former Chapter 59 Orchard Zoning of oh one to Urban Neighborhood Context Single Unit B with waiver.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So you as you be with waivers here, the waivers are somewhat similar to the waivers we discussed with the previous council bill were with the U.S. you'll be starting as the base. We're at a slightly larger minimum zone, lot of 4500 square feet rather than 3000 square feet.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The waivers are similar, though, to the Urban House form and to the detached accessory structure form. Again, primarily to allow a bulkier, taller structure, very similar to what already exist and what is built out to the south and east in the existing Lowry, the Lowry neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So again, we see a bump up in height. We see the departure from a break in height from front to rear and no bulk claim. We see a shallower setback of ten feet. We have a smaller rear setback when there is an alley.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And when there is no alley, though, it's still the same. And we we leave the building coverage behind with the waivers on the detached accessory structure. Again, these are typically rear garages or other similar secondary buildings. On the site.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We go taller from 1 to 2 stories and 17 feet to 35 feet. No bulk lane and a shallower street setback. Waivers are enabled by section 12 .4. 10.6 of the Denver zoning code. Again, we're looking at a fairly unique circumstance presented here, where we have a planned area of change where we intend to channel growth, but'",
        "'speaker_5': 'with a clear cap on density of of of no greater than what single unit zoning would allow. So if need needed to customize the zoning with the waivers again reminiscent of other tools we have in our current arsenal zoning codes but wouldn't apply here because it's not technically infill development.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we're getting to a similar end that we allow a property owner that's rebuilding in the middle of an existing neighborhood, the same degree of flexibility through the waivers to this new 70 acre redevelopment that doesn't have existing neighborhoods on the same blocks.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Again, City Review has occurred and all other sister agencies have approved with no comments or no substantive comments on the proposed rezoning. And we had a first submittal from the applicant with a proposed parking waiver to require a minimum amount of parking spaces for single unit development.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Again, in its first round, CPD recommended the removal of that request for waiver is contrary to the intent of the code and the parking policy of the city as exists and the remainder of the code and other issue districts not to require minimum parking for single unit development.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Subsequently, that proposed waiver was dropped and what you see before you does not include that waiver notifications were sent according to code when we received the rezoning application prior to. Planning Board again prior to committee and again prior to this public hearing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Again, we received a lot of public input in the form of written emails and letters which you have before you in your packets, primarily all in support of the proposed use and zoning with waivers.

        "'speaker_5': 'Again, we look to the GDP for advice and guidance. The yellow shaded portion in the bottom right hand corner of this illustrative future development plan that's consistent with the GDP shows this corner to be plan for single unit development.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There is no street between the rear of these homes and the adjoining Lowry homes, so these do not have a rear alley, but they do face a public street. That's Arch Archer Place. The GDP specifically called out this area as the Community Park South Residential Sub area and called out for this being single unit detached residential with'",
        "'speaker_5': 'a height of no more than two and a half stories. Staff finds that in considering the GDP, this proposed rezoning is consistent with the sub area intent language. The USPI with waivers will provide land use of single unit detached housing and a height maximum of two and a half storeys.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Huh? What happened to my. Can I have a moment just to unhide some slide?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Sorry I got in at 430 today, so I didn't have a chance to.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You know, this.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Quality control tech. And they would love for me to go through this much faster. But because it's a separate application, I have to go through each of these criteria again so that it can stand on its own post action by the City Council.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So please bear with me. Okay. I think we're back on course. Okay. So again, we're now looking at criteria for your that you need to hold this proposed rezoning up to. The first one is consistency with adaptive plans.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We look first to comprehensive plan 2000, which has a number of strategies and objectives relating to infill development and the potential for new housing in the city that offers quality infill development consistent with the character of any existing nearby surrounding neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We look to strategies that talk about extending the street grid into blocks of land that don't have it, which the GDP definitely envisions for this area and providing that interconnectivity. Modifying land use regulations where necessary to ensure the flexibility to accommodate changing demographics and lifestyle choices.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's something that we can do through a rezoning application as well. So the proposed rezoning, Steph feels, is consistent with a comprehensive plan, recommendations and strategies. The rezoning to an urban neighborhood context type of zoned district reinforces the street pattern and goals of current Plan 2000, which has rear alleys as its primary vehicle access.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The waivers which allow more gross floor area. Essentially you get a bigger house on the same site, a bigger amount of floor area in a house on the same size zoned as a zone. Lot does allow and accommodate differing lifestyle choices to live in the city of Denver, but perhaps have as much square footage as you might'",
        "'speaker_5': 'find outside the city. The Lowry reuse plan, which was re adopted in 2000, again is of limited applicability here because it didn't anticipate the change in use from the Federal Air Force Use Blueprint. Denver oops showing the wrong area.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But again, remember, we're down in the lower right hand corner. This is an area of change. The land use concept, again, is that future employment, which was based on the announcement of the closure of this portion of Lowry.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But we look to blueprint Denver for very good guidance on what's supposed to happen in our areas of change. We look to channel growth there. We have specific goals for Lowry as an area of change where it's this particular redevelopment is seen as an opportunity to create new neighborhoods and offer more choices.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Addressing transitions between existing, stable neighborhoods and areas of change as a major theme in Blueprint Denver New development redevelopment should be sensitive to those edges. Staff feels that the UCB with waivers, encourages housing development that are consistent with existing traditional neighborhood development.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It provides those transitions to the south and east, in this case, to existing Lowry neighborhoods. The waivers allow for a development pattern similar to what would be allowed for existing neighborhoods, both in Lowry and outside Lowry. Through special provisions described earlier.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then in terms of the future land use recommendation of employment blueprint, Denver, while describing employment as being in primarily job based, does envision a mix of residential uses within that future land use category, calling out the need for special attention to transition between those employment areas and residential.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You'll see future rezoning applications for that inner core of Lowry along Lowry Boulevard that will hone in on those more mixed use and employment areas within the Buckley Annex. But the USPI with waivers provides a land use and building height transition from those established neighborhoods to the south and east towards that more planned intensive core of the'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Staff recommends finding that this will further the public health, safety and welfare because it does implement the city's adopted land use plans and more specifically, the implements the Buckley Annex General Development Plan. Finally, justifying circumstances. Rezonings may be justified when it's found that the land or its surrounding environment has changed or is changing to such a degree'",
        "'speaker_5': 'that it's in the public interest to encourage redevelopment the area or to recognize that change character. So again, we have the closure of the Air Force facilities at Buckley Annex in 2011 and its subsequent sale to Lowry Redevelopment Authority in 2012, and numerous planning recommendations for coverage in redevelopment to meet citywide planning goals for areas of change'",
        "'speaker_5': '. That's a significant change in what this land has been. It's no longer office. Federal employees are no longer there, which justifies considering a change in its zoning. Finally, we look at consistency of the proposed USPI with waivers with the YOU part of this own district, the urban neighborhood context.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Again, our code describes these urban neighborhoods as characterized by single unit and two unit. Residential uses. A regular pattern of rectilinear rectangular block shapes the tight sidewalks and the presence of alleys. Residential buildings have consistent orientation and setbacks, and there's a balance of modes enabled that can get people into it and through it by bike walking or'",
        "'speaker_5': 'car. We look to the general purpose statement of the Urban Neighborhood Residential Zones and see that they are intended to recognize common residential characteristics but accommodate some variation, reinforce desire development patterns in existing neighborhoods, while again looking forward to reinvestment and providing standards for two and a half storey urban house forms.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Specifically, the U.S. B Zone District intent is to allow detached single family homes until not 4500 square feet or larger. And this district does allow relatively shallow separates and higher lock coverages than some of our other U.S. zone districts that require a larger lots staff that signs and recommends.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You find that the proposed rezoning is consistent with the above intent, language and context description. The base U. SUV Zone District provides a land use and building form that recognizes common residential characteristics, such as two and a half storeys and a minimum lot size of 4500 square feet.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The proposed waivers allow for those shallow but consistent front setbacks, high walk coverage and no bulk plan, which accommodates variation and reinvestment in this part of Denver to accommodate growing and changing needs and demands for housing in Denver.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'With that, based on this presentation and the staff report in front of you, CPD recommends approval of Council Bill 1405 to 4 seeking a change in zoning of the property noted from 012g ups that should be you as should be with waivers based on finally finding our review criteria have been met.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm really tired of hearing myself talk. I'm sure they're hanging in there.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Oh, we're loving it.'",

Am I missing some key facts?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So summarize for you. This is again approximately 15 acres. The owner is the Lowry Redevelopment Authority. It did take ownership through the transfer. So all you need to know, we have the same history of the Berkeley Annex itself through its previous life as an air reserve personnel center with some 3000 employees through the reuse plans adopted by'",
        "'speaker_5': 'the city updated in 2000 by Denver's Comp Plan Blueprint Denver in 2002.

        "'speaker_5': 'This is a plan that was not adopted by the city, but was followed up closely after the property was vacated and transferred by the 2013 General Development Plan, which was approved by the city. Now we're talking about an area, again, fairly internal to the 70 acre Buckley Annex site.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This illustrative plan is is consistent with the general development plan that now calls for this area to be a mix of no longer single unit but row home and single family attached housing. The current zoning is one. This allows a variety of civic and public uses like jails and schools, but doesn't allow the type of residential the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'the plans call for and very limited commercial the grade three with waivers. Again this is a general urban neighbor context different than the urban neighborhood context with the introduction of multi-unit housing and development potential, but specifically a form of of housing that multi-unit dwellings that's a real home form.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So more attached units vertically attached to each other rather than stacked row house requires each dwelling unit to have a ground storey street facing entrance. In this case, the waivers are to each of the building forms allowed in the otherwise standard.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You are a three and I'll summarize this briefly in a minute. And again, there are building form waivers for the primary building and then again for detached accessory accessory structures. Here we have a summary from the staff report that shows the difference from the base grade three to what is being proposed with the waivers.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The theme is familiar. We're seeking a slightly boxier, bulkier form of row homes, no longer a break in height from front to back, as we might see in a general urban neighborhood like Capitol Hill, which is a more infill, contextual requirement, which goes from 30 feet to 40 feet with the waivers across the entire depth of the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'zone lot, no sidewall height maximum. We get a shallower setback with the waivers at ten feet and a shallower rear setback when there is an alley of five feet. Those are the changes sought in the waivers to the Rowhouse building form.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In addition, there are waivers that seek changes to the urban house and duplex building forms. Should a single unit or two unit homes structures be built within this area, similar to what we saw with previous applications? The waivers enable taller bulkier structure, no break in height from front to rear.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You get the same 35 feet across the entire zone lot. No sidewall height marks a shallower primary street setback of ten feet allowed a shallower rear setback when there is an alley and no building coverage. The third waivers deal with detached accessory structures such as garage and the rear of a lot.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Here again, we see a request through the waivers for a bulkier form and taller form of two stories and 35 feet, essentially no taller than the main house or building on the lot. Waivers are enabled by Section 12, 14 and six of the Denver Zoning Code.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Again, CPD has viewed this application as a case study within a larger effort that needs to be undertaken to understand where else in the city we might have designated either currently or future areas of change combined with lower intensity land land use recommendations such as attached single family.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Most areas have changed our plan for some type of mixed use development, and so the zoning recommended typically as a mixed use zoned district and that we've had plenty of success with implementing our plans in areas of change through mixed use zoning here was a unique circumstance where we have an area of change that a recommendation for'",
        "'speaker_5': 'lower intensity of residential, hence the need to modify and build in some flexibility with the waivers. Again, noting that this is allowed through other means in the Denver zoning code. When you're in an infill position within an existing fabric, we allow variations in the front setback to go shallower than what's otherwise required or to bulk up or'",
        "'speaker_5': 'go taller when it's consistent with other existing buildings around it here, because there's no existing pattern that you're building and slotting into. But the result would be similar. We needed a new tool and new way to get there.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Hence the waivers that allow that bulkiness and height in as in a row home zone district. This has gone through a full city review. All our sister agencies listed have approved it with no substantive comments. CPD did have assessment and comment in the first round after the initial submittal of the application did include a park parking waiver'",
        "'speaker_5': 'that would have increased the required minimum parking for multi-unit dwelling use from 1 to 2 parking spaces per dwelling unit. CPD looked at our other general urban zone districts and saw the intent to carry through the rest of the code, which for this type of urban neighborhood did not require a minimum of two.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so asked that this waiver be removed to remain consistent with the parking policies embedded in the rest of the code. The applicant did resubmit and eliminated the parking waiver from the application. Public review was primarily through the form of public notifications.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Initially at the very onset when we receive a complete application, notice is sent by email to all RINO's and to all affected city council offices. Property was posted and notice sent before the Planning Board Ludie and again tonight before the City Council public hearing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There are a number of renos at issue here. They were they've all been notified in this case for this application. We received a lot more public input in opposition to the proposed rezoning than in support, you'll see. And in the packets in front of you, we've got about 13 emails and letters in support, just as is in'",
        "'speaker_5': 'the application you have in front of you tonight. But we had numerous 54 at last count letters, emails of opposition primarily boiling down to that minimum parking requirement. Those in opposition were not. I look through them again tonight.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I didn't see any opposition necessarily, you know, taken as a whole to the idea of row homes or multi-family uses. According to plan, it was a parking minimum firing from that standard grade three zone district of one parking space per unit.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'All those who oppose would prefer that that parking minimum be raised to two parking spaces out of a concern for overflow and impacts, perhaps on surrounding neighborhoods from overflow parking demand both of residents get. US within proposed the planned multi-unit development.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You'll see here. Recap in more detail some of the themes that we read about and saw in those letters of opposition. Again, we look to the review criteria and the Denver zoning code to guide this rezoning through council.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The first is that the City Council may approve an official rezoning application that's located within an approved general development plan, taking into consideration the objectives and recommendations of the approved GDP. What you have in front of you is a graphic illustration of the general development plan.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This portion is highlighted in the Orange is the central residential portion of the GDP. It's identified as the Rowhouse Boulevard sub area. It straddles the proposed extension of Lowry Boulevard and calls specifically not just for multi-unit, but single family attached multi-unit.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So it got to the type of building form as well as the level of intensity proposed for this area. Maximum height of three stories, pedestrian entrances facing Lowry Boulevard as a primary street. So fairly specific guidance in the GDP.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Staff feels that with this guidance, the G RH three with the waivers was a good fit to implement the GDP recommendations. That Zone District provides a land use for multi-unit form standards for a rowhouse urban form with those pedestrian entrances required for each dwelling unit facing Lowry Boulevard or other primary streets and a height maximum of three'",
        "'speaker_5': 'stories. Next, we look at consistency with adopted plans, with comprehensive plan 2000, we find strategies and objectives called out here, more detail that seek to promote infill development, that encourage development of housing that meets increasingly diverse needs of of different populations and new residents and older residents like.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We see strategies that seek to encourage quality infill development consistent with the character of surrounding neighborhoods, and that looks to extend the prevailing street grid and interconnected parkways and detached sidewalks. And Trayvon's in our urban neighborhoods, where that is the existing pattern and strategies that acknowledge that our land use regulations might need to be modified in some'",
        "'speaker_5': 'cases to ensure flexibility to accommodate these planned demand are changing demographics and lifestyles. Staff finds the proposed rezoning with the general urban neighborhood context. RH three reinforces the desired street pattern goals of the comp plan 2000 and will enable residential housing types that meet changing needs of Denver's present and future residents.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We look to other adopted plan specifically than the Lowry reuse plan. But again, because this plan, even as adopted in 2000, did not foresee the vacancy of the federal government from that site is of limited applicability. We look to blueprint Denver again.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm sorry, it's showing the wrong hash yellow, but the application in front of you is correct and the area is that central area plan for single unit in Blueprint Denver. It's designated an area of change and a future employment land use.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Again, the plan was adopted. Blueprint Denver Plan was adopted prior to the closure the Air Force uses. That element of employment is is somewhat of limited applicability but we still gain some guidance certainly. Blueprint Denver speaks to objectives for areas of change of which this rezoning application falls within.'",

Lowry has called out specifically in Blueprint Denver as a place where the potential to create new neighborhoods is of utmost opportunity there. Addressing transitions between areas of stability and areas of change is a consistent theme in Blueprint Denver and staff fires that the proposed you are'",
        "'speaker_5': 'H-3 with waivers. Rezoning is consistent with blueprint goals for areas of change and creates the potential to create a new neighborhood that includes characteristics of Denver's traditional urban general or general urban neighborhoods that we see elsewhere in the city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'As to the future land use recommendation of employment in Blueprint Denver, the land use concept does describe a need for special attention to design, screening and buffering when those employment land uses include residential areas or uses. Again, staff finds that the the proposed RH three with waivers rezoning.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Does provide that special attention to design and specifically those building form standards by providing a land use and building height transition between those more intense to future planned employment and mixed use areas and more single family both within the Buckley Annex plan planning area and outside the boundaries.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And therefore this criteria has met. SAP also finds that the proposed zoning of grades three fulfills the criteria that that Zone District B results in uniformity of district regulations. This is a unique zone district tailored to implement those adopted plans because it will be applied right now, at least only to this Buckley Annex area.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Its staff finds that the regulations would be uniform within the district itself. Staff also recommends a finding that this rezoning will further the public health, safety and welfare, primarily through the implementation of the city's adopted plans. The Area of Change Recommendations and Blueprint.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Denver and the Buckley Annex General Development Plan. Next, we look to whether the rezoning fulfills the review criteria that there are justifying circumstances. Rezonings may be justified when the land or its surrounding environs has changed or is changing to such a degree that it's in the public interest to encourage a redevelopment of the area or to recognize'",
        "'speaker_5': 'the change character area through a rezoning. Well, certainly the closure of the Air Force facilities at Buckley Annex in 2011 and the ultimate sale to Lowry Redevelopment Authority was a substantial change in circumstances in regard to the future redevelopment and reduce potential this property.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We have plans adopted that recommend redevelopment of this parcel and therefore we feel the rezoning is justified through this change in circumstances. Finally, we look to consistent whether the proposed rezoning is consistent with the general urban neighborhood context, description and the specific purpose and intent statement for the RH three zoned district's general urban neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Context, as described in the Denver Zoning Code, is characterized by multi-unit. Residential uses, a regular pattern of rectangular block shapes, detached sidewalks, presence of alleys and vehicle access from alleys, consistent building orientation and setbacks from those primary streets, and a pattern that enables a balancing of pedestrian, bicycle and vehicle reliance with greater access to other modes of'",
        "'speaker_5': 'transportation. The zoned district general purpose for the G RH family of zone districts is to promote and protect higher density residential neighborhoods, reinforce desired development patterns in existing neighborhoods while creating standards for new neighborhoods. Provide standards for buildings to orient to the street, take access formally, and have high lock coverage in shallow front yards.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then specifically, the grade three is intended to allow for a mix of building forms and uses accommodated through the urban house, duplex and row house building forms, including uses from single unit to unit to multi-unit to not taller than three stories here staff finds that the proposed rezoning is consistent with the above intent language.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The base g three zone district provides a land use and building form that promotes the higher density seen typically in general urban neighborhoods and in row home zone districts. The proposed waivers allow for a shallower front setbacks, high lock coverage and higher sidewall height, while which accommodates for a new neighborhood within a designated area of change.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Additionally, the requested zoning implements the neighborhood context vision for grid streets, blocks, alleys and sidewalks and therefore implements the Buckley and external development plan is consistent with those objectives as well. Taken All Together is more detailed in the staff report.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'CPD recommends approval of Council Bill 1405 to 3, which would change the zoning of property located at approximately 7000 Archer Place from oh one. That's wrong to you two g rh three with waivers. Just ignore the rest of those words.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Last two flip. I notice that grade dropped into 310. Okay. All right. Let me like that. We have six speakers for it, for the three combined, and I'm going to say all six names. You can come up to the front pew.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Bob Golic, Marty Forest. Kevin. Yoshida, Greg Kerwin and Brian Word and David Smith. So you all can come up to the front pew and Mr. Golic, you can come on up and begin your remarks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Good evening, Mr. President. Members of council. I feel like I need to take a deep breath for Tina. My name is Bob Garlic. My address at 609 South Gaylord Street in Denver. I'm here this evening on behalf of Laurie Economic Redevelopment Authority.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I will combine all my comments for all three of these proposed bills. Council Bill 522, five, 23 and 524 of the Boulevard one property is relatively small in comparison to the rest of Lowry, but it's a very significant parcel.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's it's the last large parcel that's under Lowry control. As Tina mentioned, all of the Boulevard one property is classified in blue for Denver as an area of change. And there have been significant changes over the past few years to the site.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Probably the most significant is that in 2012, the United States Air Force turned this property over to the control of the Lowry Redevelopment Authority. Prior to that, it was controlled by the United States Air Force. So upon that transaction, Lowry entered into the general development or GDP process, getting an approval in front of the Denver Planning Board'",
        "'speaker_0': 'in 2013, which is another very significant change conditioned now that approved general development plan establish sub areas throughout all of boulevard one in the evening. You're looking at three of those sub areas. You're looking at the First Avenue residential, which is single family, and that is the northern parcels that Tina described.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You're looking at Community Park South, which is also single family, and that's the southern part that Tina described. And then Rowhouse Boulevard, which is the attached townhouse project or product, and that's in the center of those two, combining those two other sub areas.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All of these are in conformance with the approved general development plan. We feel that we have the appropriate zoning that we're proposing this evening. The proposed Usou A and U suburb are both single family districts. They simply have a different minimum lot size.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The USDA requires 3000 square feet while the US sub requires 4500 square feet. Otherwise they're almost identical. And the grade three, which is the Rowhouse Boulevard site, it permits identical uses in the general development plan with a maximum height of three stories, which is again what the general development plan recommends.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This proposed map amendment, if approved, will bring the zoning in the complete conformance with the general development plan. It will become the catalyst for development in these three sub areas. We're proposing nothing outside the approved land use or guidelines in that general development plan.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And as Tina went into detail on, there are a handful of waivers in these three zoning applications. The reason being in 2010, when the zoning code was updated, we lost the ability to use plan building groups or PBDEs.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that necessitates these some of these waivers. We were allowed to have multiple structures on his own lot at that time, no interior setbacks. And so not being able to utilize plan building groups necessitates these waivers. I will be here to answer any questions you may have as the rest of our development team will as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you for your time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. Garlic Monte Force.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Good evening, Mr. President. Members of council, I'm Monte Faust. I'm the executive director for the Lowry Redevelopment Authority and we are the master developer for Lowry. Address is 7290 East First Avenue, and I'll be speaking to all three of these bills as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': '522, five, 23 and 524. I commend Tina on a great presentation on these details, even though she came in at the last minute. And so I'm going to be brief, but I'd like to amplify or emphasize a couple of points that were made earlier.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'First, we are very happy to be here finally. It's been a long road to get to this point. We've been through an exhaustive, inclusive public process that started in 2007. We have had well over 60 public meetings with robust debate with all the stake holders that we have to gather input to hear their concerns and finally to'",
        "'speaker_0': 'reach some compromises. The result is what I feel is a very balanced plan that recognizes the surrounding context but still has a broader view to the community needs. Secondly, Boulevard one, you've been hearing Buckley antics all night, but Boulevard one is what we call it now, as part of Lowry, is the last development parcel of Lowry.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It consists of 70 acres out of a total of 866 acres of Lowry. It was the site of the former Defense Finance and Accounting Service Center that vacated the site in 2011. The overall boulevard one plan actually calls for 800 residential units consisting of about 450 apartments, 120 single family detached, 230 single family attached.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In addition, we have up to 200,000 square feet of commercial in the form of office, retail, restaurants, neighborhood services. And there's also about 13 acres or 19% of the site that is dedicated to open space. What we're seeking tonight is the approval for the zoning for the first phase of this development.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'About half of this site that will have about 250 residential units on it. There's not any commercial development or apartments in this first phase. Thirdly, as was noted by staff, we're asking for waivers to the zoning as this request is because we have narrowly tailored and crafted the zoning is to match the plan that we had negotiated'",
        "'speaker_0': 'with our neighbors and in which in turn large part replicates development partners that are already established at Lowry. The tools that, as Bob said, the tools that were previously available to us in the old code such as PGS are no longer available.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we saw that the least impactful approach to accomplish the same end result. Finally, with respect to parking that you've heard about, we have added parking standards into our design review process so that we weren't didn't have to have it in the zoning applications themselves.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That concludes my comments and I ask for your support in these rezonings and I'm available answering your questions. You might have. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Kevin Yoshida.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'My name is Kevin Yoshida. My address is 8025 West Colfax. I'm the architecture and planning consultant for the Library Redevelopment Authority and member of the Lowry Design Review Committee and available to answer any questions you have.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Greg Kerwin.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Good evening. I live in the crust. More district in the crust, more neighborhood in District five, which will be directly harmed by the overdevelopment of Buckley Annex. I speak in opposition to the three current zoning proposals which restore the use of zoning waivers, a tool that the city had decided not to use with the 2010 zoning code'",
        "'speaker_0': '. In addition, the third proposal for row houses continues to ignore neighborhood requests for adequate parking. First on waivers, the three zoning proposals set a dangerous precedent for this council. Instead of using existing zoning categories in the 2010 code, CPD and the developer are back to using customized zoning by proposing waivers from standard zoning categories.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'CPD says this is a test case, but it is going down a slippery slope or asking the council to do so by reintroducing waivers to the Denver zoning process. Neighborhoods around Buckley Annex are concerned about density, traffic and parking in an area that is not a transit oriented development.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Buckley Annex is miles from light rail. It has infrequent bus service. It's an area where surrounding intersections on Quebec, Monaco and Alameda are gridlocked. The LRA has been refusing for years to listen to and address neighborhood concerns. Instead, it is moving forward with its plans for a high density, high traffic development with minimal parking.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In contrast, I note Councilwoman Robb has set an excellent example of how the zoning process could work with her recently completed legislative rezoning of Cherry Creek North. After a bitter, contentious meeting with this council over Cherry Creek North in 2012, with the help of a mediator, a consensus has been reached in Cherry Creek North.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Instead of allowing that kind of process here, instead you have an ad hoc, customized zoning proposal that brings back the tool of waivers. If you allow waivers, you should expect developers to request waivers on many future zoning requests.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Second on parking. Editorial writers for both The Denver Post and the Denver Business Journal have commented on Councilwoman Sussman recent article that Denver does not have a mandate from voters to minimize car spick car parking spaces. There's no light rail service to this property, and the existing infrequent bus service will not allow people to live in these'",
        "'speaker_0': 'new buildings without cars. It is not in the interest of Denver residents to provide inadequate minimum parking at a new development like this. One is only serves to advance the interest of developers because it will cost them less while providing inadequate parking.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The excess parking will spill over to and burden adjacent neighborhoods. Please restore the condition that was dropped and call for two parking spaces per residential unit. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Brian Ward.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening. I'm Brian Wert. I had resided to 50 Eudora Street in Denver, and I want to mention that there were some other speakers here who have had to leave. So I made hopefully you appreciate small numbers. I currently chair Larry's Community Advisory Committee, or CAC, as we know, and and I have been a member of the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'CSC since its inception in 1994. I mostly want to verify for you the intensity of the public process surround Berkeley Annex and Boulevard One, and I think that's primarily related to the fact that there are many more residents now at Lowry than there were in previous planning efforts on Lowry land.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There are far more people who are interested in what's going on at Berkeley Annex, and they participated in the numerous meetings and many mentioned. The result of that participation is that nearly all, if not all, of the changes that the involved neighbors wanted in the reuse plan and in the GDP and now in reflected in the zoning'",
        "'speaker_4': 'applications before you are incorporated and those in those various documents. So with that, I just want to encourage your approval of these applications. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. And our last speaker is David Smith.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. Counsel. Thank you, President. I am David Smith. I live at 7135 East Bay. I'd avenue my backyard abuts the Buckley Annex. There's no alleyway there. We will have a house or homes right behind us. I speak in qualified support of the amendments.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'If this is the best that we can do, then this is what we need. We have a an existing neighborhood in Park Heights that will be affected by this. It is a lot of density going into a low density neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I've lived all around the city from the west side to the north side, all around here. This is a special neighborhood. So if this is how we're going to do it, I speak in support of this. I'm very proud that we have VHA going in there and the developer listened to us about where DACA would go.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm proud of what's what's proposed, but there are many concerns about this neighborhood. And if you could, as this moves along, please take a look at it. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. Smith. That concludes our speakers. So it's now time for questions from members of council. I just remind council members that the question period is for all three council bills five, 22, five, 23 and 524. So we're going to start with Councilwoman Robb.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I'm going to start in the details I noticed in some of the letters that were in front of us tonight or emails and in some comments that traffic is an issue. Jay Breeze, in his email or letter to the Planning Board, talked about a traffic study and projected new traffic.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I wondered if anyone here could address whether a traffic study was done, maybe during the GDP and if that was a net increase in traffic over what was generated from the former finance center or.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What shapers could not be here tonight. The traffic study that the LRA did noted additional trips of approximately 9000 to 10000 trips per day. As to whether that's a net, the LRA justifies it because they say commuters at Buckley Annex were commuting there before to work at the Finance Center.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But when the Finance Center was there, the rest of the surrounding homes at Lowry were not.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So what we're seeing now is immense.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Traffic, because Lowry's been built up and the finance centers shut down.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Mr. Borst, did you want to comment, please?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We did a traffic study as part of the GDP process. Indeed, it demonstrated I forgot the number of exactly 9500 trips, I think, that were generated by the new development of this site. But prior to this development on this site, it was also occupied by 3000 employees in a 600,000 square foot building that generated approximately the same'",
        "'speaker_0': 'amount of traffic.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I know we're facing similar issues at eighth in Colorado, at ninth in Colorado. My other question is about the density point. I think the parking's been covered, but the density point, I understand that these are single family home and row homes, although Cherry Creek was alluded to tonight as a model, which delights me.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We are not talking about single family homes when we talk about density in Cherry Creek. So I'm just wondering if you have a density per acre. That's another figure I'm familiar with. A lot of the R two is about 12 units per acre.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I just was curious.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's in the neighborhood of 11 units to the acre net.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. So that's Cherry Creek North, for example.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The Lowry Town Centers approximately the same density.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. All righty. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Robb. Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I have several questions. So, Mr. first you went through a number of the units that are proposed on the overall 70 acres. And I noticed if somebody could pull up one of the map showing the full site to you, if you wouldn't mind just pulling up one of those maps.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So it looks like there's one area that is not being changed, but three of them are correct.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What we have before you tonight are three zoning for about half of the site. So the area to the along first Avenue from Monaco east to Hodiak or Oneida, Oneida and south all the way to. Can you point with that?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You can't see it on there. So the first rezoning covers the northern portion of the site. The second rezoning this U.S., a Yusufiyah, rather, is along the adjacency to Park Heights neighborhood on the South Side. And where it's highlighted there in the middle is the Grange three.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What's not in the zoning application are the two dumbbells to this development that is on the Lowry Boulevard at Monaco and Lowry Boulevard at Quebec. Are not part of the zoning for you tonight.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. So the 800 acres you spoke about, you said there would be 450 apartments. So that would be at the the rowhouse site.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The 450 apartments would be composed in two areas, one on the south side of Lowry Boulevard, adjacent to Quebec Street, and a future parcel along the southern boundary. That's another 80 units or so between the two of them.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So 400. So the other which you just spoke about that the pieces that part of one of these three sites. Okay. So those numbers are a little confusing. So I'd like to have you give me an idea of how many proposed units for each of the three applicant applications.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That would help me to visualize.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The applications tonight. The applications tonight are about 250 units because we don't have final planning.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Can you break them down personally?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then so the first area that Usou a I believe is around 80 units. Okay. The U.S. B, U.S. B is in the neighborhood of 20 units and the RH three would be the balance. So 150 units. But we don't have detailed planning on all of these areas.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But that's a rough number.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Got it. Got it. So can you speak to the affordability of the units? I know you made some about VHA, but that's not part of these three applicants, so.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sure. Lowry has delivered to the market at this point about 1000 affordable units between for sale and apartments. This apartment or this development will have approximately 80 affordable units as part of the development that we're partnering with.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. If I may, I have a couple more. Unless you have other people that want to ask, go it. Okay. So is there a proposed developer for the project at this point or you're trying to get through this first and then we can market it?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Where's the master developer? So we do all of the horizontal development and then we sell to the vertical developers. We have at this point selected our first seven single family detached builders. We're in negotiations with attached builders and with apartment builders.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So there won't be one builder for a particular site. You're looking at different builders that work.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'For the multiple builders on site.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then can you address how the planning board addressed the requests from the neighbors asking for the two units to parking spaces per unit on the Je RH three applet application?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm going to have to look back at the staff report because I.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Think they're what you do while you're doing that. I have one other question. Okay. So this would be back for you, Mr.. First, if there were two parking spaces per unit on the Rowhouse section, so area, how would that change the proposed number of units that you're recommending for this?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It wouldn't. We are planning what we are doing and lacking. The neighbors are very concerned about parking, as you've heard. So we initially put parking conditions or waivers into the applications to more mimic the old code for parking requirements, because the new code lowered the standards.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'When that was rejected as an option, we included parking requirements into our design guideline process so that the road homes will have two parking spaces per unit as well as the single family detached.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Who manages the design guideline process. Is that done by Lowry?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It is done by the Redevelopment Authority, as we have for the past. Not in parking, but all of the design review is handled by the Lowry Design Review Committee.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Is there a reason you would not have it in the in the rezoning application, since you're recommending that the two parking spaces per unit are going to be handled by your design review process? Is there a reason why it would not just be part of the reason application.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We included in it originally, but at the request of staff? We removed it from the application.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I saw in here somebody thought that staff wouldn't support it if it was left in there. And I don't know what that's about.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's true. And to respond to your previous question about what planning board did, they did hear testimony similar to what you heard, and they had all the same written testimony that you have in front of you. They declined to add any conditions to their recommendation of approval, which was unanimous.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They declined to add any condition, suggesting additional parking be required for the grade three application.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And that was with the understanding that LRT was going to include that in the design review.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. They heard the same testimony. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. I think those are all the questions I have for right now. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilwoman Ortega, Councilwoman Sussman.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Tina, I do have some other questions. I just want to make something pretty clear. In an area of change, you usually look for density, don't you?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That's been the case to date until now.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Most of our area of change that you can all visualize, that blueprint, every map that you have on the wall of all your offices. They're typically along fairly heavily infrastructure, transportation corridors around station areas. In our larger master planned areas like Gateway and Stapleton.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's all right. That's all I need. I wait. I'm not finished. So what you have here is a developer and neighborhood who did not want density. And so you had to make waivers in order to make this less dense.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Then blueprint Denver would have suggested right.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'As most other recommended areas of change have gone, and even the rest of Lowry was zoned into a multifamily zone district that allowed a lot, much more intensity than what was ultimately built. And that zoning still exist east of Quebec.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So so actually the waivers were done at the behest of a community that wanted it to be less dense. And we're talking here about 230 single family detached homes. And what about 100 of the rooftops?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's about 100 and I'm sorry, about 120 detached and about 230 attached.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Attached. All right. So these are all single family homes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. I mean, we could have pulled back and rezone the whole thing mixed use. Right. And then let the master.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Go first, which is what we did. And this was in response to the one.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Very specific land use recommendations and height recommendations that were in the plans to reduce the density. And then when you break it out into multiple rezonings, it's your only way to guarantee that you'll get that through the entitlements.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Now, you had mentioned before, and I don't know if my fellow fellow council people probably already know this, but just we don't have parking requirements for single family homes, do we? No, no. We're not in the old code and not in the new code.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Correct. Every city said every single city scene, so that three times west cities single family detached home has no parking requirements to my.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Now in terms of Standard Basin districts, I can say that's true. There might be some customized ones that required it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And if we began to require them all to have two parking places, that would mean everybody would have to build a garage or something, right?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's true. There'd be no choice because they would be required off site. I mean, you wouldn't have to necessarily build a garage, but you'd have to build pads or driveways to accommodate them.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so because of that, because the neighbors asked the the Laurie Authority did request two parking spaces for. For the row homes they do already have the zone code has one parking space for the row homes and they did request it for CPD.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Turn them down. Right.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We recommended or we suggested that they would lose the support because it was such a deviation from other similar zone districts and the policy embedded in this similar zone district to bump up the parking requirement.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Now the zoning code that had one parking place for row homes was done with a large public process, wasn't it?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes, it was. We just we distinguished or differentiated the parking requirements based on the type of neighborhood. And so we have higher parking requirements in suburban multi-unit versus urban or in this case, even more dense general.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Urban types of general area, neighborhood. And yet the single family homes don't have any parking requirements. The townhomes have one. Their design guidelines call for two in both of those instances. Right.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And it's a minimum.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And it's a minimum.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The minimum. And as it's worked through the market and demands, it gets built to varying levels beyond the minimum or.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'At the minimum. And generally developers will provide two parking spaces.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, as we see in the rest of Lowry, for example. They certainly they certainly do even in the some of the townhome developments.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Sassaman, councilman noted.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. President. This question is for Tina. And by the way, whoever it was who got sick of you. Big time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Big time.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm actually on vacation today.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Oh.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Oh, I'd hate to be them, but right now I'd hate to be you. So I don't I don't think I agree with Mr. Kerwin about the the the parking and traffic issues. As they say, our citizens hate nothing more than urban sprawl and density.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I do have to agree with him on this. The the use of the waiver. I'm just help me get over what seems sort of Orwellian to me. So we usually when Orwellian. Yeah. I mean when when you when you wave something, you're usually waving a right.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's like I have a right to ABCD, F and G and I'm waiving my right to F and G. In this case, we're sort of waving our hands and creating more height.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's just way too many partners.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So that's part of the evening.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I mean, we're we're waving an increase.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's an odd name for what the tool has traditionally been used for in the city of Denver.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'For better or.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'For worse, it can go either way. You can wave its take a height standard through the legislative process. Even for a quasi judicial rezoning you through a waiver, you can take an existing standard of 30 feet and wave that right to build 30.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But instead you have to. Okay, so you waive it. It goes away. That's. That's true. You wave bye bye. It goes away. What you put back in its place can either be an increase or decrease.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. We do administrative adjustments to adjust to existing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But so if you had your house in Wash Park or you know, if you tore it down and on the same side of the street, everybody or the majority had built to 35 feet in the rear third that now we have a process through the administrative adjustment review to allow that new infill house to match the bulk'",
        "'speaker_5': 'and height that's otherwise there.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Right now that makes perfect sense to me. That's the yeah we don't.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But the problem is that that process is tied very specifically to compatibility criteria. You have to be compatible to something that exist here. We don't have anything that exists to compare it to.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Fair enough. But we do have a complete zoning code.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We have a very complete zoning code. But, you know, as you all know, our ability to foresee the future through zoning is not perfect. And therefore, we have the capability, smart people that the city council was in 2010 to adopt.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'A code.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That offers tools to vary or flex otherwise standard zoned districts. Sometimes it's a party which in practice now we require applicants to tie to a standard zone district and just vary from it. So they're not making things up totally out of whack with the rest of the zoning.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Lessons learned. We have overlay zones which sometimes can be used to add an additional layer of standards that aren't otherwise in the standard zone district. We still have waivers and conditions. It's in the code. We did not get rid of it in 2010, though personally, I would have loved to wave bye bye to waivers.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But it's another tool and it's there, and we're trying to be very, very judicious in the way we use it. This would be the first case of a rezoning going through with waiver. Since 2010, we've been able to accommodate other needs for flexibility through other pdes or overlays, and you'll see more of that coming through.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In this case, there is a lot of advantage to maintaining that base zone district on the map as a usou a or UCB. BE It is very transparent right on the map what it is, we're just allowing a bulk here for its only form standards that we're very we're not burying other parking were the general design standards'",
        "'speaker_5': 'that you typically would also see in PDS that come before PDS tend to cut across the whole code and do things or add things or take away things, right? This was just one very kind of a whole need to change the bulk and height of these buildings.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so a waiver felt like the most precise way to get to a turn of the dial rather than a pad and an overlay. There are other reasons with overlay, including a minimum area requirement and the fact that you can't use an overlay to give more than what the underlying zone allows.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we couldn't get to that greater height or bulk through an overlay zone. So that left the kind of looking hard APD or waiver and PD felt like a real overkill for this type of variation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah, I guess I would have. I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I don't know if.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We'll ever do it again, but.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, that's I mean, I find that comment reassuring, honestly. It's, you know, we went to a lot of trouble to.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We did.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Do. We did. Zoning code you referred to you know in of the previous council that adopted that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Tried very hard to push it into other that peg into other holes but it's still a tool that you know is might be useful. But generally we were able to accommodate it through other means. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, thank you. You've given me somewhat more comfort.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Are you feeling less Orwellian?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I still like that. It's called a waiver.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'd rather be called banana or something.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Tara thank you. Councilman there, Councilwoman Lemon.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Tina, how more can you pass? Will people be able to park on the street in this area?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. These are public streets being, as you see in the illustrative correct mistake. So we're creating new punching through the local street grid into this. And, of course, LOWRY And on street parking will be available on all public streets as per other general design standards for Denver streets.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And not counted in the number of parking places somebody could take their apartment, say, oh, there's there's mice.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You don't you don't get to count on street parking, torture, minimum required off street parking. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you thank you. Councilwoman moment. Councilwoman Susman.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To Councilman Leavitt's question, I don't think we actually heard why we wanted to change the Bolt plane or why we wanted to have taller buildings. And I think we understand why in order to get those, we had to do a waiver because there was no comparison nearby houses to say, oh, well, we want it to look like'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that house and therefore couldn't do an adjustment. Then I don't know that we got an answer form of why would in the first place did we want to go higher and have a bulk plane? Did you get feel like you had that answer?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I mean, I think I know why is because the developer wants more square footage too.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So no, it's for net zero. It's for. Oh well let's have an answer to that. Yeah, that's, it's for. Ecological reasons. Do you want to monitor or do you want to address them?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sure. First, with respect to the bullet point, for instance, we have neighborhoods just across Quebec from this neighborhood that have two storey elements of garages and a garage with living space above them, adjacent to the alley under all the rest of their lives.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we were trying to replicate that pattern. And by using and we didn't have a PBGC available to us. So, for instance, that was zoned to a with waivers and conditions and had an overlay of a PBJ to it to allow us to have the development pattern that we had.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Under the new code, we couldn't do that because we didn't have PBGC available to us, which is why we're asking for those waivers. With respect to sustainability on this site. We're trying to reach really high standards with respect to water usage, energy usage.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And this more compact development pattern certainly lends itself to that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The main reason.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Sussman and Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Mr. Force, if you could stay up there, I do have one more question for you. Out of the 250 units that are proposed for these three applications, are they all proposed to be for sale units or will they be a mix of rental and for sale?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In these three applications, these would all be for sale.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. And the DA. Are those proposed to be rental?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Those would be rental.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. I do have a question for Mr. Yoshida, if you wouldn't mind coming forward. So I know you have a lot of experience as an architect in working with different developers who build projects. And the zoning always says one thing in terms of the requirements.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But the reality of what a developer ends up building doesn't always exactly match what the zoning code says. And again, as Tina said, it's a minimum. So can you just speak to what your experience is when there is, you know, a requirement that sets something lower than what the demand may be?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'In regards to speaking specifically.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'To the Rowhouse project, where residents have raised question and concern about, they believe that two two parking spaces per unit should be more apropos. And again, I understand that in the design review process that can be spoken to, but, you know, that's a process down the road and.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm happy to describe that. You can tell me if it's responsive for the real homes in particular. It is relevant to the time and place and market forces that. Lowry We understand and heard the neighborhood concerns about one or not having two spaces per unit.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The nature of as a developer, this discussion is relevant to multi-family as well as density increases. A developer winds up not only thinking about what the maximum or minimums are allowed to by zoning, but his target market. So in this case, as as resolution is brought on the plan, as Mr. Force indicated, two spaces per unit seems'",
        "'speaker_4': 'to match with the developer's expectations for what they want to be perceived as successful product for this site. So at this point, staff, lay staff and the design review board are continuing to communicate that to space minimum to potential developers, and that's being accepted as parallel to their market interest right now.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Ortega, are there any questions on 522, three or four and seeing and the public hearing is now closed. This is an opportunity for councilmembers to comment on either five, 22, five, 23 or five, 24. And we will start with Councilwoman Sussman.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much, Mr. President. Thank you, Tina, for your marathon presentation of the of the Bills. And thank you to everybody who spoke this evening. This has been a very long process and very lots of public input.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And you can see the results of the public input. It is less dense than it started. It does have design guidelines that are responsive to what the public has asked for, and I urge all of my colleagues to vote for it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Sussman. Councilwoman Robb.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I just wanted to speak for to why this is an appropriate rezoning for the site and to the waivers and conditions issue. Yes, we kept it in as a tool on the zoning code task force.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I feel like I'm the last living member of that. But at any rate, we kept that in the toolbox with the intention that it would not be used very often, but that it was a viable tool. And Councilman Nevett, I agree with you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's weird to waive things in instead of waive them out. We had that problem under the old code. But the interesting part I think, of why we kept in waivers and conditions was because the citizen representatives on the task force really wanted it us to from Steve Kaplan to the architects, they said, yes, we shouldn't use them'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so much, but we're not going to get rid of them entirely. If there is anybody in the room like maybe Bob Golic who sat through some of those meetings, even when we interviewed the potential consultants, we said, do you see these in other cities?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Are they still necessary tools? And there was some advocacy to have that. The way I look at it, there's only one other way this could possibly have been zoned it. I'm not going to apply to work at the Planning Department after my stint here, but another thing we could do that I'm glad that we did in Cherry'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Creek and the neighbors are. Necessarily recommending is go to a higher zone district is someone implied and not a mixed use district of some sort and then put either the overlay on that tone it down or the regulating leading plan.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And the regulating plan is something that is done after the zoning. And I probably would have given neighbors ulcers as we experienced in Cherry Creek about that. Ultimately, I think that project is going to work out okay. There have been some changes and it still fits in the regulating plan, but you're just picking a tool to meet'",
        "'speaker_1': 'all the needs. And it's certainly clear to me that Lori is a strange dog. No offense to anybody who lives in Lowrey, but throughout I mean, I still didn't find out tonight what one stood for. So throughout the zoning of it, there have been tools used there that have been unique because filling in what was 866 acres'",
        "'speaker_1': 'when we started is a unique situation in a city that's landlocked. So I'll be supporting this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman Rob. Councilwoman Sussman.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I just wanted to talk to the oh one. My understanding and I don't know if maybe Brian can remember this back in 1994 when we started, oh one means no zoning because the it was a military base. It didn't have any any need to respond to any zoning codes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that's how we always understood it. Oh, one man not zoned. Maybe we should just put waivers and conditions on that. Yes, right now don't zone and don't do this either. They just won't want filler.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Councilman Sussman, any other comments from members of councilors on 522, three or four? Okay. Scene none right now, 522 is on the floor. So we are first voting on that one. Madam Secretary, roll call.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sussman. All right, Brett Brown, I thought Kenny Lehman. Lopez Monteiro Levitt, right. Ortega, I. Rob Shepherd. Sheppard. Hi, Mr. President, I.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Madam Secretary, please. Thursday announced the results.'",
        "'speaker_1': '12 ICE.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Provides 522 has been placed on file consideration does pass. Councilwoman Lehman, will you please put Council Bill 523 on the floor?'",
