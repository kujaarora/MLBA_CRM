        "'speaker_6': 'Some of those stories include people who refuse to call the police when they saw a crime because they felt that they couldn't call on them because of their collaboration with immigration. Some of them.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Called on police and were later.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Were later arrested based on their immigration status. And that is also due to some nasty laws that were passed in the state of Colorado in 2006, but also some of that. And because of the the conjunction of of work between immigration and our local law enforcement, I am I am here asking you to pass this ordinance so'",
        "'speaker_6': 'that people can call the police, they can call on them and help the police solve crimes and and get to the bottom of issues and protect people and serve them the way that they were meant to. This is not about immigration.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Although immigrants will be greatly impacted by this ordinance, we want to make sure that the community is safe for everyone. That means that if I see a crime and I am an immigrant, that I have the confidence to pick up the phone.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And that the police will come and protect me and serve you. So I ask that you vote in support of this ordinance. I hope that you see that a community that protects immigrants is also protecting everyone. So I ask you to vote in favor of this ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Next up, we have Kristen Wade. And I will. I will ask you to hold your applause until the end so that we can keep getting making sure as many voices get hurt. Thank you. Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening. My name is Kristen Wade. I am a resident of Aurora and member of Colorado People's Alliance. I'm here to urge the council to vote in support of this community led immigrant protection policy that takes crucial steps to protect Denver's immigrant community, as well as our city as a whole.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Due to the increased focus of the new administration on enforcing harsher, harsher immigration policies. Xenophobic initiatives are already being implemented at the national level, and it has begun to affect us here in the Denver metro area. Parents are already being ripped from their families, incarcerated and deported, forced to leave children behind.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Those children are the future of our city, our state and our country. I urge you to consider what impact the unnecessary loss of a supportive nuclear family structure will have on the development of this next generation of Denver's workers, leaders and neighbors.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Though I live in Aurora, the enactment of this policy in Denver will not only have a ripple effect to the neighboring communities such as Aurora, who has yet to take proactive steps to protect their own immigrant communities but also set an example for the rest of the state.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I want to see Denver become a city that protects all of our families, not one where ICE is allowed to run rampant. Though this policy is only the first step and much work still remains to protect our immigrant communities, it is an essential first step.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Please vote in favor of this ordinance. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Next up, Ray Macias. Ray. All right. Next up, Rigoberto Perez.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. Members of the city council for allowing me to speak today. My name is Rigoberto Perez. I am 74 years old. I was born in Mexico and I become a citizen of the United States two years ago to vote in the elections.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I am here to ask that city council support this law. I have many close friends who are afraid to call the police because of their immigration status, and that is simple for her. They should be able to be feel.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Safe to call the police when you need and not worry about getting deported and. Separated from their families. Please. But yes. On these low.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Thank you. Next up, we have Chairman Siku and I'm going to call it the next five. If you could make your way to the front, Howard Dotson, Sofia Chavez, Rick Bailey, Maria Diego and Vic Ahmed Sherman, thank you.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'All right. Thank you again. Chairman Sekou Black Star Action Movement, founder, organizer representing poor, working, poor, homeless and senior citizens. You know, it's. Very rare that. I take pride in this city council. Because I know you're going to ask this.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I mean, you got to be kidding me. And when we're talking about a very serious time now where the pendulum has swung. And folks want to take us back to the day two when there was nothing but a white supremacy.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Male Privilege Society. That was pretty much stuck in their own paradigm because they wasn't thinking about nobody else but them. And so when you have a president that talks about taking it back to the day and going, no problem with that, let's take it back to before 1492.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Let's take it back because if we take it back to that, there ain't but one immigrant in this country. And that's the European. That's the only one. And so as we break through this neocolonial domestic colonialism that seeks to make the people who are the original owners of the land.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Strangers in their own house. We got to fix this. We got to fix it. And so I want to thank Robin. And Paul for having. And then, you know, the background player here, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, of creating legislation that will protect those that are unprotected.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And build upon a legacy of human rights. Because now is the time. We don't seize the time now to speak out and stand up as a local, organize people that are here for the advancement of all civilization. That can set the record straight that we.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Our nation. Under God. Indivisible when it comes to the liberty and sanctity of human life. And so we stand for this and we stand for this in the name of Frank Zapata, who was the first president of an independent Mexico.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'I'm sure it's even chairman. Council members really want to affirm. What you're discerning tonight. I'm from Loveland, but I preach at People's Presbyterian Church in Denver. I've worked with six police departments in the last 11 years. I've walked with 104 families after a homicide.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The journey began in L.A. with a three week old baby that was hit by a stray bullet. Chief Bratton asked me to help because we could not get the suspects because the people were afraid to work with the police.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And Parker Center. I sat there and watched those mother's tears. And the anxiety that she was not going to get justice for her baby. We need those bridges. We need to know that our officers are there to protect and serve and that they're not there to work for ice.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Ice is a federal responsibility, and that's where it belongs. Our founding fathers were wise. Those tears and baby Garcia and all those families. Who hope for justice. Community policing is critical. And I'll share with you the letter that I had Chief Bratton write.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'When we were facing SB 1070 and it was spreading to Nebraska and the implications when you could not fulfill, protect and serve. I've been a witness to an ICE raid. I've seen ICE agents arrest somebody across the hall from me.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I saw what it did to my entire apartment complex because in the barrio, my name is Tio Gringo. Those are my kids. I want them to go to school. I don't want them wearing colors. I don't want to see any more broken hearts.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But we don't have those bridges in our community. Too often those kids get recruited. And I see more mother's tears. In 2008, we had the Republican National Convention in Saint Paul. I'm a kid from Lake Wobegon. And Steve Earle turn the speakers over to the RNC.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And he sang a song that I encourage you to YouTube tonight. City of Immigrants. If I could just close with the course. All of us are immigrants. Every doctor, every some.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'The only place that they are completely safe from ICE is in our treatment rooms.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So people are afraid to seek out.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Strongly supports the bill as a great step in the.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Direction of justice. But it is a first step, and that is shown by the recent pardon by President Trump of Sheriff Arpaio in Arizona. I'm also a trial lawyer, and so I'm going to explain that briefly. There is more that needs to be done beyond this bill.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So it's a great first step, but we need to take more steps and we're looking forward to working with you on those. One of those steps is to keep ice out of the court, the courtroom, as a trial lawyer, my client, whether it's a civil case or a criminal case, needs to be focused only on their case'",
        "'speaker_4': ', not on worrying about whether ICE is going to detain them in the courthouse. That is justice. I would say that in this bill, the requirements for judicial warrants are also a strong step towards justice. So we strongly support the bill.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We urge you to vote in favor it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And we look forward to working.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'With you in the future. On keeping ice out of the courthouses and also in protecting against notifications. Thank you very much.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'As a member of the immigrant community, I see the effects that threats to the government, the federal government to deport immigrants have in our community. People are skeptical to have any interactions with government entities, particularly with local law enforcement.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Massive deportations cost our city. It also traumatizes our children's like minors. And it makes it even more difficult for victims and witness of crime to come forward. If if law enforcement is involved. Interpretation. I urge members of City Council to support this ordinance because as a community, we will ensure that our city officials and our city resident'",
        "'speaker_3': 'are living and working together in a safe and welcoming environment. Because Denver does not leave people behind regardless of their immigration status. Thank you for your time and consideration.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'About this ordinance. And I was present at your last meeting to ensure that it made it to the today. I'm not a current immigrant. My ancestral family went through Ellis Island in the 1880s. I was born of American citizens.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I've had the benefit of all of the amazing things this country has to offer. The actions of the current administration in DC are not of the America that I grew up in and love. ICE is acting more like stormtroopers than law enforcement agents.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I urge you to proudly. And quickly. Enact this ordinance to protect our neighbors.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And our friends. Thank you. Thank you. Next up, Joy, I thought to say you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Good evening. My name is Joy Attanasio, and I would like to thank all of the council members for supporting this ordinance this evening. And I would like to urge everyone to support this ordinance and to support future ordinances like this.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Your job as city council members is to enact laws to protect Denver residents and to enact laws that are in the best interests of Denver. Your job is also to comply with the U.S. Constitution and to comply with federal and state law.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'It is ice.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Practices that are violating the U.S. Constitution. And it is the actions of our current administration that are violating the U.S. Constitution, and we have a duty to stand up to it, regardless of who is violating, regardless of whether it's the federal government or the president or a random individual.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We have a duty to stand up.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'To anyone violated the U.S. Constitution. There have been several courts who have already issued decisions that detaining individuals after the time of their release violates the Constitution. There have also been more recent decisions, and it is the opinion of many constitutional scholars around the U.S. that notification practices and information sharing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Also raise.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Those same constitutional concerns.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The issue that we're talking.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'About is the 10th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which precludes the federal government from coercing state or local governments to use their resources to enforce a federal regulatory program like immigration. The federal laws themselves. Congress has recognized that local police officers are not required to enforce immigration laws.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Our U.S. Supreme.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Court has recognized.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Including a recent decision in 1997 with a.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Decision by Justice Scalia.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Said the federal government may.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Officers or those of the political subdivisions to administer or enforce a federal regulatory.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Program. This ordinance simply codifies our existing practices to comply with the Constitution and to comply with federal law. And that's important that Denver have a bright line ordinance that tells the world and all of the employees of the city of Denver what and.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'How to follow those.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Rules. This ordinance also simply tells ICE to do their job. If they want someone from our jail, if they want information on someone in our city, they need to get a warrant like any other law enforcement agency is expected to do.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They need to follow the rules. We should not be compelled to spend our money.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Our budget, our local taxes to do. I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Your time is up. Period. Thank you. Next up, Andrea Savage.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Everyone, I want to thank you all for a yes vote on this policy tonight. Thank you to Commissioner Lopez for your leadership on this policy. It means a lot to the community. I want to express.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But could you just state your name for the record?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Oh, Andrea Savage. Thanks. I won't express gratitude and urgency to keep ice out of courts. So thank you for doing what we've done so far and urgency to move forward in keeping ice out of safe spaces. Myself, Patrick Hovnanian knew those COPPA and all the other organizations worked on this policy.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We'll keep fighting and we are very happy that Kevin Flynn has expressed interest in leading the charge on keeping ice out of the courts. And we're looking forward to your leadership.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Next up, Philippe Gerard, you know.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Good afternoon. My name is Filippo Giardino. Rossi. I'm a business owner, entrepreneur and Latino leader. And on behalf of my community, I want to say thank you, Mr. President, for the city council, City Councilman Lopez and the mayor.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Um. I'm just very excited and happy about what I'm seeing today. But we need more. We need more than. This is a big accomplishment for our community to be here today addressing this matter. Like I say, in behalf of the community, I wanted to say thank you for presenting this act.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But I believe if you say yes, if you guys vote yes, you guys are going to going to create a synergy between our loan officers. I mean, our law enforcement officers and our communities. There is going to be great something that we need that we've been fighting for for a long time, not only for the city, but'",
        "'speaker_6': 'for the state, for our country. So please vote yes. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Next up, Julie Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, members of council. My name is Julie Gonzalez, and I'm here to testify in support of this measure. I'm representing here today the Meier law office, who formed part of a coalition of over 50 organizations, who has worked incredibly diligently over the past eight months to make this policy get to this point here before you all'",
        "'speaker_3': 'tonight. And it's just an honor and a privilege to be standing alongside so many people here in this room. I'm actually kind of nervous here being in front of you all. But I do want to say that immediately following the election of Donald Trump, our community was beset by fear and anxiety and anger and worry.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so at the Meyer Law Office, we began know your rights presentations in church basements, in libraries, in school cafeterias and in people's homes. And we brought this issue to the to the city. And quite frankly, it's been an eight month journey to one let our city elected officials know that this is a problem of ice infiltrating'",
        "'speaker_3': 'our local government. Some of them, some members of council didn't believe us when we said that ICE was conducting arrests in our courthouses until we actually filmed ICE going and without warrants trying to arrest people within our courthouses.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so it's been a process of learning and it's been a process of beginning to work together that, like I said, it's an eight month process and it took a long time. But here we are today. And, you know, I think that we are better when we and we are strongest when we work together.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So thank you for that. Members of Council. This policy is going to draw a line, a clear line in the sand between the Denver employees and ICE, and particularly in a moment in which we find Daka hanging by a thread.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This policy is more important than ever, and so this is a policy that will proactively protect our community. And so in the last minute that I have left, I know that there are many people here who are who would like to speak, who will not be able to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so I'd just like to turn around and and invite folks, if you are in support of this community. And I'd like you to stand up. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Next up, Kieran Oppenheim.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Council members. My name is Karen OP and I am a member of Colorado People's Alliance and a Denver resident. On November 9th, 1938, my grandmother's father rescued the Tora and their small town of Verner, Germany. This was Kristallnacht, the night of the broken glass where German SS officers vandalize Jewish owned businesses, breaking the glass of'",
        "'speaker_3': 'storefronts, harassing and harming Jews. My great grandfather was badly beaten. I grew up hearing stories from survivors of ostracization, of discrimination, of targeting and profiling and of assimilation. And sadly, I see parallels under this new administration's ICE agency.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Several generations later, I have many privileges that other immigrant stories here today lack. I think about the fear that my friends who are immigrants live in. I think about the emotional labor and pure exhaustion that my friends who are community organizers experience when they are protecting their own communities and living in fear simultaneously.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think about where this could head if we fail to take a stand. And that should not be on them. It should be on all of us. It is our moral imperative to protect all of our community members by ensuring our city is not doing ICE's job for them.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I urge City Council to take this important step in protecting our community and to pass the Public Safety Enforcement Priorities Act. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Next up, Tony Fagan. Good evening. My name is Tom Fagan, not Tony. Tom. I live in LoDo and I am, by the way, a proud immigrant. I'm here tonight to voice my strong support for this bill and to urge you all to pass it and pass it quickly and unanimously.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There are two basic reasons for this. One is on principle. We're currently in a national political environment that is dangerous, divisive and toxic. And people are looking to the states and the great cities across the country to be the standard bearers for the values that used to be espoused by the country as a whole.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This is Denver's opportunity to fulfill its duty as one of those great cities and to distance itself from the toxicity. The second reason is much more immediate and practical, and it's that if you do not do this, you're going to discourage and deter both witnesses and victims of violence from working with the police to find the perpetrators'",
        "'speaker_1': '. And that's bad news for the safety of everybody in the city. Thank you. Thank you. Next up, we have Tim Lopez and I'm going to call the next group of speakers severe your name. Come up to the front pew, Alexa Bylon, Corinne Riviera Fowler, Dana miller, Salvador Hernandez.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Laura PANITCH, Maria Cruz Herrera and Denise Meyers. Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good afternoon. Good evening, Mr. Chair. And Council Members. My name is Tim Lopez, and I represent criminal justice for the Democratic Party of Denver. I'm also a member of public policy and my committee chair, Lou Irwin, is there and provided you with a resolution that was passed through the Democratic Party of Denver.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm hoping that one of you will do the honor of reading it into the record for us, because 3 minutes does not allow us to do that. But let me tell you, I encourage you by writing a letter at first committee hearing, telling you to pass this unanimously.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I'm here today to tell you, please do that again. It passed through criminal justice unanimously. We put the resolution together at public policy, hammered it out, and it passed again unanimously. And it was my honor to make the motion to move the resolution forward to the executive committee for the Democratic Party.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I was able to stand side by side with Lou Irwin and present that at the executive committee, where once again, after much discussion, it was passed unanimously. So at this point, I would ask that you guys follow up and do this as well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I have to tell you, it's an honor to be standing here with my brothers and sisters who've been working on immigration for many years, and to also see members of council who have been working on it for many years as well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I know that over the last ten years there have been many that we have worked with and the organizations that really Gonzales spoke with, we have worked with as well. So it's most important that the city of Denver sends out this message that we will stand together and be the voice for those who do not have a'",
        "'speaker_4': 'voice at a current time. We must support our communities and we must follow up and usher in and continue the support of immigration and taking care of our communities and those that are not represented, those that feel threatened to go to schools, those that feel threatened to go to the courthouse and those that feel threatened to go'",

And in the United States, in the state of Colorado and the city of Denver, that we follow up and we do our jobs and hold ourselves accountable for those that are voiceless at this time.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Hello. My name is Alexa by Lone, and I'm a fourth year biochemistry student at Metropolitan State University. And I and I am an immigrant. Writing this testimony, I was trying to get into a nonimmigrant mind to explain why it's important to keep our immigrant community safe from the federal government in a way that appealed to, not to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the non-infected. All I could think about is how Denver could not possibly be the diverse and wonderful place it is today without the support the immigrant community brings. Growing up aware of my status always kept me in fear of law enforcement.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I would be more scared of cops and scary movies. My greatest fear was to be separated from the ones I love most. As a as a child, I would ride my scooter with my little sister, my little neighbors up and down the block.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And if we saw a cop drive by. My first instinct was to hurry home and hide. I would think about how much I needed my mom. And I didn't want to be separated from her. I mean, I didn't know how to wash my clothes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And the only thing I knew how to cook was cereal. So I didn't want to live off of cereal. And as I grew into a teenager and developed into a young woman, I have always kept fear and just develop into different forms.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The fear of being pushed, the fear of being pushed into communities by the federal government is more forceful than when I was growing up. I cannot imagine the fear that is being implemented into families today. I have been in Denver since I was two months old.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I love this city and I'm studying to give back to the community I love so much. We must protect our immigrants because we are members of the community that love the city just as much as anybody else who are students and parents improving themselves to give back to the community and help our city grow and develop into'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the beautiful place that it is. Denver shouldn't be a place where you hide from cops but feel protected by them instead. We are so much better than allowing the federal government create a community of fear. So I ask that you support this bill because Denver needs it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I also know that there is more that we must do during the process to pass the bill. Councilman Flynn and others question the effects that this bill would truly have on safety. We are glad that our council members understand that we need to do more and we look forward to working with all of you for more solutions'",
        "'speaker_3': '. Thank you so much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Next up, Corinne Rivera Fowler.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Council members. My name is Karen Rivera Fowler. I'm the policy and civic engagement director at Padres Seahawk in Encinitas. We are a member led organization. We have been fighting for racial right, fighting against racial discrimination in our schools, struggling for justice and working to expand and protect the rights of immigrants for over 25 years.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'On November 9th, our nation woke up to the reality that we had elected an openly racist man who had called Mexican immigrants criminals, drug dealers and rapists. A man who promised to build a wall across our southern border to keep the brown people out.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It was shocking and unbelievable. On November 16th, immigrant rights groups and allies came together and the Resistance Network was born. Tonight, this council will pass an ordinance that is the product of input from affected community. The organizing of the resistance and the leadership of Councilman Lopez and councilwoman can each.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Throughout this process, we have heard some opposition. We have heard that we don't need this ordinance because so many things addressed here are already in practice. I say that this policy cannot pass soon enough. Since January 20th, our communities have been under constant and daily attack.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It is really as if we wake up each morning and ask ourselves what new policy threat or just plain insulting action this executive branch will act on. And as time goes on, his example is permeating throughout our society.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And as we witnessed in Charlottesville, racist white supremacists have been given license to hate openly in our public spaces. Just a few days ago with the pardon of Sheriff Arpaio, our community was struck not in the back, but right in the face when our highest office is propping up racial violence and for giving public safety officers who'",
        "'speaker_3': 'have been convicted of racial discrimination and abused. We must take action. We must resist the passage of this ordinance. The changes to our statute will be in law and on the books. There will be there to hold every public official accountable.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'These laws will be there to draw a clear line. This ordinance is meaningful to our community. This ornaments means that we have each other's backs in Denver. The last time I checked, this was still a democracy and the rights of all people in this nation were protected under the Constitution.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This ordinance solidifies those rights and holds true to the values of our city. Tonight, we celebrate the passage of this ordinance. Tomorrow, we look forward to continuing to work with our council and our mayor. We will continue to resist against a federal government that is going too far.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Next up, Dana miller. Dana miller.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Hi everyone. I just want to say that my name is Dana miller. I am so proud to be a resident of Denver, Colorado tonight and to be able to stand behind this coalition and the city council who took on a really, really difficult issue.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And you've worked really hard to get where you are. And all I want to say is thank you to the community and to the city council on behalf of Indivisible, Denver, Indivisible, front range resistance and other indivisible groups across the metro area.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Hello. Members of City Council. My name is Lauren Anders. This. I am the civic engagement coordinator with the Mi Familia Vota. Um, I'm here to speak on behalf of the immigrant community that I am a part of and, and, and, and in support of this ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'More specifically, I want to touch on a key issue that is, I think is critical for the public safety of all the people of Denver, and that is being able to trust your local police department. When I was 19, I was gunned down after getting off from work.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I was walking home after my shift had ended around midnight and two men approached me. They robbed me and shot me five times. Two of my torso went through my lung when my back and went through my right bicep.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'After that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I spend about ten days in the hospital recuperating and about a month and a half at home. I found myself a victim of gun violence, and I almost didn't make it. At that time I was undocumented, and although I am a recipient of a U visa permit, I'm still.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Consider myself one of the persons who's at risk from.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Deportation. At that time, I had no doubts that the police would not question. Where I'm from or where I am a citizen of. Or my immigration status. The sole purpose of our local law enforcement should be to keep everyone safe.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I cannot imagine not being able to trust the police in a situation like this. This is why I strongly encourage the members of this council to vote yes on this ordinance. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Next up, Laura PANITCH.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening. My name is Laura Fincher. I'm a mother, recipient of Dacca, a community leader with together Colorado and a disciple of Christ. As a person who has lived undocumented in Colorado for over 20 years, I am here to testify in favor of all policy that protects human rights.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'As a person of Christ and child of God, I am here to testify that God is real. He speaks to us constantly, loud and clear, and I am listening and I have faith in him and believe his word, which tells us that the day is here now when the criminalization of discrimination and exploitation of immigrants will be'",
        "'speaker_3': 'over with. Undocumented or not, all immigrants will have the same rights and protections as any other Americans. We will be able to stay here and build homes work. Pursue a higher education. Pay and claim taxes. We will have the right to vote to drive a vehicle access to health care and a retirement plan.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The right to live without fear of being snatched away from our homes, families and communities. Because I have faith in God and I know him. I believe in him. And I'm certain that very soon immigrants and refugees will no longer be rejected, discriminated, criminalized or oppressed, but only be accepted regardless of their backgrounds.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We will have the same human right to thrive and survive in this land as righteous children of God. I'm in favor of God's plan, and all of you here present tonight are a testimony that his plan is real and that all of the things I have testified are true and must take place.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I testify these things in the name of Jesus Christ be my.'",

I'm Familias San Familias Justin Aqui no stamp present this aqui better standing corazon. I am here representing 100 families. They are not here presence but they are here in their with their hearts and they are in support of this of this bill.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So look at our Atlas and look at Yosemite here on LA. Only because Palavras kills me here on Casillas. Then you get out of Puerto Clara. So stay this. I'm going to share with you the words that they asked me to give you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And they asked me to give these words loud and clear. See if the animals. You do have a voice, Akeelah CNN, and you have it here. That's yes. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Next up, Denise, Maze and Denise. Well, Denise is working your way up. I'm going to call the next speakers, Father Joseph, Dang, Lou Erwin, Pedro Canelo, Margaret Bruguera and Sarah Morris. If you could work your way up to the front, go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Mr. President, members of council. My name is Denise Myers, and I am the public policy director of the ACLU of Colorado. And we are here in strong support of the ordinance before you. We want to thank council members Robin Kinney and Paul Lopez for bringing this ordinance forward.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'We think clearly that this ordinance represents sound public policy, and it also is in complete compliance with state and federal law and any and all constitutional mandate. It is sound public policy entanglement between city officials and ICE officials clearly undermines public safety and it undermines community trust in local law enforcement.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'What this ordinance does is pretty straightforward. It says ICE. You will do your job and city and county workers will do theirs. This dissent, this delineation. Really sends an important message to the immigrant community, their friends and their families.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And that message and that message resonate clearly. We have your back. We care for the safety of you and your family. You and your community. And the community at large. This ordinance is completely consistent with federal and state law and constitutional mandates.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'The Denver Post today ran an interesting article and it had a quote from a think tank that is conservative on immigration related issues. And those those particular observers said that really what this Denver ordinance is doing will be overshadowed by some of the more bold actions that are being taken in other cities.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'In other cities. In other words, councilmembers. You have nothing to worry about with regard to compliance with federal and state law. Now, though, this ordinance could be bolder. Regardless, it is a significant and important first step. At the end of the day, one, this is important public policy.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Two. It is in complete compliance with all relevant law. And third, the bottom line. It is the right thing for this great city to do at the right time. I urge a unanimous yes vote. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Father Joseph Deng. Right, Lou Irwin. My name is Lou Irwin. I'm chair of the Public Policy Committee at the Democratic Party of Denver. And I appear tonight on behalf of the executive committee of the county party, which, as Tim Lopez indicated, unanimously endorsed this ordinance on August 15th.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We recognize that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Enforcement of immigration policy is a responsibility. The federal government. We also.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'However strongly.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Agree with the mission of the city to place priority on protection of the security and safety of its residents. We believe this.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Ordinance does that clearly.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Effectively and legally. The ordinance provides clear guidance and promotes systematic enforcement. Of policies, whether those are ongoing current practices or new policies.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The ordinance recognizes the dedication and goodwill of employees of.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The city and our public safety officers. The ordinance. Also, we believe, we hope, brings a measure of relief. To residents unsure of the.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'City's.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Position on immigration enforcement. Finally, we endorse the compromise between proponents of this ordinance and the mayor and others who are concerned with the prospect of releasing dangerous felons into the community without warning. We believe that the adjustments to the ordinance strike.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The appropriate balance.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Between that concern and the principle purposes of the ordinance. So for these reasons and the other reasons enumerated in the resolution before you, we strongly endorse passage of the Public Safety Enforcement Priorities Act. Thank you. Thank you. Next up, Pedro Canelo.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Pedro Carrillo. When I started, guys. Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you. City council's to be here. I'm leaving them there since 1988, 1988, when my mom's bring me and my brother to this country. She is she living in Denver since 1990, 1989.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'She and my brothers living here in this beautiful country, this beautiful state since 1988. She is a legal resident and she applied for me and my brother in 2001. Since 2001. At this time, I'm waiting to relooked, regularize my papers, my situation here in this country.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But for these laws, I not be able to be realized still. And I looking for that. That's what I'm asking you here today to approve this ordinance. I'm work in Denver. I'm go to the school in Denver. I'm also I'm a part of this.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You look local one of five since 2007. I work as a janitor in one of those beautiful buildings here in Colorado. Please see, the council's be up, and your heart helped me, my brother, my family, and many of families in this beautiful estate to be walk free in the streets, to be work free in the streets.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We need this ordinance. We need help from you and for all these people whose being here. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Next up, Margaret Burger.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Hi, everyone. Thank you for your time tonight. My name is Margaret Brugger. I am a resident and I am a licensed clinical social worker. I work at the Mental Health Center of Denver as a bilingual child and family therapist.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I also teach in the Graduate School of Social Work at Denver University. There is where I teach about social work and social justice and child and adolescent trauma. I want to be clear. We have entered into a situation that is creating terror and diagnosable trauma in our communities with what is going on with immigration and immigration officers'",
        "'speaker_5': '. I have diagnosed many kids, some as young as five, with post-traumatic stress disorder in relation to what is going on. For those of you that don't know PTSD, post-traumatic stress disorder includes cheerfulness, crying uncontrollably, extreme fear, isolation, exaggerated startle response, anxiety, depression, trouble focusing in school, intrusive memories and at times can lead to suicidal ideation.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Let me break this down in nonclinical language. This is translating to increased fear of the police. Parents have become afraid to let their kids play outside and in extreme cases, go to school. Kids that I work with that used to be amazing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Students that are brilliant people are having trouble concentrating. Increased depression and lowered interest in pleasurable activities. These same brilliant kids with amazing goals are sometimes not even ending up going to school. Kids are coming in with extreme fear and anxiety, resulting in trouble sleeping.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This is resulting in more trauma. There's also extreme depression, which is what can lead to the suicidal ideation I was talking with you about. This is not a joke. It's time to act now. Nightmares. So many kids, so many kids, so little are coming in with increased nightmares.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Nightmares that their families are going to be torn apart and nightmares about what they've been seeing. People are afraid to go to stores, to the doctors and even to come to courts. I will tell you one case that I have permission to share small details of this family that I work with.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'One daughter, five years old and one son seven years old. The father in this case is a U.S. citizen, and the mother is living in the U.S. without documentation. After a domestic violence situation, the mother was afraid to show up at court.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In the case was dropped. This is real people had real family is people are afraid to go to parenting classes, courts. And this is where we have a breakdown in the system. Teachers and therapists are experiencing vicarious trauma at higher rates.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I also want to be clear, many of the children I work with that I am speaking of a U.S. born citizens that are living in fear simply because of the psychological warfare immigration officers are using. We must understand the trauma being created in our communities, and we must work together to change it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's why tonight is so important. And thank you, Lopez and commish and everyone else who worked on this. I really appreciate your support. We must keep working. There is a lot of work for all of us to do.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you for your time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Next up, Sarah Morris and well, Sarah is coming up. If I could get Connie Romero, Angela Colby on and John Zito, Maia to the front bench. Gary. Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'My name is Sarah Morris. I'm a Denver resident and community member and I'm a member of Padres. Vanessa. I support this ordinance and I strongly support continuing to work together to take the strongest possible measures to disentangle ICE from our community.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm here today because I'm a civil rights lawyer and there is plenty of work for me to do before the election. And now there's more than ever. I'm privileged that I'm not directly targeted by the attacks on civil rights, by ICE and our federal government.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I'm outraged that so far the best response that I have been able to take as a lawyer and as a community member is to do things like know your rights trainings, talking to teachers about their students and families who are scared to come to school, talking to librarians who are scared and don't know how to respond'",
        "'speaker_3': 'if ice shows up at the library and by advising parents to gather their kids documents in case of an ice arrest. I've literally had all of these conversations with people in our community. This is no way for anyone in our community to live and no way for our community to respond to the historic threat to civil rights'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that our federal government poses. Denver can do better. I want our city to send a loud and clear message that Denver will not abide the racist criminalizing anti-immigrant rhetoric and actions of the federal government and instead stands by all of our residents and our values.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I support this ordinance as a first step towards that. You all on this council have the power to do this and more, and I ask that you do so. Specifically, I agree with Councilman Flynn that this ordinance does not go far enough.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm glad that he and you all will be considering solutions to address ice in sensitive areas of our city and more. I look forward to passing this ordinance and to continuing to work on more solutions together.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Thank you. Connie Romero.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. Good evening. My name is Connie Romero, and I'm a member of the Colorado People's Alliance. I would like to urge our city council leaders to vote in favor of this policy. So many of our community members have been working so hard and towards this goal.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I've joined phone banks and meetings in support of this policy because I'm a first generation immigrant. I've lived in Denver most of my life. I now live in Lakewood, but most of my family still lives in Denver. Unfortunately, I hear the stories and so much fear in the community of Denver and it's disheartening.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I can't imagine living in a continued sense of fear, especially for those who are undocumented and also for those who are documented, as has been stated before, that we fear for those we love and those in our community and fear that there will be unexpected consequences for those that we love.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And also, I think it's really important to support this this policy in attempt to lessen those fears that sometimes are realistic and sometimes are not realistic. But for the majority of the time they are in they are way beyond our belief.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And some of us have been just totally disheartened and surprised at some of the events that we continue to see in this community. People are completely fearful. As a retired probation officer. I worked with with the community. I worked with offenders.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I also worked with victims of crime. And it's really difficult to work with with individuals in a community who is fearful, especially for those who are reporting offenses. Those who have loved ones who have been affected somehow by a criminal offense, whether we're talking domestic violence or whether we're talking sexual abuse, it's got to be very difficult'",
        "'speaker_3': 'for a parent to try to protect a loved one when there's that overwhelming fear that they're not going to be listened to and they're not going to be protected. I feel strongly that that our community feels safe and protected, supported and respected and also treated with dignity regardless of the country of origin or their legal status.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This policy is a big step in protecting our community, our immigrant community, and in keeping all of Denver safe, and that it also upholds the law. Please support the Public Safety Enforcement Priorities Act. I thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Angela. Coby on.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening. My name is Angela Coburn. I live in your district, actually, Mr. Clarke in seven. And I'm from southwest Denver. I've lived there the majority of my life. I consider myself from this city, by the way, of Mexico as my mother crossed the border and is now a naturalized U.S. citizen.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thanks to Ronald Reagan's amnesty, a political situation of which my former students were systematically they and their families not able to access. I'm here today to speak as a leader at Together Colorado and a parishioner of San Cayetano, which is a big church in southwest Denver.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's on federal and Alameda just a little bit up near Raleigh. And in 2015, I took a whole delegation from our parish carrying with us 200 letters that were written. And this was pre trump times by our parishioners that we delivered directly to Pope Francis in Philadelphia at the world convening of Catholic families.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This resolution, while it's a good first step, also aligns with my values as a Catholic. As a Catholic, we believe in the Beatitudes, which read Blessed are they who suffer persecution for justice sake. For theirs is the kingdom of heaven, which is one of the reasons why, as again, as a Catholic and as a member of this'",
        "'speaker_3': 'community, I absolutely consented and wearing white because I'm trying to walk into that faith, into that beatitude for way too long, our citizens in our city, our community members, my former students and their families have walked in persecution.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And this specific policy, which I urge you all to vote in favor of today, is once again a very first step to making sure that we create the kind of beloved community that Christians and other people of faith are trying to build in our community here in Denver.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And also, I would say, continues and extends the organizing work that our parish has been working on again before pre-Trump times. We worked really closely with our precinct, which with Commander Felice, and we were actually the first precinct to actually have the commander's cabinet in the basement of our church.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And the reason why we did that and the reason why we awarded Commander Phillips with the Community Award at our annual church bazaar this year was precisely because they listened to our concerns and the primary concern being that people did not feel like they could call the police when they were victims of the crime.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I urge you to stand in solidarity with the people from my faith community, as well as everybody else who's here in this room who's taking time out of their evening to speak. And we look forward to continuing our relationship with you to make sure that we tighten things up even more.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Thank you. And our final speaker of the night on Zito September.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Got to explain that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Evening, Mr. President. Members of council. My name is Hans Meyer, and I have the privilege of working with Julio Gonzalez at the my our law office, doing lawyer stuff and working with this community of people behind me. And only two quick things to say as the folks behind me and to the side of me.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you guys so much. What an amazing group of people. Give yourselves round of applause. You guys are amazing. This is the town I want to live in. This is the town I want to live in. It's the faces of the people in the town I want to live in and the type of diversity I want to'",
        "'speaker_6': 'be in, involved with, and that I want to have in my community. The second thing I wanted to mention is that this is a starting block. This is not the finish line. We've got a long fight ahead. And this is the first opening salvo and it's the first principled response.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And thank you for passing it. And I look forward to working on all of the other issues we all know about that are going to come up over the next couple of years. And I appreciate this first step forward.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The third thing is there's nothing else I have to say that hasn't been said better. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much. I want to thank everyone for doing a great job speaking and so that we could get to everybody. That does conclude our speakers. Are there questions from members of council? All right. Quiet group. Tonight, the public hearing for counsel bill 940 is closed.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Comments from members of council councilwoman can each.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I, my co-sponsor and I, I'm going to kick us off, and he's going to be the final speaker before we vote tonight. GRASSLEY As at those present, they are key. Thank you to everyone who is here, both to the community that is here in white and in solidarity, and also to the community members'",
        "'speaker_5': 'who are wearing blue from our law enforcement agencies. I think the significance of your presence here is as important as the communities. And I want you to know that we see you because we are a community united tonight, for the most part will count the votes at the end.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But we know that our safety agencies and our mayor are standing in support of this bill as well. And so that is is the starting comment I wanted to begin with. The second thing I want to talk about is bravery.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Victor. Alexa. Salvador. Laura. Pedro. It is a brave thing to talk about your immigration status at a time when you are probably more vulnerable than you've ever been before. I know that you had to probably do some soul searching about whether to talk about that publicly and how to talk about it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so I want to honor that, and I think we all will honor that. There's also some soul searching I know that has happened through this process by the mayor and by the agencies and by some of my colleagues.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I know that part of that soul searching has included the very sincere question about whether or not that passing this ordinance sets up false expectations. I know folks have raised questions about the fact that we can't actually stop ice from some of the immoral tactics and detentions that are taking place in our community.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I know that that concern is real, but I think it's important to address it in this way, which is to say that a failure to act on anything because we cannot solve everything. Is an enemy to justice. That justice only proceeds when we take actions step by step within the powers that we have.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so it is appropriate that this conversation has been led by communities who are impacted. But there are also soul searching and bravery required by those who have privilege, who use that privilege to stand in solidarity. And so I am honored to have had that opportunity in the course of this bill.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Denver was already extremely limited in the ways that we engaged in immigration enforcement. But it mattered to you. It mattered to the community that you couldn't see the policies. It mattered that I couldn't point them out to you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It mattered that there were gaps and it mattered that there was no accountability. Trust is earned through transparency in government. It's earned through trust. And this bill is intended to give you that transparency, to give you the trust that when you tell someone it's okay to go to the city, to use the city, that we mean it'",
        "'speaker_5': '. And so thank you. Thank you for the lesson that you brought to us about this importance, albeit not a complete protection from all the threats that you face. Tonight we vote on an ordinance, but it's not colonies ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's not even this council's ordinance. It belongs to the people of Denver. And it was a journey that I believe you all here tonight are demonstrating is about building your power and your voices for these next conversations. And so the mayor has acknowledged that you will have a space in those to the extent we continue the conversation'",
        "'speaker_5': 'as the council. When those conversations happen, a legal defense fund, you know, I will stand with you in fighting for that legal defense fund and for public funding for that. I know that you all wish. I know that you all wish for a policy to protect public but sensitive areas, and we share that goal.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Paul and I. But we did not have a strategy legally to do that in a way that we felt like we could deliver to yet. And so we do need to continue to examine what kinds of innovations we can have and to continue to monitor that conversation.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I have learned so much from immigration law experts, from folks who have had experiences, have made mistakes, have gone through our jail, have experienced probation or community corrections, and have tried to do right by our community and have experienced places where our our city did not live up to expectations and sticking to our local role.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I've learned a lot from our city employees who really, really want to focus on their local jobs. That's what they want to do. They want to they want to keep you safe. They want to run the jail. They want to give you library books.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They want you enrolled in recreation programs. They want you getting the benefits you need for your children. They don't want to be doing immigration enforcement. This bill gives you transparency. This bill gives our employees clarity. It does both of those things.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I learned a lot from our city attorney, David Broadwell. I want to thank you and. My partner, my dear friend Paul Lopez, who allowed me to come along on this journey which he had begun and, you know, seemed like there was enough work to share.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So thank you for allowing me to share. And to each of my colleagues, I have watched people struggle and move. I've watched them change their minds about tough issues. I've watched our agencies and our mayor move and change their mind and have issues in our climate.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That doesn't happen all that often, that people sit down and really listen and really grapple and really evolve and really move. And so you all did that. You all by sharing your stories. By sharing your truth. By sharing the real impacts.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This matters to you and therefore it matters to us. And so I hope it matters to all of our colleagues today by sharing a yes vote. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you for covering. Councilman Espinosa.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'First, I want to thank this council, the leaders of the sponsors of the bill and the administration, the mayor's office and his team. It's no stranger. You know, I wish we as a legislative body would exercise more of our actual charter power in sort of trying to meter out ordinances and laws that govern this city.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And to. This is this has been one of the processes that I wish we did more often. But I understand it's a lot of work. But the courage that Councilman Lopez had in coming forward and coming out strong with this bill and the passion and the support he had from the community basically caused the administration to act'",
        "'speaker_6': 'in a direction that I don't think they were going to just willfully go. Maybe, maybe eventually, but not sort of out from the gate and and, you know, through through the series of deliberations and meetings that the the sponsors had and that other members of council had with both sides, I think resulted in a in the announcement'",
        "'speaker_6': 'you saw last week, I think it was last week and tonight's vote. And to me, this is this is how we should work on behalf of everybody, you know, on a more consistent basis, ideally. But I do want to I do genuinely appreciate the courage.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Like I said, that Councilman Lopez expressed I mean I mean that in taking this on and and more so and not more so, but in the same amounts to Councilwoman Cannick because we Robin sorry but a couple a year and a half ago we had a conversation.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That maybe isn't supposed to be public and I won't go into detail. But you have tremendous strengths and capacities and skills that I think would, you know, expressed, you know, if you could sort of share those from a time on issues like this to sort of help, you know, other members of council like myself get things across'",
        "'speaker_6': 'the finish line that would benefit from those skills. And I think you just spoke to them. Your involvement in in supporting Councilman Lopez and making this a joint bill between yourself and him, you know, is what what made this to be so successful into a place where I could wholeheartedly support it and feel comfortable that we were'",
        "'speaker_6': 'working well within the lines that we that we that we have to that we have to to to work in. And I and I and I'm looking forward to the fact that you're you're you're both are going to be continuing to work and sort of continue to to investigate what can and should be done going forward anyway'",
        "'speaker_6': '. I do want to think and I wrote these comments down before Councilwoman Connie spoke, but I mean, same again. So this sounds a little bit repetitive, but I want to thank the vulnerable but brave members of the public that spoke today.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I also want to thank the privileged privileged, but just members of the public that spoke together in a unified voice, because that is that is what makes this country what it is. And as as as a shining example for how freedom and liberty should be, should be, should be carried out on this planet until we you'",
        "'speaker_6': 'know, that's how you make a more perfect union. We know we don't have it right even today. But we're, you know, we we by trying to explore and push and trying to create a more perfect union rather than take steps backwards, is is is essential to this endeavor.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And and I'm going to say it because it's going to happen before the secret and open races that are going to express their ignorance via email or social media in the coming hours, minutes and days. The reason there won't be an injunction is that this council is acting consistent with our Constitution.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The same cannot be said of the Oval Office occupant. So to to close too close, I'm actually going to quote no less than the great orator. W Yes, that w George Bush number 43. President George Bush. Yeah. And it goes this is the quote, Liberty for all does not mean independence from one another.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Our nation relies on men and women who look after a neighbor and surround the lost with love Americans at our best value. The life we see in one another, and must always remember that even the unwanted have worth our country must abandon all the habits of racism because we cannot carry the message of freedom and the baggage'",
        "'speaker_6': 'of bigotry at the same time. Thank you. With that, I'll be voting for Mr..'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman Espinosa. Councilman Cashman. Thank you, Mr. President. I'm deeply moved and very proud. Of what's going on in this room tonight, the power of the words of the community, the presence of a few members of our city attorney's office, other members of the administration.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'As has been mentioned, a great presence of our law, law enforcement community. I the last thing that I am worried about tonight is any form of supposed retribution.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That may or may not.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Come from the misguided, deluded. Occupant of the Oval Office I get in discussions with. Friends. I don't have a president. And they say, well, yes, you do. He was elected, but I don't and I don't want to quibble with words, but I can't.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Claim someone who finds.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Very fine people in a group of torch carrying racists that spew hatred about Jews and people of color and representatives of our immigrant and refugee.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'part of some sort of ill thought policy. We will continue to close the gaps that need to be closed. So I.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Want to truly.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank Councilwoman Lopez and Councilwoman Canete for for the courage that they've shown. And it takes courage to stand up to authority. It takes courage to compromise when the justice you seek requires compromise. So I'm very happy to be supporting this bill tonight.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Councilman Cashman. Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mr. President. This is a country of immigrants. You know, it's just so ironic that we're having to have this conversation in the year, you know, 2017, when this country was built on the backs of immigrants who came here from, you know, every country around the globe.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I just want to say, I stand in solidarity with the community and with my colleagues who have worked very hard with members of our community to bring this legislation forward. The fact that we see the the unity among so many different sectors of our community and organizations like ACLU and American Friends Service Committee and others who've'",
        "'speaker_7': 'been is we need unidos in so many who have said. We're not going to take this. You know, it is important for all of us to stand up and to speak on behalf of people who feel like they don't have a voice.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Who feel like they have to hide in the shadows, who are afraid to go to work. Who are afraid to go to school. I mean, we heard many, many different stories, not only in in committee, but at some of the public meetings that were held around the city about people who were living in fear.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Not that that hasn't happened for people who are, you know, undocumented across this country. But with the kind of climate we have with this president and I won't go into all those details, but we should not have to have people living in fear in the year 2017.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'When you see all the progress that was made through the civil rights movement in this country to be taking so many steps backwards. I am honored to support this tonight along with my colleagues and anxious to roll up my sleeves and work side by side with, you know, the efforts that still need to happen to continue to'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Colleagues to stand together on this side of history. All of you, the mayor, city employees, including law enforcement, are leaders who are working together for all people in Denver. We will not allow fear and hate to reside in our great city from the date that we discussed this in the Safe House Committee to this evening.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So much more on the political landscape has erupted. Open racism, white supremacy, anti-Semitism. As I shared in committee, I have been elected by the people of District 11, and I'm honored to represent their voice and talking with my children.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They helped me actually write my comments that I spoke of in Safe House, and I must really represent who my family is and who I am as well. My children are Spanish, Greek, Mexican, Black and Japanese.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Very immigrants and refugees. Refugees who I represent in my council district, which is 50% Latino and in Montebello is 62% Latino. We must have a society, a city and a community that is safe from fear. That is a basic human right.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We live in a time that fear and hate are driving public policy at the federal level, and we must strive and work together. Tyler Tirelessly for immigration policy reform. We cannot wait. In our democracy, we have the right as a local municipality to define how we choose to operate and govern.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And we are doing that here tonight. Dear friends who are part of my family, who I have known them since they were young babies are living in fear. Living in fear that their family members will be deported. Innocent children.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Mothers, fathers, grandparents. Innocent people who only came to our country to live the American dream. To have a better life, to have an opportunity. And now we know that DOCA is hanging by a thread. We never know what the next thing is going to happen coming down from the federal level.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It is our time to band together and do things right for our community. We need to make sure that our residents know their rights and know and understand what we.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Can as a local municipality can.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Do and what we frankly cannot do. I again want to thank Councilwoman Canete and Councilman Lopez for your strong leadership in a very uncertain time in our community and in our country. And I want to thank the mayor's office and law enforcement, because we are all working together to move a better Denver forward.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I'm proud to stand together and do this tonight together as the city of Denver. Thank you, Mr. President. Pro-Tem.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Gilmore. Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I want to thank everybody who came down here tonight and stayed to tell their stories. I want to tell a story also in July as we were preparing in Harvey Park for the annual celebration festival there.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Some constituents brought to my attention a yard sale that was happening across the street from the park. And when we went over and we saw the banner, it was not just a yard sale. It said deportation sale. And my my constituents said, you have to pass this bill.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So that we can address what's happening here. And so, as most of you probably know, I'm an old newspaper reporter. And so I followed my instincts. And two days later I went over and visited the house and spoke with the family.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And here was their story. The father who is no longer there. Was brought to this country by his parents when he was 13, and he is in his late thirties now. More than two decades ago. His wife is a citizen.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'His two teenage sons are citizens. His wife is battling cancer. Her skin was a bright red from the chemotherapy, and it was a very difficult and a horrible, horrible experience to be talking to this woman as she tried to sell her last belongings and move to San Diego because her husband had been arrested.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'On a misdemeanor warrant during a traffic stop in Santa Barbara, California, while they were out visiting. And ice just happened to be stopping by the jail to pick up someone else. And they saw he was in there and they saw that he was not documented and they picked him up, too.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And today he's sitting in a prison in Mexico. And his family sold all their belongings to move to San Diego to be closer to him. However, his arrest did not happen since Donald Trump was elected president. He was arrested last summer when Barack Obama was our president.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And nothing in this bill. Would have kept this family together here in Denver and prevented this from happening. In our hearings on this bill in committee, we heard testimony from an advocate who accompanied a woman to traffic court to provide interpretation services.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And while there, her client was arrested by ICE when she showed up. We've seen the YouTube videos that were referenced by the woman from the Myer law firm. Of ice, making arrests at our courthouse, tackling people in the doorways and folks screaming and crying as their family member is hauled away.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And there's nothing in this bill that's going to prevent that from happening and continuing to happen. Nor is that, as I'm reminded by the sponsors, nor is that even the intent of this bill. The intent of this bill is to help people, as I understand it, to help people in the community feel safer and more secure by'",
        "'speaker_8': 'codifying many of the disentanglement policies and practices we now use, which are now only in handbooks or custom and putting them into a body of laws. Because we know, statistically speaking, that's stepped up and more indiscriminate enforcement of immigration is harmful to our public safety.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We know this. We know that while crime is up slightly in Denver as a whole, the reporting of crime in Latino neighborhoods recent statistical look has shown that it's declined 12% since the first of the year since the inauguration of the new administration.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So we know that there is there is this effect. We know that people will fail to report crime, fail to give eyewitness statements to police, fail to show up in court and support their neighbors, whoever they may be, who have been victims of crime.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'If they fear that by doing so, they may be grabbed by ICE and deported. We know this. This is bad for the cause of justice. It's bad for public safety. It's bad for Denver. And it's bad for Colorado.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'If we want to have an impact on reducing ICE apprehensions at our courthouse and other public places which are disrupting our justice system, causing cases to be dropped, and denying justice to Denver families, we need to find ways to reduce the need for people to appear in person at our courthouse or other locations.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'As Andrea Savage, one of my constituents, brought up. I already have met with our county court presiding judge, the city attorney and others to discuss areas where we might be able to expand such things as pleading by mail, expand the payment of fines online, and other measures like that under which people do not need to come to'",
        "'speaker_8': 'the courthouse and risk exposure. And I will continue to work with the administration on this. Let me say that by representing a city that's trying to deal in a fair and a just manner with the presence of refugees, immigrants, whether documented or not, and all of our residents and visitors, I place the blame for our dysfunctional system'",
        "'speaker_8': 'squarely on Congress, which has kicked this can down the road on immigration reform for more than a quarter century. And they've left America's cities with a dilemma that while trying to recruit cities and counties into doing their work for them while we are trying to maintain public safety, it's absurd.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'To deport people, for instance, who were brought to this country as children and, quote, send them back to a place where they may have no operational memory at all of ever having been. It's terrible to rip families apart, and it's a travesty that good and decent people who are trying to make a better life for themselves and'",
        "'speaker_8': 'their children have to live in fear. The Denver community is enriched and it's better off for the many contributions of our immigrant community. But some people were not better off. Because of our practices and policies. Timothy Cruz was not better off.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And was not safer when we released a man from our jail in December whom I said asked to be notified about. We gave ice less than a half hour around midnight that this inmate was posting bail. And two months later, that man was arrested in the murder of Tim Crews at the 10th and Sheridan Light Rail Station'",
        "'speaker_8': '. So in committee a few weeks back, I voted no on sending this bill to the floor because as Lou Irwin noted in his testimony here tonight, one new provision in the initial draft prohibited us from honoring ICE requests for released notifications of certain inmates.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Unless the person in question had served time for a felony crime of violence within the previous seven years or under several other limited circumstances. I supported all the other provisions of the bill, primarily because, as Joy Athanasiou testified here tonight, my policy practice or custom, they were things we already were doing completely in accordance and in compliance'",
        "'speaker_8': 'with federal law and not in violation of any of our federal obligations. And despite. What Representative Dave Williams of Colorado Springs may believe and despite thank you and despite that, his own county, his own county follows many of the same policies that we do.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'In the previous version of the bill, we wouldn't have given us any notification when we were releasing the man later charged in the murder of Tim Kruse. We would no longer note if we would no longer have notified ICE if we were releasing a heroin dealer, for example, who might have come to this country not as an'",
        "'speaker_8': 'immigrant or a refugee, but to sell drugs and recruit our children and destroy our families. Denver is a welcoming and an inclusive community, but being a welcoming and inclusive community does not require us to abandon common sense by welcoming and making room for heroin dealers or violent criminals who in many cases, are victimizing the very same communities'",
        "'speaker_8': 'that are living in fear. So it's one thing to help make people feel safe in our community. But I want you I want you to be safe. So I am very appreciative that the sponsors, Councilwoman Kennish, Councilman Lopez, worked with Mayor Hancock and worked with the immigrant community, many of whom I see in this room tonight.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'To agree on a better balancing point between making our immigrant community feel safer and having them be safer. Removing that one provision and allowing us to honor ICE release notification requests for certain inmates, which I understand average about 15 a month.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Maintains a balance between establishing trust between police and the community. And protecting them from criminals who prey on them. I also appreciate the new versions inclusion of mandatory data collection on released notifications and their follow ups with quarterly reporting.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Because one of the most frustrating things about this issue has been the lack of hard numbers on which we could predict the impacts of what we were proposing here. So for these reasons, Mr. President, I am very happy tonight to be able to support fully this new version of the bill.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman Quinn. Councilman Lopez, I see you last up in the queue. And I know that you and Councilwoman Kennedy wanted the book, and so are you. Okay if I say a few things, and then I'll punch it to you to have the last word.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Age before beauty.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Part of what I meant.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I meant the other way around.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Just because you have that luscious hair. I first of all, I really wanted to thank the sponsors of this bill. Councilman Lopez, Councilwoman Kennedy, for all your hard work. David Broadwell and the administration, the mayor for all of their work on getting us to where we are.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And to the community that has really done a lot of hard work getting us to where we are. As some of the speakers said. And my colleague, Councilwoman Ortega said, there are very few of us who are not immigrants in this country, whether we are immigrants ourselves or the sons and daughters of immigrants or the grandchildren or'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the great great grandchildren or the great great great grandchildren. We are a country. We are a state. We are a city of immigrants. I know I certainly am. And that is what makes this place the amazing and diverse place that it is.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So this bill is about all of us. This we are one community in this room. I look around and I see that we have neighbors and we have friends. We have teachers, we have students. We are one community.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There were 32 speakers tonight. Every single one spoke in favor.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Of this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Bill. We are one community. There was a meeting that some of the advocacy groups held about this issue, a meeting that Councilwoman Lopez and Councilwoman Kennedy each and I think the three who were there were at where the community said, we want you to do this and put us on the spot.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It was a meeting that was at times uncomfortable. And immediately after that meeting, you know, we kind of had a huddle and Councilman Lopez and Councilwoman Kennedy said, we're going to take this on and we're going to come up with a bill.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And what I said to them then and every time they came back to me is, I've got your back. At the end of the day, this bill is not perfect. We still have a lot of work to do together in order to make sure that every single person in our community feels safe, that every single person in'",
        "'speaker_1': 'our community feels respected, and that every single person in our community feels valued. Because anyone who doesn't see or feel safe or respected or valued, that affects every single one of us because we are one community. So with my vote tonight and with our collective vote as the city council tonight, I just want to say.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'What I'm saying. What we're saying is we've got your back as a great honor to vote in favor of this. And thank you to everyone who got us to this moment and with that, to close us out.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Councilman Lopez. You know. When it when it's the start of college football season, you're going to see this quite a bit. Is this back and forth? So we like to throw those little barbs at each other. Thank you for your words and counsel, counsel President Clark.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You have had our backs. You are part of us. You were there. And in that meeting, I've never seen somebody so sure of that. That's like saying, hey, we're going to get into the brawl. We may not make it out.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And he says, Absolutely. I have your back. And Councilman Ortega. Had our backs. Early on as well, too. And they so much as said, well, you need us to co-sponsor. We'll co-sponsor with you. Our colleagues have been. Very thoughtful.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This council has been very thoughtful. These are a lot of new issues. These issues have been kind of forced on us, as you see most of our public hearings and zoning and, you know, tax increment financing districts and, you know, just a lot of boring city council stuff.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But a lot of our work has changed since November. We have changed in Denver and our priorities have changed in Denver. And I want to really acknowledge our colleagues. For. Writing that change with us? Right. And so thank you all.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you for your solidarity or support. The time to sit down, the time to ask the questions and and really go through this step by step. It's been a long ten months. I really. Really want to thank my colleague.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'My sister Councilwoman can each. Our our bill. Part of our bill on council. Your bill. When you hand it to us. Right. But on the council front, I couldn't ask for a better co-sponsor. For a better. Person in the struggle.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And my sister here. It's important to have these allies in our community. And I am myself an ally. My family came here at the border, crossed us. My family. One day we went to sleep. Mexican and woke up.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'American woke up. You know, United States citizen. We're all Americans. So thank you. To a wonderful co-sponsor and amazing councilwoman. I want to. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Please. Please. Led the way.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And in times where I was frustrated and wanted to burn the whole place down. Should I have? We're not going to win like that. All right, all right. All right, Robin. All right. So I you know, I want to say that I also want to say thank you to our staff.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'All right. Rodolfo. Paulina, Arianna has Sousse. Our team. It's very, very hard. So thank you. They're just as dedicated. They this is their lives as well to the mayor staff, the mayor, crystal, dad around in the back and the man who.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'And and Robin. And here in these two go at it, right? Not. Not in a combative way, but just kind of lowering around eye to see this and to see the work that's come out. On behalf of a very grateful city and community.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, David.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And losing the great man.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'In this city. The mayor, I want to thank in one man who doesn't think I'm going to call on him, but that man in the uniform way back there. That's Chief Quinonez.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Had our back.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The few who go back to our marches and go back to our work in oh six and oh five. And even before that, that man made sure that when we went to point A to point B, we got there in one piece, we got there safe, we got there peacefully.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And in all of those marches and this is what our rallies are compared to these other rallies you see on TV, not one act of violence, not one sign of somebody being vile. Just us wanting to be seen.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And it takes good people to do that in this city. And there are great people in uniform that cannot be here because they are out there. But he represents some of them in our sheriff's department as well, too.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Look, there there is there is nothing. There's never anything. False about hope. Right. Our our movement needs these allies. They need allies to stand in this gap. And. We usually refer to civil rights and human rights as something in history books, but it's not in history books.'",

We will not be moved. And a lot of movements we've been a part of on this council, folks in different capacities because we've seen the'",

        "'speaker_4': 'As has their male counterparts. We stand with our gay, lesbian and bisexual transgender communities. All right. So you're seeking to be recognized in their humanity. And now. This movement, the civil rights movement. Is now shining on our new Americans.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Because that's what our neighbors and brothers and sisters are. New Americans. And these are folks who have fled poverty. Have escaped famine. Who? Fled violence. Cross blistering deserts. Just to be free. Just to sit in the seats, the same kids sit in the same seats that our kids sit in, whether it be in school.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Where the brain is. Chambers just to be able to sit here today. Right. These are folks who. Humbly. Work. They build the city. They maintain your gardens. It may clean your offices and they serve your plates. But they also teach your children.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They also build your skyscrapers. We make it possible for this country to celebrate Thanksgiving? We? Will represent you as lawyers one day. And hold that clipboard when you're in the office. Looking for health care. Right. So. In essence.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We are this country. We lead this country. And last year and we've all known this, I'm preaching to the converted both on council and here in this room. But last year we watched. As our new president. Called us.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Rapists. Drug dealers and criminals. Our children cried. And fear. As a new president. President threatened to separate their families. And build a wall. Of deportation. And worst of all, in our community as a councilman, our children and our our community have stopped calling the police.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Nine cases of domestic violence. Nine cases so far. We know that people have have not showed up, not want to testify, not only to be seen because of this threat, because of this fear of deportation. And that ain't right.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'After after ten years. I know ten years as a councilman that our police department has been working there. They're there badges off trying trying to establish this trust, trying to make it clear that when you call the police, you're not calling ice.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then it's erased with the election of one occupant of the White House. And so we. As representatives were there this day, we were asked and looked in the eye by the community and said, Can you please? Help.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Can you help restore? Trust. And they handed us a bill. I said we will help to the best of our ability. So. And now. Shruti. And now the trumpet sounds. So tonight we are going to pass. What is going to be known as the Denver Public Safety Enforcement Priorities Act.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And let it let folks understand and know whether it's here or in Washington, D.C. or anywhere else. We're no longer afraid. Never afraid. And we're not going to allow anybody. Not even a sitting U.S. president. Not even a rogue agency.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'To coerce us. Or to force our city or its employees to violate the Constitution to do their dirty work. And if you have any business with us whatsoever. We ask for one thing. Show us a warning. Show us a warrant like everybody else, like other any other law enforcement agency in this country.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Show us that warrant. Because that is what we protect is our Constitution. So. In that. I just I just I just wanted to to end with with the thing that I thought about. And Robin would always remind me about this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But there's something that I thought that was always been said in our community, and that's what we do. Because it's not about them. It's about us tonight. It's about us. It's about our community. It's about our willingness to affect change in our ability to do it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And this council doing it. And that is that we do what we do. Not out of the hatred of our enemies. But rather for the love of our people. So with that, I want to thank all of you for being here.'",
