        "'speaker_7': 'He can read it now. I'll take it. So bear with me. This is a long one. So proclamation number 15 0589 Recognizing September 2015 is Childhood Cancer Awareness Month. Whereas a diagnosis of cancer at any age is disruptive to the lives of patients in their families worldwide, it is estimated that between 160,000 and 250,000 children are diagnosed'",
        "'speaker_7': 'with cancer each year, and approximately 90,000 will succumb to their illness. In the United States alone, cancer takes more children under the age of 14 than any other disease. And. Whereas, statistically, each school day, 86 children are diagnosed with cancer, and one and one in every 285 American children develop cancer before the age of 20.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And. Whereas, there have been key breakthroughs in cases of childhood, acute leukemias and pediatric cancer care. Children continue to receive chemotherapy, drugs and treatment developed in prior decades. Specifically, only three new drugs have been approved by the FDA to treat childhood cancer in the last two decades.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Treatment is intense and generally includes surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. Whereas. And. WHEREAS, although there have been tens of millions in funding allocated towards clinical trial research, there have been there has been very little improvement in the overall survival rate of childhood cancer in the last decade.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There are currently more than 380,000 childhood cancer survivors in the United States. And. Whereas is an imperative that the funding and research be continued so that the children with cancer could benefit from additional cancer therapies and drugs that lead to a greater number of cures.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And. WHEREAS, this month, we pay tribute to the families, friends, health care professionals and communities who lend their strength to children fighting childhood cancer, and may their courage and experience move others to pave the way for new cures and a brighter future for our children.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'So I'm glad I didn't choke up reading this this time. It was tough to read the first time. And now that you're calling, it's choking up again. This this has hit home to the district office personally, as many of you know.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Rita Contreras, longtime city employee district. One longtime desert district. One resident gave birth to a wonderful her son, Nathaniel, and he's been struggling with childhood cancer for years. And we knew at some point during her tenure with my office there would be some challenges.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And those challenges came sooner than expected that Nathaniel is persevering and he's a strong fighter. And I would just like to offer the podium to Nathaniel if he'd like to speak. So. To do that, right? That's right.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Um, I would like to say thank you for raising awareness for childhood cancer, because the more people who learn about childhood cancer and the challenges, the more we can fight for money to find a cure. There are many heroes, just like me, fighting for their lives every day, even though red is my favorite color.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I hope you will wear gold in September in honor of Childhood Cancer Awareness Month. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, President.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right, Councilwoman, I take it you're up.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Oh, my goodness. That's a tough act to follow. First of all, I'd like to ask that my name be added to the proclamation. And I've known Rita for a long, long time. Rita actually worked with me in my council office before before Nathaniel was born, actually.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I'm very much aware of the challenges that your family has dealt with. And I know it's symbolic of what all families go through that have children who are fighting cancer. And I just cannot imagine what those struggles are like day in and day out.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And Nathaniel, you're my hero. To see you on Facebook and see that big smile, you just light up my heart and we're all fighting for you and praying for you and all of the other children who are struggling with cancer.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I appreciate you coming and reading your comments and encouraging all of us, all of the adults in our community to do our part in making sure that we fight for the the funding that's needed so that young people in our community don't have to sit around waiting and waiting and waiting for the the research and the'",
        "'speaker_8': 'and the medications that are needed that can make a difference in your life. So thank you for being here tonight. And I love you and your mom and just keep praying for you. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Ortega. Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Nathaniel, I just want to tell you that there will be cures found. There is always hope. 50 years ago, when I was 11, I lost a brother to cancer. And there isn't a day that goes by that we don't remember him because his cancer has a very high survival rate these days.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But 50 years ago it didn't. So cures will be found. And God bless you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman Flynn. Councilman Lopez.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I want to thank Councilman Espinoza for sponsoring this proclamation and also welcome, Nathaniel. I know you've been here to the city council before, and I know that your mom has worked in the city council before.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I am so, so happy to see you. I'm so happy to see you walk up to the podium and speak. You know how many people get so shy and they're so scared to come speak? Even grown ups, when they come up here, they freak out.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You didn't freak out one bit. You used to really strong. And that's one thing I know about you is that you're very strong. And I'll tell you something. I had cancer, too. It was a different kind of cancer, but I did two.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I know how sometimes you got to take that chemotherapy taste like you swallowed a battery. It's gross, huh? It's really gross. And sometimes you can even feel like you're sick all the time. You feel tired. But it'll get better.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You just got to believe it. And you got to believe it in here. Okay. Ethan. Right in here. All right. You spend that time with your family and your brothers, and you'll get better. You'll get better. All right.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I also know something, not talking with other council members up here and your mom. And we all know that you love Legos. You do, huh? You know you love them. Okay, I do, too. And they're mine. Are a lot different from yours.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Mine didn't make sounds or they weren't cool. My Star Wars Legos. They are nothing like the Star Wars Legos now. And I'm kind of jealous, but so I'm going to bring you something special. We have a little box here of Legos from the city councils, from all of us.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And it's Iron Man, because that's who you are and that's who you're going to be. Right. And it's all in his heart, right? You know that. So I'm going to give these to you. And here's something else we got from the city council to.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'When I had that battery taste in my mouth and I felt sick and everybody's going to laugh because I'm not skinny. The only thing that really sat well was chicken wings. That was chicken wings. John Murray chicken wings.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And it was your favorite and it was my favorite and as the only thing I can eat. So I tell you what, when you get hungry again, go take your brothers and take your family and go get some chicken wings because they taste super good.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I'm going to give these to you when we're done with the proclamation. But you hang in there. Okay, Hito. You get through it. Believe me, you'll get through it. All right? Love you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman Lopez. Councilman Espinosa, you back up.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The Council President. I am the recipient of the proclamation. Cassandra is actually attending with her son Logan, who is a childhood cancer survivor. And so I just want to acknowledge that Logan is here in our audience as well.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'It's going to be really hard to follow up. Nathaniel tried to talk him into coming and doing. Do it. So. Good evening. Just over one year ago, I entered into this scary world of childhood cancer. When our five year old son was diagnosed with brain cancer.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'After the initial shock of diagnosis, I began researching everything relating to childhood cancer and the different treatments available. After many hours spent, I found it all to be very disheartening because of the huge lack of funding and studies being done to find a cure for our children.'",
        "'speaker_5': '4%. That is a very well known number in the childhood cancer world. Out of all of the funding for cancer in the nation, only 4% is given to help find a cure for our children. I don't know about you, but to me that's unacceptable.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Our children are worth more than four. They are our future. After discovering all of these facts about childhood cancer, my family and I made a pledge that we would stand up and fight for these children because kids can't fight cancer alone.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'A couple of days ago, my son was asked if he could have any one wish in the world. What would it be? His reply at only six years old. He would make all of the kids sick with cancer in the world healthy.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Good. Sorry. That's my wish, too. And we will fight until we find a cure. I want to thank you all so much in the city of Denver for pledging to help us fight for you. For a cure. That means the world to us.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'My name is Chris Andrew Green, and I'm the founder of Hope for Heroes, who Founding Hope program operating under the American Childhood Cancer Organization. Our mission is to help families through their journey with childhood cancer. All. It's possible.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We would like to invite you if you are interested in helping to spread. Aware. To support families struggling with childhood cancer. To go to our Facebook page. Hope for heroes. Dot asco. To find out many ways that you can help.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Denver We would so appreciate it if you would help us to turn this beautiful city gold for the month of September and help honor the brave children who are battling the biggest fights of their lives. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you so much. And thank you, Councilman Espinosa, for bringing that forward. All right, Madam Secretary, we are on to the resolutions. Will you please read the resolutions.'"

        "'speaker_2': 'One needs 571 council members. Can each and Flynn get them wrong? Looks good. Madam Secretary, can you take the first 1500 Catherine McInnis, would you like for us to do with this?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I had just a comment, and I actually was planning to do it on both bills at the same time. But since my colleague has called out Council Bill 571, I'll just do them separately. Sure, go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'My comments really apply to both Council Bill 570 is the contract between Denver and the Colorado Housing and Finance Authority for the creation of our first revolving loan fund for affordable housing. And I first want to thank especially my returning council members because the funding for this this new fund was a direct result, I think, of several'",
        "'speaker_10': 'years of budget advocacy from this council to put at first 3 million in 2014 and then another 3 million in 2015 and make that available to the department. My kudos to the Department Office of Economic Development for leveraging those dollars to create a $10 million fund out of our 6 million.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So they grew it by four with partnerships with the state. And we are going to be able to build, you know, some really important workforce rental housing with this fund. We know it's not enough. And I call out my my colleague, Councilman Brooks, with whom we've been working with the mayor.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Some of you may have seen the piece in The Post this Sunday, but this is a really important first step to getting workforce rental housing built in the city of Denver. And I really want to thank the department for their work.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We have several developments ready to go I'm sure we'll be seeing in quick succession. But it's an important moment to just take a pause and say this is our first time really having our own local funding source and being aggressive about this and more of that to come as we continue the conversation about a permanent source.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman, and must give kudos to you and Councilman Brooks for leading the charge from the council from that perspective. Right. Madam Secretary, you want to get to the second one in 571 and so, Councilwoman, can each other, Councilman Flynn, where either one of you wanted to call that out for a vote?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No. Okay. We'll start with comments in council.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you. The second bill is also a piece of a really multi-pronged strategy to expand access to affordable housing. In this case, by keeping the housing, we already have many of our tax credit projects and other things that were built with public money.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'They only are designated as affordable between 2030, every now and then 40 years, which means that they expire and we have more than 4500 units. I first want to acknowledge some of the private partners. We have Urban Land Conservancy and Enterprise Community partners who worked with the Office of Economic Development to commission the study that really tried'",

        "'speaker_10': 'And here we are just a month later, passing this ordinance, hopefully on first reading I'm counting on all year. And so this is, again, a really important step in the right direction to keep the housing we have by making sure the city gets a right of first refusal to buy any properties that are expiring and making sure'",
        "'speaker_10': 'that there are good notice provisions when people are thinking about selling those buildings. So a really important piece of legislation for our overall approach to affordable housing. And again, thank you to the department as well as to the community partners for bringing this to the Council's attention.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I plan on supporting it in the black vote. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman Flynn, Europe.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I will also be supporting them in a block vote. I just wanted to use this particular council bill as well as there are several others that the staff took a lot of time to work in committee and then also to meet with me separately.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Councilman Flynn. Councilman, I take it you're up.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I also want to add my comments of appreciation to Councilman Brooks and Councilwoman Kenney for their efforts in continuing to work work on this very important issue. I can remember back when the inclusionary housing ordinance was adopted, we had a group called S.O.S. that represented folks living in HUD housing, and they wanted to'",
        "'speaker_8': 'make sure that there were some protections in place. And that's where the original notification came from, so that anybody who had Section eight funding on their apartment buildings would have to notify the city if they were planning to opt out from continuing to operate that housing for Section eight tenants.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so to see that, you know, we've we've come back to 2015 and we're still dealing with the same issue in making sure that we have all government funded projects included in the notification. And it's really important. You know, we are losing apartment buildings in this city.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'If they are low income or affordable projects in my neighborhood, most of them have disappeared. The only ones that still exist are these protected properties. And so to know that we're including all of these in the city is really important to preserving the affordable housing that is still left in this city.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And the work to create the fund with the previous ordinance is critically important. We all know people who have kids coming back from college or family members that are struggling that can't afford to live in the city. And, you know, it's important that we have some strong policies.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I still would love to see our housing ordinance or housing plan be adopted so that we've got some clear guidelines for the development community, and it would provide some predictability for them and for the neighborhoods. But that's for another discussion, another time.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But I just want to thank everyone who has worked on this, the administration, our Office of Economic Development for, you know, just making this a priority. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Kathryn Espinosa.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yeah, sorry. I just I want to I do want to commend everybody that worked on this. I do think they're good measures and I'll be supporting them. But I don't want anyone to think that this is these solve anything.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We still have a very, very tough situation, particularly in my district where these properties are. Turning over and people are getting displaced and they get stuck in limbo between caring, basically paying the funds, the carrying costs for developers, intent on moving their plans forward.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Well, people can't actually migrate and move into other subsidized housing projects. And so there's other things that we need to structurally fix. These are two measures that go a step in the right direction. But there are still other things that we as a council will need to be tackling.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman. In other comments, questions 571 seen none. All that was all that were called out. So we are ready for the black vote.

        "'speaker_2': 'Madam Secretary. Please close the vote. And now the results. 1212 Eyes for 98 with its public hearing have been postponed to Monday, September 21st, 2015. All right. Next, we're on to the actual public hearing, which is on 503.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilman Lopez, will you please put Council Bill five of three on the floor?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thanks, Mr. President. I move the council bill five or ten 2015 be placed on final consideration and do pass.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It has been moved and seconded. Council Bill 503 approval approves the Zoning Map Amendment. The Council is required by law to conduct public hearings on zoning map amendments and Council's actions are subject to a court review in order to provide a record for the court reviewed testimony is recorded and any items presented to the Council are marked'",
        "'speaker_2': 'as exhibits and become part of the record. The public hearing for Council Bill 503 is now open. May we have a staff report?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Good evening, members of Council. I am a barge with the city of Denver's Department of Community Planning and Development, and I'm here to walk you through the request for a map amendment or rezoning at 22 through 44 South Adams Street, which is in Council District ten in the Cherry Creek Statistical neighborhood, 22 to 44.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'South Adams, the site you see outlined on the slide here is bound by South Adams Street, East Ellsworth Avenue and East Bayard Avenue. It's one block east of the Cherry Creek Shopping Center and the Cherry Creek Greenway. It's across the street to the across the street to the south is the Polaski Park and Gates Tennis Center.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The site is immediately adjacent to two RTD routes. There are additional RTD routes along Steel Street, a block away. The property is just under 1.5 acres. There are 211,000 square feet of buildings on the site now. The property owner is requesting rezoning to allow an increase in the floor area allowed on site over the floor area that's'",
        "'speaker_6': 'allowed on site by the existing plan, unit development or PWD. So just to get into the requested district is GMU. 12. It's in the general urban neighborhood context. That's the G. The EMU is multi-unit with a 12 storey maximum height.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'll walk you through a little bit of the existing context, starting with the existing zoning, which on the site is pegged right now to the north and west. The sites there are zoned GM you 12, which is the district requested by the applicant to the south is zoned open space to the east is a different PD PD'",
        "'speaker_6': '183, which is for the seasons apartment complex, a large mid-rise and high rise apartment complex. And to the northwest there is some mixed use zoning. So just to talk a little bit about the existing zoning rules that apply on the site.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'PD 75, was established in 1982. It was taken out of the former Chapter 59 hour three zone district. It has a height, maximum of 75 feet. It has a land coverage maximum. The area of the site that can be covered by buildings and impervious surfaces like parking lots, is a little over 52,000 square feet.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then there's a maximum floor area on the site of 221,000 square feet. A little over that, the use allowed on site is residence for older adults. This is the covered senior living facility and the parking required on site is 0.24 parking places per dwelling unit.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The Cranmer Park View plane also applies to the site. The site is downhill enough from the origin point of the view plane here though, that that viewpoint plane limits maximum heights on the site to 150 to 159 feet approximately, which is above the maximum height limit of the requested zone district.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so the view plane doesn't really factor into isn't really a limiting factor on the site or wouldn't be if the site were resolved. The existing land use on site is multifamily high rise, which is consistent with much of the nearby land use.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There of course to the south is open space and then nearby about a half block away, there's some office uses and a little bit further away, of course, the Cherry Creek Shopping Center, there's commercial uses as well in the existing context.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Looking up and down Adams Street here you see the existing covered senior living complex and there are two joined buildings that are part of the complex. The taller of the two buildings is eight stories. That was the original building and then the after the PUD was adopted, a second building was built to to the south that's linked'",
        "'speaker_6': 'together. And you can see here there's a limited single row of parking in between Adams Street and the buildings. The rest of the parking is provided behind the buildings off of the alley. As you see in the lower left slide.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They're looking at some of the nearby buildings on the upper right. That is a 16 story residential building that's directly across the street from the site, directly across Ellsworth to the north. And then in the on the lower right, that slide, we're looking north on Adams Street.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And that that taller building on the left is part of the covered senior living complex. That is not part of this Map amendment application. They're only looking at the buildings on the right hand side of that picture, which are in the pad on the left hand side.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That part of their complex is already zoned GMU 12. And that's that building that's across the street that's part of covered on the upper right. And then on the lower right, there is part of the seasons complex, which is the high rise residential complex that's just to the east across the alley.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So looking at the process, there's been several points of notification to registered neighborhood organizations and to the counsel office. And also signage was posted on the site prior to the planning board hearing as well as prior to this hearing.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'll walk you through the review criteria for this MAP amendment. Starting with consistency with adopted plans. The plans that apply on this site are comprehensive comprehensive plan 2000 Blueprint Denver and the Cherry Creek Cherry Creek Area Plan excuse me, Comprehensive Plan 2000 defines Cherry Creek as an urban center, and it says that an urban center is a'",
        "'speaker_6': 'place with an opportunity to concentrate population and land uses within a limited geographic scope. Comprehensive Plan 2000 says a number of other things that that are relevant to this rezoning about reusing existing sites where infrastructure is already in place and you'll see those in your staff report.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Moving to Blueprint Denver The concept land use for this site is regional center, which is intended to include a balance of retail, employment and residential uses. It is located in a Blueprint Denver area of stability. As you can see on the map there, those hatchet lines indicate area of change.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so there's areas of change mapped very nearby on nearly all sides of this property as part of the Cherry Creek Area Plan implementation process. This property was actually and the immediate surroundings were taken out of being designated as an area of change.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They were previously within Blueprint Denver with the recognition that the high density residential character of this particular area was desirable to retain in place. So those areas of stability are, as you know, places that have been identified to maintain the character of an area while accommodating some new development and redevelopment.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The future street classifications mapped in Blueprint Denver are residential collector for East Bayard and then the other adjoining streets are both on designated locals. And the language that's used in Blueprint Denver about these street types primarily relates to them being used to access properties and to serve as transit routes for pedestrians and bicyclists as opposed to being'",
        "'speaker_6': 'regional. All types of corridors for transit. Steele Street, a block away to the west, is designated as an enhanced transit corridor by Blueprint Denver, where the goal is to increase transit ridership, improve service and transit efficiency. So get to the recent, relatively recent 2012 Cherry Creek Area Plan that actually looks at sub areas within Cherry Creek and'",
        "'speaker_6': 'places this site within the Cherry Creek East Sub area. One of the things it says about Cherry Creek East is that it's a highly desirable, moderate density residential neighborhood that also includes a high density office and residential district on its western edge, which is kind of that more purple hatched area where this site is located.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then it talks a little bit more about the character of that particular part of Cherry Creek East. Talking about the area west of Madison where this site is located, it says the district supports primarily high rise residential and office uses with buildings reaching 16 stories.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's really talking about the existing context there, the concept or future height map that's in the plan. You see on the right hand side of that slide, that dark purple area where the site is located, says that the desirable concept land use for this site is 12 stories.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Another interesting recommendation of the Cherry Creek Area plan is that it specifically calls out the existing pods that are in the Cherry Creek East area for potential rezoning as opportunities arise and with property owner interest that there's an opportunity to work together with the city to determine the appropriate base.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Denver Zoning Code District that will serve to implement the Cherry Creek Area Plan. So we have an opportunity to do that tonight. So we would find KPD staff that the requested MAP amendment is consistent with the adopted plans that apply to the site and then looking at uniformity of district regulations.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The next criteria the requested zone MAP Amendment improves uniformity of zone district regulations by rezoning to a standard zone district. That applies to other very similar properties nearby, including the the remainder of the covered project across the street.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And we find also that the project furthers public health, safety and welfare. Looking next at justifying circumstances. The applicant has indicated that changed circumstances or changed changing character is the justifying circumstance. And some of the things that have changed since this PD was adopted quite some time ago are the adoption of multiple new plans.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'All of the plans that we just talked about were adopted after that PD was created. So all of those recommendations didn't factor into that PD. Also, of course, the adoption of the new 2010 Denver zoning code. That creates a whole new range of districts that provide opportunities to this site.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then also, as we all know, the general Cherry Creek area has been changing and there's been a lot of redevelopment and there's a need for potential flexibility to keep pace with the changing character of the area. And then just moving back to the last criteria.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Consistency with neighborhood context, zone, district purpose and intent. This is looking at the intent statements for the neighborhood context and zone district that the applicant seeks to rezone to in the Denver Zoning Code. Some of the things that the code says about the GMU U12 district, it states that they're appropriate for residential for areas with residential uses'",
        "'speaker_6': 'that are primarily located along local and residential arterial streets, for areas with a regular pattern of blocks and street grids as well as alleys that the character of the area that is covered by the zoned district would include residential buildings with a consistent shallow to moderate front setback.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And that moderate, high to high residential building heights are typical in that area. At the Planning Board public hearing in early July, the planning board voted unanimously to recommend approval, finding that all applicable review criteria had been met, and CPD also recommends approval based on finding that all review criteria have been met and I would be happy'",
        "'speaker_6': 'to answer questions. And we also have the applicant here as well to answer questions.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. All right. So we have three speakers lined up and I'll call all three. You can make your way to the front pew. Sean Maley, Michael Klein and Susan Smirnoff. You can make your way up and Mr. Maley, you can go ahead and begin your remarks when ready.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you very much, Mr. President. Madam Members. City Council. My name is Sean Maley. 1660 Lincoln and I'm serving as applicant representative for Covered Senior Living. And as you heard from Abe's staff report, this is a rezoning to Jim you 12 from PDS 75 from 1982.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And unlike many rezoning applications which are in order to accommodate new development, this application is not necessarily for new development per se, but to accommodate for renovation of carloads properties that is currently ongoing. Codes update to the properties is mainly interior, but there is an exterior circulation walkway on the outside of the building that put us over'",
        "'speaker_6': 'the threshold of the PDS lot coverage allowance. And so this 900 square foot walkway goes from the south building to the east building, but you should call the east the north building because it's the to the north and south buildings on the lot.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So currently residents wishing to circulate between the two buildings either have to go outside or go through the dining area, which oftentimes the covered will have activities going on in the dining area. So that circulation disrupts that. So the purpose of this rezoning application, when we met with staff about this renovation project was to rezone in order'",
        "'speaker_6': 'to accommodate this development. Again, we have no other plans to redevelop the site other than the current project that has been submitted. And we also worked closely with the Cherry Creek East Neighborhood Association that is here supporting us tonight.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I'll keep it short and sweet. If you have any questions about the rezoning process or the application, I'm happy to answer those. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. Maley. Next, we have Michael Kline.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Good evening. I'm Michael Klein. I'm the executive director of Commode Signor Life. I live at 1795 Locust. Just a few facts were nonprofit, were located in Cherry Creek East. And we provide affordable and subsidized senior housing for people, seniors, 62 years and older.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We provide social services, meals, transportation activities, exercise a full range services. We were established in 1971 and we have every reason to stay where we were at. We actually recently renegotiated with HUD, so we're around for at least another 15 years, which is really good.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'As Sean mentioned, we've been spending a lot of money in upgrading the facility, making sure that it meets the needs of our seniors in doing this project. We really wanted the circulation, which would allow residents to go back and forth between the building without having to go outside, without having to go through the dining room.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We never thought when we started the project that it would be a six month rezoning process because we were short by only 132 square feet. But so be it. We're here. I think, as I mentioned, this project will really add to the life of the seniors that live within our building.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We work very closely with the community. Cherry Creek East Association is here to support us and we worked with Councilwoman Robb in the past and with Council Man new now and I think that's about it. If you have any questions, I'd be happy to answer.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. Klein. Thanks. Susan Smirnoff.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Mr. President, members of the council. I'm Susan Smirnoff, 240 South Madison Street. I'm here representing Cherry Creek East Association tonight. Cherry Creek supports the proposed rezoning to GMU 12 hour or no had several are much I will say thoughtful outreach.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We emailed the 400 person email list that we had with information about the rezoning. We invited any and all community members, not only in our neighborhood but in surrounding neighborhoods, to come to our board meeting where Covered was very gracious to host the meeting and answered all questions that we had.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We also did special outreach to Mountain Shadows, which is the abutting R and excuse me away that is next to Covered. We also did special outreach to Cherry Creek North Neighborhood Association because we share an area plan with them.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'There was no OP as well. I would say there was only one person who just didn't support any rezonings of any sort, but otherwise there was unanimous support both from the neighborhood and from the board. We recognize that the request is in conformance with the Cherry Creek Area Plan and other adopted plans and in consideration of public'",
        "'speaker_10': 'outreach. Cherry Creek East Association was unanimously in support of the Capote request. We would add that we very much appreciate a door and love having covered in our neighborhood, and we can't say thank you enough. I would say that if helpful to anyone, what triggered this rezoning?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'If Michael and I were to stand up, hold hands and stretch our arms out and spin in a circle, that much space is about what triggered this. So in essence, we kind of said, Well, okay, fine. So we're good to go.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Smirnoff. All right. That concludes our speakers. And we are now for questions. Any questions from members of council? Councilman Espinosa.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Can I speak to a barge, please? High aim is a variance process, not not a tool that you can use on a party.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It would potentially be an option. However, that's a particularly potentially unpredictable scenario.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But that's the owners decision, correct? What's that? That's up to the property owner to make that determination. All right. That was it. No further questions. All right. I have a question actually have questions for a mr. Klein and Mr. Maley.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Actually. Mr. Klein. Mr. Klein, I'm sorry that you ended up in a six month process. Are you familiar with the Board of Adjustments and the variance process? Could you repeat that again? Are you familiar with the variance process in the Board of Adjustment?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Not until the process came up and we engaged Sean to help us walk through the process. So why did you choose to go through the six month rezoning process as opposed to probably a far less costly and more expeditious Bowa process prior to embarking on the rezoning process?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think at least in our initial one, what we had heard was that this was the way the city was recommending. Also, we talked with the city and they were saying that they were looking to move everyone to follow the plan that had been established and they would support that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So we felt that was the safer way to go. Okay, I. I can't speak for the board, but I did sit on it 132 feet on a 900 square foot addition on a building this size. Probably going to find some support there.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The legitimate hardship, if the idea is binding you, I think. You think Mr. Malley or Maley. That Malley or Maley mainly. Sorry Sean. So. Yeah. Just simply y you know, if, if you were advising your, your, your, your owner, why did you select the redevelopment, I mean the rezoning route as opposed to the far simpler, less costly'",
        "'speaker_7': 'board of adjustment around.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So to my knowledge, plans were submitted on the renovation project and actually a number of reviews had taken place and some sign off. And it was actually actually somewhat mid-stream that zoning realized that there was this 132 square foot delta between the Pudi and the zoning.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I can't speak for all those meetings because I wasn't engaged that time. I'm not sure if the Board of Adjustment Process came up at that time, but when we did sit down with staff and had a pre-application meeting, you know, the policy of rezoning towards this was, of course, in February of of this year.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You know, the policy of of coming into the new code and rezoning into standard new code districts was encouraged. It's included in the Cherry Creek Area plan. So that was the path that we followed. You know, I think you bring up a good point in the Board of Adjustment.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm not familiar right now. I know you served on it with the hardship criteria, so I can't cite those off the top of my head. But we were, you know, a combination of being midway through the process or not midway, but into the process and following the direction of city staff found that the rezoning met the criteria'",
        "'speaker_6': 'and the guidance from the plans, and that's just what we pursued.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yeah, and I'm only looking at this from a taxpayer so thing that's a lot of city resources investing in staff to to sort of go through these presentations and all of that when this is a pretty cut and dry hardship.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You had overwhelming support from the Arnaud's and sort of all the different players there strongly encourage you to use that tool on future insignificant changes like this. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yep.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman. That's another.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes. My question.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay, great. One that I just made with my computer. All right. So any other questions? 503. Seen none. Public hearing is now closed. Time for comments, Councilman. New?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes, I really I know the coverage staff and I'm really pleased to support the rezoning tonight. And and as you know, covered means honor or respect. And in my interactions with how the staff treats residents is just that with honor and respect.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I'm just so proud of having this organization in the Cherry Creek community. It's a wonderful nonprofit organization and like Mr. Classy has been around since the, you know, gosh, through the seventies and so provides wonderful services for senior citizens and very unique example for Cherry Creek of having low income housing in Cherry Creek is it's almost'",
        "'speaker_6': 'an oxymoron. So it's a wonderful, wonderful example and we're so proud to have them in our community. As I had sort of fun when I was doing my campaign, I went over to converse and talk to the residents and they are so wonderful and talented and smart and and I said how I remember going the first night'",
        "'speaker_6': ', going to their dining area, and they were so chatty and so glad that we were there. And, and I went to the first table and they all smile, their motherly looks and, you know, very charming and sweet. And the first lady says to me, What do you do about that damn parking?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I said, Well, they are on their on target. They're so smart. I had one of the roses send me a 20 page thesis on how to improve transit in our city. So they are so intelligent, so, so smart.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm so proud to be a part of that community with them in our organization. So I'm really proud to support the rezoning effort and look forward to seeing how they provide greater services to our senior citizens. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilman, new councilman Ortega, you're up.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Mr. President. This one is a no brainer. And I remember during the campaign process going over to Harvard as well and speaking with Mr. Klein, where he showed me this area that was going to need to go through a whole rezoning process.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And there should be an easier way for us as a city to figure out how to fix these, you know, these little nuances that shouldn't have to require, you know, going through a lengthy and costly process. But I am happy to support this.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I just wanted to say, Mr. New, I. Councilman knew when I when I was over there, the issue they were talking to me about was the concern about losing their Safeway store and and specifically the the ability to be able to get prescriptions and groceries from there because it's within walking distance.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I'm not sure what's happening with that, but they are very active and very vocal residents that live there and was happy to engage with them. And so I'm happy to support this tonight. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Or any other comment on 503? Scene none, ma'am. Secretary Roll Call.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'New Ortega. Sussman Black Eye Brooks Espinosa. Flynn, I. Gilmore Cashman. I can eat Lopez.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Hi.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Mr. President. Hi.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Madam Secretary, please close the voting and ask the results.'",
        "'speaker_4': '11 eyes.'",
        "'speaker_2': '11 eyes. Five of three has been placed on final consideration and does pass on Monday, September 28, there will be a required public hearing on Council Bill 586, changing the zoning classification for 4245 Fox Street 4143 to 4159.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Fox Street four 642 West 43rd AV 4211 Fox Street and 4205 Fox Street. Denver, Colorado 80216. Any protests against Council Bill 586 must be filed with the council offices no later than Monday, September 21st, due to the Labor Day holiday.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The next time you'll see council as a whole will be on Monday, September 14th, 2015. Have a safe and happy holiday season. No other business before this body. This meeting is adjourned.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Denver eight TV. Your city. Your source.'",
