The airport says the RFP process wasn't dated, but they canceled that. RFP changed the parameters away and issued a second RFP. Key to me is the applicant with the alleged improper behavior was on the first RFP, but not on the second'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Maxfield. You're welcome. So my question is, I, too, was concerned when I heard questions about the changes that were being made to the ownership maximum ownership calculations. Can you clarify for me how that piece was scored in the RFP or how it could have affected the outcome of who was selected and what the connection'",
        "'speaker_0': 'might or might not be between those two?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Sure. So concentration of ownership is a policy that the airport has in place has been in place since 2007. It limits essentially the amount of square footage one entity can own at the airport, just so we don't put more concentration in one entity's hands at the airport.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So the concentration of ownership policy, I get it can be murky at times. I understand that. I think it did. We acknowledge it is a little murky and difficult to understand. We are going through a review process right now with our concessionaires in a third party, and we intend to hopefully release some additional changes to the policy'",
        "'speaker_7': 'or a revision in the next few weeks. But it has no really no bearing at all on the selection criteria that's used in the RFP. The concentration of ownership policy comes into effect after an award has been made.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And essentially, if that potential awarded party, the recommended party from the third party panel evaluates that proposer and says this is the recommended awardee, then that award then has to go through the concentration of ownership calculation process. If they're determined to be over the concentration limit that the policy sets in place, then we ask them to divest'",
        "'speaker_7': 'of their current holdings before awarding them the contract.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So if I may just follow up and make sure I understand that. So there's no points awarded in the selection criteria based on this calculation? That's correct. Not scored. And if someone would have been over, would they have been prevented from bidding?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Did it have any impact on who could bid?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'No, it doesn't prevent anyone from bidding. We do as a courtesy request that somebody identifies if they won that RFP, if they would be above the concentration. So we can understand what their divestiture would be if they were awarded the contract.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And then my last question is just it sounds like you have learned some lessons about the policy in terms of how it's updated. And so you're taking some steps regarding that. It you mentioned very briefly, but can you clarify?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yeah, clearly we understand that square footage, you know, how it's measured, how it's quantified is something we need to look at. We also understand that the policy, the calculation that's contained within the policy creates some ambiguity. So we're trying to find a way, and we've been working with our concessionaires for the last few weeks to identify a'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Don't go too far now. So can you help me understand what the timing of the change was and what the involvement from the concessionaires was at the time that change was made? Because it's my understanding it was a 20% threshold and then that was changed to 24%.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So what's the timing of that as it applies to, you know, the RFP being out to bid and all of that kind of stuff?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Sure. And it's what we need to make sure you understand is clear, is that there were two hour fees, as was suggested by Councilwoman Fox when RFP went out in April of 13. That was terminated and another RFP was started in October of 2013.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'During the period of time that the first RFP was on the street, we were working with the concessionaires. We had several meetings and conference calls to engage them in the revision of the of the policy. And the policy change was enacted just before we released the October of 2013 RFP.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. And so it wasn't done specifically for the release of the RFP, or was it?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. So it just happened to be that's the timing of when it got done. And so that new policy would have applied to that or any other contract that was being awarded at the time, is that correct?'",

        "'speaker_6': 'As I understand it, the United Airlines lease is actually dependent on our restructuring the debt, even if we are taking action on it. First, when this proposal was before the Business Development Committee, I asked the position of other airlines since United Airlines gets far and away the most benefit from this package.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'The portions to come later dealing with restructuring debt and modifying amateur resolution are what benefit all carriers proportionately. The total package, including this least change, is worth $45 million of airline benefit per year. For major airlines, United's scores, 35 million of the benefit.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Southwest 4.5 million. And Frontier 2.5 million. A bit lopsided for a level playing field. Lastly, I discovered a troubling issue concerning timing. DIMIA gave the details of this agreement to other airlines. The Friday before council's Tuesday meeting. Needless to say, corporations need more time to evaluate such important changes if they're to have opinions or input.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'But but, Patrick, perhaps a couple of questions. One, you can talk briefly about the SCOOP and Chuck financial method by which we're doing this and other airlines will benefit. And specifically addressing Councilman FATSIS, concern of the disproportionality of the payments, because I believe that's because of the proportion in which they use the airport.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes. Thank you, Councilman Brooks and members of council. My name is Patrick Heck. I'm the chief financial officer for the airport. In regards to the to the second part of your question regarding the proportionality benefits, when you look at how carriers operate at the airport, they're different sizes.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'United has about 40% of our market, for example. And so when you they also lease approximate, they pay about 50% of the airline revenue that comes to the airport. So when you do anything to change the financial structure of the airport, that positively affects the carriers.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'They're going to have a larger impact from that just because of the way it's structured. That's the proportionality that Councilwoman Ford's parts mentioned in United's case, though, however, United's been at the airport. They signed a lease in 1995 to help the new airport at that time get off the ground, get it financed and get it open and'",
        "'speaker_7': 'united. Signed a 30 year lease in order to do that. And as a result, they have legacy airline costs from 20 years ago that other carriers haven't had the burden of. And as you all know, the airline industry has changed dramatically in the past 20 years.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This is a reflection of the airport being financially successful because of that long term lease United signed and us recognizing that in order to keep them here, we need to change to adapt to the changing airline model. And so that's that's what this leases is really about.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The first part of your question regarding this group and Chuck, we have debt associated with the regional airport of about two and a half billion dollars. That is still outstanding. That debt is scheduled to be paid off in 2025.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'As a result, our payment on our debt goes down dramatically in 2025. This scoop, and Chuck, as we call it, is taking some of that debt now and chucking it out past 2025 to take advantage of that debt fall off so that we can deliver benefits to the carriers now.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think you all know money now to the carriers is much more important than money, say, ten or 15 years from now. So this allows us to leverage that debt structure and provide savings to the carriers now.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And another question, Patrick, is I think it's important to set for the public and folks for counsel to understand the climate in which we're at with United Airlines downsizing in some of these other hub airports, for example, Cleveland and things like that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so maybe Cincinnati. Yes. Set the tone there a little bit.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Certainly, the airline industry has gone through a massive amount of consolidation in the past 4 to 5 years. Delta combined with Northwest, United and Continental, Southwest and AirTran, American and U.S. Airways. So we have fewer players and fewer players means that there just needs to be less of these hubs.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I could rattle off Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Cincinnati, Memphis, Raleigh, Durham, you name it. The list goes on and on of cities that once formerly had large airline hubs that have lost them. And there cities that if you look at that list are not too dissimilar from us in a lot of ways, medium sized cities that don't necessarily'",

        "'speaker_5': 'I don't know if we have someone here from our city's asset office sky. Can you help answer a question? So I don't know what the zoning is on this property. I know exactly where the parcel is and I'm just trying to figure out what it is that the buyer plans to do with the property.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Do we have any idea?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Lisa Lumley from Real Estate is not here this evening, but I'll have her get back to you. I think she has had conversations with the purchaser about what their intention is, but I do not recall that off the top of my head.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. Mr. President, I will vote for its passage. Well, it's it some final.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mr. President, if I may. I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Go ahead, Councilman.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I chaired a committee that this came through on consent, and I was actually going to ask Councilwoman Sheppard, this is in her district, and she did a little due diligence on it before we put it on consent.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I don't want to put you on the spot, Councilwoman Sheppard, but you may be able to answer the question. And if not, we can certainly.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Councilman. Can each councilman I tell you what I recall in the discussion was I was concerned about the historic property that is part of this parcel. And so I was asking what was going to happen to the historic property there.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I was not told what the larger redevelopment was, but I was told that the developer would continue to keep the historic property that it's there and incorporate it into the overall development. But I did not learn what the larger redevelopment was.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we don't know if it's a mixed use or if it's just housing or if it's going to be commercial.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I don't know that at this time.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. I would appreciate hearing from our real estate office to learn more about what is proposed on the site.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We'll get you that information here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right. That was all of them, I believe. And I'll just quickly look up and down. I believe we got them all. So we are now ready for the block votes. All of the bills for introduction are ordered published.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilman Brooks, will you please put the resolutions on the floor for adoption?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Why, certainly, Mr. President, I put the following bills on the floor for resolution to be adopted in a block. Others 2014 653 667 696 679, 683, 742 and 743.'"
