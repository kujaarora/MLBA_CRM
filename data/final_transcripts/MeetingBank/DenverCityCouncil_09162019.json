        "'speaker_10': 'things. Plan recommendations seek to encourage a mix of land uses, including office, commercial retail and a variety of housing types for different demographics and income levels. The community also wants to ensure that new development doesn't negatively impact adjacent neighborhoods and that new buildings are well designed and constructed of sustainable materials.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Of similar importance are recommendations that speak to affordable housing, the threat of gentrification and involuntary displacement. The plan recommends incentivizing affordable housing for households of all ages, sizes and incomes. In a nod to some of the historic buildings on campus, the community has recognized the opportunity to explore reusing some of the buildings for affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'One such example is Pink Crystal Hall, a former resident, a former residence hall, which will include 60 plus units of affordable housing as announced earlier this year by the developer. The community has had the opportunity to weigh in on these recommendations.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And as you can see, there is a great deal of support. Results show us that 96% of survey takers strongly agree or somewhat agree with the land use recommendations, 95% strongly agree or somewhat agree with the historic preservation recommendations, and 88% strongly agree or somewhat agree with the economy and affordable housing recommendations.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Throughout the planning process, there were a number of topics that warranted future conversation and work with the community. These are topics of utmost importance to the community. The first being the height of any future buildings in the plant area.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It is important to note that the Ruby Hill View plane, enacted in 1969 guides the building heights that can be achieved on the eastern side of the campus. The plan supports varying building heights of up to eight storeys, but as redevelopment occurs on the campus, it will be important to maintain these sheds to and from it due'",
        "'speaker_10': 'to the topography of the site and height restrictions imposed by the view plane. Not every portion of the eight story maximum area indicated on the map in front of you allows for buildings to reach that level of intensity.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Additionally, the plan calls for design standards and guidelines that further restrict the number and placement of any building over five storeys to one single location with the limited footprint to protect the views. It is equally important to transition from higher intensity development in the center of the campus to lower intensities that are compatible with the existing residential'",
        "'speaker_10': 'areas where the viewpoint does not cover the western portion of the campus. The plan further imposes height limitations that speak to this transition. Finally, the plan contains recommendations that speak to supporting and enhancing public transit in the plan area, especially along Federal Boulevard.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Some of the most defining features of the Libretto Heights campus are the sweeping views of downtown Denver in the front range of the Rocky Mountains. As such, plan recommendations note the importance of maintaining these view sheds. Historically, there was a grand view of the administration building from Federal Boulevard, and the community finds this view said to be'",
        "'speaker_10': 'one of the most important attributes to preserve. Therefore, the plan calls for zoning regulations, design standards and guidelines, and other regulatory tools to ensure that the height and mass of new buildings are not only compatible with the existing historic structures, but also protect and frame the key view sheds.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Furthermore, the plan identifies key open space areas identified by the community and specifically calls for a publicly accessible open space area or promenade in front of the administration building. As I touched on historic preservation and the re-use of historic resources is a central concept within this area plan.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And as such, there are several recommendations that speak to this topic. The history of the campus, coupled with the preservation and re-use of existing structures and features on the site where some of the top community concerns and desires.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'A consultant, written inventory and survey report along with community feedback provided direction on which campus structures and features should be prioritized for preservation and re-use. These include eight historic resources the administration building in Chapel Pancreas, the Hall Cemetery, Matchbook Hall, Pool, Library and theater.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Similarly, the community agreed on using multiple tools to achieve its vision in both the short and long term, including historic designation, preservation, easements and historic covenants. These options allow for the best tools to achieve the preservation and re-use of historic structures, including local historic designation of the resources as individual structures and or historic districts.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The second section of the Small Plan of the small area plan deals with mobility. There is a strong desire to improve streets by making them more connected, safer and more comfortable. This includes making streets more functional for pedestrians with amenities like enhanced crosswalks and medians, street trees and lighting.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The need for intersection improvements, especially along Federal Boulevard, is critical to create a safer environment for pedestrians and cyclists. Additional multimodal recommendations include connections to and from the Bear Creek Trail, the South Platte River Trail, and making it easier and more comfortable to take bus and light rail.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'These detailed recommendations can be found within the plan and in the staff report. Again, the community had an opportunity to weigh in on these recommendations. And you can see there's a great deal of support. Results show us that 96% of respondents strongly or somewhat agree with the mobility recommendations contained within this plan.'",

The plan also encourages a new street connection extending south from the Denver School of Science and Technology as a way to relieve'",
        "'speaker_10': 'traffic congestion along Dartmouth Avenue. The community has also specifically called out South Julian Street and West Amherst Avenue as needing traffic calming measures as redevelopment occurs. The plan further outlines pedestrian and bicycle priority streets with the maps on the screen right now.'",

        "'speaker_10': 'The final section of the plan is quality of life infrastructure. This includes recommendations for addressing access to healthy food parks, recreation and open space, green infrastructure, and how the how the built environment affects health outcomes. The plan puts a focus on new tree plantings along streets to improve walkability and comfort for residents and visitors.'",

The second phase started when Councilman Flynn outlined his vision for the campus, and we realized we had a partner who understood our interests.

        "'speaker_8': 'We've had very consistent support from the City Planning Department on this, and it is very critical to our support for the plan. Number two, the residential alleys between the extension of Bates Avenue and South Irving Street should be designed to serve local traffic only.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'There was also a Spanish language meeting that had very little attendance, leading us to believe that there is not much outreach in this heavily Latino community. The lack of outreach was disappointing. When asking questions during the area plan meetings.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The community had been told over and over that certain topics would not be addressed because it was too soon in the process. Then we found out just a week after the summer, small area plan meetings were over by accident that the service plan was released and including many of the answers to our questions, but still not about'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the but still there was no answer about the amount of affordable housing other than with Pam Hall. Another major concern an historic, historic district designation in open space, which specifically includes views in Denver. We, what identifies us as Democrats and what people talk about when they come from outside is the views in the mountains.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's the number one thing that make this a special place visually. So that brings me to The View planes at Loreto Heights. Do we want to have row after row of buildings that block views of the beautiful administration building and block views from the administration building?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'These views and the buildings on the campus are treasures. The plan also does not allow for enough green space. There needs to be more, which complements the historic feel of the campus and helps to keep the area's original feet, feel of natural beauty and magistrate protected from the densely populated city that Denver has become.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The campus should be designated a historic district, which would protect the character defining features such as the views and the buildings for future generations. Because we don't want Denver to become just any big city, and specifically, we don't want Loretta Heights to become just another dense housing development which may not be affordable.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I request that you do not pass a small area plan until we have assurances about historic districts, including views, affordable housing, open space, gentrification and suitable information on how the increased traffic will be handled. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next up, James Hawksworth.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Good evening. My name is James Hawksworth and I'm a local pastor and member of our community who has a deep interest in the future of Loreto Heights. I had the privilege of leading a special Christmas service in the historic chapel in December of 2018, in partnership with Councilman Flynn, who I commend his singing to anyone as well'",
        "'speaker_4': '. All right, Father Joseph Dang, chaplain for the.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'DPD, as well as a member of the Vietnamese community and a great leader there. And at that event, we saw approximately 300 members of the community come out in force to celebrate Christmas in such a beautiful and sacred space.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The evening for told the potential of the renewal of the campus for the sake of the entire community. And I would argue again, it was a beautiful evening. Well, Representative, the community, after looking over the small area plan myself, I believe the plan.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Will accomplish the dreams of the city and the community as a whole. I believe this plan will help create a deeper identity for.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Southwest Denver and will seek to be a community that engages people from all walks of life. I believe the history of the campus will be honored by repurposing it with integrity for such a beautiful space. As we've even heard tonight from even the historic Denver gentlemen.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Contrary to what some.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'May say this evening, the process was transparent, well-received and broadly open to the.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Diversity of the area. I believe the process is truly.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Created a consensus that allows the process to move forward in good faith. Few individuals may have attempted to create a bit of disruption to an overall what I would argue, beautiful process. And I commend the city.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'For managing disruptions with integrity and.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Utmost professionalism. In conversations that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I have had with West Side, other members of the community and members.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Of the steering committee.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I have been encouraged by how sensitive, particularly the developer, has been when it comes to maintaining the integrity of the area by giving it new life for long term use and enjoyment. I personally attended many of the steering committee meetings and I found the process thorough and well-executed.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I would like to encourage council to approve the plan as submitted.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And that planning board that has brought forth this in such great effort, and that I would recommend once again that you approve this. The process, again, I would say, has been filled with integrity and hard work, and I hope no further delays would hinder the progress that has been made.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next up, Jim Gibson. And I'm going to call the next five to come up with the front row. Paul Fea, you know, Carl Christianson, Bonnie DeHart, Jim Hartman and Kathleen Kind. Wait. Good. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Good evening. My name is Jim Gibson, and I live in Harvey Park. I lead the Laredo Heights Community Initiative, a project of the Harvey Park Community Organization. Our group has been working on this project since late 2016, when Tokyo University sadly announced it was closing and putting the property up for sale.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I had the honor to serve on the Loretta Hyde small area plan steering committee. I'd like to thank Councilman Flynn for the opportunity to serve our community. Unfortunately, this area plan is filled with specifics of what the developer wanted to be included, but has very little details about what the community needed to be included.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The response from the developer to many of the community community's questions was always the same. It's too early to address those issues. Then one week, exactly one week after our last area plan steering committee meeting on July 23rd, a service plan to create a metropolitan district for the property was presented by the developer to the City Council's'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Finance and Governance Committee. The document clearly worked on during the area plan process provides many of the answers to the questions the community had been asking. Unfortunately, those answers were never provided and the community never had an opportunity to more meaningfully weigh in on the issues.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'As a result, the area plan, while well-meaning, is simply too broad and does not provide a roadmap to meeting the goals that I think we all share. When the site planning process occurs, these provisions will need to be significantly strengthen the plan and provide what we need.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Placing a historic district designation on the property before any redevelopment takes place will go a long way toward preserving the unique, historic and esthetic character defining features of the property. The site needs stronger and more specific protections to preserve the iconic views to and from the campus.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The site also needs more open space and more details on the size and location of these open spaces. Finally, traffic should be more thoroughly addressed because the project at Resident and Daily Visitor information provided by the developer right after the small area process was completed is now available.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I hope you understand our strong feelings about this beautiful site and why we're asking for these additional specifics. This place has been a big part of our community for decades and it is near and dear to our hearts.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Please help us save this important south west Denver treasure. Thank you very much for your time this evening.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next to Paul for your you know.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening, counsel. You know, it's interesting. I'm here with Eli Hartman. We met at Ridge Counsel about two years ago, maybe three years ago, trying to get a performing arts center in the Fruitvale School out in Rio Ridge, which would have been a fantastic facility for education in its proper.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If you've never been out on 44th out there, 44th and Oakridge area. Go out there and check that out. But the building is now homes. I don't know how affordable they are, but the idea of the fact that another public facility is now housing never again to serve the children or adults or anybody for that matter.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You know, we're going back to October 12th, 2017, when the Florida Heights Redevelopment Community recommendations came out and that the number one was develop a comprehensive cultural, historical, topographical, environmental esthetic assessment report. And that's all that's it. There's nothing about housing or anything of that nature.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And on the second point, plans and designs need to ensure ensure the continued usefulness and integrity of the cemetery or a place of reflection and contemplation. Now, in order to ensure anything, you need a deed. Now we have offered the developer a quick claim deed and that still stands.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'As far as a quitclaim deed, the city and county of Denver could put it together. And I have five quitclaim deeds here for five parcels. If nothing else, number one should be for the cemetery. And I'm asking for you to tonight to put this off until the cemetery is insured.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And is safe for not the dead nuns, but the living through Jesus Christ nuns. Okay. We're not dealing with a situation that of course, I'm about the arts and I've given you a proposal. All the new council people have a proposal from 2017.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Check it out. We are number one in arts and humanities in the nation coming from zero.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm sorry about your time is wiped out. Next up, Karl Christiansen.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Evening Council. I'm Carl Christianson. My wife and I are both Denver area natives. My wife grew up in the Bear Valley area. I grew up in the Green Mountain area. We purchased a home in Harvey Park, just west of the Laurel Heights area 26 years ago.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And we love our neighborhood. We love the Laurel Heights campus. We've enjoyed being neighbors with that for so many years. And when we saw that particular our heights was failing, we kind of dreaded what might happen. And so we were really excited to see the development plan come forward.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We were really pleased with the community engagement and we felt like we had a lot of opportunity to give input into the plan and what that area would become. We feel like they were very respectful of looking at the things we valued in terms of historic preservation, open space and also thinking in terms of economic development.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I don't know how.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Many of you think.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That we can preserve the beautiful buildings on campus without some kind of revenue stream? You know, they're not going to fix themselves. And so I think it is a very sustainable plan in our view. And we're really looking forward to all the potential that's going to be on that site for a community gathering place, for cultural development'",
        "'speaker_8': ', for different kinds of housing. And so my wife and I are just very excited to see what the next 26 years will bring for us in that neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you. Next up, Bonnie DeHart.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. My name is Bonnie DeHart. I lived in Harvey Park, just north of Yale Avenue since 1989. And I'm hoping to age in place there if I can. And although I share some of the concerns of the Harvey Park Community Organization concerning future impacts on the area, including traffic congestion, possible gentrification, higher taxes, possibly small businesses'",
        "'speaker_1': 'currently in the area being unable to compete once the new development occurs. I also believe that West Side Investment Partners have made an extensive effort to include the community in in the planning effort. And I.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Believe the plans will in all.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Likelihood move forward at this point. So I'm here today primarily to add my voice to the historic preservation plans for the area. And I want to preface those comments by saying I'm neither a sister of Loreto, Nora co member, I'm not a graduate of Loretto Heights, not even Catholic.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But but I say all that to stress that there's a broader support for the historic preservation pieces of this plan beyond those who have a long term and specific.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Engagement.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'With Ladera Heights. The sisters in Loretto have contributed to Colorado and to this community for over 100 years and continue to be a force for justice and peace in this very divisive world we're now living in and to advocate for the most vulnerable members of our society.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I stand with them and I want to see their legacy continue. One small way we can do that is to ensure the preservation of some of the icons of the Loreto Heights campus. I'd like to specifically see not just a verbal assurance, but a firm written commitment in place for the care and maintenance of this cemetery at'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Loreto Heights into perpetuity. You're into perpetuity, not for five or ten years, but forever. I'd like that commitment to be made in writing before plans move forward. I'd also like to see stronger language and about the preservation of the administrative building.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And whatever is the strongest assurance that we can get. I, I support the historic district designation and again, would like to see that happen sooner, not later. Regarding Pan pre-show hall. I'd like to see a commitment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm sorry, but your time is up. Thank you very much. Next up, Jim Hartman.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Good evening, counsel. My name is Jim Hartman. My partners and I are the Pan Croatia Hall redevelopment team. We've been passionate about historic preservation and affordable housing for almost the past 40 years, working on several projects throughout metro Denver.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We were invited first to get involved in a lot of heights a couple of years ago by Councilwoman Sally Daigle from the city of Sheridan. We were fortunate to attend a community meeting that Jim Gibson had put together, and Jim's led many good community meetings.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And we observed the change in some of the tenor and some of those meetings. In general, we believe that this has been a very inclusive public process. We've observed it over the past year, and we think it's really representative of what the city should do on all of the types of plans that were before you tonight.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We urge you to accept the plan as recommended tonight, and we think it's been as good, if not better, than many other planning efforts around Denver. The library community is one that we've been involved with and we think it's a really great example of historic preservation and community reuse.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So we're excited to be involved. We urge your action tonight to approve the plan. And thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next up, Kathleen Conway. And I call the next five to come up to this frontbench where you will have Susan Leigh, Christine O'Connor, Adriana Pena, Larry Ambrose and Thomas Sanders. If you could come up to the frontbench.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I hope I don't sound like a broken record, but my concern is for the cemetery on the property that contains the graves of about 62 sisters of Loreto, some of which died over a hundred years ago. These women took the arduous journey, journey from Kentucky to serve the people of Colorado and New Mexico.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They experienced all the discomfort and fears that occurred along the way. They and other women religious really helped settle the West. The Sisters of Loretto found schools all over the area from Trinidad, Colorado to Denver, and every place in between.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'My sister in law, a German immigrant, graduated from Lauretta Heights. The sisters of Loretto taught her in Illinois and she won a scholarship and pursued her education here. My husband and children went to Saint Philomena School and I went to Holy Family Great and high schools, all run by the Sisters of Loreto.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We owe it to these women to preserve their final resting place, and I think we need a historic designation for the cemetery and perpetual care. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next up, Susan Lee.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening, council members. My name is Susan Elliott, Boulder, Colorado. I'll keep my comments really brief, but as a member of the development team working on the redevelopment of Pancreas Hall into affordable housing, I've witnessed the inclusive process used to develop the small area plan.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I fully support the adoption of the plan as I believe it is.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'An appropriate.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sustainable and long term vision for the future of Loreto Heights campus. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next up is Christine O'Connor.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'My name is Christine O'Connor into foyer and I co-chair the RNC Zoning and Planning Committee. And I'm going to let Ian talk about our resolution in a minute. We thought he could go first, but that didn't happen. I'm here tonight both as an ANC rep and as an individual.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We're not here to oppose the plan, but to make it better, to strengthen it. And I don't think that's obstructionist. I'm aware that there's extensive discussion in the plan because I've read the whole thing about historic preservation. I'm aware of the recommendations.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I just heard something about one of the tools, protective easements being put on, but I don't have enough information yet to know how that's going to play out at the site development and large development review phase. But the takeaway is that preservation will be addressed some time in the future as development unfolds.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I'm here to tell you that that sounds great. But to ensure the desire of the community to preserve the historic site as re-use unfolds, we believe it will be more prescriptive to ask for historic district designation at the front end.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This historic district designation does everything that the other tools might do at some time in the future might. Depending on how the developer and historic Denver choose to work together, this campus may well be the most historic site in Denver today, and it makes sense to use the most comprehensive tool.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I am going to describe Jim Hartman and Marcus Packer and maybe Brad Buchanan if he's listening. Well, know this example in Lowry where historic district designation saved hangar two in 2007. The owner and Brad Buchanan is the architect and Marcus partner as the promoter.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'He's also helping these developers came forward to demolish Hangar two. They said, oh, we have to demolish hangar two in order to save another historic structure. What happened? They both structures. Both were in districts that had been designated in 1995 before development started.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'As a result, it had to go to Landmark. It was defeated 8 to 0. At Landmark, we still have one or two and a beautiful dining district. I am asking that you think about the importance of putting this upfront.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This step of district designation is not specifically called for in the plan, and it is our position that the plan should include the more specific recommendation that it be. Come to that designation be recommended under large development plan review and section 12.4 12 point 12.6 EA to be implemented prior to rezoning.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next up, Adriana Pena.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening. My name is had an opinion and I met. I am a member public school member of the Loreto Heights Steering Committee. Also, I'm here on behalf of the board, the director of DPS for District two, Angela Corbin, who is not join us today due to a school district board meeting at this time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'For the context, the public schools on the land where the assisted college view middle school and high school are currently located on the already to heights. We are thankful for the consideration that our community partners gave to the success of our students and their families as we work together on this project.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This work includes multiple community meetings, surveys and other information, such as draft of these plan blueprints and guidance in progress. All were provided in English and Spanish to our community. We were particularly excited by the all Spanish language community meeting that we hosted on Saturday, March 16.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We provided support with the community outreach through multiple outlets such as announcement during the community calendar in Univision, in Telemundo, Hispanic television networks Dipset Educate Radio and television in the Rodolfo Cardenas radio station. We distributed players in libraries, libraries, community centers and rec centers and community organizations as well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'As well as emails to DPS parents and community members. Support from our school was particularly crucial during this process by them not only providing fliers in this student folders in their network, but also provided more information at any time they needed.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We are so grateful to have been able to help convene and support our community, had several opportunities to provide our input on the plan in the planning process at different levels of our community. We engaged our DPS parents, students and overall Southwest community to make sure all their voices were heard.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The process has been inclusive, clear and well-organized. The school district listen to and consider all comments, feedback and concerns. And they were included in the draft plan. Our top priority is our students. For this reason, the mobility proposal was crucial for this project.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The study for a new street connection extending south from the SD campus towards the Floyd Avenue. With this proposal, we minimize the exposure of our children and families to heavy volume of traffic on the school route. This is important for the safety and security of our students.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We want to create a safe and inclusive environment for all Denver students, current and future generations. Denver Public Schools is committed to meeting the educational needs of every student, and we look forward to working together to provide support resources to our students and ensuring that this neighborhood reflects our time as a community.'",

I'm here tonight as an alternate representative to Tony Hernandez to the Loretta Hyde Steering Committee from the Loretta Heights Community Initiative.

Loretta Hyde site is the gateway to Denver from the Southwest, the iconic hilltop site with its rich history, magnificent buildings, landscaping and panoramic views.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It's not only the most distinctive, landmark and source of pride for Southwest Denver and all of its residents, but perhaps is currently the most significant and vulnerable historic site in all of Denver. It should be a source of pride for the entire city and the region for centuries to come.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'As a representative of LHC I on the city's steering committee, Tony Hernandez and I have been relentless in advocating for historic district designation for parts of the site as the most comprehensive manner in order to protect and preserve those features which the community holds dear to its hearts.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'There is not much to criticize in the plan. It is what is not in the plan. That's a problem. Saving buildings and surrounding them with large scale development is not what people expect, but it is what they could get.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Southwest Denver is now beginning its journey into large scale, potentially displacing and gentrifying development. Planning process for the site will serve as a precedent for future development in the southwest quadrant. It should be done correctly, consistent with recommendations given to the steering committee and a city funded study.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We are here tonight to continue to advocate that historic district designation, be recommended not just mentioned as the correct process to ensure preservation of the key features of the Loreto Heights campus. The area plan mentions several preservation tools.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'However, it does not specify when any of these tools could be implemented. Therein is the obvious floor. To preserve something, you have to do. Do it before it's changed. It would be impossible to preserve the important parts of the campus once they have already been redeveloped.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Please amend this at the either at these or the large development review stage or in the site planning process that reject that recommendation. And those requests are reasonable and time timely. History will look kindly upon us.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you. Next up is Thomas Sanders and then McCaul. The next five up to come, please. Up to the front bench. Mary Nell Gage, Brant Kirkpatrick, Andrew Chapman, Dmitri Fortney. I'm sorry about that. And Norma Browne, if you could come up to the front.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'for the citizens of southwest Denver, as well as the metropolitan area. I want to focus my comments on the plans and the developer. First of all, the plans publicize a significant story of Denver's history and landmark buildings. The plans provide attractions and event places for the entire city, as well as outlets for artistic and cultural expressions.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Also, residential diversity is created and retail and commercial opportunities are accommodated. The plans include open space, mature landscaping and recreational areas. Finally, a unified community center and identity for Southwest Denver is established. I feel the area plans are a win win for all.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Time at Sea of Loreto Heights.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Next up, Brant Kirkpatrick.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Good evening, City Council.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'My name is Brant Kirkpatrick.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm a long time resident of Inglewood, Colorado.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And have lived and worked adjacent to Loreto Heights property, which is in the process of being repurposed. I am speaking today in support of Denver's process, described as the small area plan for Loreto Heights from the.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Beginning of West Side.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Partners, ownership of Loreto Heights property in July of 2018.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'They and the community.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'In and around the former Loreto Heights campus have worked and collaborated with the City of Denver to achieve the most reasonable and revisioning.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Of.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This important property. I have attended and participated in several of the community meetings which have been held as part of the small area plan. I found them to be inclusive and sensitive to the desires of the community residents and also dedicated to the visionary repurposing of the iconic structures and natural beauty of this area.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I believe the collective efforts will add value to the community of Southwest Denver and its surrounding neighbors. And again, I support the collaborative process between the city government, community members and property development partners who have worked so hard to provide a new and bright future for Loreto Heights.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next up, Andrew Chapman.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Good evening, counsel. Thank you for this chance to give support to the small area plan. I've been to all the public meetings, including a few before the small area process began, thanks to Councilman Flynn. And so I want to thank Jason and his team for putting that on and opening the doors.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'They're very interactive. I was able to ask questions as well as see them interact with other neighbors and residents. My wife and I and four children bought a house on Grove Street near Amherst in the small area plan seven years ago.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Sadly, we cannot buy that house today because it's doubled in value. So, you know, gentrification and home prices are already an issue. And I don't think it has anything to do with the proposed redevelopment of the right of heights.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It's another issue that I think requires other solutions, but one is we need more housing. And so that's one reason why I support this plan, is it encourages more housing of all kinds and hopefully a variety of types as well as income levels can be included in in the future redevelopment as well.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Having lived there for seven years. My wife and I will walk the neighborhood, take evening walks, and we walk around a park that's already existing. So this the idea of a lot of green space, I don't know, makes a lot of sense.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'There is a neighborhood park right next to the right of heights that my wife and I and our kids already enjoy. But we do want a walkable neighborhood, a place that we could walk to. We've talked about Pearl Street, Gaylord Street, other nice neighborhoods, Tennyson Street, that that have amenities that people could walk to small scale.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It doesn't need to be huge like dome or anything. Just something with a coffee shop, ice cream restaurant, things like that that my wife and I could take our kids. And also we go out for a date night.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So we're excited. We see the small area plan encourages that type of walkable neighborhood. My few interactions with the developer gives me confidence that he desires the same kind of walkable neighborhood, that it's a sense of place, a destination that the community proud of.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so for those reasons, I strongly support the smart plan.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Could you state your name for the record? What's that? Could you state your name for the record? Oh, sorry.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Andrew Chapman.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next up, Dmitri is Xavier Rodney. I hear earlier Norman Brown and are going to call in the next five up to the front bench Claire Harris, Grant Bennett, Richard REPP, John Joseph Nieman and Tara Durham. You could come up to the front.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you for allowing me to speak. I'm Norma Brown and I'm a graduate of Rada Hinds, class of 1959. Makes me a little awkward. And I'm also the representative of the Spirit of the Hero Association, which is the Alumni Association.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I am pleased to say a representative on the meetings that we have held. I live in the area. 2200 south her away. So that's not very far from the heights. I see it nearly every day. The stockholder committee had been meeting with the City Planning Department and working on the small area plan for the past year with'",
        "'speaker_1': 'much discussion. Pros and cons and a lot of input. I feel that the West Side has been very helpful in speaking what they needed and what they might do. Our work will bring this area of old, beautiful buildings, along with some new buildings alive.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And this is what we need in that area. This project has brought the community together. All of the area's developments have been represented at these meetings. I am in favor of the small area plan. I have this written.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have worked hard on it this past year. I am looking forward to seeing you. Vote yes on the plan as written so we can begin to see a beautiful, historic and thriving community in the southwest area. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next up, Claire Harris.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'My name is Clare Harris and I live four blocks from Mirada Heights and this is the third house I've had in this area in 50 years. So I've lived near Lorenzo Heights for 50 years. I graduated 1978 with a degree in nursing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I also hosted Japanese students Take You in the nineties. I used to take my kids swimming and to the theater for plays. So and I represent college view, which is the whole neighborhood across the street. As you can tell by our name, Loretta Height's management man matters to our whole neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm totally in favor of the plan. We've had a unanimous vote at the College View Neighborhood Association Board. Many of my remarks were covered by Martha Kirkpatrick. She did a great job and I've also seen the project. Jim Hartman is done in Northwest Denver, so I'm looking forward to pay increase your hall being developed.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I want to mention that the group that met together, I went to every meeting, every community meeting. I went to see every site visit for the for the group that we worked with that many, many people were represented at that group, including all the neighborhoods, all kinds of other interested parties.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We had many people behind us who gave input. What I noticed was the people that had negative remarks and things to say or questions about the plan. We were open to hearing all of them. One striking thing to me was that the developer was essentially just a member of the group.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I didn't hear him take over any meetings. The city employees ran the meetings fairly every month. When we got back together, they ran a summary of the previous meetings comments. So positive comments and negative comments were raised again and again.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I felt that we debated all those publicly. Some of the people you've heard speak tonight against the plan raised the same issues over and over. We discussed them, we debated them. We came to conclusions. No one seemed to be leading us.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They seemed to gather our input and put it all together. So my feeling is that the process was very open. I know people have spoken about how many people didn't attend that fliers were sent out in all in Spanish.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I will note that many people in my neighborhood of College View don't show up for these meetings. So I don't think it's about the outreach. I think it's about a lack of participation by citizens. So I am in favor of the plan as it stands and hope it is soon.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you. Next up, Grant Bennett.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Good evening, council members. Thank you for your time tonight and president of council. I note that, um, my name is Grant Bennett. I am a resident 40 at 30 East Alabama place in Denver and my councilman stepped out of the room.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But kudos to Councilman Cashman and he lives a block away. I was introduced to the Alert Heights Steering Committee as I'm part of the Pink Racial Hall Redevelopment team. We're pretty excited to be working on that project, bringing affordable housing and historic preservation to that project.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I can just tell you that it is complicated, very, very complicated. And so you've heard a lot about historic preservation tonight. And it's not straightforward. It's not simple. It takes two years and layers and layers and layers of bureaucracy to get a project done.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so I just want to start by saying that's what I'm working on. That's my connection to the steering, the small area plan process. So we were invited and sat through those steering committee meetings listening the whole time, and we were impressed by what we saw because of the conversation.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Welcome back, Councilman Cashman. I noted that we're neighbors and you're District six. I called you out or you're gone. Sorry. And so we were excited to see the process unfold. Brandon, earlier, the staff member mentioned about the historic resources and the inventory that was done and how really there was a robust discussion about the historic inventory done'",
        "'speaker_9': 'for the buildings on the campus. And obviously, I very much care about paint creation on that project coming together. But really the city had a great process in place and allowed for that robust discussion to occur. I have a background in real estate development and in sort of city planning.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I worked for six years in the last decade for the Denver Urban Renewal Authority and came to many council meetings to watch this process unfold. And I was impressed by how the city really got a plan in place before development activity is happening.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I know being a resident in Denver and seeing certain development projects unfold, I don't always like what I see. But the fact that a planning process is happening now, not six months from now, not a year from now, but well in advance of even the project I'm trying to promote means that we're doing something right.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So he's excited to see that play out in this stead. And to just really listen in to that process. So with that, I support the plan. I encourage you to all do the same. And I will add on that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Sister Mary No, I like it. It's wordy, but live, learn, play, pray, work, work. Oh, darn it. I forget the work part. Okay. Good job. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next up, Richard repped. Good evening, City Council.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I've been in Colorado for 33 years and I've lived in my.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'House in southwest Denver for over 20.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Raised four kids, son in Denver public schools. Ran a small business in southwest Denver.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They joined all the sports clubs, did all after school activities. And in that time, I met a ton of people from my neighborhood and surrounding neighborhoods. And I see those people at Belmar.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Southwest Plaza because that's where we have to go. We don't have anything like that. We don't have.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'A jewel in southwest Denver.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If Loretto Heights gets redeveloped, as is, that might give us something to come visit. It's in our own neck of the woods and people are willing to travel from our neighborhood to these destinations. I think about the people outside that will travel to our destination if it gets developed properly.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Let's give ourselves something to be.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Proud of in southwest Denver. It's a beautiful place and I love it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Could you state your name for the record? Yeah. Rich rep. Thank you. Thank you. Next up, John Joseph Newman.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening, counsel. My name is John Joseph Neiman.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I was born and raised in the north side of Denver, and I'm a current resident.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Of the Harvey Park neighborhood. I want to start off by thinking of you guys for your service as council people and for your dedication to our wonderful city. I'll switch it up a little bit. I'll do a little allegory.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There was an old elderly man who was walking down by the ocean after a big storm and the beach was covered in starfish. And he saw a little boy who was by the ocean grabbing starfish one at a time and throwing them back into the ocean.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And he wandered over and he told the young man, What are you doing? There's thousands of starfish in the on this beach. There's no way you can save every one of them. And the young man picked up the starfish and he said, Yeah, I may not be able to save them all, but I can save this one'",
        "'speaker_4': '. He threw it back in the water. I've been participating in a small area plan and I speak to Matt for myself for over two and a half years. Our initial idea of what we wanted to see happen with Florida Heights was one of the good result.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We wanted a historic appreciation for the history of Florida Heights. We wanted to maintain open space and that campus feel that Loreto Heights has. And we wanted a vibrant and diverse community because that's what we already have in Southwest Denver, and we wanted to help maintain the really high quality standard and way of life that we have'",
        "'speaker_4': 'in southwest Denver. This small area plan is the community driven vision that matches those desires. It was led by Councilman Flynn, who I think led with an exemplary effort. And I want to give him thanks for that. I'm former president of the Inter Neighborhood Cooperation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And in that time as president, I heard a lot about the problems that came from the West Coast Facts Area plan. And I heard about the disagreements and contentions that came from the Gates area plan. And I can tell you after this year long process that I think this letter had similar to plan, is the best summary'",
        "'speaker_4': 'of plan the city has ever created. And so I'm very happy with the results. I think it does have the community voice and it actually did include the developer, which I was concerned with in the beginning, because in the north side developer's kind of a dirty word.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I think the problems that we have with gentrification as a city, the problems we have with growth problems we have affordability are not problems in this plan. This plan actually helps to address those issues. It tries to give the community voice upfront and tries to give us a chance to show the developer what we care about'",
        "'speaker_4': '. And this plan does that. It'll help avoid gentrification. I heard something about 7 to 8% for affordable housing. I think that's a guaranteed low. That's that's the part we've heard definite. And I know from hearing others that we're going to see a lot more.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This is a very important plan and I'm really.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Glad to be a part of it. So thank you all very much for your time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next up, Taro Durham and I'm going to call it the next five. Glenn Durham, Renee Moffat, Mark Upshaw, Brad Will Wilkin and Sherman Sekou. Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Counsel. My name is Tara Durham. I live in Chatham Park, which is adjacent to the Loretto Heights campus. I am a secretary for our R.A. It's Sharon Park, South Marley in Brentwood. Arno. I also was a steering committee member on the Loreto Heights small area plan.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think it was a very community driven process and I was very thankful to be a part of it. And I would like to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank Councilman Kevin Flynn as.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'He was tremendous.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In getting all of our community.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Involved and to be a part of this multi-year plan. And I do support the plan in full favor.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I ask you all to as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next up, Glenn Durham.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you for hearing this out side by side. My wife and I are passionate about history, architecture, and we care deeply about our neighborhood. Kevin helped us organize our registered neighborhood organization.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'South Marly, Brentwood. Sure.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Sharon Park. We also participated in other meetings and organizations as well as HCI, and that that was helpful when Catullus was interested in purchasing this property. A little history lesson. They would have brought everything this this community fears.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I used to call them, can't tell us.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Because they couldn't.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Give us a straight answer on anything.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think West Side has been generous, understanding, flexible in hearing us out. We we literally live five houses from the cemetery. We back up to the open space.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm a little nervous right now because this is a big deal. I fully support this plan. I believe it encompasses everything that we've worked for for these last three and a half years. Thank you for hearing me out.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next up, Renee Moffitt.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Good evening, handsome. My name is Renee Moffett. I'm a songwriter and art director and homeowner in Harvey Park, which borders Loreto Heights. I approve of this plan and I'd like to share three reasons and a.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Prepared statement why I.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Highly encourage you to approve the Loreto Heights plan as well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This process has been sound. I've attended numerous meetings over the past year and have found the entire process to be inclusive, engaging and transparent. Community voices have been heard.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Hopes, wishes and concerns have been expressed, and the majority sentiment has been well captured by this plan. Where side partners have been present throughout this entire process.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And have shown themselves to be ready and willing to personally connect with our community. Councilman Flynn and his office have gone above and beyond in creating a new.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Model for public and private collaboration. I've met more neighbors, community leaders and city officials because of this very process. We are all working towards the same outcome and this process.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Exemplifies that work. That outcome we all desire is my second point. We need a true gathering place for our neighborhood. Denver is growing and that includes.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Its communities to the Southwest. To keep up with that growth, we need better infrastructure. That means roads, sidewalks, bike.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Paths and housing. But to grow a true sense of community, you need a gathering place to relax and convene and increase the day to day interactions with our neighbors of all ages. When the recommendations and guidelines in the area plan are followed, I believe it will create this gathering place that we can all call our home and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'share with the city. Lastly, the redevelopment of the right of heights will create a regional anchor. Once established, I believe residents will begin to notice concentric.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Circles of progress and rehabilitation and revitalization throughout the surrounding areas. I've witnessed this this this effect firsthand in other cities.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That I've lived in. Approving the Loretta Heights area plan won't improve the livelihoods.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Of just me and.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'My neighbors, but has the potential to increase the quality of life for the entire region of southwest Denver for generations to come. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'Mr. President, members of council. My name is Mark Upshaw. I live at 3492 West College Avenue. I support the plan. I live in the Dartmouth Heights neighborhood, a homeowners association of 72 homes. I've lived there for 17 years prior.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I lived in the College View neighborhood for over 20 years and was active in its leadership. I am very familiar with Lauretta Heights campus and the surrounding communities. I remember fondly my experiences on campus of attending theater productions, workshops and especially running around the Campus Loop Road.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I have communicated frequently with the stakeholder members who are part of the planning process. It's a good vision plan. It is founded on much good work. City staff, led by Jason Morrison, has done a highly professional job of distilling and assembling all that was gathered and presented.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The community outreach was beyond anything that I have seen. The community, the developer, Loretto alumni and other related individuals.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And community groups were engaged and.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Represented on the stakeholder team, stakeholder group throughout the process. Here's here's what stands out for me. I always felt heard. This was especially true of the developer and owner Mark Markovich of West Side Investment Partners. He answered every email and phone call and was remarkably timely and thoughtful in his response.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'He attended community meetings that he was not required to attend or did not need to attend, and some of them were not friendly. He was present. He listened and he gave input where he could. I acknowledge and thank Councilman Kevin Flynn for the forethought of convincing the city administration that we need this area plan now.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We need it now. I simply don't know what we would do without a big vision and long term guidance that that it will provide for the phased development and related zone change request that will come forward over the next two years.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'One last important thing that stands out to me as I know what the citizens and organized groups, neighborhood groups of Southwest Denver love and care about our corner of the city. We know its history and value, its history, its beauty, its vital neighborhoods, the inspiring open space, the parks, the greenways and natural areas.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We know what schools and thriving commercial areas. However, Loretta Heiss campus, with its storied history and sacred purpose, is more than an icon for Southwest Denver. Rather, it is a high among the great cultural gems of all Denver.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'This plan gives Denver an opportunity to enable the greater heights to be an important part of Denver moving forward. I ask that you support and adopt this plan. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'I feel really, really.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Privileged to be a peer assessor, especially after Sister Mary now just really eloquently described the site. So I feel privileged to be able to work on this site. We're working on a portion with West Side. I also feel privileged because I've worked on a couple of other developments before, and this one is the most community for community'",
        "'speaker_9': 'centric process I've ever been involved with. Specific specifically.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'One example is in January, there's a community meeting.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'In March of Hall and I thought it was so cool and maybe I thought was cool because my wife's a teacher just down the street.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And they handed out grade cards.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And everybody got a grade card and they could grade how well CPD and Councilman Flynn and the developer was doing and everybody got to grade that and they didn't just put it into a folder then they, they published it on online.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I just want to say thanks so much for CPD. Kudos to you guys for a really transparent process. So we are so much in support of this plan.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next up, Chairman CQ and I'll call the next five to come up with the front bench. Tony Hernandez, Gene Myers, father Joseph Deng National and Donna Rapp.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening, ladies. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Colleagues and. Folks coming.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Here for this very.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Important legislation. I was born and raised in Colorado and attended schools here, including college. Do you. And one of the signs that we had a deal was that if you are looking for a rich, sexy girlfriend, you'll find her at the U.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And if you're looking for a wife, you'll find her at Loreto Heights. And that's kind of how this thing is work in the United States, this legislation. So you guys are sort of do you want to get a girlfriend or do you want a wife, though?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Because once permanent was temporary. All right. And so what we have here really is the first step toward a happy union. One of the things that's a tragedy is that these zoning hearings pit neighborhoods and neighbors against each other so that developers can slide in on the down low like they did with this one.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And all of a sudden, hey, there are things.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We can't address now, but we're addressing them now.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Anyway because everybody's like, and we're getting this. Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah. It's sly. It's like it's wicked. And yet. Councilman Flynn. It's kind of like the cop on this. Is this is this Jack? He let this one get messed up.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'He's fired.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Chairman, please, please refer to the council as a whole, not individual members.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. So what we have here really is an example. I need your community to pay attention. What happened to my community on this side? They ethnically cleansed us. There are now very little or no black people on each side.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'None. And then when you look out there, I mean, black people usually are dead. Look how many? Zero. None. Where there was outreach. Did you go look for. Hmm. And then we went to the Christmas program out there looking out for my friend, who I.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Didn't know he could play an.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Instrument.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm sorry, but your time is up. Thank you very much. But guess what? Next up, Tony Hernandez gets you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The going gets you because they line up there and they go to tell. Care to discuss?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Hi there. My name is Tony Hernandez, and I would like to thank Kevin Kim, my city councilman, for your leadership in bringing the area plan to our side of town. We've needed an area plan for a very long time, a neighborhood plan.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So thank you very much. I also want to thank the city staff for their outstanding facilitation of these meetings. These are hard to do. I've done there was in my past that was appointed by Kevin Flynn because of my expertize in affordable housing and community development across the country and in Colorado.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I'm very excited about the redevelopment. I support the redevelopment. Unlike at Colorado Heights, what we're trying to do is make sure, as the system talked about the preservation and protection of the buildings, the views, those are the things we're looking for.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The vision plan that we have in the area plan really provides a vision which is about 100,000 feet. That's what visions are supposed to do. And that's why we're looking for the next phase, which we call the Large Development Review Committee, which will help us pin down what we need is certainty in protection and preservation of the'",
        "'speaker_6': 'buildings, open space and view plans. That's what's not been done yet. And so what we're asking for is continuing a process that really protects.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The last iconic building and campus in Denver. But to do that, we're.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Encouraging the city council to ask those tough questions. When do we preserve those.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Buildings and views?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, we have to do it before they start the construction, because once they start the construction, things have changed and the protection is less. So when you have a horse in the barn, you close the door so the horse doesn't leave.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You don't open and let the horse go and say, We'll get a new door pretty soon. So I'm encouraging the large development review committee to really certify and give us some certainty in the preservation of the views and the protection through a historic district designation that is so important.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Last thing I'd like to share with you is the importance of looking at the metro districts. It's a great tool for financing. As a financier, I've brought over $21 billion in the state of Colorado and have used the metro districts to do that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There is concern with Metro District. That means the Metro District becomes the local government. They have the board, they do the votes without input from the citizens because they're out there votes on the board. So I encourage you look at it because if you do not do a designation at the large review committee, developer can do whatever'",
        "'speaker_6': 'he wants. And I believe Mark will do good things. But I've been with lawyers and developer for if you don't put it in writing, it's not certain. So encourage more certain powers. So thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next up, Gene Myers.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening. I'm Jean Meyers. 1875 Lawrence Street in Denver.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm the CEO of Thrive Homebuilders.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And as a local builder, we are very grateful to have.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Been selected as one of the builders of Loreto Heights. So thank you to West Side and to Mark and to Andy. I was going to talk about my first day as a freshman at DU in 1969, but the chairman still stole my thunder.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think I was told on the first.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Day that Loretto Heights is where the pretty girls were. I would just like to compliment the collaborative.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Process that has been undertaken. You've heard heard that from numerous people. I think a kudos needs to go to the city staff for genuinely investing in this inclusive and genuine process. I have to admire Councilman Flynn. I've never.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Experienced anybody quite as engaged.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'As he is in this issue, and.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I spent a couple of hours in his presence and very impressed with his command of the issues. Thank you for listening. And we we very much support the project.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next up, Father Joseph De.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Boy, you guys are holy today because we have priest, we have minister, we have rabbi, we have sisters. Hallelujah. My name is Father Joseph. Dang, I. I'm on behalf of the Vietnamese-American community of Colorado. I'm honored to participate in the Loreto High Steering Committee and the creations of the area plan for the Loretto Heights campus.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I have attended monthly at the steering committee meetings, public input, open houses and worked closely with Jason Morrison, Councilman Flynn, sister of Laredo's sister Mariano, and mostly with Mark. And yes, I have a problem to spell that is pronounce your name to icon.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'W I am super impressed with the astonished students with it. Very impressed of the level of input and collaborations with the community planning and development process. The Vietnamese-American community of Colorado is fully supporting the area plan for lower out of height.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We are looking forward to seeing Loreto Heights development to kick in as soon as possible. The building has been vacant too long and vandalism has been a nightmare there. We believe the future of this great area will be a hub for the Southwest community where it can serve a multicultural center.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I will continue to do my best to work with the city councils of Denver Councilman Flynn, West Side Investment Partners in any way I can to support this implementations of their Laredo height area plans. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next up, national.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Name's National and I live here in Denver. I currently work for.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Harris Cooker Smith, that's a consultant.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'For West Side Development and I fully support this development.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you. All right, Don, a rep and I'll call the last four up Daniel Craig into for you Nora Jack was and Marc were quick go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hi, I'm Donna Noble Rep 4850 West Colorado Avenue two and nine. I'm president of my neighborhood organization and an alternate to Terry Tara Durham on the Loreto Heights Steering Committee. When they bought Loreto Heights, West Side Investments could have started building right away without even seeking a rezoning.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But they made it abundantly clear from the beginning that they wanted to understand the pulse of the community. So the steering committee was formed a huge win for the Southwest committed community. The committee didn't always agree, but the steering committee members, most of them were respectful and collaborative.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We also had some bumps in the road by agitators who tried to knock us off our focus by creating confusion and doubt. But in the end, we had this wonderful, guiding, visionary document without any amendments that I am very proud to have played a role, and I hope you adopt it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The process was transparent and communication flowed freely to and from city planner Jason Morrison and staff. We met monthly and throughout the process there were far for large community meetings for people to share their hopes, ideas and concerns.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Some of my favorite things about the plan are the developers asking for a down zoning. I've heard it said The higher the penthouse, the higher the price. Which is exactly why I'm excited that down zoning puts a cap at eight storeys rather than the 15 story of this, the current zoning allows for the first time ever, Loreto'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Heights will be open to all people to enjoy all that it has to offer. The development will be an inclusive community and will be welcoming of all ages, ethnicities, abilities and backgrounds. It will offer a variety of price points for housing, including affordable and attainable housing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Not to mention opportunity for jobs. This is what our neighborhood needs, and it's what we asked for. We have a developer that heard our desires as a community, and now it's time for you to approve this plan. So the legacy of Loreto Heights can continue.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's such a shame that as time goes by, more windows and those wonderful buildings are shattered by rocks or bullets. Graffiti is sprayed on the buildings. A dumpster is set on fire. That's happened. A vacant Loreto Heights 72 acres is not good for our community.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We need to begin breathing life and love back into that wonderful space that the Sisters of Loreto first loved. Thank you for your consideration and thank you so much for all you do for Denver.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next up, Daniel Craig.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'If you need counsel.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you for your time. My name is Dan Craig. I'm a resident of the city of Denver.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I followed the law out of Hyde small area planning process closely over this past year. And as a resident, I'd.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Like to voice my support for the smaller rate plan. I'd also like to note.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'And in this capacity we were tasked by West Side with attending.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Each and every.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Steering committee meeting and public meeting to ensure that we would have heard.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Firsthand the community's goals and aspirations for Loreto Heights. I personally attended each one of those sessions, as did.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Many other folks from the consulting team. And as an architect, I would like to say to all the folks involved in the Loreto Heights similar plan process.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you for offering this.'",

        "'speaker_10': 'Hello. My name is Ian Thomas Tafoya, and I'm the duly elected co-chair of the Zoning and Planning Committee for the Denver Area Neighborhood Cooperation. Denver I c is an association of nearly 100 organizations in Denver. I'm also a trustee of historic Denver, and I want to be clear that I'm not speaking on their behalf tonight.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'In fact, you heard comments from John earlier. I also live in District two. I see in particular, our ZAP committee has been watching the redevelopment of Loretta Heights close for many years before this concurrent developer and before this small area plan.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We regularly discussed updates, shared promotional materials from community planning and development and directed our members to attend meetings. I myself attended the last meeting and had the opportunity to engage with city workers and even held a design forum on the site.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And we'd like to once again thank Mark and his company for opening the doors for this forum. And we'd like to thank the city employees for their hard work at our monthly meeting. This last August, we hosted an open dialog for the Loretta Plan, during which a resolution was brought forward asking for a historic designation district.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Our committee members believe historic designation is the best way to ensure protection. And apparently so. Too many of the people that came here tonight, we forward this to council for the official record. And I do want to note that the 90 we made it in the resolution, we made it clear that we agree that this plan should'",
        "'speaker_10': 'this area should be redeveloped with a focus on attainable housing. Our members are requesting strong commitment to historic districting, and amendments to improve plans are something that we shouldn't discuss. A recent example is Councilman Cashman's. Climate Change Amendments The Comprehensive Plan.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I want to be clear Hastert's historic designation shows the importance of the campus to the city as a whole. To designate or not is not a courtesy zoning issue. Typically, we would move this forward to a vote of the entire ANC member delegation, but due to a shortened window we were unable to bring it to the entire'",
        "'speaker_10': 'body for discussion. And so our Executive Board had us testify on behalf of the committee of which my co-chair, Christine O'Connor, added additional comments. If there are additional questions regarding our process, we're both willing to come back and answer them.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I do want to repeat what Christine's point was, that upfront historic designation was the thing that required more scrutiny for all the buildings within the district, even if they were not individually landmarked. And without this process, hanger two would have not been preserved.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I am pleased to hear that two of the buildings were committed to easements only mere hours ago, and I believe at least three are committed to. There is still work to be done to ensure that other assets are protected and approved tonight.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It is our hope that our members will this is our hope of our members that this will be addressed in the planning stage, but know that the stronger the plan is, the more certain the community can be. At Preservation Agency is committed to hosting a community conversation with city officials Westside and historic Denver about how best to'",
        "'speaker_10': 'ensure this amazing asset is here for my grandchildren to enjoy. Now I want to add, I had heard from local community members that only a handful of folks attended the Spanish meeting despite a concerted effort. There are many Latinos in this community.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Look at this room now. There are more consultants than there are people of color. Where is the Spanish media? I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But your time.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Is up. The outreach for this vote. And is this something that came before your time as a neighborhood planned?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Next up, Nora Jacqui's.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm not orcas. And I did my undergraduate work at Laurel Heights. I was a resident of Creature Hall during my stay at Laredo. And I want to say that I am very impressed with the plans for Creature Hall, where all 68 units will be designated affordable housing, and more than half of these are 2 to 3 bedroom'",
        "'speaker_1': 'units suitable for families. I am impressed also with the effort that has been made for community input for the small area plan. I understand that more than 1400 people had their voices heard either on in community meetings or in online surveys.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I want to thank the development teams and the city planning group for their efforts for that and also the Denver Public Schools. May I particularly note the effort that was made to reach the Spanish speaking people in the community?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I might say that if the return on the Spanish input was less than expected, it might have nothing to do with your efforts, but more the fact that some of these people.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Are having.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To stay under the radar in today's world and cannot come out to public meetings and give their name. I support the small area plan and I urge the Council to do the same. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Mark or cabbage?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Good evening, President Clark and members of Denver City Council. My name is Mark Ward Cavic. I'm a principal of West Side Investment. The owner of the Lauretta Heights campus at 3001 South Federal tonight, the Florida Heights area lead, Loreto Heights community led area plan is in front of you for adoption.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'West Side purchased Florida Heights campus in the summer of 2018 only. And I said this before only after all avenues to continue the 130 year legacy of an educational facility were exhausted. For the past year, we've been on the pause button and I have to say that initially I was apprehensive about the process, but I can tell'",
        "'speaker_11': 'you that I have nothing but wonderful remarks about what we've gone through, and we've been working in collaboration with the community and we've been also working with the city on this area plan process. And the results, as I just indicated, are overwhelmingly positive.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I am honored to be a part of this process. I'm honored to have heard every comment, both in support and in opposition. The process has been beautiful because everybody's voice has been heard. We heard loudly that Southwest Denver has been overlooked for many years.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It is clear the community is seeking a place to call their own. A community that envisions a mix of use, a mix of incomes, and a multi-generational development which honors the spirit of Loreto, celebrates the existing culture, embraces the campus characteristics and preserves the historical legacy.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And that includes the cemetery, while at the same time the community is not seeking to move forward under the current zoning, which is incredibly dense. In closing, it is my wish to think about the future of Loreto and not be sad.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So let's rejoice. Let's get together and breathe life back into this campus just as the community led area plan envisions. On behalf of the community, I ask for your support and approval of the Right of Heights Area Plan tonight.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. That concludes our speakers. Are there questions from members of Council Councilman Flynn?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I'd like to ask Irene Aguilar to come on up, who's the head of our Neighborhood Equity and Stabilization Team? Because I, like many of the speakers, I'm very concerned about the potential for displacement and gentrification.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I think a lot of us have the same goal, but we view differently how to get there. My view of this is that it is currently vacant, so new housing there displaces no one, in fact in any places people.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And the plan that's in the area of the mapping in the area plan has a range of housing from Pancreases Hall and others to come under the affordable housing program, but also affordability by design from thrive builders with price points that start actually below the average values in some of the surrounding neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So Senator Aguilar, I would like to ask you, what is your view on the potential for development at Loreto Heights to either help prevent gentrification, to provide a defense against gentrification or the opposite?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Flynn, and thank you, members of the committee, for your attention this evening. And to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All my neighbors who are here, I do live.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Across the street from the vacant.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Property. I actually, as you know, I've been doing research into gentrification and what can cause and what can exacerbate it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Interestingly.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The the placing of a development being placed in areas that are largely minority is a mitigating factor against gentrification. And if you look at the area maps of southwest Denver, this is a largely Latino population. I think the analysis of the small area development plans show that it was 63 or 68% Latino.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The other thing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Tends to be mitigating is if there is a large percentage of affordable housing and in addition to the housing that West Side Investment Partners has committed to, it at this point is only pancreas. While as part of the large area development plan, we will be having our housing people.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Actually, Melissa Tardy was here earlier meet with to talk about deeper affordability and larger units for the area. Loreto Heights.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is right next to a Catholic Health Initiatives project.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And it is across the.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Street and are surrounded by.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'A lot of multi-level, very affordable housing buildings, which actually actually again tend to protect against gentrification. The further you are from downtown, the less likely you are to gentrify. And one of our complaints to Councilman Flynn constantly is how difficult it is to get from our community to downtown.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so there are a number of factors here. Yeah. You were on that RTD board. I remember that. But I there so there are a number of factors here that I'm speaking to you as your constituent now.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Not as an employee of the city and county. That my apologies.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That will actually potentially help mitigate this. I think.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think the largest.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thing that will help, though, is if we do get a true commitment written on paper as part of a development agreement for affordable housing in this area, it presents a unique opportunity to potentially build, as you mentioned.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Attainable housing for.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Many people in our workforce, including our teachers. It is a big barrier to recruitment in.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Our city, is that many.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Teachers cannot afford to buy housing. And so if there is a potential to by force to put for sale housing here and the 300 to $350000 range.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That could really help to stabilize the community in general.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I am hopeful that the amenities that the developer plans will come to fruition and will.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Be sustaining and will help to create some jobs in the area. There are a lot of schools nearby.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And around the area who would benefit from partnerships and employment and certainly economic development and opportunity could work with.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Them around.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Work force if that was the desire of the developer as well in terms of ensuring that we had utilized some of the city's development goals around.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Redevelopment.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I think done correctly, there's a lot of potential here. I think interestingly, areas in which the city has had high levels of investment are more likely to gentrify. And as we've been telling you for years, you have not been investing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'In southwest.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Denver. So I think we're protected.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Senator Jason Morrison and Mr. President. Oh, Madam Pro-Tem, sorry, I. Know that there are others in the queue. So I will just ask some rapid fire questions maybe for Jason and then for Mark and then I'll I'll defer and then come back into the queue.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Jason, could you describe after we had the first community meeting in January where we had 230 people come out on a very cold night Thursday night in January. I came to you and I said, you know, we're not getting outreach or we're not getting turnout from the Latino community.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We need to do more. And so I asked CPD to take on a monolingual Spanish meeting. And could you describe the outreach that was done for that?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Sure. Absolutely. So great question. So as Councilman Flynn mentions, and I think Irene touched on this earlier, the very beginning of this process, we did our due diligence and want to kind of understand the demographics of the area, the planning area.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And we did discover that over 60% of the folks that do live within the area identify as Hispanic or Latino. So in working with Councilman Flynn, we realize there's a great need to engage these folks. And, you know, we from day one, from that first community meeting, we had the bilingual fliers realized we weren't getting the turnout'",
        "'speaker_9': 'that we wanted to see. So we wanted to partner with Councilman Flynn to have this particular meeting. And so we sat down as a group. And rather than hold that meeting in the evening, we really wanted to kind of think think through this a little bit more and really kind of identify avenues and ways to get folks'",
        "'speaker_9': 'to these these particular meetings. So we decided to have the meeting during the Saturday morning. So traditionally, we do typically hold our meetings in the evening, but this particular meeting was held at first thing in the morning on a Saturday actually to get folks to to come in in the hopes that we can engage these folks.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But in working with Councilman Flynn, we, you know, tried a lot of different avenues to get folks to come to these particular meetings. And so we we did everything, as, you know, not only distributing fliers through a company, but walking up and down Federal Boulevard and putting these fliers on businesses, apartment buildings to try and engage the'",
        "'speaker_9': 'renters and then even marketing the vendors more. Just kind of get to know your neighbors, you know, complete with breakfast burritos supplied by a local vendor. We actually had a communications team that went to a Zumba class. Believe it or not, I was not at that Zumba class.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But there were folks that went to a Zumba class at College View Rec Center to try and try and get folks to to show up. So we really tried to get, you know, just be innovative and, you know, really work with Councilman Flynn in the community.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And Adriana Pena was up here speaking about our outreach with Denver Public Schools and working with the Duka and Univision to really kind of promote this particular event. And we were very happy. You know, we did end up with 30 folks that did show up to this particular meeting.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Did we want more? Absolutely. But we I think we learned a lot through this process. And we worked with our steering committee to kind of identify ways to continue the outreach moving forward. And I would encourage folks to work with CPD in the future to really, really get folks to think over this.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think I mentioned to you also that the Saturday before the meeting we held this at a neutral at a church at All Saints church on a Saturday morning. And I think I mentioned to you that the Saturday before that I personally drove up and down federal and post to those fliers.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Correct as well. And that I also approached CPD because of what Mohawk has said. The second the last person to testify that there was great concern in the community about what what's going on at the national level with with immigration raids and things like that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I asked CPD to develop a protocol, should we hold this meeting that we advertised pretty widely so that what our response would be if ICE showed up at the door at All Saints and we did develop that, correct?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Correct. Okay. Thank you. And now very quickly, Loretta Height's community initiative had about you sent me the spreadsheet today for comments on the final draft. And by my count, with your resolution of them, 14 of them were incorporated into the final draft.'",
        "'speaker_6': '14 Those comments, eight of them involved such specific requests that actually come later and will occur after area plan is adopted but are more site plan oriented. Two of those were beyond the scope of what area plans do I think one of them wanted us to measure demographics with a five mile radius, including the city of Littleton'",
        "'speaker_6': 'and things like that. And that was determined that that's not something an area plan does. And the only one that was actually not accommodated was one that you heard here that the rest of the steering committee would not agree to.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And that was an immediate, historic landmark district designation as the only tool on the table for preservation. And wasn't it the determination of the steering committee other than LHC and Harvey Park, that we should leave all the tools on the table and use the ones that produced the best result at the time they're needed?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That's absolutely correct. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. And just a couple of questions for Mark before I defer my name for a time, Mark McCarrick. Because you have been talking with a strike Denver for quite some time.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I have been talking to historic Denver for quite some time.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. And those talks were aimed at determining the timing and the sequencing and the application of whatever historic preservation tools we want to use to save these buildings.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yeah, the talk has always been about preservation and, you know, preserving the buildings that are very important on that campus.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'No one, including West Side, but no one in the community has ever said we should tear down the academy building.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That has that has never been in any conversation. As a matter of fact, to take it one step further, when we purchased the property, the property.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That was our next question.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Put on a covenant that prevented demolition.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Tokio Group When they sold the campus, they would not even entertain a an offer from any buyer who would not accept that covenant that runs with the land. Correct.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That is a true statement.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. In fact, how many minutes do you think it would take me to file a hostile landmarking designation bill? Should you or anyone in your group even breathe the word demolition.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'To the administration building.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Or Pancreases Hall or the chapel or reload or relocating the cemetery?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yeah. I mean, I think we all know the answer to that question quickly.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. And finally, what's up with the cemetery? Tell me the status of your talks with the. Oh, I'm sorry. Before I leave that you've you did send a letter today to historic Denver, because although you're not finished and Mr. Olson is still here, I assume, although you're not finished with the instrument that accomplishes this, the intent and'",
        "'speaker_6': 'the committed intent now is that there will be permanent preservation protection on the I call it the Academy Building, people say administration. It was built as Loretto Academy, the Chapel, Pancreases Hall and protection for the cemetery. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It is true. And let me take a minute to explain that letter. It is a true statement that today I did send a letter over to historic Denver, which was I think John used the word a commitment letter.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The commitment has always been there. You know, I come from the Midwest. You know, my handshake is worth a lot. I know people don't necessarily believe that here in Denver, but it does. We have always said in all of the steering committee meetings that those buildings would be preserved.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Mm hmm. You know, there there is already a covenant on the administration building where you can't tear it down.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And chapel.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And the chapel as well. And the way that the rehabilitation and the adaptive reuse of those buildings are going to work, you absolutely have to have historic tax credits. The historic tax credits are governed by a very strict guideline by the Department of the Interior, you know, which does the exact same thing, to be honest, that those'",
        "'speaker_11': 'easements are going to do. So the reason why the letter came out today is that we were trying to get an easement done beforehand. We're having the easements reviewed by our financial advisors just to make sure there's not a problem.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But again, it's completely redundant to everything that we're already doing. Okay. You know, it's like belt and suspenders.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Last, last, last question before I defer. What's up with the cemetery? My impression is that you have offered to facilitate whatever arrangement is is acceptable to the Sisters of Loreto.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yeah, I've been meeting with Sister Mary now and Ruth for a long time, maybe almost a year. And, you know, their relationship is going beyond the cemetery. You know, they've taught me a lot about the history of the campus.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We've spent time up at Regis in the archives digging through boxes. In fact, Martha was there with us and on all the journeys as well. And at this point in time, we have offered many solutions to the cemetery.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And at this point in time, we are waiting for the sisters to let us know which solution that they like the best. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman. Councilman Hines.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you, Mr. President. You know, with 41 speakers, it gives us an opportunity to rack up a couple questions, so I hope it won't take too long. May I chat with CPD for a minute? Just some about some of the data around the, you know, in the surrounding neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So we had Senator Aguilar say it was about two thirds Latino, 63 or 68%, I believe was her stab. Is that. And I think you said you felt that was approximately correct. Yes. Has the do you know if the demographic composition has changed much in the last decade or two?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I don't personally, I don't. No. I think my assumption would be that it's it's mermaid pretty consistent and it's in line with what Senator Regular said. Correct. In line with and also in line with all of the investment that we've done as a city in southwest Denver, as in not much.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So there's not really a whole lot of need, I suppose, or a lot of opportunity for change, I suppose, just from natural evolution. The how many other do you know if there were other potential suitors for this property?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I think there there were there were few companies or organizations that I considered purchasing, but those all fell through. Is that is that right? I believe so. So the one that comes to mind is, I believe in metro state was offered, but they did not they did not want to move forward with the purchase.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Other than that, I thought my head I can't think of any others. I'm sure there may have been more and I don't know if someone else and that purchase was like for a dollar or two or less. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So that I guess in my mind kind of speaks to again to the opportunities in southwest Denver that have not really materialized and also speaks to perhaps the difficulty in doing something with this property. How many other culturally significant structures are there in southwest Denver, do you know?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So what do you mean by culturally significant if you had to put a definition on it? That's a fair statement. I'm so I'm new to council two months as of and a couple of days. And I'm starting to realize that the questions that I ask people want to be very careful with their answer.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so when I ask vague questions, I understand that that's difficult. You could give vague answers, but I guess are there other community centers in southwest Denver as in like placemaking, where people go to to collect, they go with their neighbors and they you know, they that does that is that may be a bit more specific or'",
        "'speaker_9': '. Yeah, that helps. So to my knowledge, I know Bear Creek Shopping Center, which is kind of located south and west of this particular planning area, is most likely, I think, you know, probably known as kind of that, that main kind of commercial, you know, destination place type Federal Boulevard has a lot of local shops and restaurants and'",
        "'speaker_9': 'small businesses. So that's another area I know. You know, Councilman Flynn would know the area, I think, a lot better as far as, you know, southwest of the actual planning area itself. But those are kind of two areas that I think come to mind for kind of a destination where folks can actually shop and experience retail and'",
        "'speaker_9': 'have kind of that community gathering. Okay. And I guess he does live there and represent District two. So I would hope that he he understands the neighborhood. May I also ask you a couple questions of Mr. Miscavige, please?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So think thank you for coming and and thank you for presenting and being available for questions. We've had we've heard from a lot of people. I it seems that in my unofficial estimation, we probably had more people in support of the conversation than than opposed.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'There are a couple of things that I want to try to wrap my arms around. And and perhaps you can help me help me do that. Some of the folks who were against said that the community wasn't in favor of the plan and that but then once we looked at the surveys, you know, when CPD presented, the'",
        "'speaker_9': 'surveys were overwhelmingly positive. Do you have any sense of perhaps why, you know, the people who were against the plan felt like there wasn't community support, but then the surveys and obviously there were other people afterwards that said there was plenty of support.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I just I guess I'm I'm not understanding exactly why there might be opposition to support.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'You and I both I don't understand either. I can tell you that the process, you know, has been very inclusive. I can tell you that when I first started, I was apprehensive as well as you can imagine. I think that the insight that we have learned from the community through this process has been absolutely amazing.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I have personally tried to have conversations with some of the individuals that are in opposition, and all I can tell you is that the answer is no. When I talk to them.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'As in they. Daniel.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I just. I don't understand. I wish I had an answer for you, because if I did, this conversation would be a lot easier.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. And so zap the ANC zoning committee, I believe, mentioned historic designation. I think Councilman Flynn had mentioned it's smart to keep all the options on the table instead of moving forward with one can. Can you help me understand a bit more about the, you know, keeping all the tools in the tool belt, why that's important.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Specifically with regards to the idea of historic designation first.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Sure. Like with anything you want to begin with the end in mind. And I think we're 100% aligned with what the end in mind is. The end in mind is creating a great community gathering place, maintaining the spirit of Loreto.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And included with that is preservation of a number of really iconic buildings. So if the goal is preservation and there are a number of ways that you can provide for the preservation, why would you want to eliminate all of them?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But one, why would you not want to take the best tool in your toolbox and use it? You know, we have buildings that are going to be very expensive to repurpose. Just by way of example, Pan Croatia is going to cost $22 million to renovate.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The administration building is probably going to be in the upwards of the neighborhood of $40 million to renovate. One of the very most important tools that we have got to have in our toolbox is through the historic tax credits.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And the historic tax credits will absolutely provide for preservation of not only the exterior of the buildings, but very important interior components as well. So I'll ask you again, if you were in my shoes, why would you want to get rid of a tool that you could find useful in the future?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I know that's rhetoric. I am in the very wonderful position where I get to ask the questions. So the so because I'm not a developer or an expert in development after this, say we were to vote for it today, you know, start breaking ground tomorrow.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Right. That there is there the large development review, is that another necessary step before you can do anything with the property?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yeah, absolutely. And that's a great point. I'm glad that you brought that up, Councilman. This is the first step of a of a number of steps that need to happen. You know, we do have the LDR process that has been referenced a few times here tonight.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'You know, after the LDR process, there's still zoning documents that need to be done. There's a development agreement inside the development agreement. We'll have the affordable housing components, the open space components and all. Yeah, the historic preservation components.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And then beyond that, we also have to have site plan approvals and then there's things called construction documents. So there are a lot of opportunities for input still.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. So the the comments about displacement or, you know, effect of pushing out communities of color, we still have opportunities to weigh in on that in historic preservation before ground is broken. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yeah, that's true statement. But nobody lives on the campus yet.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But if you're not pushing out, all the people are vandalizing the place. Oh, no, you're not going to displace them. Okay. So I think that's that's all I have for now. Thank you, Mr. Councilman.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilwoman Joyce.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you so much. Jason, can I ask you a couple of questions? And this trails off of the last comments that were made just in terms of what the community can expect next, in terms of steps that either they will see or that this body will see.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And it sounds like a large development review, zoning process, development agreement, site plan approvals. At what point are you plans determined?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Sure. So great question. So as you know, it was in our presentation, we've heard multiple times this evening that the views of the campus to and from the campus actually just incredible. You know, having grown up in southeast Denver, I didn't spend a lot of time in southwest Denver.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But the fact that I've been able to, you know, participate in this process and be on that site, you know, since we've started, this has just been fantastic. And to be able to see those views, I would highly recommend it.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So the views will actually continue throughout the LDR process, where when we start to get into things like the development agreements, you had mentioned that that something like that, that's where the views would potentially live. So what would happen is within the development agreement we would work with the developer, continue to work with the community to make'",
        "'speaker_9': 'sure that the development agreement adequately addresses the concerns surrounding the views. The plan goes as far as to make reference to specific locations, so to and from the administration building from Federal Boulevard, the sweeping views from the top of the campus to the southwest, the Rocky Mountains, the front range, and then also to the northeast, to the'",
        "'speaker_9': 'city of Denver. That's the skyline. So those specific plans or scenic views are called out in the plan. And now it's up to us as we move through implementation to make sure that we capture those and it would be in the development agreement.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Is it possible to do a traffic analysis of Dartmouth at this stage?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Not not at this particular stage, so not at the visioning stage. However, we have obviously we've heard the concerns. You heard the concerns tonight, particularly with Dartmouth Heights, where we worked with them to actually the language that lives in the plan now was crafted by Dartmouth Heights.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And we worked with them to get make sure that, you know, the vision was captured. But it's a little too early right now to have that traffic analysis. But one is coming. The traffic study is coming in order to make sure that we address those concerns.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is it at a particular stage that we mentioned before?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So it would be within the, I believe, the site plan, site planning process? I believe that's correct.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then my third question for you is the outreach and engagement for Latino Spanish speaking communities. It was mentioned that parent engagement took place at DPS. So everything independent of the of the single single meeting. What kind of input was received through that engagement?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I believe so what we did is we worked with Denver Public Schools and Adriana Pena, who was our kind of liaison, and we worked with her to not only distribute fliers but also, you know, incorporate feedback if she was hearing anything from those folks.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And then at the particular meetings, we would have the sticky notes and we would have, you know, pages and pages of feedback that we received from those folks incorporated into the plan. And then we would bring that back to the steering committee, bring that back to the other community meetings in order to make sure that we were'",
        "'speaker_9': 'listening to these folks and we we had everything covered. So I can't speak specific to the engagement that Adriana Pena did, but she was instrumental in us, first of all, asking us to print thousands and thousands of fliers that were distributed in backpacks of children in area elementary schools.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I know that she did have engagement with some of those folks throughout the process. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Just one question for Mark. Now the increase to haul affordable housing units are already set. At what point would anybody know that additional affordable units are being considered?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We are considering them so now.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. And do you know.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'What that will be?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I do. I have some ideas of some concepts that we're working on. It involves some pretty heavy lifting on one particular project of another adaptive reuse of a building. It would be potentially gauge towards seniors. And that is my next target that we're working on right now.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is there a point where community will know exactly when they'll be able to either hear what those unit numbers are, what the percentage of the overall plan will look like, anything that indicates to them it's going to be more for sure than increase the whole.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yeah. Part of our LDR process as a community outreach, there is a community public meeting I think is the technical term for it. That meeting is already scheduled. It's on October 1st over and match both on the library.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So those that want to come, you're welcome to attend in that meeting. You know, it's where our plan is to unfold more, you know, talk about more ideas. We are expecting fact expecting is the wrong word to we are wanting to do more than just penetration on this project.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman and Councilman CdeBaca.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Just a few questions for Jason. Can you come back up?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Jason, I have a quick clarification there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Were you what was the partner or partner groups role in the development.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Of this site plan?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I believe the partner company served as kind of a consultant to the development team.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So they were they consulted with was side. Did you come from partner.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Before coming to the city?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That's incorrect. No.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'What was your relationship to partner before coming to the city?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Sure. So in graduate school. So I went to University of Colorado, Denver for two years of graduate school. And in 2012, I believe I, of course, you know, was was trying to find a job in planning. And there was a presentation that was done by the partner company working with one of the professors.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I applied for an internship. I was an intern with the partner company for I don't even think it was six months back in 2012. And so again, that was, you know, so six, seven years ago.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So you didn't work on this plan before coming to work on it?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I didn't.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so can you. You mentioned that 30 Latinos showed up to the meeting that was designed for the Spanish speakers. Are any of them here?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You know, it was so long ago. I honestly, I, I mean, I don't know.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Did you guys receive any support from any of those.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Participants for this project?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So support is in.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Letters of support statements.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So we did receive. Sorry. Just sorry to cut you off there, Councilwoman. We did receive a letter of support from Cassandra Ornelas, who is with the Southwest Denver Coalition. And so she works she works with this community, and she was also a member of the steering committee.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so she was instrumental in helping us without that community meeting. So we did receive that letter of support that represents that organization.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. All of them.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I heard a lot prior to this meeting from people who had participated that there was a very clear separation between the site plan and discussions about how to finance it. Is that typical of CPD processes where you keep it separate, siloed?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes, absolutely. And so I know it is a little confusing because I know that the Metro District was in front of council, gosh, a few few weeks ago now, I suppose. But the Metro District was identified in this small area plan as a financing mechanism or a tool that could be used.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I know Marc and I think others spoke to the constraints on getting that particular measure on the on the ballot at a certain time. So that's kind of why that leapfrog. But you're absolutely correct that it is separate from from the process.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Why do we keep those conversations separate?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I don't know if I can answer that question.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Does the financing mechanism ever.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Factor into the ability of the plan to meet the goals of equity and inclusion?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I believe it does, yes. And if I know that Andrew Johnson is here to speak a little more specific about the metro districts, I did not work on the metro district and I don't really know the ins and outs, so I'm a little worried.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I'm not going to speak eloquently about that. So if we can bring up Andrew, I think you might be able there to answer that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, we can save that one.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But do you know off the top.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Of your head what you guys spent to do community engagement, outreach from your office and then perhaps from you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All mark my work.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I do not have a specific dollar amount, but I can tell you that we spent a great deal of time with the outreach. And again, I just want to reiterate the you know, the avenues that we went to try and come up with innovative approaches.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'One thing, Councilwoman Torres, I did forget to mention is all of our spin or excuse me, all of our surveys were also in Spanish. So, you know, we actually went outside of the planning realm and work with our community folks that, you know, are specific with community engagement and develop these types of surveys.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So a lot of time and effort went into these and I don't have a dollar amount for, you know.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Do we ever monetize it?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So we do. I know that it is part of our budget. I don't know off the top of my head what what is specifically allocated for that. But we we do have kind of a chunk that is used for that and that that involves the outreach, that involves supplying, you know, food, things like that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Some of these particular meetings as well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is, is there's no.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Dollar amount attached to that chunk.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So there is a dollar amount. I do not know what that dollar amount is.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And one question before I ask us a couple of the same questions to my mark. How do you define inclusive?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I think that's that's a great question. So I think, you know, inclusivity is it's where, you know, I always think back to that definition of equity that it's it's to make sure that everyone has a chance. Right. Everyone has a chance to participate.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I think that that involves. Proper engagement that involves thinking outside of the box. But I think that's how I would you know, I would define inclusive, is that everyone can participate and everyone has a say moving forward.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mark. Can you tell.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Us a little bit about what your budget was for outreach and engagement?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We didn't have a budget for that, councilwoman. Our goal was to get out to as many meetings as possible. And I think that you heard from a lot of individuals that every meeting that I could possibly attend, I was there.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'There was no budget set aside where I had to spend X number of dollars or once I spent X number of dollars, I was done.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So what did you spend?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I have no idea. I really don't.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so when you guys were firing haphazardly throughout the area, was there any consideration.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'For the fact that you have.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes, a majority Latino community, but.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In college.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'View, 76% of homeowners are Latino. In Mali, 44% of homeowners are Latino. And in Harvey Park, 23 are 29% are Latino. Was there any. Consideration to maybe sending postcards to their.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Houses to let them know or engage them.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'With all due respect, this is a city led area plan. This is not a developer led area plan. The outreach program was through the leadership of the city and me. Mark with Cabbage and West Side as the developer participated.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We went to meetings, we answered questions and we engaged with the community. But we specifically didn't do the outreach.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So with this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Majority Latino neighborhood and 44 people who spoke tonight, I think there was one Latina who lived in the area, one who participated on the group, and then one who was a representative of DPS.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Does that feel inclusive to you or does.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That fit with your definition of inclusive?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The answer to that question is they weren't. It wasn't that they weren't reached out to councilwoman. I think it's the question of why aren't they coming? And do I think that that's inclusive? I think the outreach was there.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The question, and I think somebody asked it earlier, is why are they not coming? It wasn't for a lack of trying, and I can assure you of that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you for that. Just just.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'A little.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Piece about inclusion, though. It's an acknowledgment. Inclusiveness is an acknowledgment of the injustices.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That have gotten us to this point. And it's not actually a favor that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Those of us with privilege do for those who have less privilege. It's a partnership and intentionality behind what we're doing to make sure that whatever those barriers are, we're not explaining them away later. We're actually addressing them. But thank you for your questions.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I'm sorry, what was that last point?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you for your questions. You can rewatch the video. We'll need it for the next parts of your your process.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Are you alone? All right, Councilman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Let me start with. I want to ask Jean Moore, are you still here? Gene? Jane Myers. I'm sorry. Jean Myers, is he still around? No. He's out in the hall. They're getting him. Sorry, Jane.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm calling you up to the podium, if you don't mind. So I just want to clarify, are you going to be developing the affordable units in reshuffle?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Are you intending to do any development on the on the site at all? Yes. Okay. And will that be affordable units?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We're in the midst right now of working that overall project plan out for the development agreement. Okay. So we're counting up pancreas creation units, units that would occur elsewhere and then arriving at what we need to be doing on our site.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. And I just wanted to ask you if you could just talk a little bit about some of the affordable housing projects you have done within the city?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well, I think the big one is Stapleton. And I think between Thrive, we're a for profit company and Northeast Denver housing. I think we built all of the for sale housing, affordable housing in Stapleton. I think we've done three or 400 units and continue to build out there.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Great. And we're is was that a mix between for sale and rental?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's all for sale. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So we're a homebuilder, never done rental, never done any historic preservation northeast. And we have enough trouble getting.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'What we do right that we aren't trying a lot of new stuff. So I'm getting too old for that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So what you're looking at is for sale affordable?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes, that's correct.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Thank you. And I am familiar with the work you've done at Stapleton, which I think has been outstanding housing for folks that are at a lower price point. So appreciate that. Let me move on to have a couple of questions for the city attorney.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I have a copy of the letter that was written to John Olsen by Mark. And I'm wondering if that is something that we can just incorporate into the record and what is the the most appropriate way to do that?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Kirsten Crawford Legislative Council in yes, you can put that into the record. And I would suggest, I think that you give a copy to medication. She can make sure it's part of the record.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Okay, great. And just make sure that, Mark, you have no issue concerned with that being part of the record since it's already been referenced on a couple of occasions.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'As I mentioned before it, we're doing it anyway. Yeah. So it's completely redundant and I welcome it to be part of the record.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay, so while you're up, I have a couple of questions for you. Can you tell me? So I know you're just focusing on what the financing is going to look like for this project. Had to get through sort of the the planning and trying to understand where the roads are going to be and, you know, what buildings'",
        "'speaker_1': 'are going to be preserved and what other types of development to include on the site. But do you anticipate the use of tax increment financing at all at this point in time as you're sort of brainstorming what those different financing tools might be?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I do.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. And do you intend to own and. Maintain the development or do you are you looking to master plan the whole site and have other developers come in and do other components of it?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yep. Great question. My vision for Loreto is to find the best. Developer for each component of the project. There are some things that I know that we can do well, and there are other things that I know other people can do well, like Jean behind me.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We brought Jean into this process early because I wanted the person who was going to be doing the for sale to also be at every community meeting and listening in the background without tainting the process, which was a little bit challenging to do, but just to keep them in the background and listening and to continue to have'",
        "'speaker_11': 'us, you know, regurgitate what we heard. And so the plan, as we're working on them, can incorporate what the community is asking for.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So my next question is kind of focused on what those additional reviews are that still need to be brought forward for approvals. Some of them will be done by the Planning Department and some of them will be done by city council.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Obviously, if if TIFF is one of your financing tools that will come before this body. Yep. The large development review. The zoning. And the historic preservation rate as well as the TIV. So those would be the additional opportunities where the community gets to have additional input before this body on those various components of this development.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Right. Yep. I'll be up here a lot.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Um, my last question is back to the city attorney, and this has to do with the Metro District. There were some questions, and I think Andrew came back into the room. If there's a need to have you weigh in, Andrew.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I want you to clarify. There have been some comments or concerns expressed that a metro district gets to completely do language that waves them out from having to participate in TABOR. And I just want to clarify that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The city of Denver still gets the bass mills from the development. And Andrew, I don't know if you or Kirsten want to speak to this issue. So can you just clarify that this doesn't completely waive all taxes, collected property taxes, and exempt them from from TABOR entirely?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So can you just clarify that? So we know this project has 50 mills, but that's on top of the RTD DPS. So can you just speak to that?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Right. My name is Andrew Johnston. I'm with the Department of Finance. I work on special districts. I was here a couple of weeks ago talking about the metropolitan districts. And so I'm. I'm a little.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Confused by the question, so help me understand it a little.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Bit. But. Metropolitan districts the question.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'To can they waive.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The right to impose taxes is that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'No can can they. Not. Not opposed taxes, but. The The Tabor. You know, the taxpayer bill of Rights cannot be just completely ignored. But in terms of the bills that are collected on any metro district project, the metro district funded project, the city still gets those base mills.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Correct?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So the Metro Pass metropolitan mill levies are on top of their additional taxes because there are special taxing district areas. So DPS, the city and urban drainage, which constitutes about 77 mills across the whole city, are impacted by the activities of the Metropolitan District.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The project will still collect that. Those will still be remitted back to the city. The additional mills are what they get to use to offset the cost of the infrastructure that's being built to do the project. Correct.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Correct. And I just would like to clarify that, like the city treasurer and assessor.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You know, impose all those.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Impose and collect those taxes for each of those taxing entities, whether it be the city or DPS and the metropolitan district is a special taxing district that overlays the area. And so just on that, what areas are.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'In any special.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'District? They get only those taxes that they impose.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So my last question is, have you seen that where we have met districts where it's layered on top of the base that's collected for every other property that it has? Created more challenges for a developer in either building affordable housing, attracting either buyers for housing or tenants for the commercial spaces.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Can you just speak to that? I mean, obviously, it's a little, little more costly to be in some of these developments.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But yeah, so I can't exactly speak to the answer to your question, but I think just if you think about economics in general, right. So if you have additional taxes in an area, then that's a burden that's just in that area.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But the theory for.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Metropolitan.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Districts really.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Goes to.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Is there's also additional services and benefits being derived in that area, which is what those taxes are being used for. So it does sometimes provoke propose a challenge with affordable housing or trying to bring certain businesses in there.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But usually the offset is the desire to, if it's a commercial business, that they want to be there because there's additional placemaking going on and things that drive people to that area for affordable housing. It's hopefully not too much of an impact, but when we do affordable housing programs.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And bring those units to.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The site, there's usually compensating factors besides the metropolitan district.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And the state legislation that allows the creation of metro districts. Does it really give local government the tool for us to use that financing mechanism as a vehicle to mandate affordability and some other things that are not within the list of allowable things?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Can you just speak to that?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Sure. You are absolutely correct. You're talking about metropolitan districts, which.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Are Title 32.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Special District Act districts. They are an infrastructure financing tool. And actually.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Creating.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Affordable.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Units themselves is not part of the purview of a metropolitan district.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'However, they could provide, let's say, the infrastructure.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'To help make give like, you know, roads and sidewalks and water.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And light and dri utilities to those affordable units. So it's not a direct relationship. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. I have no.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman. Councilman Flynn, you back up?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes, Mr. President. And at the risk of, you know, we've been at this for two and a half years in the neighborhood, and I apologize to my colleagues for the length that we've gone on. But this is such an important issue to us.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I'd like to have. Tony, could you come up for a second? I'd like to do some maybe Rapidfire questions before we go on to the next person in the queue. Tony, I was. Tony reached out to me because I was very concerned about the fact that the steering committee was coming together and it was not it'",
        "'speaker_6': 'was very low on representation from our Latino community. So what we had was, if you recall, Tony, we had Jim Gibson from Loreto Heights Community Initiative representing LHC, HCI, and J.J. Neiman over here represented Harvey Park. None of my neighborhood presidents were appointing or designating Latino members for me.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So you reached out to me, I think, through Larry Ambrose. Is Larry still here? That's correct. Larry had suggested you and I've known you for years. You're former state representative, which we should acknowledge your service in the legislature.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And and you also had this deep background in affordable housing. I said, perfect. So I feel like a baseball manager. And we we did like the double switch. Right. And you took Jim's seat on on as the LHC person?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Correct. That's correct. And Jim moved over. And so. Q You designated Jim as the Zahavi Park representative, and that's that's how you came to be and your input. You had a do you remember all those meetings that you came to?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I know some that you missed. And Larry Ambrose was your alternate. And you remember those. And I remember you as you and Jim, frankly, as two of the most active contributors to making changes and tweaks to the language and things like that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Is that your recollection? That's correct. My whole goal was trying to make sure that the vision actually represented with the citizens wanted, and that's why they stressed so much. A historic district's affordable housing. Mixed income. Mixed use. Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And not having traffic going through Dartmouth, those are things we stressed, trying to make sure that we'd hold that vision. But at the same time, we've been trying to find ways to have more certainty in those same areas to protect.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Because a vision is a vision. It's the execution documents that are so important. So that's why the next phase, the site plan and the large development review committee allows us hopefully to put more certainty, say this will be protected and the toolbox that you helped us create.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I want to thank you for helping us do that. Try to make sure we have the right tools. The key is using the right tool at the right time. And we've been pushing to use historic districts sooner, not exempt beside something else, but trying to get it at the right time.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so my representation of both Latinos, as well as affordable housing has, I think, added value to trying to make this a better vision. More importantly, the execution of it that better meet. One of the questions we're going to be asking more in the next part is will there be a covenant for affordable housing because the prices'",
        "'speaker_6': 'of the housing on Loreto Heights will grow so fast. So if you build affordable housing now or attainable housing, you may have to consider what the covenant where you put on there to retain those and still have people move up the escalator for rental to townhomes, to single family homes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You have to have an escalator, but you have to have some strategy to make sure that happens. And let me ask you, we can count on you to stay involved in this. Yes, sir. Thank you. And thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I saw that you were leaving. That's why I wanted to bring it up. Thank you very much for that. Thank you. I don't think you need to leave, but thank you for staying. Jason, on again, just to not to belabor, but to amplify on the Latino outreach, the question was raised about flowering and outreach.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And actually my council office supplemented not the developer because the developer putting money into this is something we actually did not want. But I my office supplemented CPD's outreach. You recall on one occasion for one of those community meetings, we leaflet it 13,000 houses.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Apartments, door to door.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Door to door. We hired a service and we covered, I believe, every address and RV park, RV Park, South College View, Brentwood, Sharon Park. I think Donna we even did Marley and we also I talked to Sally Daigle, the councilwoman from Sheridan, and I got her permission to to leaflet in the city of Sheridan as well.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And you recall that we did that for three public meetings, and those fliers were in English and in Spanish, and we had every door in college view and in the north. West corner of the city of Sheridan.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That's correct. Yeah. And I believe it. There was for meetings. It wasn't just the three. It was all four of them.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Oh, all Spanish. Now, we didn't flier for that because we targeted we we used the Univision and Adriana Pena. We went to the to the backpacks in college view and Dust Elementary to reach the the Spanish speaking community that way.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So in that particular meeting, though, we we did actually flier for that. So that's when my team printed fliers. We work with Adriana to get those fires into the schools. Okay. But then my team actually went door to door along Federal.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Boulevard real quickly. Then our view sheds addressed in the plan.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes, they are.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay, including from Loreto Heights Park looking toward the campus.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yeah, correct. From Lora Heights Park, looking southeast to the campus and.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'From the campus looking to the southwest toward Fort Logan Cemetery in the front range. Correct. And from Federal Boulevard, looking toward the.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Administration.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Building. The administration building. Correct. And actually from the northwest, also looking toward downtown and looking toward the building from the northwest.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That is correct.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. On heights, we described that in the campus core, there is a maximum building height of up to eight stories. We revise the area plan at the suggestion of LHC Mr. Gibson and and I think Larry Ambrose was part of this.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We actually did a site tour on a Saturday and we walked the campus and that led to West Side agreeing to language that says there will be one and only one such building of up to eight stories with of a limited footprint, correct?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes, that's.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And is it true that the Ruby Hill view plane covers the entire campus that is subject to an eight, eight story limit?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That is correct, yes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So if that one building of small footprint were to be built closer up the hill toward the campus, it could not be eight stories.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That is correct.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'In fact, the view plane mandates that no structure ever, ever will exceed the height of the dormers on the Academy building. The dormers that are on the the the the low roof there.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That's correct. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'No building.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'No building.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Did you do Mr. Chapman, an inch of Sharon Park spoke of wanting various wanting various housing types and price points. Does this plan enable that to happen?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It does. That was something that was made very evident and very clear at the very beginning of this process, was to have a variety of housing types for a variety of incomes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Thank you. We heard some testimony that the recommendations in the plan favor it gives the developer everything he wants. And my impression is actually the opposite, because I saw all I saw 230 people from the community come out to the first meeting and we had about 120 at the second and 100 at the third.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We had 30 people at the at the monolingual Spanish meeting, and everybody got to put their marks on the maps, including the steering committee. There are 28 major recommendations in the plan, and in them I counted a total of 193 specifically recommended strategies.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It seems to me that they all originated from public input.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It was 100% community driven.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mark. Real quickly. Can you explain the relationship the West Side developed with Thrive builders? And just to preface that, your teams, your architect, your planners were in the audience specifically so they could start to think about how you can comply with this area plan.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That is a true statement. I wanted to have them all hear what the community was asking for so they weren't getting it regurgitated through me, through the city or through reading a document.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Jason, I'm sorry. I should have asked you this real quickly. An area plan is not a site plan. Correct. So when when we hear talk about the fact that West Side was developing a metro district with a service plan and they had some mapping, regardless of the fact that the mapping was totally consistent with what the steering'",
        "'speaker_6': 'committee was saying and what the public was saying. They are always kept separate, are they not?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I said you did not know that they were doing this.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I did not. As a as the plan states, it is a mechanism that's used to finance. So we knew that it was in the plan, but I was unclear. I did not know that it was going forward.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'In fact, if the area plan process became more of a site plan process, we'd be meeting for three years, trying to site every building and design it and whatnot. Correct. So this is an iterative process. The area plan says, here's the vision and then we have the large development review.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Then we have rezoning, we have site planning. We even have a subdivision plan that comes to us. Correct. Okay. I believe.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That is all on Open Space LLC. LSI wanted at first 10%, but I see that they've asked for 15%. And maybe I should ask Mark this like you only asked Mark in the Metro District Service plan. I looked at the open space plan and there seems to me when I measured on my map, there is an excess'",
        "'speaker_6': 'of 1.1 acre in front of the academy building LHC. I was asking for 1.1 acre. I believe that's slightly larger than that as well.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'At the time we put the Metro District plan together, which we needed to do as part of the service plan, we we took the best information we at the time and put it down.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I know that you don't have a percentage yet of open space, but 10% is the maximum that you're required to provide. The open space plan mapping I saw on the service plan actually has substantially more than that, doesn't it?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It does.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Thank you. That's all.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman. Councilman Gilmore.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, President Clark. Jason, I have a couple questions for you. So Mark had mentioned and I just want to make sure I understood correctly. So it sounds like there's a community meeting that is already scheduled for October 1st for the large development review process?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yeah, that's correct. So that's the required community meeting. That's part of that process and it has been scheduled for October 1st.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Because I understand what Mark was saying was that this wasn't a developer led process. But I guess, you know, with that meeting being just a little bit well, about two weeks away and we're just hearing about it now, I guess I want to understand what is the the the agreed upon time frame in which CPD sets meetings'",
        "'speaker_1': '? Because, you know, when we did the far northeast area plan, we told city agencies, don't try to schedule anything out unless you give us at least 30 days so that we can be.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Respectful.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Of working families, families with children. And so could you talk a little bit about your internal policies on scheduling?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Sure. Absolutely. So within the early hour process, when we do notice for that community meeting, it is a 30 day notice. And so notices went out 30 days to the property owners in the area. The code actually specifies that it needs to be within 200 feet.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And the developer, you know, we communicated to him that, you know, within there's another process coming along. I believe it's the I think it's the tiny home village. Tiny home village is actually looking to amend that that hasn't come in front of you yet, but that's to bump that requirement up to 400 feet.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So he told the developer that that was coming and it would it would be a good faith attempt. I think that, you know, we encourage him to do so. So he did notice up to 400 feet of property owners that live within the boundary.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'There were also postings that went out and I believe and so postings in terms of actually posting the property. And I believe there were nine, maybe ten signs that were posted along the Colorado Heights property and various locations, strategic locations.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But to get back to your initial question with the notice on the notice was satisfied within 30 days. The developer got that out in time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then are those notices also at least bilingual in Spanish?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'They are correct. So we worked internally to make sure that it actually it is more like a postcard and that it is in English and in Spanish.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And are you open to work with other agencies, other community organizations? I mean, we have a really great agency, you know, human resources and community partnerships that might have some different outreach, some different ideas, maybe faith based ideas.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Are you open to working with them to increase the Latino involvement and engagement in the LDA our process if this passes tonight?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yeah, absolutely. And again, I want to extend the invitation to councilmembers and also folks in the audience that if there are other mechanisms that you think you should look at in terms of engagement, I know across the board we are open to that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Absolutely.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thanks, Jason. Thank you. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman Hines, are you back up?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr. President. So may I ask and thank you, counsel, our president pro tem for the question about engaging Latino, because I guess I'm confused about that, too. So, Mr.. We have each affiliate got your name right?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I think I did. Um, are you intending to encourage people in the surrounding neighborhoods to purchase or invest in Loreto Heights? You know, purchase a home or.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That has never been part of any discussion. I mean, if they want to talk to me, I'm more than happy to talk to them about it. You know, the process up to this point has not been about selling houses, though the process has been and only been about what is the vision that the community is asking for'",
        "'speaker_9': '. Okay, fair enough. Mr. Tafoya, may I ask you your thoughts on. Yep, yep, yep. I figured I'd ask the question as you were making your way.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So you question.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You live in District two, correct? So how far from Loreto Heights are you? Are you pretty close.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Or you live in Bear Valley, which is a couple of miles to the west.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Oh, okay. So maybe you're not the best person. I'll ask you anyway.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Since you're co-chair of the Colorado Latino Forum, though.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So we've heard that there are 13,000 fliers issued, you know, cut some of Flynn personally, did some firing. CPD, did a lot of outreach. Do you have any thoughts? And I know this is somewhat speculation, but but with your connection to the Latino community and living in District two, do you have any thoughts as to why more'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Latinos didn't participate in the process?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Well, I can say a couple of things. One, if flowering worked, I would have won city council. It takes a lot more than just putting fliers on people's doors to get people to turn out. A lot has to do with process.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And this is something that I see. The Colorado Latino Forum people are trying to take a look at before the West Side MPI processes, which I got cut off on. I can't speak 100% to why people didn't participate.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I can say that there is a supreme distrust of processes like this by people in our community, particularly people of immigrants and dreamers. You know, there's also recent examples where Latinos did voice their opinions like I-70.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Where they were completely.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Run and shot over despite the fact of participating at every step. So if I had a magic bullet to it, I answer it. I you know, part of the reason the comp plan and the Denver plan were slowed up is because of the supreme lack of engagement that had occurred.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Something like 12% of the people who had participated were Latino. Despite we make up 38% or so of the city, African-Americans was even drastically lower. I think it was 2%. Even then, they make up 11%. I know that the equity training that the blueprint people in CPD went through CBD.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I'm having a meeting with them on Wednesday about Latino engagement. I think they're trying. I don't think we figured it out, though.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. And I guess in some ways it's a chicken egg thing except the other way around in that perhaps the Latino community feels not heard. And so then they'd say, why bother? Participate. So then they start participating and then they're not heard.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So, Mickey Guyton, may I ask you the same question as so? And again, I understand this is speculation, but but my thought is how really the nature of the questions that I'm asking here is how can we get engagement?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I don't I don't I don't want to.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Do you want me to do the job of the CDP? No, because I can give you an invoice if I do the job for the CDP. How many Latinos are on your team? And why didn't the Latinos tell you that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You don't flier, that you go to their communities, that you go to their school, that you go to their place of worship and you sit with them.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And you feed them and you have a conversation and you ask the questions and engage. And you have people that look like them engaging with them. So do you want me to do the job of the CDP?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'No. I mean, I don't I don't I don't really have any thought either way. And if you invoiced me, I couldn't pay you. So sorry.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I've heard. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But thank you. Thank you for your for your commitment to the Latino community and for your thoughts. I just want to make sure that if it's 63 or 68% of the community surrounding this plan are Latino, that the Latino community is engaged.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And it sounds like there's an attempt and perhaps.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'An appropriate attempt.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yeah. And so perhaps I would just say.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If they asked.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'People of color on how to engage, they would have known.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. Fair enough. Thank you very much. And thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. All right. So you know other questions. The public hearing for accountable 818 is closed. Comments by members of council. Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. President. First, I want to thank everybody for staying here and participating. By my count, we had 32 speakers in favor, four opposed, and eight who took neither position. The developer owner hates when I say this and he knows exactly what I'm going to say and he's grimacing right now.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But he would do a lot of the community outreach meetings by asking people, If I could hand you a magic wand and you could wave it over the campus, what would you make it be? And for the life of me, my only answer, my gut answer was if I could wave a magic wand, I would have found'",
        "'speaker_6': 'a way for the Sisters of Loreto to have. Financially secured the future of that as a college, as a university that would rival at the south end of Federal Boulevard the success of Regis University at the North End.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And it would still be a functioning educational institution that we treasured for 125 years or 130 years. That magic wand didn't exist. Tokyo offered to give that the real estate to give it free. To Metro State a couple about a year or so before they put it on the market to give it to them.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Metro hired Jones Lang LaSalle, the national firm, to do an assessment, and they turned it down because of the immense cost of restoring these buildings. $60 million just to get them up to be useful as an educational institution for for higher education.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think that would have been tremendous. But we have achieved preservation. We've achieved it thanks to take you by there. Selling it with a covenant that requires preservation of the of the academy and the chapel and through West Side, reaching the deal with Hartman Ely to preserve pine crucial hall with the certain certain preservation.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Although we don't yet know the perpetual care mechanism, but the certain preservation of the cemetery, not a single soul. I use that term advisedly, has suggested that we relocate the cemetery. All I have heard from every party is we want this to be beautiful.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We want there to be a buffer around it. We want it not to have development encroach on it. And we have a plan that says it will not happen. We we have a plan that addresses affordable housing values across the spectrum, 30% to 80% AMI workforce housing, three bedroom units.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'How many times have we sat here and approved affordable housing projects that are studio and one bedroom? How does that work for a family? Southwest Denver is about families, so I'm very happy to see multi, multi bedroom units.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Some of the homes will be sold at prices less than what the houses in the surrounding area already sell for. The goal is to have a mixed income multigenerational community. The goal also no one talked about this. We hinted about it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But I want to hammer this like I did a planning board. The goal is that when you come here 50 or 100 years from now, you will always know that this was a campus, that this was a special place.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Therefore, this is not just another quarter or quarter section of of Brownfield. This is a sacred site. It's not the highest point in Denver, by the way, Mr. President, because if you think about it, there's Ruby Hill, apparently.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'No, no, it's not Rubio Heights. I look down on Rubio from my vantage point because the agricultural ditch flows into it from the West. So it's it's not the highest point, but it does sit on a promontory that is very important to us.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So when you come here 50 or 100 years from now. Not me, but anybody, you always want to you always will know that this is a campus. And the only way we achieve that is through the plans direction that this is a place you come to and not drive through.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Very important that our transportation planners at the city pay very close attention to the direction in this plan, that there's no cut through traffic here. A couple of speakers mention the importance of not having that traffic funneled past save an elementary or even college view DST which is on the campus.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Come see Dartmouth Avenue when it passes through the campus. It's only about this wide. It's about 30 feet wide. And it goes between the DST school, the DPS school and the Catholic Charities, Section eight apartments right next to it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There is no way to widen that into a thoroughfare and this needs to be recognized. So therefore, the Street Network here is meant to be designed for 20 mile an hour speeds that we prioritize the movement of people.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'First, the pedestrian and the bike networks are very robust and we are trying to design streets that that encourage 20 mile.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'An hour traffic.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And if you try to cut through Loreto Heights campus, you're going to get lost or you're going to be sorry you did that, but hopefully you'll stay and attend a show, the theater. So I will I will finish with just to make note, chairman say who mentioned this.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I'll say that maybe for me, the most embarrassing moment of the entire two and a half years was when the chairman and Jesse Paris showed up at the Christmas service and heard me sing Silent Night in German, and my wife sang it in Spanish and Father Dang in a Vietnamese choir singing in Vietnamese.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then we sang it all together on the 200th anniversary of the composition and first performance of that song in Austria. And it was such a moving moment, but. But very embarrassing that you saw me singing in German.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilman Flynn, if you stick around till we're all the way done tonight, which might not be till 1:00 in the morning, Councilman Flynn has promised to put on another show. Councilman Sandoval.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes, thank you, Mr. President. So this evening, as we sit up here, we heard from 44 public speakers this evening, and I would just like to say thank you all. I do not think it's easy to sit on that side of the of the dais.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I do not think that those chairs, the pews you're sitting in are made to be very comfortable. I do not think that this process is very easy on anybody. If you're a single mom, you're not able to be here.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'If you're a parent whose kids are young and you want to read them books, you're not able to be here if you're hungry, you're not able to be here because you have to leave. If you don't feel like going through security, you're not able to be here.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'If you have to pay your pay for your parking meter, you're not able to be here. So I just want you to know that I see that and I hear that. And also, my mother graduated from Loretto Heights in 1961.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'She has been a co member of the Sisters of Loreto since 1994. Currently she is a grandma and she works Monday, Tuesday, Wednesdays at for the sisters of Loreto. Like literally right now my mom is in Saint Louis with the Sisters of Laredo's and goes to the mother house.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So my entire life I have heard about the Sisters of Loreto and the impact that they have on this community and in Denver in general. And I also heard that gentrification is real. I also understand your anger and your frustration at some of the processes that the city undertakes.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It can feel be can feel like you're disenfranchized displacement has already happened in the Northside. So I feel your pain. I really understand what you're going through. And yet I also know how important a neighborhood planning process is.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I also know how important it sets the future. It's not going to set my future. I'm in my forties. It's going to set my kids future and the future generations after that. And so these processes are not easy.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Democracy is not easy. Democracy is messy and it's angry. And all of you would not be sitting here tonight if this wasn't your home, if it wasn't something. That you've really believed in, whether we agreed or we don't, it's your process.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so I just want you to understand that I hear you. And I also hope that you all understand tonight that this is not the end of the process. Use this energy that you have to come back to our council and talk to us about the preservation.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I hope that in the next four years before there's another general election, that these applications about the preservation of this historic site come forward. You will have open ears. People will understand. We will remember being here until 936 at night.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Hearing from you all tonight. Come back and talk to us about the rezonings, about the Dartmouth traffic issues. Don't let this process end. A lot of times the city leads these processes and then we forget about the people and you forget about the energy.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And you go back to your daily life and you go back to work and you go back to your kids. Continue this process. You have a new council here in front of you and we are listening and I understand your pain.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Northwest Denver. When I was growing up, it was 60% Latinos. When my father started Lacazette's in 1972, we were a Latino neighborhood and we are no longer. And so I understand what you are saying. And yet at the same time, I understand this planning process is real and it's important and it's important that we do it right'",
        "'speaker_7': '. So thank you to all the task members who gave up hours, hours after hours after hours to make sure that this plan ended up in front of us. Thank you to the critical thinkers who pushed beyond and thought beyond what was normally presented in front of them.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We need you. Thank you. To the land use people who think critically and push these issues. It's your your voices are invaluable. You. It's priceless. So I just want to start by saying that. And thank you, Councilman Flynn, for showing us what a what a neighborhood process with having 450 people looks like.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That does not happen in northwest Denver. It just does not. So thank you for your leadership on this. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilwoman Torres.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. Chair. Just a couple of things. I know that we were sent a number of recommended languages for amendments. And even my own appreciation for the number of processes that are coming up has made clear that there are a lot of those decisions that are going to be made in the LDR, the zoning plan, the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'development agreement, the site plan. So I look forward to capturing each of those pieces through each of those processes, including the number of affordable and deeply affordable and multifamily multi individual units. One of the things that I just wanted to say was the way that we think about community access for everyone, everyone has a say.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's equality. That's not equity. Equity means we're deliberately going out of our way, making it a part of our effort to capture historically underrepresented voices. And that's equity. And that needs to be 60% of a community process if it's 60% of the community.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I really do want to and I look forward and it was one of the reasons I'm I wanted to be in the seat right now from my prior job. That's that's where I want us to get to as a city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I worked hand in hand with CPD a number of times who, in my experience do want to do better and do make efforts to capture intentional information from the community members themselves. I've done those projects with them.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Everyone, every single project is not always the same. And so we've got to create an entirely different mechanism for community engagement. And I absolutely agree with Ms.. Guyton that it is through relationships, it's not through emails and fliers.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so all that to say, we have a lot more work to do and I'll be in it with you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Councilwoman Torres actually said what I wanted to say, but better. So thank you. The only other thing that I wanted to say other than equity and and that we're in the middle of the process, we're not at the end.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so I would strongly urge exactly what Councilwoman Torres had said about if it's 60% of the neighborhood, it should be 60% of the process. The only other thing I'd say is I live in Denver's perfect ten, which is obviously I'm partial.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But when I campaigned, I talked a lot about the 20 minute neighborhood, as in let's get beyond cars and let's get everything that a neighborhood needs to survive and thrive within a 20 minute walk right or role as in no cars.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I see this as an opportunity for a 20 minute neighborhood in in southwest Denver. And the reason why I like the 20 minute neighborhood is, first of all, climate change is real and we need to get out of our single occupant vehicles.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The second is this It's good for physical health for us to walk around and see grass and see the the buildings around us instead of see the the dashboard in front of us and the steering wheel. And then the third is it helps community.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It helps us grow as a as a neighborhood. It gives us a place to go and meet our friends and meet our neighbors and hold hands with our partners and walk her dogs. And and it sounds to me that Southwest Denver doesn't have that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Denver's perfect ten, has it? I'd like for it to be even better, but frankly, I would like that for everywhere, including District two, to have a place where there could be a the concept of a not the concept, but the reality of a 20 minute neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so I, I like the the plan. I like the idea. I want to make sure that the community is is included and engaged. And so, again, what Councilwoman Torres said, I would echo. So thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Hawkins. All right. Seeing no other nobody else in the Q. I'll just end by saying thank you to all of you for coming for sticking with us, and thank you also to the people who are here for the next one that we're doing after this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I really want to say thank you to my colleague, Councilman Flynn, who really, I think, went above and beyond for our community on this process. And just just.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Just thank you for everything. As I say, thank you to Clara Harris, who is one of my arsenal presidents. And as was stated, literally the name of the neighborhood is College View. And that's how important this site is to my community.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so for a year, just being in there at every meeting and involved and reporting back to the community and representing, you know, our community, thank you for that. I also want to say thank you to staff for all the hard work on this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This was not an easy process. And thank you to Mark for pushing pause and not developing. Just saying, hey, used by right, I'm going to go start building and building something that would not have been what the community wanted or would not have been good for.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Denver So thank you all around. As I've mentioned before, this is a very special place for me. This is the spot that brought my mother to Denver. It's the place my dad, Chairman Sekou, mentioned earlier. My dad literally went to the right of way heights and found his wife and picked her up.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'For their first.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Date there. And so this is a very special place for me personally and to, you know, to go through this process and to see and to see, you know, my mother's eyes just completely light up. When she found out that Pan Krisha, where she lives, was home for.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Her.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Her first home outside of the Midwest, where she came from, that it was going to be turned back into housing and affordable housing at that. So it's just been really great to see and I'm so excited to take this next step.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think it's a great plan. It's creating a community driven plan. And thank you to everybody who who got us to where we are. I'm excited to vote yes tonight. So, Madam Secretary, roll call.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Lang. I'm the owner of 16 a property at the corner of 17th and shared. I brought along the masters of the petition that we turned in. Never should have got it. This these petition has 102 signatures that support the rezoning.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And we captured those from many of of the people around town. And we did it all in four days. We got that many. If we would have had more time and started up this had this idea earlier, we probably captured several hundreds of them.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So anyway, the three of us or the three other associated parties or property owners, along with myself collectively formed an assemblage to pursue this rezoning and to have all the properties developed and sold as one assemblage. As such, we all participated in the mediation in response to neighbors input to reduce zoning.'",

And it's very important to note that this project goes if this project goes through and the rezoning is approved, absolutely no one will be forced from their home.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Lastly, homes concerns because this is not desired, desirable because there is not a desirable much needed tree lined sidewalk along Sheridan frontage arterial for a safe pedestrian environment. The alley is routinely used as a transit corridor between Colfax and Sloan's Lake Park by the homeless.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Because of all the neighbors across the alley on this block have six foot high fences and never use the all except for trash. There are totally oblivious to the excessive problem of the homeless.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. I am David Weber, the owner of two houses at 1640 and 1650 Sheridan Boulevard. And I'm one of the home homeowners who are applying for the reason I've owned these properties for 17 years and lived in the neighborhood for 26 years.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I grew up in Denver, taught high school geography for DPS for 25 years, and I'm well aware of the issues dealing with Denver's growth. As far as the rezoning goes, the neighbors of Zenobia and others have multiple complaints that can be boiled down to three main issues.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Size of the buildings, parking, loss of community. In my opinion, these issues have been addressed during a lengthy period of mediation where we went from a five story proposal to a three story proposal under the old blueprint Denver.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And when we did offer this compromise, we were rejected by the neighbors. Then in the advent of the new blueprint, Denver, we compromised again and went to a two building proposal. So two separate buildings, zoning to UMC two and UMC three.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We also added 1 to 1 parking, lowered the height of the building roughly equivalent to row house three. Then we limited rooftop and retail uses of the building and would add three bedroom units. And of course, we would have a 14 to 16 foot sidewalk built on the block.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'These compromises were also unacceptable to the neighbors, even though all of these compromises were well within the framework of the Planning Board's guidelines. It's obvious that true compromise is nearly impossible to attain unless we had offered row rowhouse zoning, which to me seems completely incompatible for a busy street like.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Sure. It's understandable that people dislike change. In fact, most of us, including myself, yearn for the good old days. However, this isn't the reality of the situation. The world isn't a static place. As I've seen, Sloan's Lake in the last 26 years become revitalized and vibrant in its outlook.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'However, it is also now debilitating, expensive, and this is causing established residents who live on a tight budget to move out. Surprisingly, the struggle to rezone our land has been met with many claims of the neighborhood's demise. We are miffed as to why we can't share the resources better or share again on Sheridan and adapt a new'",

Denver's currently considered one of the greatest cities in the United States, and that's partly because we have a forward looking planning board. I just hope our city is agreeable to sensible change, and I hope the city sees this.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Zoning change will help preserve our diversity through mixed use, smart use and the best use to create more complete neighborhoods. The 20 minute neighborhoods, so to speak. And I believe we can continue to make Denver right again. I'm sorry, but your.'",

        "'speaker_12': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Members of council. Good evening. I Bruce O'Donnell at 770 Sherman Street and I'm the applicant's representative on this rezoning request. My old friend Jennifer Moulton, the former city of Denver planning director, taught me that cities never stay the same or remain constant.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'They are always changing. Cities either grow or shrink. Both growing and shrinking come with challenges. Cities that continue to shrink begin to die. Look at the aptly named Rust Belt cities. Denver's a growing city. Our city plans recognize and plan for inevitable growth.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'The most important of these plans is Blueprint Denver, which is adopted a short five months ago by city council with substantial neighborhood input along this stretch of shared input from immediate neighbors, many of whom are here tonight, resulted in a blueprint.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Future land use designation of urban residential low medium with building heights up to three stories. The community's voice was heard and has now adopted city policy. The requested combination of UM's two and three zoning is an exact fit for this blueprint prescribed future land use and is an appropriate implementation step of blueprint.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'The combination of UM's two and three was crafted in direct response to neighborhood input, keeping the overall scale and future development compatible with the surrounding context, especially when compared to our original application for five story zoning over a year ago.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'In addition to honoring the community input to reduce building heights through zoning, we have also been responsive to neighbors by directly incorporating their input into a protective covenant and deed restriction that has been recorded with a Denver Corcoran recorder and runs with the land.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'The Covenant reduces building heights below. What is allowed in zoning, requires two buildings, requires a parking minimum, prohibit specifically requested and unwanted uses, requires three bedroom units in limits the uses on rooftops. These restrictions and requirements assure better compatibility with the neighborhood and surrounding context.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'An unfortunate result of shared and being a jurisdictional boundary in Denver's edge is that shared and has long been ignored, making Sheridan a forgotten place to include not having a sidewalk on a blueprint identified mixed use arterial in an RTD bus route.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'This rezoning can correct this, bringing eyes on the street along with amenities. This rezoning creates a chance to bring this block of share and it into Denver rather than continue the edge condition that backs itself up to Denver because Denver can't stay the same and it will continue to grow.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And because Blueprint tells us what type of growth should occur here, and because this rezoning meets the criteria established in Denver, Denver's Zoning Code Section 12 24.10.

        "'speaker_9': 'And from.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Any place. So you're going to have this enormous traffic jam on those streets. You're just going to have all these these cars trying to get in to this area. And although I know people are saying, no, people don't really need so many cars these days, the reality is, and you'll forgive me, but the kind of people who'",
        "'speaker_8': 'can afford to live in these kind of housing units, people who are coming into our neighborhood, they've all got cars. They have two cars per person, per per couple. And there's a lot of traffic and there's a lot of density.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And it makes it a place where you cannot safely let your children play. And that is a shame. I raise my children in this neighborhood and my daughter is trying to raise her children in this neighborhood. And I'm very afraid that without you to stand up and protect us and our community, that that will not be able'",
        "'speaker_8': 'to continue.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And next up, Joel Unger.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening. My name is Joel Unger. I live at 4930, West 17th Avenue, Corner Yates, a block away from the property under properties under question. Our family has lived there since 1969. I'm here to speak against the application.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And primarily because this property is a substandard, defective property. And I'll explain why. You can access it on foot or by parachute, but it's hemmed in on all sides. Sheridan with its traffic, with its noise and its fumes as on the West Side, 17th Avenue, which is now overburdened with traffic.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If you have an idea how bad 17th Avenue can get, just think of what it looks like after a Bronco game. Well, the 17th now, all the people running to King Soopers and target and the population increase on the east side of Sloan's Lake AV overburdened 17th Avenue.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So you can't really access the property to or from 17th Avenue, particularly with all the traffic turning in from Sheridan, Zenobia is blocked off by the residents, so the only egress or entrance is any court, which is a small street to the south end of this property.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That street, if you come out the alley on to Annie Court, if you make a right, turn your right into Sheridan, you can't go from any court, the Sheridan, without losing your front end. Cars are whizzing by at 35, 40 miles an hour.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The only choice you have is to make a left turn and go to the Zenobia where you can't go north, because that'll take you into 17th. So you can go south to Colfax and in Colfax you can't get across Colfax.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's an obvious you can only go west. If you want to go east, you have to wend your way across till Wolf where there's a light where you can access Colfax and go east. This property is ill suited for high density.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's not that high density is a bad idea, but this property will create all kinds of difficulties and consequences. And therefore I.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Urge the council to reject it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you. Next up in a do it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening, City Council.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm on a date with a teacher and Denver resident. Today I'd like to discuss the super majority vote. What's undoubtedly necessary for this rezoning to pass.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'A super majority, I feel, is a tool that allows.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Affluent property owners more power than less affluent property owners. So what is a super majority? Well, its very nature is, I believe, classist and racist. The voices of renters are.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Completely left out.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And a renters opinion isn't even taking in consideration.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In this process.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And because of historical injustices.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Black and black.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And brown residents are far less likely to be homeowners in Denver than white, affluent residents. Moreover, more than half of Denver's residents are renters. Renters outnumber homeowners, and their numbers are growing. So when a neighborhood disperses, a supermajority petition whose voices are taken into consideration.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'When you dig even deeper, you realize that the term neighboring property owners.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Doesn't mean the amount of people. It means how big the property is that that owner.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So, for example, in order to push a supermajority, you need signatures of 20% to 20% of the total land owners within 2200 feet of the property. Meaning that if I own a larger property than you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'My vote matters more. So not only the supermajority not taken to the point I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Not take into consideration the voices of renters, people who are typically younger and less affluent.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It takes into entire another step and listened to the voices of large landowners more. America was founded by white landowners who gave only a vote to, shockingly enough, white landowners. The supermajority policy.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Does the same. It is vile and it must end.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Move those obstacles. End this practice once and for all. And to all of us here, I know the change.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Can be frightening. But if you think change is scary, consider the status quo. We are destroying our earth for our children, and we must change our ways. One way is to reduce our carbon footprint as an entire city.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'a need for additional housing and that is indeed a moral imperative. But there is a conflict of moral imperatives. Operating here is also a moral imperative to address those needs in the context of orderly and esthetically compatible architecture and density and consideration of the adjacent neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And there are long term residents. Previous discussions with the city were consistent with this principle regarding the appropriateness of, quote, a low scale multi-unit residential mixed with one and two residential uses, unquote. This is much more in-keeping and compatible with the adjacent established neighborhood spots.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Owning this strip with its most difficult and limited vehicle access is really quite unnecessary in light of other vacant properties closer to the light rail, which are already zoned for higher density. It would be a very damaging precedent to rezone single family lots to a high density development.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'This would establish an economic pressure that will diminish the number of single family residences and increase the value of those that remain, making them even less affordable. This would seriously damage our neighborhood of large families of very modest income.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Our congregation is more than 50% underpaid teachers. The large number of families surrounding Colfax Elementary School, also of very modest means, would also be threatened by setting this precedent. We would sincerely hope that the esteemed members of the City Council will review and reject this request in light of these very strong conflicts.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It is our hope and expectation that you will have the best interests in mind of both the existing residents of the neighborhoods and any new residents of the proposed development who will be much more comfortable in a lower density setting with two or three bedrooms similar to the previous application that you just overwhelmingly approved.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'and cannot have on street parking today. Finally, the scope and intent of Main Street zoning is is clearly not just to build an apartment with the leasing office yet that is the concept the applicant presented to the neighborhood for apartments.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'In this residential neighborhood, there are better conforming multi-unit residential zoning codes and the planning board agreed with that. But there is no developer here attached to this and the applicants told us they were not even entirely committed to sell the properties together.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'This would be granting significant extra entitlements, but with no plan for what comes next. This is an idea that members of this Council have specifically rejected in the past. During mediation, Mr. O'Donnell boasted he would get this passed without any neighborhood or R and or support if he needed to.'",

        "'speaker_11': 'I could talk about, you know, why dense urban housing is good for the environment, that it decreases the overall footprint, allows people to live close, sort of work closer to where they shop, make more trips on foot by bike and be close to transit, especially on a arterials such as Sheridan.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'We don't have the option of just picking up and moving. While I understand that nothing stays the same, I strongly objected to gross abuses of developers who leave neighborhoods unrecognizable and overpopulation in their wake. They are not stakeholders in our community, and many of those who spoke tonight are not either.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The stakeholders in our community are coming from other areas who don't really understand what not that we're against density or change, but what each piece of change, what that does to our community. Their greed and desire for more of what drives their wishes for zoning changes is what's going on.'",

Our community appreciates a newly adopted plan which establishes goals to preserve the authenticity of Denver's neighborhoods and celebrate our history, architecture and culture, unquote'",
        "'speaker_4': ', and to, quote, embrace existing communities and their cultural assets, unquote. We are a community geographically rooted here because of our institutions. Yet, as high density development increasingly expands from Colfax Avenue into the adjacent low density residential neighborhoods, it threatens to dismantle this lovingly established century old community.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'When in negotiations with the applicant, we discussed a plan, an idea in which we could have the applicant work with us to meet our housing needs. It was suggested by the councilwoman who organized that meeting to consider 25 to 20% of the apartments.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That would be three or four bedrooms. Meeting the need of the current community. The response by the applicant, which was termed as a compromise, was 3%, three bedroom housing. That's not compromise. That translates as one or two units of three bedrooms.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's not a compromise. That's insulting. The adopted plants identify this neighborhood as both vulnerable to displacement and lacking in the missing middle of housing options.

It's been an evening and I. As it happens with most people, I think I started paying attention housing when I bought a house.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'I started paying attention in the streets at the same time. You know, how do you get in between the houses and the places you want to go? I became passionate about cities and how they work. This rezoning that's being requested at the up to 2 to 3 stories of Main Street, I believe, is a really good idea'",
        "'speaker_13': '. I urge you to vote for it. 2 to 3 stories. Main Street zoning is the most pedestrian friendly we have. If you're going to try to encourage mode shift, this is the way to do it. Forcing more parking into it isn't the right way to do it.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'But like was said earlier, compromise. I know it's difficult for people to imagine that cars aren't necessary to get things done, but when you live across the street from a park and a grocery store and hardware store and a home goods store and a beer store.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Heck, I don't. I wouldn't. You don't even need a bike at that point. You can just walk across there and get everything that you need. The the the the I mentioned the way cities work. 86% of Denver is dedicated to single unit residential.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And that form of zoning requires well, it doesn't require, but it makes it really difficult to live without a car. And that's too much of our city to try to force people into cars. There's no more room on the streets if we are to get the mode shift we need, we need the density to support the transit'",
        "'speaker_13': '. It helps that this particular rezoning is along. Sheridan and two blocks off of Colfax are the main Premiere. I consider a transit way and hopefully will be upgraded one day, but we have to be able to to to have the population to support that transit.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'I find it curious. The last speaker said that he wants young families to move into the neighborhood, but you have to have a place to move them into and there are no more single family houses being built there.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'You can't, you can you can only replace them. So if you want a place for young families to be, you have to have units for them to move into. Not to mention that, you know, couples and singles and transients need housing, too.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And we keep falling further and further behind. Every year in Denver, more people move here, and we still aren't building enough housing in order to house everyone. And we need to do something about that. We keep trying to scrunch it all down into a smaller space as we can, and you can see what it's done to, you'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Denver has worked hard to put into place various plans for redevelopment in order to meet the demands of a rapidly growing population. Within these plans, one focus mentioned is equity. Our society today spends a lot of time talking about inclusion and diversity and protecting minority or at risk segments of the society.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I would ask the Council to take into account one such minority community located in the West Colfax neighborhood where the proposed rezoning would take place. The West Denver Jewish community is made up of over 100 households, all within a geographic area of a mere half square mile.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The cultural practices within this community include active involvement in the various organizations belonging to this segment of the population, including multiple daily services and classes, the local synagogue, ongoing classes and services at the Adult Learning Center, two active high schools that draw students from around the globe and many others.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There's a prohibition of driving on the weekly Sabbath and holidays, which prevents this community from being able to look at housing options outside of this small geographic area. There is much infrastructure in place for this community, which has been active in West Denver since the 1880s, along with the needs of housing close to these Jewish community centers'",
        "'speaker_2': '. The housing needs of this population requires larger units than the average requirement of the surrounding area, although the average household size in this zip code is 2.9 persons. Over 11% of the households in this area are made up of six or more persons.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'With these larger household sizes being average within the Jewish community. Because of the intergenerational focus of this community. Many children desire to remain in the neighborhood near their parents when moving out and starting families of their own. However, these families need more than a studio one better two bedroom apartments in order to remain long term.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Despite this need, less than 1% of units in this neighborhood are larger than two bedrooms with the proposed units.

This ignores the needs of this minority population while adding to the traffic congestion and lack of parking that already characterizes this section of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the neighborhood. The concern with this rezoning is not only the houses that would be torn down, but the precedent that would be set allowing other low density housing needed by this minority population to be resold and replaced with high density housing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm a single woman and currently rent an apartment two blocks from the properties under discussion. I have rented in over a dozen neighborhoods in the Denver area in the course of my adult life and can testify to the unique nature of this neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In addition, my family has been in Denver for over 100 years, so I have a vested interest in seeing this neighborhood retain its character and to make sure that I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Heard that your time is up. Thank you. I don't see Chairman Sekou. All right, Tovah Zuckerman. And then I'll call the next five. Okay. Next last three. Dan Schorr, Jesse Paris and Daniel Krauss, if you want to come up to the front.'",

I have many friends who would like to be able to buy homes but have been unable to do so because of the prices and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'limited housing stock. Some of my friends have moved away because of the housing situation. We are not a wealthy community. We are interested in living in single family homes in order to have space for our families. My husband and I have a relatively small family of four children.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Some of my families, some of my friends who have managed to buy homes in the area have eight or nine children. We need the arts for kids to play in and streets that are not overly full of heavy traffic and will be safe for children to cross.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Apartments do not work for us. I have heard that building more smaller units will make the price per square foot in the neighborhood even higher, causing the prices of homes to go even higher. Rezoning single family homes for apartments will cause.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'A number of single family homes to go even lower. I am very proud to be living in the neighborhood where my husband's great grandparents and grandparents lived. If rezoning in our neighborhood continues as a trend, our community will be displaced.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'And main streets. And it really works toward completing a complete.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Street network that we're is is painfully absent, particularly in this location with no sidewalk. And we're also afraid about the lack of of attainable housing, especially as you've heard about this neighborhood. Gentrifying does not, you know, is dwindling.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And this would, you know, at least provide some opportunity for some of that stock to come back. And then, of course, we're a business improvement district. And we believe that building a vital pedestrian connection and creating a broader network of infrastructure.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'To serve, that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The entire community, commuters, everybody who's living and walking and shopping is really beneficial and not just for the business community, but really for everybody in the community. And in fact, you know, many of the speakers here opposed tonight are very much you know, we've been working on making Colfax a safer place to walk across and beyond.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And of course, that's something that a lot of people here, even opponents of this rezoning also are seeking. So there's a lot there is some commonality there. I think that what we are seeing tonight is that change is difficult.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And unfortunately, I think that sounds like there was an effort to make this housing, this potential site, a this site a potential place for the Jewish community, you know, to accommodate the Jewish community by, you know, housing them there.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that didn't work, unfortunately. And so I think that it's a difficult thing. And then we're seeing that actually broadly in the city, that change is difficult. There's a lot of tension about development and housing. This is an example of one where there's not a developer, which is kind of unusual.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And but what I come back to is that on this in this location on Sheridan Boulevard, and some people have already referenced this, it's a somebody mentioned it to you did. So, you know, it's just a very it's not an easy site to to develop and build on.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so I just don't think that there is a realistic solution.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'To this.'",

        "'speaker_14': 'the property. And I was there for at some of the meetings, mostly observing in the in the mediation. I have to say that that did not include the community that was for neighbors directly, you know, the ones who petitioned, I guess, in protest formally.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'But the community concerns are legitimate. There is a very different dynamic and you're hearing about it. There are people ready to buy families, ready to buy homes. I can tell you very specific examples of, for example, a couple with a woman with multiples with M.S. and they want to buy a cross from the synagogue.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'And the home was advertised as a red brick Tudor with the original fireplace and wood floors, etc., and it was being marketed for a family to move into as a, you know, a number of bedroom home. Like it's typical in the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'There was typical in the neighborhood. And because of the four plex zoning, which was not intended, that was the duplex zoning that went awry that people were building these four plex. And largest concentration, as far as I know, is in the West Colfax neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'And those are displacing actual housing. In this case, that was an offer well beyond the expectation of the of the seller. And they're like, well, wow, a developer wants to buy this will raise you know, they'll raise the house and put four small vertical units.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Of course, someone is not going to live in a vertical unit like that and our families are not going to be able to live in homes that don't have the yards, don't have the bedrooms. And really, sustainability comes to mind because I'm very, very involved in green building and in the committee member for the adoption of the'",
        "'speaker_14': 'sustainable building codes. Now it's going to 20 into 2019 and the sustainability and the cost of new housing. When you're going to raise existing housing and build new, they're going to be more expensive and it's driving up the per square foot, even the cost of the existing housing stock, which is very limited in a very small area'",
        "'speaker_14': '. But it's certainly something that could be avoided if the it was appropriate, things were appropriately zoned. And I do think that the blueprint, Denver, the actual zoning and the new comp plan get it right and they don't call for a 50 foot building an m a main street building which doesn't respect the alley the same way there's'",
        "'speaker_14': 'there's issues with this trust. You know, there are issues. What I suggest is there's a neighborhood planning effort going on for West Denver and it's starting October 5th. If I could please implore.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The I'm sorry, but your time is up.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'To wait and have this thinking adjudicated as part of the neighborhood plan. I think it would be appropriate.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. That concludes our speakers. Are there any questions from members of Council Councilman Hines?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you, Mr. President. May I speak with someone from the Jewish community? I don't know exactly who to call, but if you could select someone. Awesome. Thank you. And I'm sorry, could you could you mention your name again?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Daniel Krauss.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Krauss, yes. All right. Thank you, Mr. Krauss, for your service to the city. Also, thank you for for coming here. Also, thank thank you. The Jewish community for for coming. I'm glad that we could do this on a time other than between Friday and Saturday night on Sunday on what is an era of.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'And most Jewish communities through the centuries have such a construction.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. Is this the only eruv in Denver?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'No, it is not. There's one on the east side. There's one on the on the southeast. And I believe the current community has recently also constructed one.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Is this recognized as a historic area or a historic district?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That's not my department, but I don't think so.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. As the city allowed you to use utility poles to demarcate the era.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We had to. It was an arduous process. The legal process probably took a year or a year and a half, and all of the utilities had to sign off and approve our use. Even the water department had to sign off and they were underground.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But yes, we do indeed either use the utility poles with their existing infrastructure or we are allowed to. As long as they are in the low voltage area, we are allowed to attach to the utility poles.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'Who is.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'Golda meir.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Meir, excuse me. Yes.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'Was it part of this area, this era or no?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well, I don't know if it was in the era of there was no Arabs when she was here, but the Jewish community was. There were 2000 families at one time, and it has since. And 13 synagogues, I believe 20 synagogues.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It has since shrunk. We are the only synagogue left. The oldest one, I think, west of Chicago.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The only synagogue left west of Chicago.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Left on the west side is congregations there. Abraham There used to be 20.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. And I apologize. I'm I'm learning quickly tonight, one of my aides speaks Hebrew and and is an American. But. But it was educating me when I was looking at my phone. I apologize. She can't be here physically.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'She was physically present earlier, but was trying to learn as much as I could as quickly as I could. And I. I might have more questions in a minute.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I appreciate your interest. I don't know. But, you know, I hope I was able to answer your question satisfactorily.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes, of course. I mean, I guess where I'm going with the line of questions is if this is a distinct area and it and and to preserve the air of this this new building might destroy the era of I'm that's where I'm trying to go with this.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You know.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I the average certainly runs up to that that alley. But we're we're very used to being having to respond to changes all the construction goes on. I worked with RTD for, I don't know, 15 years as they changed things around as there are pull hits or people take fences up and down.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So there's a reason I have to inspect this go around every week because we need to respond to change in that regard.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yeah. So. When we consider zoning requests, we as a city council, we have to follow a very narrow set of guidelines, but conformity with existing plans is one of them, and equity is the first metric in both blueprint and comp plan 2040.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so that's kind of my thought process. But I'll yield to Madame Vice President or President Pro Tem. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well, we do indeed have a vested interest that goes back over a century in the neighborhood. Historically, financially, educationally. And the area was just really one one aspect of that. And the very admirable concern you had for the Latino population in the last and that minority.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We would hope that you would look upon our needs in the same, you know, in the same light. Thank you for your consideration.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. Thank you. Councilman Hines, Councilman Sawyer.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Teresa, can I just ask you a couple of questions about the surrounding area? And so in your first couple of pages, as you're coming up, you mention in your staff report 44 letters of opposition.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm sorry, didn't you mentioned.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In your staff report 44 letters of opposition? It's on the page.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hang on. Well, I'm looking at looking puzzled because I thought it was while there were. I'm sorry. 46 total letters. One was an R.A.. One was in support. So I guess that's 44. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. 44 letters of opposition. And you sort of glossed over that and had said, hang on, let me just pull it up really quickly. Sorry. So it was it's nine. Slide nine. One letter of support, 44 letters of opposition.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then when when you were going through this slide, you just sort of glossed over it and said that those didn't count any more or there was something that had gone on around the mediation attempt. Can you explain?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Kind of. So those 44 letters of opposition are are intact in your staff. They're in the staff report. And those ones that are in there are intact. Okay, great. And then can we talk a little bit about the surrounding area and what sorts of transit options exist and what sorts of transit options are planned for that area'",
        "'speaker_1': '? You want to. Yeah. Go back to existing land use or.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah. I guess. Or maybe this is a question for someone from Public Works that I'm just sort of trying to figure out as I look at the maps what the and I look at Google Earth, what the actual transit options are that are there because to me, it sort of looks like there's Sheridan Boulevard where there are'",
        "'speaker_3': 'cars and there's 17th Avenue where there are cars.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Um, 17th avenue where there are cars and bus and bus. They're shared an avenue where there are cars and bus lines. There are two complex avenue where there are several busses.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, right now it's like seven, several blocks down. So I'm just looking at the immediately surrounding area. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So there's a bus line on 17th and there's, as I recall, and somebody checked me, I thought there were at least three bus lines on Sheridan.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And are those planned upgrades? Are there are there planned upgrades? Is that a high capacity corridor that's going to give.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It in a high capacity corridor?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. And it's one of the ones that's planned eventually to be built out to something else. Do we know?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I. Not to my knowledge, but it is a high capacity corridor and those are the ones we try and emphasize adding transit to. So it would not surprise me. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then without a is it typical to do a rezoning like this without a builder and without some sort of plan?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. We're only talking about an entitlement at this stage, so.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. I guess I'm a little confused because it was mentioned several times that it wasn't typical for this to happen without some sort of discussion of pulling out of a planning stage as well. So can you clarify that a little?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, yes. Staff is looking at this from the perspective of the entitlement. A lot of times the builder or the property owner is looking at it and what they might propose to build. And sometimes that feels like a disconnect, I guess.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah. Because I guess, you know, as we're talking about equity issues and we're talking about a very specific community of people who are looking for a very specific thing and have very specific needs, for example, to have separate countertops, to separate refrigerators, to separate dishwashers, to separate.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Right. If you're keeping kosher, you have to have completely separate cooking areas and prepping areas in your kitchen, which makes design and layout of something like a home, an incredibly intricate and different process that is very specific and has very specific requirements and very specific needs.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So it's it's very hard to have that conversation when there is no builder or design at all, I guess, and.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Maybe that's a better question for Bruce, but because I was not in on the discussions of what exactly was being built. All I know is apartment and I don't even know the number of units.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Sorry. No further questions then. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman Black.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I have a question for you, Bruce O'Donnell, please. So we've we've talked about letters of opposition, and then one of the applicants had a petition of people who are in support. So can you tell us about some of the support that you've had in the community?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I don't feel that people from the community who are in support of it came tonight.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sure, I'd be interested in hearing about.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Letters of support that are from that community as well as who signed that petition.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So we in have furnished in our in the official record and in your packets 12, I think it is additional letters of support from neighboring property owners. Two of them are from well, actually five of them I guess are from property owners within 200 feet who could have signed the protest petition but instead signed letters of support'",
        "'speaker_12': '. So they're in the immediate you know, they would be classified certainly in the immediate neighbor vicinity. And then the over the last weekend and I was not involved. You could ask Rick Lane, who kind of headed up the effort and one of the applicant property owners, but went to in the neighborhood over the weekend and gathered 102'",
        "'speaker_12': 'signatures in favor of the rezoning proposal.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Mr. Lane, would you mind coming up and telling us more about the petition, the signatures you got on that? Yes, please.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, we just wanted to find out what the interest was. With petitions to see how much support we could get. I was quite was quite surprised that we got a lot of support basically over the. I think we started on the 12th and we went through the 15th and most of those were I was obtained on the'",
        "'speaker_6': '15th. And we just simply asked people if they would support that. You know, we would support the rezoning of the low to medium density that we wanted to put on there. And we got a lot of response. A lot of people signed it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And did you go door to door?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'No, actually, what we for the. Well we did for some. Yeah, we started doing that and but Sunday there was a bazaar that was on Raleigh and there was a lot of people walking around. So we just stood in one spot and as people would walk by, we would ask them if they would like to support us'",
        "'speaker_6': '. And they would they would ask us questions. We answered the question questions. And we've got we got 102 signatures as a result of it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. Thank you. And do you live in one of these houses?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The corner house on 17th and Sheridan.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And are there are five houses or are. It's hard to.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There. There there are four.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Houses were houses and ah. Do you all occupy those houses. No. Who do. Okay. So before you sit down, so we've heard a lot from people in the neighborhood just east of this row of houses who it seems like everyone is part of the Jewish community.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Are any of you.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Part of that Jewish community?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'No, ma'am.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. Thank you. Fine.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Black. Councilwoman Torres.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. Chair. Hi, Mr. Darnell. Just a quick clarifying question. If there's no development or plan slated for this, can you clarify why? I've heard a couple folks talk about 3% affordable or some more specific language.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Sure. So it is correct that there's no developer. There's no development plan. There's no architect. There's no project in in my experience doing this work in Denver for about the last 25 years, that's actually quite common. And I've I've done a lot of that type of work throughout the city.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And so we've, as you've heard, spent over a year in community engagement and public outreach and mediation, working with a number of people that are here tonight. And we kept trying to craft restrictions and limitations and requirements into our proposal that in an effort to see if we could find come up with a compromise or a solution'",
        "'speaker_12': 'that would be acceptable to the neighboring community. And so that was unsuccessful, although the the commitments that we've said we would honor, we've lived up to by recording a covenant in a deed restriction against the property about a week ago now.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And so, for example, there is a requirement in there and it runs with the land that 3% of residential units be three bedroom, and that that is one of the requirements in the covenant. And it's in direct response to the input we got from the community in, in all of the components of the covenant collectively are our'",
        "'speaker_12': 'attempt to respond to the input we've received over the course of the last year in why that is good is that if when this property if and when it is purchased by a developer, they will inherit these obligations.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And and so the, the that portion of the community input that we were responsive to will be inherited by them. And in in they'll have to live with it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And the the covenant only covers.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Three bedroom layout. It doesn't cover price point or correct it.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'It covers a number of other topics. More on the development standard than the use standard side, but one of which is the three bedrooms. It also addresses height and parking and the number of buildings in the use of rooftops and all these many topics that we heard over the course of the last year or so.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Okay. Thank you. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Councilman Cashman.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Bruce. If you'd stay up there along those same lines, we also I think I heard something about 100 units or so.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So the application councilman is for Main Street zoning. And so there as I have said, there isn't a plan, there isn't a developer. It could be mixed use. It could be all commercial. It could be all residential. No one knows today.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'It is because of its location. It's likely. And what we've talked a lot about over the last year or more, it's likely that it is a multifamily site, perhaps with ground floor activation as is required in Main Street in if it is multifamily.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Our estimate is that this site in two buildings would support somewhere in the 80 to 100 units perhaps.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. Do you have any comment or about concerns over access and egress from the site?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Yes. So it most likely will be Allie served. Sheridan is a state highway and with limited access and then within the block to Zenobia there is limited space. And so one thing that was this was talked about quite a lot over the last many, many months or a year.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'One thing that's true is that none of the Zenobia houses take vehicular access from the alley. They all have front yard. Zenobia facing or any place facing driveways and garages. And so the alley today is used only for trash and recycling and utility type services.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And so, as I think we're aware on zoning situation, the access and those types of issues are not part of the zoning. They're addressed by public works at the time of site plan, but that it's it's likely that it's very reliant on the alley.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. Yes, Theresa. One question for you. Is this neighborhood going to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Can I correct one thing? Mr. O'Donnell said the zoning requires alley access if there's an alley.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. Thank you. Is this neighborhood part of the NPI initiative? It is. And when would you expect that to start?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's already started.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'They're already in the midst of it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The first meeting I think, was last week. The steering committee. The steering committee is. That's right. Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Teresa. That's all right. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Cashman. Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. President. So, Bruce, would you mind coming back up to the microphone? So did I hear that there was mediation on this site?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Yes. The city engaged Steve Charbonneau company to do mediation. And we had a over a period of many months, a number of meetings and back and forth.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so who were the community players that were involved in that mediation? I'm assuming this looks like the neighborhood group was at the table, but were some of these immediate neighbors?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The Jewish community part of that?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Yes. There's a number of people here this evening that have spoke that we worked with throughout that time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. You mentioned that over the last 25 years that you've been involved in doing the zoning changes that it's common to rezone without a site plan.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's only been happening since 2010 because prior to that, the the requirement and expectations of this body were looking at details of what came before. Wasn't just a zoning without plans for what was going to go on the site.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Well, I respectfully in my experience, I disagree respectfully. I reasoned the 80 acres at the Gates site in 2004 and five with a.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Robust planning process as part of that rezoning. It wasn't just a blanket rezoning without having some some clear. It also included, you know, discussions about obligations from that development to the community. That's all of.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'That. That's all true on the east side, on what was Cherokee. But I was on the west side. But anyway, I like to argue. But but ivory's on a lot of property in Denver with no no developer. And in fact, it's interesting it in particular a planning board today that for the past many years we're not allowed'",
        "'speaker_12': 'to talk about the specifics of a project or show design or anything like that, because zoning is all about is this zone district appropriate at this address?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, some of us are hoping to change some of that so they don't.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Play by that rulebook when it happens.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Understanding of what specifically we're being asked to approve, besides just looking at scale without seeing the details. And, you know, this has come to light with the 41st and Fox area.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilwoman and we.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Dressing those.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah we could get going on that discussion for a long time and the hours late, so maybe we could focus on this one.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Let me call up Rabbi Wasserman, if you wouldn't mind, if you're still here. Do I remember correctly that as part of the Sloan's Lake redevelopment, that the school at the corner of Colfax and Perry was replaced with housing that DHS is doing?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That was part of the Jewish school. And I don't remember if it was a land swap or but that in exchange provided some resources for the school to do additional improvements.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So that was it? Yeah, that was our dormitory, which was four blocks away from the school, which is on Stuart. And the idea was to create a contiguous campus and to have a were a boarding school to create, to build a dormitory on site.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So we had sold that property to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And what is the location of where the dormitory was built?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilwoman, if they would stick to this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's all part of the same neighborhood. So that's why I'm asking. A new dormitory?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes, a new dormitory is. And it is 1555 Stuart Street, right across from the Saint Anthony parking lot. Great.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. So that's within this same geographical area. Okay. Thank you. I just needed clarification on that. Can you just. I'm sorry. One quick question. What was the the scale of that? Is that a two story building? One story building?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Two story building.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And we had to fight hard, so.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. Let me see. I think I had one last question. No. I think I've covered them all. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman Cannick.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I was curious about Main Street zoning. I was looking. Theresa, this is probably for you. But, Bruce, stay close. I see that there's no comment from transportation. I'm really familiar with this area. I used to live not too far away.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I'm just curious about the practicality. If street activation is required, this is a.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Tough. Couple of blocks.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Like I've seen the strollers in Sheridan and the wheelchairs in Sheridan. And so I guess I understand we don't do site review, but at a certain level it would be very bizarre to be doing Main Street zoning in a place where it might physically be impossible to comply.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I'm just a little concerned about that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that's I think this is probably a Bruce question because he's been the one in discussions with transportation. But my understanding is that there is discussion with transportation of dedicating 16 feet for a detached sidewalk on Sheridan.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah. Okay, Bruce, if you want to come up, I guess a sidewalk only gets you across the site. It doesn't guarantee that anyone's going to use an activated space. I just, you know, I can't imagine personally myself walking and going to a shop or a a restaurant in this particular block of shirt and even with a sidewalk'",
        "'speaker_3': '. Right. The only people I've ever seen are people getting to the park or the bus stop. It's not a destination. So Main Street, to me, we're having a lot of conversation about density. I'm I'm not sure we have the right sound district, so that's what I'm trying to understand.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Sure. Thank you, Councilman. So we have there's been a lot of talk over a long time about improvements in the shared and right of way. And so Theresa mentioned to the sidewalk when when Councilman Espinosa was involved, he started an effort to see if as tied to the actual zoning, if 16 feet of right away could be'",
        "'speaker_12': 'dedicated to Sheridan because he thought there might be some bond money available that a sidewalk, a detached sidewalk in a tree line could be done immediately. And we agreed that we would pursue that. And then it just for a whole variety of reasons, it never panned out.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We we tried to work with the real estate department and also with public works. And so the the only real assurance of a detached sidewalk and tree line today would be just through the rezoning and through the development review and permitting process.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'The in regards to activated use and the in you're more concerns in the building. I agree with you that this is a difficult site there and we actually explored a whole variety of zone districts. We've inquired about a desire to do a Pudi.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We looked at Enmu, we looked at our ECS and CPD insisted all along that it be Main Street because of Sheridan being an arterial, a mixed use arterial pardon me. And also because of in particular the West Colfax plan.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And so the inn so we've we kind of got boxed in the main street and we'll have to figure out how to make that work. During the development or implementation down the road.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. So CBD, Theresa or if you can please come back up, can you please explain to me since you since it sounds like it was the department that insisted on this zone district, I get the idea of like a generic arterial and a generic location, but this actual site has an actual slope.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Even with a sidewalk, it's not a pleasant place to be on that side of it. And I'm just so sorry.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I don't recall us saying this has to be Main Street. I think that when we did the prep, it was a mixed use or Main Street. There was a lot of discussion with the council office, so it was sort of a pick, one of these kind of thing.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I guess the next question then for the applicants, so thank you is again, I understand we don't have a site plan, but we're having a very big late debate involving your whole community. And I'm not sure that what you're describing as what the zone district allows you to do is feasible.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So can you explain to me how it is that you are assured that you can fulfill this zone district? First of all, in terms of the Main Street and activation and secondly, why you set certain thresholds for what you could and couldn't agree to in, for example, like the three bedrooms, right.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Why? Why if you don't have someone testing the economics of this, why not? I mean, why who who is advising in terms of what the applicant. SA agreeing to or not agreeing to in the good neighbor agreement.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So we've that's been a big part of my role certainly. And then the I've worked closely with the applicant on all of that. And so, for example, with the three bedroom question, when this came up about a month ago, three weeks ago or so, we started researching it and looking into it and gathering a lot of data'",
        "'speaker_12': 'and information. And it I've learned through this information gathering that in the West Colfax and Sloan's Lake area and also in the downtown LoDo, Central Platte Valley, kind of Reno area, since 2014, about 12,000 apartment units have been built and about 120 of those are three bedroom.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So it's it's just a here under 1%. And in we learned a lot of market factors and market reasons of why that's the case. But we also heard that the community was interested in three bedroom units. And so we've talked about it and determined that doing three times what the market delivers is a step in the right'",
        "'speaker_12': 'direction on that. And and so there's, you know, real data and information backing that up.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There wasn't any feasibility in this site. There wasn't any testing of the economics or the design on this site.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'My last question. I guess maybe, you know, Daniel Kraus or if you prefer, the rabbi or someone else. You've posed an alternative, and I have to focus on the criteria, so I'm going to focus on the criteria. But you've proposed an alternative that we should not rezone this, which implies that if we did not rezone it, there'",
        "'speaker_3': 'would be housing opportunities for the community, right? That we're foreclosing opportunities if we do this. But I'm not. I guess I need to understand why you think not rezoning it would somehow result in something better for this community.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'What what evidence or analysis have you put into the fact that if this doesn't get resolved, it would in fact, provide the type of housing that you're you're curious.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'I very much appreciate that specific question because I was involved in Blueprint Denver as a citizen at the time, and there was concern about the community. And there was very targeted, specific areas of change identified along West Colfax, which everyone wanted it to be, become less blighted.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'And there was a transportation transit corridor at the gulch that would receive light rail that needed to change. And there was also the Saint Anthony redevelopment. So there was a very careful surgical, almost like saying, okay, this is what we want to preserve, because if we give increased entitlement to the single or duplex zones, we're going to'",
        "'speaker_14': 'essentially what we've seen already with the four plex, which was a mistake. But we're going to have homes razed literally the homes that we've lived in and people leave the community because eventually people do move around. And when they do, for whatever reason, they're selling to a developer to demolish a house that was lived in for 30'",
        "'speaker_14': 'years. That is perfectly can continue to be that. And we have very limited housing stock. So I do think that anything that encourages a developer to say instead of us paying market at Colfax because these lots are available on Colfax, we're seeing lots of these single I mean, that's what Mr. Sherman they were saying is that we're'",
        "'speaker_14': 'seeing 12,000 units, of which only 1% are what we need. Right? So we're seeing mostly what we don't need. And that is going up all around us. And it's been going up where it's intended by the zoning plan.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'And that is correct. And all we're asking is to not infringe and not invite people to look and say, well, I can offer less than market to people who can only sell for low density. And I'll tell them no, they can sell for more because we'll go to council.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'I feel very strongly that a neighborhood plan is on the docket. We should use that to do this through the city, not through this process, because this process has already undermined the community, just literally. It's not a risk that people have talked about.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'We're looking at, you know, a potential threat. No, this has happened. We have lost housing. And I must say that people who've come to me and asked, can I look in the zoning department whether they can use an established basement unit to rent so they can buy a home and they can have some income?'",
        "'speaker_14': 'They're being told, no, it's single family zoning. You can't. And that already has the kitchen already has access from the outside. They're being told they can't put up an Adu. So we would thrive from increased density. We could put 100 units in this neighborhood in an appropriate way easily just where it's intended through the correct process.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. One last question, Mr. President. So, Teresa, can you come back up, please? So can you just clarify for me the current zoned district, this is something I was CPD, by the way, would just do for every zoning, but just tell me what can be built currently.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then you mentioned the mixed use zone district. IMU was the alternative if they didn't go with the MZ, is that right? So I would just like a very high level brief summary of what else could be built on the properties in question under their current zoning and what can be built under means.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm actually did I not do a comparison in your staff report some of the different zone districts and.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well I see what the surrounding zone districts but.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay I'm just not sure because.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I have the options two and three summary of Zoning Request. If you let me know where to look, I can certainly go there. Slide six, I'm. Oh, I'm in the staff report. Oh, sorry.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Let me get my staff report.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'All right. So it's the site is us you see to and you are three a single in two unit residential. I just don't know exactly if you us we've got to we've got four parcels though so I don't, I don't.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. I'm just like if you were to say to me we have four parcels with four residences now under the current zoning we could get eight, you know, let me know that. Like that's where I'm trying to get bottom line.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, so the US you see two is single unit build an urban house two and a half storeys or 30 feet because that two is on there. The C two, you can also build an Adu, a duplex, a tandem house on corners where at least one of the streets is a collector or arterial.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So on Sheridan Corner, 17th Avenue Corner, you have that ability to build that 82 duplex tandem house. So bump up your density slightly with that you as you see two. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. I so yeah, we're we're we're neck and it's late. I just literally want to know, are the four homes that are there now if we maxed out the current zoning, we could end up with eight. We could end up with six.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Counting Adus. I don't care about height right now.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm just hoping you could do two at the corner there at 17th Avenue. You could actually do two at the other corner at any place there's already one of the properties is already a duplex, so that's six already.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. And then so the seventh one you do seven houses, a single unit. But then the actually I'm sorry because they let me get to this. I'm looking, I need to look at the existing zoning. So. It is.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The two properties at the end are this row house.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. So for the row house, though, you have the ability to build more because you can build row house, duplex, tandem house. You've got a variety of things you can build there. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then there was a little dispute about who insisted on Main Street or whether it was a choice.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There was a lot of discussion between the council office, the planning office and the applicant. And as I recall, there was discussion about the context. There was discussion about the zoned districts.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we probably want to sort all that out. So just between so there's the existing zone district and there's the main street that could end up with the apartment form and the 8200 units in between is the other zone district you mentioned that they could have gone to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Can you just say what that is again?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mixed use.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Right? You ask just can you give me the whole mix if.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, again, you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'M.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'X x. Okay. You could choose three five.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. So and then just let's just say it was the three. If it was a you x three for the whole, the whole set of parcels, what would be the potential number of units that in that zone district we'd be talking about.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I hate that question.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I know cos.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I don't know unless I know how it's being parked. Is it parked in a garage or is it being parked on the surface. Okay. Because surface parking takes up so much space, it really limits the amount of units you can build.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. And garage, if it's underground, I mean, it lets you build a lot more at the surface. So that's why I really hate that question.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Mr. President, I know that I am going for a long time, but this really is trying to figure out the criteria for my vote. So one last question to Mr. O'Donnell, please. You shared at one point that you saw it or someone shared me.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It might have been an applicant that the only thing folks would have been happy with is townhomes. Can you speak to why the applicants were not willing to pursue a different zoned district that was more of a townhome type approach rather than the apartment type approach?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Well, the you know, the the South and the very south end of the block is already zoned for row homes. And in so the there was in I'm not trying to argue with trees or anything, but there was very strong direction from CPD to pursue Main Street.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And so we got into that in in got locked into Main Street because of the plan support in the in the all of that and the the real desire of the applicant is to has been to prepare their property to be able to implement blueprint recommendations in in.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So we've been through this long kind of arduous path with mediation and on and on, and we've tried to craft it with the covenant and the deed restriction to be more sensitive to the immediate neighbors and the community given kind of the tool kit we were able to work with.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Kels on black.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I have a quick question.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think for you, Mr. Goulard. I think that's your name. So I'm very carefully listening to everyone's concerns and I feel like what I'm hearing is that there's concern that there's not enough housing for future generations. And so I'm.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Curious.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'These four houses are not currently occupied by by people from your group. So can you explain to me how disallowing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'New development there.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Changes the housing options for the people.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Who live in the community?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well, I think I the concern I vocalized was that the rezoning sets a precedent to be able to rezone single family zoning. I'm not familiar with all the code words and and and letters, anagrams, wherever they are. And that will make residential property therefore more valuable for raising and rebuilding and requesting similar zoning within the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And then more single family residences will evaporate from the marketplace. So, I mean, I remember a family that came here that lived in five basements before they could find a house to rent. And and there are property owners in the community who rent below market to be able to attract young people to stay here.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I think the logic is that if we don't oppose this rezoning, we set a precedent that will spread just because of the economic incentive to other residential areas, which would be harmful to us and would also be harmful to other people of modest means who are not part of the Jewish community.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And my answering the question.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes, yes, you are. And so I know it's just one question, but Teresa, if you could answer a follow up question. So thank you very much. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Mr. Aguilar is concerned that this would set a precedent for a rezoning into the neighborhood. But is is there.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Plan support for rezoning those single family.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Homes to the east of Sheridan?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, I guess I'm a bit puzzled by that, because the reason we're supporting Main Street on on Sheridan is because it's it meets the criteria. It's an arterials street. The Main Street zoning talks about being on that sort of a linear situation like that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I don't think that we'd support going into the residential with Main Street because Zenobia is not a Main Street. We would we consider that the whole point of blueprint is that our arterial streets are where we push the density.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We wouldn't push it to a zenobia street.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Black. All right. Seeing no other questions, the public hearing for Councilman 577 is closed. Are there comments by members of council? Councilwoman Sandoval, this one is in your district. Did you want to go first?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Sorry, I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Sorry, I was looking over some notes. So I just want to say that. I don't like sitting here tonight at 1145, having neighbors who I represent pitted against each other. It doesn't feel right. It's really unfortunate.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I remember when this application came in. And I'm going to counter what CPD said. Councilman Espinosa wanted the sidewalks dedicated, and he would have done anything possible to have those sidewalks dedicated. I don't think any person in this room can say different.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'He made that known throughout his whole campaign. He made it known everywhere. And so that's what Councilman Espinosa wanted. That was his will. And so if that meant it was Main Street, that meant it was Main Street. Now, in my councilman Espinosa.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'No, I am not. So when this came to our office, I saw the writing on the wall because it was actually a five story rezoning application and blueprint. Denver was going on the updated blueprint Denver. And we were working robustly in all of our neighborhoods to make sure that the map that was adopted was reflected from the'",
        "'speaker_7': 'work of the people. And the map that was adopted from the work of the people in this neighborhood actually changed the plan support from five stories down to two and three, because that was the will of what the people in this neighborhood and the registered neighborhood organizations wanted.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I'm sitting here and as I was, the reason why I wasn't paying attention right now is because I was looking through the MSA zone district. So I like zoning. I think it's pretty clear on what you can do and what you cannot do.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So if we were to pass this rezoning, we could have duplexes, we could have tandem house, we could have row house, we could have townhome, and we can have an apartment for them. And then we could also have a drive thru service on the corner of 17th and Sheridan.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And the most interesting thing that I find in this is that the general intent of an EMS zone district is to improve compatibility with and respect for the existing character and context of Denver and its neighborhood. Give prominence to the pedestrian realm as a defining element of a neighborhood character.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I could go on and on and on. And I will tell you one thing. Chardon is not a pedestrian neighborhood. Sheridan is scary. Sheridan from Colfax to 17. People cannot walk. They push their strollers in the right of way.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Nobody can get there. It's a transit quarter. So I do not agree with the fact that we are going to mess. And I will agree with Bruce that that was forced upon us by community planning and development, because as many of you know and as many of you, especially you like Robin and Debbie, have you ever heard'",
        "'speaker_7': 'KPD say that the council office got to pick a zone district? Now you go in front of community planning and development. You do your pre-application. I have done them for council members. They push you into a zone district and then it's your job as the applicant to come up with the five criteria that meet the rezoning.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I will I thank you, Bruce. I know that that is to be true. I also know it to be true that this neighborhood does need more development. You. The Jewish community is suffering. It's sad. I feel sad that you all are being pushed out.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I also understand that if this were to get rezoning, we might find a developer who might do more bedrooms. We're not thinking outside the box. We're looking at the application before us, which is very challenging. And before I go on, I just want to for those crazy people who are watching at 1145 at night, I want'",
        "'speaker_7': 'to talk about what's called a supermajority. It's not called a supermajority. It's called a petition protest. And that is what this neighborhood did. So anyone can have a petition protest. It could be in a minority neighborhood, which I actually think the Jewish people in this neighborhood considered are considered a minority.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So thank you for owning your homes and thank you for doing the hard work to get a petition protest done. It's not easy. It's been happening. It's in the Denver zoning code. And so, Ana, I do not agree with what she said.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I just had to go on the record and state that I actually do believe that the Jewish community in West Colfax have been a minority. For as long as you all have been there. You have not been the majority.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So in that vein, I have been sitting here vacillating back and forth. What do I do as the councilperson? What is my role? And I think I have to go back to my values. I have to start with my values.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And my values are that we need more housing in northwest Denver and we need more opportunity in northwest Denver. And we need developers to look at this. Yet at the same time, I do not believe that we can use our housing as a Swiss Swiss bank account.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I don't agree that you can just suddenly have three land owners. What if one wants to sell and the other one doesn't want to sell and then these three parcels get broken up or four parcels get broken up.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There's no guarantee that this is and we've moved forward in one section. So I just have to go back to EMS, provide human scale and buildings through the use of detail, contrast form windows, doors, placement, provide identifiable pedestrian connections between private development, public right of ways and more time modes of transportation.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So in that vein, I will have to vote no on this because of the mess, and it just does not match Sheridan. And I just want everyone to know I hope to never be sitting on this site again.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I was elected July 15th, running on the fact that hopefully I can be a good facilitator. And I just want you to know I feel guilty. I was in the council office when this came through. I attended the first meetings to establish a working group, a task force.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I thought it was going somewhere. I left the office in November, and I am sorry that you didn't have the representation that took you forward to get this done. I think it could have happened. I really do. And so I feel disappointed by what has happened.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I feel I take accountability and I take responsibility for that. But thank you all for staying here this evening.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman Hines.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I'll just be brief. I you know, the first metric for both Blueprint 2019 and current Plan 2040 is equity. And I want to make sure that we provide an equitable solution here. And I am a bit troubled by considering equity with this particular rezoning.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Why is this rezoning better than the original zoning? I'm not certain I know that particular because we don't have an immediate developer in, you know. Waiting for this rezoning. The M's form troubles me a little bit as well, which has already been discussed.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And the final thing is, well, two more things, I guess. It sounds like there's a robust stakeholder process that has just started or will start on October 3rd. So either way, it seems like we've got something in front of us that in the very near future that will have a lot of comment that will affect this not'",
        "'speaker_9': 'only these particular plots, but but also the area for this particular Jewish community that would allow them for a lot of them, with with more comment. And the last thing I would say is, please, if you're going to have a stakeholder process, allow them to have some at least some of them to happen, not on the Shabbat'",
        "'speaker_9': '. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman. Councilman Sawyer.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I also am going to have to be a know tonight. I am very concerned about the public safety issues with this rezoning, not only because I think as we delve further into this, it it is the wrong zoning district.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's not. There's something very wrong here. But also because we've got you know, we're talking about 80 to 100 units added on a parcel of land to get a sidewalk, it seems like, which doesn't make a lot of sense, logically speaking, you know, and we're talking about adding density to a community of people who, yes, need a'",
        "'speaker_3': 'sidewalk so that they can walk around the community. But the trade offs there don't seem to make a lot of sense. There's just the disconnect here. It's just not it's just it's not. Something is wrong. And so I think that the there are just the safety implications of what we're talking about here and the public welfare implications'",
        "'speaker_3': 'of what we're talking about here. Just don't add up. And I think that unfortunately, that means going back to the drawing board. And I'm I'm you know, I'm sorry for that because I think that you guys are really the victims of a mistake in our planning board or, you know, in CPD somewhere along the way or in'",
        "'speaker_3': 'a disconnect in our council office somewhere along the way, I'm not sure, but it stinks. And so I think that that I hope that you will go back to the drawing board and find something that works better and come back and I'm sorry that you had to stay this late at night for that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I do think that we have a responsibility to our community as a whole to make sure that the decisions that we make, especially when it comes to zoning, do make sense for public safety and welfare. And this just simply doesn't.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I will be a no tonight. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilwoman Torres.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I just want to mention a couple of things. Yes. The West area plan kicks off on Saturday.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'October 5th.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That won't be the only opportunity. And I guarantee you, Councilwoman Sandoval and I, because we share the West Colfax neighborhood, will absolutely make concerted efforts to find times when your entire community can weigh in on the West Area plan.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I guarantee you that. One thing that I would mention, though, is that what I'm finding in a number of other neighborhood conversations that are preparing to enter in that West Area plan, they're already thinking about how do we proactively plan for density so that density doesn't happen to our neighborhoods, to the communities that we live in without'",
        "'speaker_3': 'kind of our participation or our say, how do we proactively zone? And so those are conversations that Villa Park is having, that Westwood is having, that Varnum is having. And and those are going to be some of the things that will filter into the West Area plan as you go farther down.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sheridan You find a mix five mix eight m2, and so you do find density. This is where density should be on Sheridan Boulevard. And I'm compelled, though, that we've lost an opportunity for better conversation here. I would say that in all of these options, Main Street seems to be one that would protect the interior of your single'",
        "'speaker_3': 'family home neighborhood. And that's one thing to consider among the variety of options that could encroach farther in Main Street would only be on Sheridan. So I'm I'm struggling a little bit with the direction, but I know that there'll be a lot more opportunity to figure out.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'What happens in West Colfax. And and and I'll support the community in a lot of that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I got to know this community very well. About 13 years ago when I was at the Rocky Mountain News and RTD was going to start construction of the West Rail line. And that's where I became familiar with your roof.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I walked past the A Mikva that's there on Equipment Street, I believe, and that's Beth Israel and the boys school there. Who the name of which escapes me on the north side of Colfax talked to this is the the the home not only of the west side Jewish community, which as I discovered, was vastly different from'",
        "'speaker_6': 'the east side Jewish community, but also for over a century had been very well integrated with the Latino community as well, side by side everywhere from lower Colfax, down by the old Starr Bakery, all the way west to the Jefferson County line.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I learned so much about these communities living together for decades. And I'm very appreciative of that, of knowing that heritage and hearing some of it come alive again tonight. Thank you. Because of that and because of the testimony I heard from that community, I think a strong case has been made that criteria three has not been met'",
        "'speaker_6': ', that this does not further public health, safety and welfare because of the impact it has on the character of the community. One of the directives in Blueprint Denver is that while we grow intentionally and carefully, that we pay attention to conserving and preserving the character of our diverse existing neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They're very different all over town. You will find neighborhoods that have different character. We talk about building complete neighborhoods, but those neighborhoods are all they all have their different character. That doesn't mean they all look have to look alike.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so I don't think I can support this tonight because I think it fails on criteria three. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Flynn, Councilman Cashman.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yeah. Thank you, Mr. President. I also have concern about I have concerned about criteria one and criteria three as far as adopted plan. If the city has decided that it's time for this neighborhood to have a new plan that is is basically already started, I guess the formation of the the steering committee.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I can't rely on a plan from 2006 as having much validity. And as has been stated with with such division, I think it makes sense to be more protective of health, safety and welfare to have that extended community discussion.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Now, there may be a bad news to all of that, depending on your point of view and where this planning process ends up. As Councilwoman Torres said, there's no guarantee you get two and three stories there. I would advise the community, if this does get voted down tonight, that you be very, very involved and do your best'",
        "'speaker_8': 'to get the the outcome that's best for this community. And the while it's not. Maybe it's directly related or not. I think looking to the future for all of our neighborhoods, an increase in the number of multi bedroom units.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Again, I think furthers the health, safety and welfare of the community. So I'll have to vote no this evening.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Cashman. Councilman Black.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. President. This is a tough one.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I agree with the comments of everyone has made tonight. I actually do think it meets the criteria, but I also recognize there are issues with it. And the fact that the neighborhood plan is coming is very compelling. We've had other rezoning similar to this over the years on Colorado Boulevard and other busy streets that neighbors have opposed'",
        "'speaker_7': '. But we spend an awful lot of time working on Blueprint Denver, and it does, as Councilman Torres points out, really does want us to put density on those commercial corridors. And that does not mean that it is going to go into the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Those are there's very different.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Appropriate plan, support for what would go on a busy.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Corridor versus what would go in a residential neighborhood. We can all count. And I think it's very clear that this is not going to pass tonight. As I said, I am I am torn. I do think it meets the plan's support.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I am going to support it because I feel like that is my job. But I'm I'm hopeful that you all will come up with a better solution. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman. Black Council Manager.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I was going to say two different criteria than some of my colleagues, which is the uniformity of district regulations. I don't think similarly situated properties that are on a sloped site like this can possibly meet the Main Street expectations for activation in terms of of just what we expect of a main street, you'",
        "'speaker_3': 'know, Tennyson as a main street 32nd and little even 25th in federal by Edgewater makes sense as a main street. I just think that this was a little bit overly broad and I don't think we would treat a similarly situated property property as a main street if it weren't just that it had been painted with that brush'",
        "'speaker_3': '. So I think it fails to meet the criteria, I will say. For me, it's not so much just about pure density. The only I rarely, you know, on especially on a thoroughfare, you know, vote against density. But the site matters.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And, you know, the one other site Colorado needs, Hartsdale, that I also voted against was for a similar reason. I will say in that example, the applicants did come back with a different proposal and were able to rezone to something that I think worked better for a very awkward site as as this one is.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I want to thank the applicants for for being here and for making your case. And I want to thank those who testified. I want to make clear that as persuasive as folks, folks, the story and the community cohesion is, it's the criteria that is the basis of the vote.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so that's that's why, you know, I'm voting this way. But I do hope that folks stay at the table. I guess I would disagree that you can't continue to talk while a new plan is coming. The current plans are in effect.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There's a lot of guidance in those citywide plans that are brand new. And I think that it probably behooves everyone to get certainty by continuing to talk than waiting for a two year planning process. So I might differ a little bit with my colleagues about that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I would suggest your position is best if you get to the table as soon as everyone gets some sleep and recovers and figures out whether or not with a little more focus on feasibility on the actual site. And I will say I'm I'm a little disappointed that y'all didn't get a chance to get some actual advice.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You have a ready made market for three bedroom units. Part of the reason they don't build them in LoDo is because three, you know, families with that many kids don't want to live in LoDo, but to look at that and make a decision about what's feasible in your market, you deserve site specific market information.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I would I would hope that if you are going to continue, you shouldn't agree to something you don't feel like is feasible. But I think you have a very different market for very different reasons in your site and you deserve actual feasibility from your site and not just some generic analysis of the whole city, including places'",
        "'speaker_3': 'like Reno, that are just not going to be applicable. So so I hope that you can get that so that you can come to the table and understand what's really possible for you all. And with that, I'll be voting no tonight.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Kennedy. Councilman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I just wanted to. Add that I think the biggest challenge with this particular site is the fact that it is very, very difficult to get a curb cut from court, from, you know, being able to access the site off of Sheridan, which means the traffic will come in on what was at any street'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and and then it would be through the alley. And I think that challenges the safety of the neighborhood. I heard a lot of discussion about people from the Jewish community having to walk down many of the alleys. And that safety concern, I think, is is real.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But we know that Sheridan needs sidewalks. This conversation should not be about sidewalks. We know that developments that come into the city have to provide their their own infrastructure. And so in this case, that would would have needed to be done.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I was right there with Councilman Espinosa before we even knew there was a reason application for this area. Fighting for sidewalks on this part of Sheridan, because it's on a slope where you see people walking in the snow with strollers or with children trying to traverse being that close to the bus and traffic that's on Sheridan'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Boulevard. So the safety concerns, you know, with this being a slope site really are somewhat concerning. But, you know, the city would have made sure those sidewalks were put in in in a way that could allow people to walk through there and do that safely.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I think the need for a curb cut to get access to this site is one of the biggest challenges. I've worked on some of those kinds of projects, and they're not always approved. And so that that makes this area even more challenging to try to develop on it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I'm not going to be supporting it tonight as well. I appreciate the work that everybody put into it. Thank you all for staying so late. I'm sorry. The previous process, you know, went went on as long as it did.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I think this is the right decision tonight. And there's plenty of opportunity to to look at the right way to do this. And I think the fact that the the area plan is moving forward really gives the opportunity to to look at the area a little bit more comprehensively and figure out how it all fits in'",
        "'speaker_1': 'together. So thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Ortega. Thank you all for sticking it out this late. Councilmembers is a reminder that community planning and development has determined a requirement for a legal protest has been met. Ten affirmative votes instead of the standard seven affirmative votes of council are required to pass this bill.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Madam Secretary, Roll Call.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sandoval Black Eye. CDEBACA No.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Flynn No.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'GILLMOR No.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'HINES No.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Cashman No.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Kenny Ortega No.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sawyer No.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Torres, I. Mr. President?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No. Madam Secretary, please close the voting. Announce the results.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Ten days to ICE.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Ten days to council. Bill 577 has failed depending on publication. On Monday, September 23rd, 2019, Council will hold a required public hearing on Council Bill 19 0913 designating 4345 West 46th Avenue as a structure for preservation. We'll see you in 9 hours for budget hearings.'"
