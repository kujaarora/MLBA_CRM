        "'speaker_1': 'I just want to say I'm in favor of this rezoning tonight. I need more. It's just a growing unit and we have a housing crisis. So the CSU darling units are most needed at this time. So any time this council is approving of accessory dwelling units, I'm all for it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. That concludes our speakers this evening for this hearing. Questions from members of Council on Council Bill 822. Not seeing any questions. I was going to give it a second there, Councilmember Flynn.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Which one?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'For this rezoning to A1 in the urban context.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm pretty sure we were just talking about that. We? Where is that? I think it's 37.5. She'll be.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Great.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I mean, she might need you to come up to the mic so you can introduce yourself. Oh, sorry.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. I just looked up here. It's 25 feet. Okay. And is there a minimum depth? I haven't seen a minimum lot depth on any of these other than in the suburban context for F1.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So this lot is about 125 feet deep.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I am not sure. But okay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'All right. Thank you. Thank you, Madam President.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilmember Clark, and agree that the rezoning criteria have been met and happy to support it as well. Council Bill 21, Dash 822 is on the floor for final passage. Madam Secretary, roll call on Council Bill 8 to 2, please.'",

The property is located between Loa Laurel Boulevard and Osceola Street along 46th Avenue, right at the corner of the alley'",
        "'speaker_0': '. The site is 5090 square feet and currently contains a single unit house. The applicant is requesting to rezone from U.S. you c to us ub1 to allow for an 80 u in the rear of the property. All other forms and U standards will remain the same.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The property is currently in the urban single unit season district, which allows for a minimum standard of 5500 square feet. As I mentioned before, the subject load is only 5090 feet, which means to allow for the construction of a detached you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It needs to be a reason to use you. Be one. That allows for a minimum. So a lot of 4500 square feet. As you can see on the map, most of the surrounding properties are also shown you, as you see with some others, you see one, two or so and a public park to east.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The current land use for the site is single unit residential and in the immediate vicinity of the area. Land use are mostly other residential uses. Shown on these photos. The character of the neighborhood is mostly residential. The subject property can be seen in the bottom right image of the slide.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Throughout the rezoning process, application notifications have been provided according to code requirements. Planning Board recommended approval on July 21st and a present. No letters have received from the public or a have received by stuff. Moving now to a Denver zoning code review criteria.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It must be found that the request map amendment is consistent with the five criteria. The first criteria is consistency with adopted plans. There are two plans with rezoning. The first one is comprehensive plan 2040, and the second one is Blueprint Denver.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'As stated in the staff report, the rezoning is consistent with several goals and comprehensive plan. This MAP amendment will promote equity by creating greater mix of housing options in every neighborhood, and it will lead to an environmentally resilient Denver by promoting infill development where infrastructure and services already in place.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Now blueprint the subject properties mapped as part of the urban neighborhood context. The future places map designates the subject property as low residential place type. Display stops have predominantly single and two unit uses, and accessory dwelling units are appropriate.'",
        "'speaker_0': '46 Avenue is designated as a residential collector. Street Street. Blueprint. Denver also provides guidance on when it's appropriate to rezone to us on districts with a similar minimum so lot size. It's appropriate when a pattern of similar loads with similar uses is present in the surrounding blocks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The block with the subject site shows a large proportion of properties that are under 5500 square feet, which would be consistent with the US be one district and a few lots that are larger than 5500, which would be consistent with the existing song district of us, you see.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Therefore, Stuff.co.nz considers there is a pattern of smaller loads with similar uses and the applicant's proposal to respond to a district with a smaller load so lot size is consistent with the future places map and blueprint guidance for applying the no residential future place type.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The growth area in Blueprint. Denver is all other areas of the city. These areas are anticipated to see 10% employment growth and 20% housing growth by 2040. Blueprint also includes specific policy recommendations. Housing Policy four focuses on diversifying housing choice through expansion of accessory dwelling units throughout all residential areas.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Stuff also finds that the requested zoning meets the next two criteria. The rezoning will result in uniformity of district regulations and will further the public health, safety and welfare primarily through its implementations of adopted plans. The justified circumstance for this rezoning is so severe that the plan, since the approval of the existing U.S., you see some district'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the city has adopted the Comprehensive Plan 2040 and blueprint, Denver stated throughout this presentation. The proposed rezoning meets the intent of this plan's. The proposed rezoning is consistent with the urban neighborhood context residential districts and the you as you be one zone district.'",

We have a housing crisis, so any time that this council's approving zoning increases, the housing stock, whether it's special units to granny flats, however you want to call that, I'm in full support, so please pass this to my good councilwoman, Amanda Sandoval'",
        "'speaker_1': ', for leading the way with these accessory dwelling units. I would love to see these in all areas of the city, not just in District one or just that simple. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. That concludes our speakers questions for members of Council on Council Bill 851. Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Madam President. Friend. Our next hearing involves a lot of properties on the same block asking for the exact same thing. And this one is broken out separately. And I'm curious, why are we hearing this separately?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, as you know, these are application driven applications. So this applicant had applied first. It just happened that they ended up in the same timeline. And also, they're a little bit different because this one has early access. The others don't.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we figured that. That makes a difference.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So this applicant had the option of being bundled with the others, but chose not to because of different circumstance.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, I know he could, but also he had applied before, so he wasn't sure that the other group was going to be able to coordinate everything. He's in a hurry to get the rezoning, so it just happened that they ended up being together.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But he had applied earlier in the process.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. And I think, Madam President, that was it. Except for. Let me. This is from C to B1 and ah, do you know what the minimum width and there is no minimum lot depth.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No that's only an F1.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Only F1. And there is no F1 in the urban context. No. Okay. Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilmember Flynn. The public hearing is closed. Comments from members of Council on Council Bill 851. Councilmember Sandoval.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilmember Sandoval and I agree that it does meet the rezoning criteria and we'll be voting in favor tonight. Council Bill 21, Dash 851 is on the floor for final passage. Madam Secretary, roll call on Council Bill 851, please.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Sandoval, I. Sawyer, I. Torres, I. Black. I see the bucket. I cut.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'My.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Friend.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I.'",
