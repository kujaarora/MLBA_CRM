        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. This is you know, when I first came on the city council, before we got inaugurated in 2011, a very large individual who we all know by the name of Wellington Webb said, You know, I can't even use his voice.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I was going to try and use this word for I can't do it. He said, You know, whatever, whatever you do, I really don't care. But it would be really nice to see the sister city relationships that we have, the 12 sister city relationships invigorated again.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'When I left office, it kind of fell off and so I began to do research and it was true. We actually had global offices all across the world. I mean, you know, Mayor Mayor Webb really believed in connecting with the rest of the world.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And he was probably a little bit ahead of his time because now the world is flat and globalization has happened and countries no longer trade. Cities do. And so this was a project that our office took on, and it happened to be the city of Nairobi.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we went on a trade mission to Nairobi, not knowing what the heck we were doing. And we went out there with, you know, when you do trade, it's not about the city, it's actually about the region. And so we had a CFO from level three, Sunit Patel with us.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We had some nonprofits. We also had Navin Dhiman, who was in the hotel business, and we went over there and built a relationship. With Nairobi. And on our first mission, I had a multimillion dollar investment with level three into Nairobi.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And it was just an incredible opportunity to understand and and exchange ideas around education, exchange ideas around economic development, exchange ideas around government policies. And I've seen firsthand how much the relationship works and is the launching pad to so many other issues and things.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So that's why I'm such a believer in Denver sister cities and we as a city don't invest that much into our Sister Cities program. But the return on investment is quadruple. And so I will always be an advocate doing budget season for Denver sister cities and and making sure that we do have that global reach.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we are talking to our friends and neighbors. I wanted to touch on, you know, Takayama was key in the in our inaugural flight and building those relationships. And I believe the mayor has has been. Has the mayor been out there, been out there to meet the mayor as well and as well as Aksum, Ethiopia, which as'",
        "'speaker_4': 'we look at our global nonstop airfare and we look at potential cities, most people don't know. But Aksum is a city that we are considering, and we have an incredible population of Ethiopians here in this region. And Africa is a sleeping giant economically.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so I think it is wise for for Denver to connect there one day. And so I thought I would I really only know a little bit of Swahili. I don't know the other languages, but I'm gonna try and just say hi in each of the languages and then we pass it on to my other colleagues.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But in Swahili, if you recall, you'll say near Haji. That means what's up? If you are just off the plane and you just can't go on a safari, you probably say jumbo. And if if if, you know, you have a little understanding about East Africa, you say Abadi.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And in Ethiopia, if you kind of green like me, you say Salaam. Salaam. Is that right? Okay, good. Shaking the head. And then everybody knows in Japanese. Konichiwa. So we are grateful to be to have relationships and we want to continue to grow them.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'He worked for my father, and over all of these years, my family has remained close to their family. Their children, their nephews and nieces have all come to live with us. They've lived all over the country and with my family members.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Here is the city of Cuernavaca, which I've also had the opportunity to travel to. And I can remember under Mayor Webb, we actually donated a truck, a fire truck to the city of Cuernavaca. And Councilman Hiawatha Davis was the one who brought forth the adoption of the city of Aksum, Ethiopia, to be added to the sister city'",
        "'speaker_5': 'program. So we've had long and rich history with these relationships with other countries, and I think it is important that we continue to celebrate and expound on those efforts so that we can. You know, it's a smaller world today than it used to be.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And our airport has played a major role in that process of bringing us all closer together and the fact that we have people where we can go to these cities and be able to reach out when we're doing expansion of direct flights and creating business opportunities.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I know with some of the communities in Japan, we've actually had some cultural exchanges where we have students from each city travel to both cities. And so those kinds of opportunities, I think, go a long way in building bridges between, you know, our country and our cities and those cities and those countries.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I think it helps work towards a greater appreciation of how to get along with one another. And so, Councilman Brooks, I want to thank you for bringing this forward and let's go forth and see how this can keep growing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Ortega, Councilwoman Gilmore.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman Espinosa.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Please add my name to this proclamation. And I'm just going to speak just because it's just coincidental. And I'm my butcher some languages in the process. But prior to entering council, I was doing affordable housing development, particularly in Stapleton.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And the models of the units that we're building are actually have derivations from the languages from all three of these cities that are recognized. So because of that coincidence, I'm going to go ahead and mention and we could be totally wrong in our research, but the models are Koti, Uchi and Bette, which.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hit all those generally those areas. I got some nods. And one of the other models since you mentioned Cuernavaca is also the CASA. And that was by design. We're trying to we were trying to make an inclusive product and bring introduce a little bit of diversity into Stapleton.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'A little bit more diversity into Stapleton. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman. Councilman Lopez. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Councilmember. Sponsoring the proclamation.

        "'speaker_1': 'And that's a good thing. The cultural exchange is good. When we when we look at the economic potential, that's a great thing. The fact that we can, you know, create nonstop plays of some of these countries is is outstanding.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But we mustn't forget that Denver has a very diverse population. And a lot of the folks who are our sister cities like Ethiopia, like the country, like like Mexico and.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Like.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Parts of Asia, you know, it's.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'They face discrimination. They face a lot of cultural barriers and and oftentimes violence. And I think it's important incumbent upon us as as we recognize our our sisterhood with these cities that and we we develop these relationships, but we also make sure that we strengthen life, strengthen and improve community life for a lot of the folks who'",
        "'speaker_1': 'are here in our country and call our country home. Although we as a as a city and county recognize this important relationship, there's still a lot of folks out there that don't. And a lot of folks economically and socially are still treated like second class citizens.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we have to make sure that when we develop these relationships. That they are also that we're also we also have their back when it comes to that as well. Too far, too many times I've seen a lot of folks who are taken advantage of because they are new to this country.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And despite seeing their flag here on the second and third floor in our city, there's still a lot of work to be done. And I think that's where this definitely helps. You know, I could think of a community in in Westwood where we have folks who live in come from different countries and didn't really talk.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Didn't really get along.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Were kind of siloed. But they are.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'One thing in common and that was gardening and.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The West Wood projects. And one of the things that we realized in order to break down some of these barriers, strengthen community, was to create a community garden. Or they all work together side by side and they develop this relationship.'",
