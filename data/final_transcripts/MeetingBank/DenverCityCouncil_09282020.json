    "A bill for an ordinance changing the zoning classification for 55, 65, 101 S. Colorado Blvd., 51, 97, 101 Colorado Blvd. and 98 Harrison St. in Cherry Creek. Approves an official map amendment to rezone property located at 101 Colorado Boulevard from G-RH-3 to G-MU-5, properties located at 98 Harrison Street, 97 Colorado Boulevard and 51 Colorado Boulevard from G-RH-3 to G-RO-5, properties located at 55 and 65 South Colorado Boulevard from PUD 56 to G-RO-5 and property located at 101 S. Colorado Boulevard from G-MU-3 to G-MU-5 (various districts to multi-unit, 5 stories) in Council District 10. The Committee approved filing this item at its meeting on 8-18-20.": [
        "'speaker_2': 'Uh. Two mailings to 400 persons who live in the neighborhood, both members of the Church Crazies Association and Nonmembers. 500 plus fliers were sent out with the mike to a survey, and there were multiple postings on social media.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'From that output, we got 228 respondents. A plurality favored the redevelopment plan and control run by Mr. Dick and the City Planning Department. With, depending on the specific location on the sites, 47 to 50%. Yes. In favor of the redevelopment and 37 to 40% no.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So definitely a plurality favor of the redevelopment. The primary reason given was this the sites have been vacant for many years and. Mr. McKinnon showed us development, illustrations and visuals which suggested that the authors would be breaking through.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you for your time and I appreciate your looking into this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, John. Treating treatment is up next. Sorry for mispronouncing name.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Tredinnick, but thank you. And my name is John Tredinnick, 3605 Cedar Avenue, Denver, Colorado. Good evening, Madam President, and our council members. I'm here speaking on behalf of the Cherry Creek East Association. You may know that they are rhino and they already know that that house, three of the four properties I was president of the association last'",
        "'speaker_2': 'year work with Bill Tanner, who headed my development committee. I serve as a board member this year and I've been authorized to speak on behalf of the board. Let me just start by saying there is a strong bias not to approve more than three stories in our neighborhood that probably won't surprise you, but we always listen to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'developers and their proposals, and that was the case here over the past 18 months, the board and particularly the development committee worked extensively with the macKinnon Group, that there were multiple presentations, including presentations, to get an idea of what was important, to explain what they were going to try to do, etc., and also presentations to the board'",
        "'speaker_2': '. After we got some of our ideas shaped up, we had several community meetings. Those were in-person meetings. You might have heard about those where people actually come together and yell at each other instead of over Zoom. No, we had two, two very good sessions where we talked about issues and what would be important to the community.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we worked extensively with the macKinnon Group on these points. Ultimately, we did a very extensive survey which Bill Tanner has talked about. I'll leave it at that. But they made a lot of effort to not only reach out to not just all our members, but all our contacts in the community, and then people put fliers out'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to get that feedback. And that was done before we entered into negotiations. I then formed a negotiations group and worked closely with Lou Rader, Cherry Creek North, because there's a property on the north side and we thought we could work better working together.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We also worked closely with the Hilltop folks who joined in ultimately, but we did the negotiations. And Lou Rader wrote up an extensive agreement that we think not only protects the community and met their needs or meets their needs, but will end up with a great a great project.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So the board we shared all the negotiations with the community, shared the documents we created. The feedback I got after that was almost unanimously in favor. There are a few people that were not. That's to be expected and our board support supported the proposal 8 to 3.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We think these are good projects for the community and for Denver. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next up, we have Jesse Paris.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Then even the members of council could not be heard. Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Um, so this rezoning meets all the criteria of the. Not going to change your mind on this. I just had to question on the first question is, what were the three letters of opposition? And the second question is, was there a traffic study done for this reason on Colorado Boulevard?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Because that's either that or one of the speakers has already mentioned or traffic issues over here, especially on First and Colorado. So I want to see if there was a traffic study done on this. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Jesse. Next up, we have Lou Rader's. In lieu, you might need to unmute yourself. Okay. There you go.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Good evening, counsel. I don't know if you can see me, but I am here. I'll start this with you. Okay. There you go. Thank you for the time this evening. Just to tell you a little bit about this project that you've not heard.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think this is one of the great examples of so many people in the city coming together and really working together with the developer who started in one place and it in another. Not to say, as John pointed out, that everyone was in favor of this, but so many people were and are and are very excited to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'see what this project will do to reconfigure that important intersection, provide the important gateways that have been in the Your Creek area plan for some time, and will allow a more pedestrian friendly crossing where there is in fact a bus stop.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We are a very walkable neighborhood. This will join that with our hilltop neighbors and others to increase safety and will allow us to further the goal of affordable housing. We completely applaud the developer for including affordable housing. Again, one of the things that makes this such a, I think, a remarkable team effort.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have people from the city that helped us answer questions. Councilman Hines and his staff have continued to help us to try to imagine how it is going to look when we have some type of true gateway on the property that will be a result of the reconfigured walker drives.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So this is going to be an ongoing effort. But we we noted to planning board that there's three and it jumps to five. There wasn't a four. So this is one of those situations where we were able to accommodate a lot of concerns by working with the developer and doing a private agreement where there are lapses, or'",
        "'speaker_1': 'at least not an opportunity to do a four story with certain restricted uses. The developer and his counsel, Caitlin Quander, were a delight to work with and we had a lot of people involved. We had very many meetings on this and we are so appreciative of the efforts that the entire team made in order to get this'",
        "'speaker_1': 'project off the ground so we can continue to work on it. We look forward to coming back to council at some point if we have our gateways figured out which we will do in the next year or so.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And again, thank you all for your support of this project.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. We have Larry Fullerton up next.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hello.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hi. Go ahead, Mr. Fullerton.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hi there. I'm Larry Fullerton. I have been active in the real estate community in Denver for over 40 years, including public service and private sector, and developed 200 condos in downtown and near downtown Denver. I am enthusiastically supporting this project and I just want to make two simple points.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I. I don't see me, but I hope you can see me. Number one, during my term, working with Mayor Pinera, I was very privileged and honored to develop long term friendships with Ron Straka and Jennifer Moulton, the two visionaries who started many of these planning processes that Courtney Livingston described in her presentation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I know them very, very well. Ron was the best man at my wedding and Jennifer pals for many years. Unfortunately, they're no longer with us. But I wanted to say that I am fully confident that they would support this project and its compatibility with the plans that they started years ago.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And secondly, having been through a few of these my developer days, I want to say how impressed I am with Doug macKinnon and his team and all the work they've done with the neighborhood organizations, community input, listening carefully and trying to be the best neighbor they could possibly be.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So with that, I just want you to know that as a veteran in this business, in this community, I enthusiastically support this project. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. We have next Adam Astrof. And Adam, you might need to unmute yourself.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah. Sorry about that. Can you hear me okay?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yep. Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah. My name's Adam Ashraf. I'm at 361a.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Lady. And also speaking on behalf of Yimby Denver. We support this project. It's going to add affordable housing and more abundant housing to an area of the city that is at no risk for displacement and an area of the city that has, you know, a huge proportion of jobs, 80% AMI isn't everything, but this will be housing'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that potentially teachers.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Store managers.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know, and people who work at the restaurants in Cherry Creek can use some of those folks in use. So thank you, counselor, for approving this. And while I am glad that the neighborhood, you know, and everyone could come to a compromise, I'm not sure how great it is that where we're allowing people to dictate what future'",
        "'speaker_2': 'neighbors can have on their balconies. But thank you very much for your support.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Up next, we have Dylan McQuinn.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hello? Can you hear me?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mm hmm. Go ahead. Oh.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Great. So thank you for having me. First of all, I'm an architect for tribe architects who's representing the applicant for this project. My colleague Bill Mooney spoke nicely about the project, covered most of my points here, but a couple of things I just wanted to add a little more detail on.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'First of all, the chair category plan, which has been referenced quite a bit here, it specifically and unequivocally identifies these sites as gateway sites. So that term, Gateway is something that we kind of made up, expanded as referenced several times in that document as a kind of important entries into the Tier four neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I just want to point out that, you know, a rezoning in this location is not going to set precedent because that document is kind of our what we're leaning on primarily for the justification for the rezoning.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And, you know, every site obviously can be a gateway site. So no precedent set there. I also want to point out the fact that, you know, this is obviously primarily a residential neighborhood in this district. This particular these particular sites are along Colorado Boulevard, again, which is a arterial street.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So if height is additional, height is going to be allowed anywhere in the neighborhood. And this would be the place to do it, kind of in a boundary condition or a high speed arterial. Furthermore, you know that even though the five story zoning is what we're going for here, the private development agreement will limit this to four'",
        "'speaker_2': 'stories. And to layer on top of that, there are setbacks in the zoning code, upper story setbacks. So as you approach the neighbors on interior lot lines, the building will transition from a four story building down to a three story building and then down to a two story building at the edges.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So it won't be completely out of scale with the neighbors. And then finally, with these new zoning designations that we're seeking here, the ground level setbacks will be increased as well. So all in all, we think the combination of these different zoning restrictions and the gateway locations makes this an inappropriate project for this neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. We have David part, bro, up next.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Full Council. My name is David Pardo. I actually live in District one at 3342 Wind Street. But for the last seven years, up until a few months ago, I lived in District nine, right by Union Station. I'm here to in support of this project.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'For me, as a relatively young person, being able to buy a home in the city is hard. There are we have a lack of housing that's available. And to me, anything that we can do to produce additional housing units is of incredibly high value.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Whether you live next door or whether like me, you live three or four or five miles away. Seeing something like this happen and seeing a large number of units come in, many of which will be available to people who do jobs like I do in the hospitality industry, will be highly valuable.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that that's all I have to say. I'm very much in favor of this project going forward.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, David. And our last speaker for the evening is Wendy Roach. You might need to send me your cell phone. There you go.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hi. Good evening. I thank you all for allowing me an opportunity to speak on behalf of this project. My main support of this project is that it's a project that's going to activate and elevate this major arterial corridor.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'As envisioned by their neighborhood plans. And I also appreciate all of the hard work, Lou Raiders and John Tredinnick and all of the folks and both of the Cherry Creek Rhinos did to make.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This project work.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Along with Doug macKinnon and his team, it'll be a it'll be a great project for this neighborhood. Those. Those parcels have been vacant lots as long as I've been here in Denver, which was 1997 and along a major arterial in our city.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's a shame. And it's an incredibly challenging couple of parcels on First Avenue and Harrison to develop. So I'm glad that Doug macKinnon and the Tribe team, who are and who have a deservedly well respected national record reputation, are going to be tackling this project and making it work for the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So thank you for your time and I hope you support the project.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Wendy. Would you mind introducing yourself for the public record, please?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I am sorry. I am speaking as a individual member of the Hilltop neighborhood. I live on the 600 block of Burke Street. I'm a member of the board of the Cranmer Park Hilltop. R.A. and I became acquainted with the project while I was president of the R.A. when I was invited by the Cherry Creek East and North'",
        "'speaker_1': 'R.A. to learn about the project and help them do outreach to our neighborhood, which I want to point out has been very robust.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm no longer the president.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There's a new president. It was a transition period, and our R.A. has supported this project and submitted a letter of support for it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Very good. Thank you, Wendy. That concludes our speakers. Members of Council. Questions from members of Council. Councilman Hines.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Madam President. May I ask Mr. Workman a couple questions about the project?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sure thing. We will go ahead and get him back into the panel and we might end up just leaving him in here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening, sir. So a few questions for you. This zoning allows for five stories. I kind of I can't I think I got the answer to this in previous testimony. But I'll ask you anyway, will this development be five stories actually per the end?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think Caitlin, who's also here, could probably speak to the agreement as well as liberators more than I can buy per the Good Neighbor Agreement. We're going to four stories. I think what you're considering tonight is the zoning is five stories, but we made an agreement to four stories per the good neighbor agreement.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I guess I was asking you on on behalf of the developer, I was hoping to ask the same question on behalf of the neighborhood, just to make sure that they everyone's on the same page. Yes. So but if you think I should ask Miss Quander, then I'm happy to ask.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah, I think she could probably have some clarity on that as well. Okay. Super sorry to send misdirected question. No.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilman. Good evening. Kaitlin Quander land use counsel for the applicant feels correct. We entered into a private development agreement that we writers on behalf and John Phonetic on behalf of Cherry Creek East and Cherry Creek North Neighborhood Associations negotiated and drafted and that private covenant is signed and recorded against all of the properties, and that would limit'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it privately to the four story. So while you are considering a five story zoning tonight, privately it is limited and the developer is very committed to the first four storey limitation. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, thank you. And I guess part of the reason why I'm asking is I know that there was some discussion about the height of this development. And and so I just want to make sure that, you know, that there was a discussion and that ultimately I want to talk about how there was compromise that was made, because'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think the original proposal for the from the developers perspective for Mr. McLennan was for five stories. And I think the original proposal from the residents was for three stories. And so I think it's I think it's interesting and compelling to show that that there was a compromise made for stories.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So let's see. So I guess one other question that was asked by one of the people testifying. Was there a traffic study created or conducted for this for this particular development or in advance the development? And I'm not sure who I should ask.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think Phil unmuted, but then Courtney was gone.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Back on too. I mean, I think that's actually part of the site development planning process. Usually a traffic study is required. I see. You know, Doug can. After that as well, but not as part of the reasoning. But that's what that's when that will come in.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And you're muted. Mr. yet. Is that working now? Yes, sir. CASTELLANOS We as part of this rezoning, committed to do a traffic study when we move forward towards a site development plan. A pure traffic study with amorphous zoning was not going to be a valuable piece of information.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But we fully recognize you through a traffic study before we submit a site development plan that in fact, that is a affirmative and specific obligation under the good neighbor agreements. And we will be doing a traffic study group and in every one of the developments.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And you have already been in contact with both sides. And Dottie, is that right? Because Colorado is a state highway. Correct. There was some jurisdictional questions between Dottie and sedan relative to work activities on Colorado Boulevard, as well as the First Avenue intersection.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But we've approached both both entities and have received, if you will, kind of a initial positive response to their concepts to reduce and remove these write in and write out the three rights. In fact, as part of serious improvements of the intersection, we're going to be working hand in glove with them to make sure that improvements that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'they plan actually near-term will be done in such a way to accommodate the the long term vision of the intersection as we proposed to the neighbors and in addition to a traffic study, because traffic often is interpreted to exclusively mean cars.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You're doing a study that includes creating pedestrian access across Colorado, at least at first. And so that to the people who have access to this development, will also have access to the nearby park. Is that right? Correct. Councilman, we specifically on the First Avenue Gateway.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There will be a removal of what is today, sort of the in our minds, very unsafe pork chops, if you will, for sort of a small respite as you cross the larger Colorado Boulevard. So that will be improved such that the right of way is now reworked to provide accessibility, safe accessibility for all individuals.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And on the Bayard intersection, what we've what we contemplated is the continuation of the bike lane, such that the bike lane concept can actually allow for as well as pedestrian access into Byrnes Park, which, as we all know, is sort of a kind of a strange, underutilized, great piece of greenspace in the middle of our city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah. And I and I actually want to thank you for. We get a lot of comments generally negative for the the pork chops, as they're commonly called. But the, you know, the the car friendly swing in swing out from Colorado to to first.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I wanna I want to thank you for considering that in the traffic study because I think that we'll find out that pedestrians are not excited about the the pork chops. I mean, we certainly we know through feedback, but I think we'll we'll understand empirically through this study as well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I, I don't think have any other study or any other questions. So thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Hines. Up next, we have Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Madam President. All this talk of pork chops is making me hungry for my dinner. But first one, I want to extend some of the conversation that Councilman Hines I was engaging in and recognize the work of the neighborhoods in together, working out the good neighbor agreement that's recorded against the land.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I completely understand that. But I would like to ask Courtney if she could increase my comfort level for this departure from relative relatively recent plan guidance that says three story maximum in the staff report, which I'm going to flip over to right now.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It says the acknowledges that the request exceeds the height recommendations as shown in the plan from 2012, but the request is consistent with other recommendations for the vacant parcel within the Cherry Creek North sub area as well as other plan goals described earlier.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So could you be a little more specific about why in this case, other than the agreement with the neighbors who appear to be happy with it and have endorsed it, what is it in our plan guidance that says there are other recommendations that make the increase to 65 feet appropriate?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, I think I think that if we're looking at the Cherry Creek area plan, we have those recommendations, but we also have recommendations. You know, talking about the fact that this is a gateway, that it's important to the community to focus growth in this location, to redevelop the parcels.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, specifically, you're looking at encouraging private reinvestment along Perimeter Street, that page 73 of the 72 of the Cherry Creek Area Plan, you know, looking at the half block. You know, the plan acknowledges in its recommendations that here is New Street is very unique and that it creates a half block condition in between here and in'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Colorado. And so that makes it super challenging to redevelop along with all of these other constraints, wanting that sidewalk connectivity. So we have a lot of recommendations pushing and pulling here. So we're looking at it in all together.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So on balance, we feel that this application does meet the plan criteria because it is meeting the recommendations to help redevelop this area and meet the goals that way.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hey, I don't suppose you were here in 2012, Courtney.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'No, I was not.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. I'm wondering if that's the case. Why? Along Colorado Boulevard, at least in on that half block. Which, you know, very awkward between Harrison and Colorado being a half block. Why the area plan didn't accommodate more than three stories, especially along Colorado Boulevard.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I noticed there's there are some structures there that look like they're higher than three stories already or they're not.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think that's a little bit farther south.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. I'm thinking of the sunrise.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sunrise assisted living. But that. Isn't that a cedar? Between Cedar and Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. Oh.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I believe that is. And so the plan has that that. You know, that was built way before 2012, I believe. Yeah, because it was there in 2006 and that's well over three stories. And in the plan guidance, I think that's on page 72.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It does show that that assisted living is five stories in height. So it does account for the existing condition there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. All right. Thank you. That's all I have. Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilman. Councilwoman Sandoval.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Madam President. So I have a few questions for, I think. Hmm. Caitlin I think this would be best suited for you or Courtney. So. Although. The zoning is five stories. You have a covenant. That's for. You can go down to development services and you can still get a five story permit because these are associated with'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the zoning. So how do you ensure that that actually happens? Because we have a couple of covenants in northwest Denver and it's not until they get brought to my attention through the site development plan, the city that they are following, the covenant.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So how do we ensure that this is actually going to take place? Because the only way that somebody down in development services knows about this deal is they'd have to go to the crooked recorder's office. Councilwoman, thank you for the question.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So a couple of points. The development agreements are that have been entered into are recorded against the property. And I will say that, look, radars and John Tredinnick have done a fantastic job of circulating both the terms and the actual written agreements themselves to the neighborhood organization and throughout.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So there's a much wider awareness about the terms. And, you know, I think those organizations were lucky to have Blue Raiders in particular, who is a retired real estate attorney from who tap rock to draft those with me on behalf of the neighborhood because you know, she certainly represented them well and not as an attorney, but as'",
        "'speaker_1': 'a member of the neighborhood. So within those reported private covenants, there are the site plans themselves that the neighbors and Mr. macKinnon and Tribal worked through closely. Those are actually attached. So the depictions of what is proposed are attached and recorded.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So that's that's provides a lot of clarity. And in addition, there is a default in enforcement provision. So the neighborhood association has the ability to go and get you know, I think if we were to try and apply for something that is not allowed, they would one be in communication with them because we have to as part'",
        "'speaker_1': 'of the covenants on the site plan, we have to give them copies of the site development plan as we're submitting them to the city. But if they were to find there, there was something that was inconsistent. There is a notice and default enforcement process written into the agreement.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Certainly don't ever anticipate having to go there. But I appreciate the question and the neighborhoods and and my client made sure to write in a very clear process for them to be able to enforce them. So if I heard you correctly, your first two sentences answered my question.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So as the site development plan is pushed forward, it's given to the neighborhood is the same time. Is it process to development services? Is that what I heard? That is correct, yep. Okay. And so question for you, Courtney.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'How is an applicant able to read zone on land that's not contiguous?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'With the application, vacancy and application, there doesn't need to be contiguous by code standards.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. So they can just do a map amendment based on however they'd like so anyone can go in there. So anyone, any person can go in and have a Swiss cheese map amendment, basically.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. If the property owners are in agreement and sign up to it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. So one more question to you, Caitlin. This. Covenant have a sunset. Councilwoman. Yes, it is. And I'm just double checking 50 years from the time it was recorded. So certainly intended to last kind of the lifetime of these buildings and then it go and it revert and then after the sunset, it reverts to the zoning that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'we're approving today. Is that correct? To the five story with no. None of these restrictions on it? Yes. Although I would assume that anyone that was potentially redeveloping the site would probably be back negotiating with the neighborhood associations at that time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And 50 years from now, you know, who knows what that area will look like. But yes, you're correct. 50 years from now, the development agreement concludes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilwoman Sandoval. Councilman Sawyer, we had you up in the Q. Did you get your question answered?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. My question was about the enforcement and Councilman Sandoval. Got it. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilwoman. The public hearing for Council Bill 20 dash 0813 is closed. Comments by members of Council. Councilman Flynn, I'm sorry. Councilman Hines, your Councilman Flynn's picture was right below you, and I said his name.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Hines, go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If Councilmember Flynn wants to take it away. Okay. So, thank you, Madam President. I, I I'm excited about this this project. The these plots at first in Colorado are, excuse me, current and first in Colorado and beyond, have sat vacant for a long time, for decades.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They're oddly shaped as in they're not as deep as most parcels in the area would be. So they've been underutilized. And, you know, I'm a big multimodal advocate. They limit pedestrian access along Colorado, a transit quarter that we've identified because of their poorly created and maintained sidewalks and and they're pedestrian friendly lamb chops, pork chops.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Neighbors have complained about these locations for years. The current developer, McKinnon, purchased these sites in April of 2019 and immediately started engaging the neighbors to figure out what would work for these plots. Both of these intersections, Colorado and Bayard, as well as Colorado and first or, um, you know, areas that that the neighbors have contemplated for for'",
        "'speaker_2': 'many years, engaged community members have spent a lot of time adding their thoughts about the vision for these sites. And they I'm also excited that they used well-known architect and District ten constituent David Schreiber, to help design what would work on these plots because he's using a tribal architecture developed around the nation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we're really fortunate to have a national architect that's that's also working here in our own city. So so I'm really excited that he's creating something that will integrate into Cherry Creek, something that will be a grand entrance.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I understand that, that the zoning asks for five and Blueprint says three. As, as we've heard, it won't actually be five storeys, it'll be four and three and two stories because of the step process. And, and so the way that this, this development will be on this funky parcel will we'll still be in some ways what the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'neighbors had asked for anyway. You'll see in the packet that the 15th Century Creek North Arnaud's both combined to write a letter support. Both groups created a detailed agreement between the neighbors and the developers. I personally have been to multiple neighborhood organizations.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I personally have, you know, before I was elected, have worked on good neighbor agreements. I have never seen a 67 page and a and and that's what we have here in attached to this proposal. And so I really I credit church groups and particularly Cherry Creek North, my readers for for their attention to detail to make sure'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that that the developer and neighbors are in lockstep and and that the developer is kind of caged in to doing what, you know, what the agreement has been. So is this exactly what every neighbor wants? No. But it's a solid compromise that incorporates a lot of what the neighbors have asked for.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So another thing that no one has really touched on much so far is the affordable housing. I think. What's important for this development is that this affordable housing and it is in a very pedestrian friendly area of the city and they're working to make it more pedestrian friendly.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know, as long as you don't walk along Colorado. But that's another issue that we need to continue to to address. It's also an area with access to great public schools. Something that hasn't been mentioned so far is that the affordable housing is required to have a minimum of 900 square feet.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I think that that's particularly compelling, too, because when you have an area that's very pedestrian friendly and you have really good schools, you know, a lot of times affordable housing is shoehorned into the smallest possible unit. And in ensuring that these affordable units and support school age kids to go to these awesome schools, I think that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that's another component that that is a result of the the long conversations between the developer and the neighbors. So as I ask before, as I mentioned before, I would finally say I value multimodal transit. And I I'm so glad that the developer is willing to to proactively already engage in conversations with Saeeda and Dottie to make sure'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that this, frankly, pedestrian unfriendly area is is turned into a much more pedestrian friendly area. And I think that with is with this development and this vision, I think that this will be an exciting gateway into Cherry Creek.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So thank you. And I urge and I vote.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Hines. Up next, we have Councilman Sawyer.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Madam President. And I think, you know, Councilmember Hines hit it on the head. I was talking to my staff about this rezoning today, and one of my aides said something really interesting. She's a Denver native and she said these parcels have been the way they are now for her entire life.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And she's not going to be very happy with me for hinting about her age publicly. But she said, you know, people have been talking about what to do with this land for almost a half a century. So, you know, while there are residents who understandably have concerns about the density proposed in this rezoning, and as we talked'",
        "'speaker_1': 'about in the questions section, you know, Blueprint says three stories and this is five stories. But, you know, we're compromising it for stories here. I think the question is really whether given the criteria we're looking at and we're required to look at in rezonings, is this thoughtful development?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Great. That's the goal here. Is this thoughtful development. Does this meet the needs of the community? Is this development for development sake, or are we finding that there's a community benefit here? Is it worth it to develop these properties into this proposed plan, or should we just let these lots sit deteriorating for another half a century?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And, you know, thoughtful development doesn't mean no development. It means development that makes our community better. And I think from what we've seen from the questions and the answers that we got tonight, this proposal does that it not only includes affordable housing, but, you know, like Councilman Hines said, it includes affordable housing at a minimum square foot'",
        "'speaker_1': ', 900 square feet per unit. That's two bedrooms. You know, this affordable housing is specifically for families in a neighborhood with access to three excellent public schools. Parks directly on two main transit lines. The Good Neighbor, the 67 page good neighbor agreement, which cracks me up, includes design standards that take into consideration things like setbacks.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Setbacks, though residents don't feel overwhelmed by the four stories that make up the compromise. Because many of them would have preferred the three stories. So visually and sort of spatially, it's going to be a good it's going to be a good compromise.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is it perfect? No. Right. This development represents a compromise between a developer that, frankly, would have preferred higher density and taller buildings and the neighbors who, frankly, would have preferred less density and lower buildings. The fact that no one is 100% happy in this situation is probably the best indication that it's a success.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I will be supporting it this evening as well. It's right across the street in District ten. District five is just on the other side of Colorado Boulevard. I think this is a really great option and I'm very excited for it as well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I just want to thank Mr. McKim in. I want to thank his team. I think this is really great. I want to thank the Arnaud's for all of the hard work that they did. So thank you guys all very much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This is this is a great option and I'm really looking forward to supporting it. So thanks a lot. And thank you, Councilwoman.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh, thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman Sandoval.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Madam President. A lot of times I love looking at zoning and I love looking at precedent setting. And I would just have to say that this good neighbor agreement is a document that I'm saving and I will be able to use in the future when we are negotiating land use deals in northwest Denver.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So first off, thank you to the team who put together this good neighbor agreement. It's very thorough. I've worked on several in my time as working as a counselor, and this is the most robust one I've seen. So thank you for that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I would like to thank the team for the affordable housing. That's super important. And if I'm going to go really down into the weeds, you even got into the construction materials, which is very important for Northwest members. You talk about brick, you talk about tree line.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You talk about how it intersects. You talk about parking, being underground and only having one insert when when in, when we're in and when we out. So a lot of the work in zoning, I believe, and development is the devil's in the details.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so this is good neighbor agreement is there's tons of details in here. So thank you for providing this document for future rezonings in Denver. And based on the criteria, I, I had similar questions similar to Kevin Councilman Flynn about the heights and how we sometimes deviate away from neighborhood plans.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I really believe that Colorado Boulevard, this site will be it will be long lasting. And if you look once again into the details of the good neighbor report, the construction materials that you're using, I bet this building is going to be here longer than 50 years when this comes in at sunset.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So that's always what I'm looking at when I'm looking at site development times and what's in the what kind of construction are you using? What kind of materials are you using? Because in Denver you can go from 100 degrees to 37 degrees within 24 hours, and that's really harsh climate to build in.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And not very many architects know how to build in that type of climate. So with that, I will also be offering my support to me above and beyond the criteria. Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Sandoval and I not seen any other hands raised will add my comments that this rezoning of these numerous parcels, in my opinion, does meet all of the criteria, and I will be voting in favor of it as well tonight.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Madam Secretary, roll call, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'HYNES All right. Cashman Hi.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'There are some commercial retail uses, like a lighting showroom in a restaurant to the north existing. There are three single unit homes built in the early 1900s to the north of the 50 kilometer parcel. There's more residential to the east.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Additionally, the layout noted that the enhanced design is needed for the site to support walkability and livability and also outlined the need for an affordable housing commitment. The voluntary, affordable housing commitment is associated with the proposed rezoning includes at least 10% of all units constructed on the property would be higher use with a 60 year period of'",
        "'speaker_3': 'affordability and a range of unit sizes. The affordability level varies based on the product type under a build alternative plan. The project and the large parcel contemplated would be required to provide only seven income restricted units and under the Voluntary Affordable Housing Agreement.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The 10% is approximately 47 income restricted units, about seven times what would be required normally be required. Be. I'm inspired. You have to do a seven month waiver. It's what is requested here. So this is a table that shows an increased design standard as a result of applying the design overlay with flavors.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then what we would get with just the I'm at five district alone and then the first column is the current design standards of the existing zone districts that are in place right now. So we'll talk about the waivers requested.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'll take each one as it is. The first waiver requested is to the D7 Nonresidential Street Level Active Use requirement, and that would be replacing the current provision that would require the large parcel have about 210 linear feet of nine residential street level active use and reduces it down to 185 linear linear feet.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'For the other two parcels included in the rezoning, the 121 South Santa Fe and then the La Pan 39 counties. The standard of the DE seven would apply normally, so it's just for that big site, the first one.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'In the applicants application. Notes of outreach conducted with the community prior to submitting the application. Specifically meeting with the Baker R.A. multiple times. There was also, as I mentioned before, a committee information meeting as part of the process.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Baker R.A. wrote a letter of support, and there are six additional letters of support from committee members. Moving on to review criteria to prove a rezoning, it must be found that the MAP amendment is consistent, consistent with the five criteria found in the code.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The first criteria is that it must be consistent with the adopted plans or five adopted plans that apply to this requested rezoning plan. 2040 Blueprint. Denver Alameda Stationary Plan. The Baker Neighborhood Plan and Housing and Inclusive Denver. First Continent 2040, adopted in 2019.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There are multiple goals and strategies that the request is consistent with that said, in terms of the vision elements that pertain to equity. The proposed rezoning would enable the development of additional housing units and the mixed uses and proximity to the Alameda station.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The proposed rezoning also has an affordable housing agreement that requires a minimum of 10% of the units be income restricted at various levels, depending on product type. Next to environmentally resilient element of compliance. So this would allow for mixed use infill growth with access to transit via the Alameda station.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Additionally, with the industrial mixed use, redevelopment and proximity to transit helps improve air quality through decreasing the reliance on single occupancy vehicle. And let's move on to how the two classes consistent with Blueprint Denver versus object state status shown within the district context and the industrial mixed use zone within that district context.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Blueprint shows the properties as part of the Innovation Innovation Flex Place type blueprint describes innovation flex places and makes you places for businesses, offices, manufacturing, logistics pieces, and says that multi-unit residential is compatible here. So the request to district allows for a variety of industrial and commercial uses, and the D7 with waivers provides enhanced design standards like'",
        "'speaker_3': 'increased transparency, minimum street level height and three level active use requirements, all meeting the the vision for those innovation flex places. The proposed zone district is intended for industrial dominated area areas served by these collector streets. So what works right here?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's a collector street. And considering that the other three types are industrial arterials, the request of zone district is appropriate here. Moving on to the growth strategy. That map that shows the vision on how we distribute future growth across the city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The proposed MAP amendment will allow mixed use growth and helps to support the future employment and housing growth anticipated by the plan. Additionally blueprint have policies related to uses and design outcomes in the innovation district. So the application of the Geo seven in this location implements the recommendation for urban pedestrian friendly building forms for variety, for vibrant'",
        "'speaker_3': 'mixed use district by repurposing a tool that we already have in the code. And so Blueprint recommends that using custom zoning tools like waivers that we're using here are most effective when a standard zoning district doesn't exist. So in this instance, we have the 50 South comment parcel, which is extremely large, will likely have three primary street'",
        "'speaker_3': 'frontages and will be applied in the in Baker with the nonresidential active use and street level minimum standards of seven were initially calibrated. Currently, the design overlay that enables enhanced design standards for the industrial mixed use phone district does not exist.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So applying the D7 in this location necessitates customization with those waivers to respond to unique circumstance and enables the implementation of the plans recommendation. Additionally, the five acre site was was subject to the order process, which isn't typical for a standard rezoning.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So that customization with the waivers is is appropriate here. Next. The blueprint is also consistent with policies and strategies related to creating exceptional design outcomes in a particular location. Desired higher quality design can't be achieved through just the Impact Zone District alone.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So applying that design overlay with waivers here is how is appropriate, because it's how we ensure new development. New residential development will introduce residential uses that are better design and more pedestrian friendly than would otherwise be realized by simply just applying that identified zone district.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So the site also is over five acres in size, as I've mentioned. So there was an equity evaluation and the equity concepts were considered in context of the application first with access to opportunity. So this equity concept helps us to consider if the city is making progress towards achieving the vision for complete neighborhoods across the city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The site has a higher access to opportunity score in the contemplated development in connection with the proposed MAP Amendment will provide a little over a half acre of open space and that will further strengthen that equity metric. Not the the subject property is in an area that has lower vulnerability to displacement in these areas, important to maintain'",
        "'speaker_3': 'affordable housing options so all residents can continue to live in the neighborhoods. So there is an affordable housing commitment in connection with the proposed rezoning. Therefore, we think it shouldn't have a negative impact on this measurement specifically. Next to the subject.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Property is an area that has moderate housing diversity. Affordable housing agreement provides additional income, restricted units, and with a diversity of bedroom counts per unit and a range of affordability levels, we don't think that will have a negative impact on this housing diversity metric.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So also when we're looking at the expanding job diversity equity concept in terms of the job mix, the area has more emphasis on retail and manufacturing type jobs and the citywide average. The zone district allows for very commercial office manufacturing and retail jobs, and having a mix in many different types of jobs enables people of different incomes'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and education levels to find employment here. And the application mentions adding some level of offices to that parcel at 39 South Kalama. So this could help expand the mix of jobs and increase jobs in this area, since currently these parcels have no jobs at all because they're vacant.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So this rezoning application may actually have a positive impact on the area of job diversity. So next, we'll move on to the Baker Neighborhood Plan from 2003. The plan identifies the properties as part of the industrial sub area of this plan and describes these areas actually as fundamentally nonresidential.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And while there is some strong language in the plan against introducing residential in this area, we think that the guidance should be taken in context. And a lot has changed in 17 years in this area, like many of the industrial businesses leaving the area.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We have guidance from new guidance that's different from Blueprint Denver and the support of the Baker, R.A. and the community for transitioning this area and introducing residential here. So let's move on to the Alameda Stationery Plan from 2009.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You can see that the southern little tip portion there, the parcel 101 South Santa Fe Drive is within this plan area boundary. So that's a half mile from the Almeida Station. On the plans land use concept map. One of the subject parcels is designated as industrial and there's not a lot of language in the plan about industrial'",
        "'speaker_3': ', but the plan recommends that industrial areas should have manufacturing offices and other employment uses with special attention to design. So the Annex five zone district that they're requesting does allow for those uses. And we can consider that consistent with the plan recommendations.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The plan also calls out the West that avenue as an enhanced sidewalk route, bike route. The rezoning enables the development that will implement the plan's recommendation because the development will be required to install sidewalks in this area. And those have street trees and those will create enhanced pedestrian friendly street.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's how the inclusive Denver adopted in 2018. As we all know, the plan talks about promoting the development of new, affordable, mixed income housing. And there's a voluntary, affordable housing agreement associated with this application. And that we find that the requested rezoning meets the next two criteria.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It'll result in uniformity of district regulations as the IMX 50207 with waivers is considered in itself the unique zoned district. And it will further the public health, safety and welfare not only through its implementation of adopted plans like the Blueprint Denver, but also through enabling a higher design quality through the application of the design overlay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And that requires active uses and pedestrian oriented street frontages. Those design features make the area more walkable, and that has been shown to be linked with increased physical activity and decreased obesity. And then next, the criteria requires just five circumstances to exist for the rezoning.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There's been a lot of change in the area since 2010, such as multiple new developments to the southwest of the site. Additionally, the application also identifies the adoption of Blueprint Denver last year. With that innovation flex place type that change and that justifies the rezoning fact concurred.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The new future land use guidance for the site provided by Blueprint Denver is a change from the previous guidance and consistent with that criteria. And then finally, the final review criteria for math amendments is consistency with neighborhood context.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Purpose statements. Purpose and intent statements as a code. The requested district is characterized by providing a transition in between industrial and accommodating residential, which aligns the area net with the D7. There's a list about 12 purpose statements in this application.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And what purpose statements in this application is consistent with the promotion of promote promoting vibrant pedestrian street frontages with active uses street fronting buildings. So when we take all of that, on balance, the application is consistent with this neighborhood context zone, district purpose and intent statement criteria inclusion CBD finds that all zoning Denver Zoning Code criteria has'",

The Southern property, the business, the businesses that operate on our side are industrial with fabrication, manufacturing and and trucking. This use generates industrial traffic. Our concern is the close proximity of industrial and residential uses from the added traffic of the proposed 450 unit apartment complex just northwest from'",
        "'speaker_2': 'us. We communicated via letter and spoke briefly at the planning board meeting. We also submitted a letter to the latest meeting detailing concerns and submitted a letter to council prior to this meeting. We have spoken to the developer several times.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'One of our main concerns is the impact of the proposed signal at Santa Fe and Bayard on our and others existing movements. We hired transportation consultant Matt Brown Postoffice and Associates to review the Transportation Mobility Study provided by Kimberly Horne and West Side Development.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We reported our findings in our letter to council. Matt Brown is also going to be highlighting traffic concerns today. The area has been industrial for a long time. Business businesses built up around the railway and grew in this area as the city did.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Not all the industrial industries moved out. With the growth, there are a large number of industrial businesses in the Baker neighborhood. These businesses rely on maneuvering successfully in the area area as they currently do. Traffic around 50 south.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Kalama is bordered by two major three lane one way streets, Kalama on the west and Santa Fe on the East Bay areas on the south. And just further south is the main line track for the Bean and U.P. Railroad.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This creates a complicated set of conditions. Our businesses need good access as currently configured so that we can facilitate 252 and front trip, 250 to and from trips daily. We understand much of the project design is not final at this point, and if this project is approved, the site development plan process will begin and finish the detailed'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Yep. Hello?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hi. I'm out of Mr. Apartment 361.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'A lady. I live a couple of blocks from the site and I'm definitely excited to welcome new neighbors to our neighborhood. I think we are well placed to add additional residents. We are at a lower risk of displacement than some other surrounding communities.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We have good access to public transit as well as just being simply a mile and a half from downtown. I just walk to work, you know? I think that this is a great site to add both jobs and housing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I hope you guys will vote to approve. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next up, we have Matt Brown.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Evening. My name is Matt Brown. I'm a senior transportation engineer with Stauffer and Associates located in Greenwood Village. I've been practicing traffic engineer for over 25 years, and I'm a registered engineer in state of Colorado. On behalf of the Rio Grande companies, I was asked to review the transportation mobility study that was prepared for the 50 South'",
        "'speaker_2': 'on our site. Based on that review, there are two topics that I'd like to highlight tonight. The first is in regards to the proposed traffic signal at the Bayside and Santa Fe intersection. And the second is just more generally regarding the industrial nature of traffic in the area.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I know I'm probably speaking to the choir here, but traffic signals do have consequences. They tend to increase average vehicle delays for motorists, fuel consumption and even potential for rear end crashes. So we really need to be judicious in their application and particularly along our two roadways like Santa Fe.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Traffic signals are a precious commodity. Typically, we would not consider locating a traffic signal at a site driveway or even at an intersection with a local road, which they are. Avenue is in this case. There are also three active rail crossings and other traffic signals near this intersection.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's really a pretty complicated scenario, putting another traffic signal in the midst of all of what's going on there. Lots of engineering constraints and regulatory hurdles that need to be overcome not only with the city and county of Denver traffic, but also with the the railroad and the Public Utilities Commission.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And those topics aren't really addressed in the study this point. We also have some concerns with vehicle queuing. You know, not only will it potentially encroach on the track, but they also have the potential to block access points.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'For example, today, traffic, a lot of traffic from Bayard Avenue from the east has pretty much a free right turn movement when there are gaps in traffic to turn north on to Santa Fe. If the intersection is signalized and bad to the west is converted to a those right turn, movements now have to wait behind vehicle stop'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to cross light and as a result vehicles will end up winding up along that and potentially blocking driveways. And the study doesn't really address whether there four lanes or other improvements that are needed at the intersection to address those concerns.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Like distance. Also, as you're traveling northbound at Santa Fe, it's not ideal in advance of the signal. There's a curve in the road. There's lots of visual clutter going on with overhead utilities. You've got the railroad crossing there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so the visibility of the traffic signal or a traffic signal at that location would not be ideal. So we think during the STP process it makes sense to look at other site access or circulation concepts that avoid the need for a traffic signal at this location.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Finally, I think it's important to acknowledge the industrial nature of the area and the need to accommodate large vehicles at intersections and access points. There clearly be a need for intersection improvements as well as offsite improvements of the rail crossings and along area roadways to accommodate multimodal travel.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'These haven't been identified, but it's worth noting that land uses in the area generate many trucks and their ability to move freely needs to be maintained regardless of how the site near to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You, Mr. Brown. Thank you for your time. Up next, our next speaker is Jesse Paris.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening, members of Council. Good evening, Council President Gilmore My name is Jesse Paris. I'm representing for Denver Homeless our low life star action movement for self-defense, positive action, commitment to social change as well as the Unity Party of Colorado and Mile High and those I'll be your next mayor in 2023.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm in favor of this rezoning because we need more affordable housing throughout the whole metro area. I just have a few questions. The first question is, is it true that only 10% of 450 units will be affordable between 60% and 80% and my level.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So is there a traffic study done for this rezoning story? Was there a trade study done for this rezoning or how long is this affordability agreement going to last before it's due for 60 plus year? Or what is the time frame for that?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So someone could please answer those questions. I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Jesse. Our last speaker this evening is Brian Lomax. Mr. Loma, you might need to add me. AMY Mm hmm. Yep. Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hey, thanks. You know, as I'm sitting outside of Melanie and Mike. Mike night instead of in a vacant city council chambers, I'm reminded that as we continue to develop areas, we're not effectively looking at the long term impacts.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I read through all the documentation, so I know there was a traffic study and I see the train traffic. I see the trains travel there a lot. It's a congested area, one of the few industrial areas left in the city and county of Denver.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I'm really like I'm concerned that we need. Affordable housing. But when we're looking at placing people next to trains and next to industry, that's not necessarily the best places for it. And for anybody to be living. And I'm just kind of really concerned about the idea that definitely looking at bike traffic, looking at the industrial traffic'",
        "'speaker_2': 'mixes that are going to be ending up in this initial in this zone as you as currently mapped out, it's concerning to me. While we recognize that we have to have places where people live, not necessarily against this, not necessarily for this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm really concerned that as I read zoning regulations and we look at the park plans and stuff like that, we're not budgeting for the infrastructure of sustainability. And so definitely housing near bike pathways is something near the the main train lines, something that we need and we need to consider more.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So this one's a little bit of a mix for me, but I know nothing is easy, but I'm really, really concerned. There's a lot of heavy, heavy traffic there. It's not the right place to put people. You're going to drive that industry out of town by by if you don't do it right.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's all I got. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Loma. That concludes our speakers tonight. Questions from members of council. Councilman Clark, I was wondering if you're going to chime in since this is in your district or.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We've got I don't have any questions at this time. I would love to get in comments, but I see some other folks getting in raise their hand for questions. Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Very good. First up, we have Councilwoman Ortega. Thank you. Madam President, I would like to ask.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's that Matt Brown that talked about the traffic study. If you wouldn't mind coming back on. Go ahead with your question, Councilman. We've got the map back up.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay, great.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So, Mr. Brown, first of all, were were you able to complete your comments because you you ran out of time? And I just wanted to make sure if there were some other key points that you were able to get those across.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know, I was very close to the last thing that I really wanted to emphasize was just the importance of being able to accommodate industrial traffic in this area. So as improvements are made for this site and offsite to accommodate the multi-modal connections and so forth, I just wanted to make sure that the industrial traffic was a'",
        "'speaker_2': 'part of the consideration.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So the study that you did was independent. It was not. And it was done for Rio Grande. Was there already a study that was done by the applicant of the redevelopment that you looked at and compared yourself?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. So. Excuse me. The applicant retained a traffic engineer that prepared the transportation and mobility study for for their project. And that's the information that I reviewed on behalf of the Rio Grande. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So I just find it fascinating that that's done prior to this application yet again. This is an example for my colleagues of the level of detail that we don't get as part of these applications. And it's why some of us have advocated that we should go back to some of the things that used to be part'",
        "'speaker_0': 'of the rezoning, so that we are, in fact getting more details and making a better informed decision on the request that we're being asked to approve. Let me just ask you a further question about whether or not that traffic study, either that you did or that you reviewed, done by the applicant, look at pedestrian access to the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'east, to the Baker neighborhood, and to some degree to the to the north, because if the site is going to have a lot of commercial on there, that will draw more pedestrian traffic across. What is what is that, three or four lanes on Santa Fe?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Ensuring that we've got safe pad access is really critical to that mobility. So is that something that you looked at or was that included at all in their study?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'My interesting I did look at that and my understanding is that the the improvements that are proposed by the applicant are limited to on site improvements. So and I they're here obviously and can correct me if I'm wrong but I believe they're proposing to make sidewalk improvements on the north side of Bayard.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But my understanding is that that's between Kalamazoo and Santa Fe, not east. As you go east from Santa Fe towards the Baker neighborhood, obviously you have a lack of sidewalks and accessibility along that corridor and you also have the light rail crossing there that isn't an accessible crossing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so that's what I'm referring to with respect to the need for additional on site improvements and that those being the industrial use of the area and traffic be considered in evaluating the appropriateness of those kinds of improvements, like being able to turn, you know, big vehicles at corners and at intersections is something that my my client'",
        "'speaker_2': 'in particular is interested in ensuring that that that isn't compromised as a result of any improvements that are made.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I want to ask a representative from the developer if they can address my same questions. So thank you, Mr. Brown. Appreciate you answering my questions. I'm not sure who the best person is that should address this, but I just wanted to ask about the the head connection where we may have you know, there's a lot of'",
        "'speaker_0': 'interest in the Baker neighborhood to support the project because it will add, you know, more, more people and more amenities. But at the same time, it could pose a greater risk for pedestrians. And so I just wanted to ask the applicant to address that as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right. Thank you, Councilman. We have Kenneth Ho. And he's ready to answer your questions. I. Kenneth, how are you? I thought you were in there for a minute. Now I don't see you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You hear me now?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. No reason.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay, great. Thank you for the question.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh, you just cut out on us. We just lost you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Can you hear me now?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'No, we can't.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'll hold the speaker out in front of me a little bit here. Sorry for the audio difficulties. The mobility study was actually part of the LDR process that we went through with the. So that's why this this was done specifically as part of it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And, and I believe it was scoped as part of whatever the city is now requiring for LV hours. In terms of the pedestrian connection says so of the study that was being reviewed actually has already been submitted to the city and I'm not sure whether it has been provided to council, but in any case, it is.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The study recommended a light at Bayside in Santa Fe in order to not only accommodate automobile and truck traffic, but also, frankly, pedestrian crossings as well as as the previous gentleman spoke about. You know, traffic signals are complicated, but at the same time, they not only may create some inconveniences for automobiles and trucks, but they create important'",
        "'speaker_2': 'breaks in traffic for pedestrians and cyclists. And that improvement is a offsite improvement in order to enhance the pedestrian bicycle access, also along Bayside, which is identified as a key pedestrian bicycle route.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you for answering that question. I want to move on to whether or not the LDR process looked at your proximity to rail on the West Side and whether it discussed some buffering to protect the residents that would be living and working in the development, you know.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Were there setbacks that were identified from the rail and some kind of buffering that you all would be looking at? And can you explain what what you guys are thinking?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We were we were during the earlier process provided with the rail study and the report and we reviewed it, you know that you know, the additional buffering in order to address noise from the rail is going to be incorporated into the design.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The vertical developer has already talked about that, but there weren't any specific recommendations regarding any spatial buffering from.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So the buffering you're going to do is only for noise, not necessarily for impact of an incident that might occur of any of the products it travels along that corridor, knowing that we have high volumes of flammable liquids and other hazardous materials that will travel on that corridor.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No councilwoman there. There isn't a specific distance related to that occurrence.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So. Do I hear you to say that your development would? A but a close proximity to that trip to those tracks? Or are you looking at some kind of setback? And I guess I see Courtney trying to chime in here to see if the city is recommending any distancing from the tracks as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Courtney. Was that addressed at all? The LDR process.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we did talk with the applicant. You know, we have as recommended by the task force, we created a proximity detection feature in Excel to identify project proposals within 200 feet of a rail corridor. And we did talk with development services and that the project during the site development plan phase would be reviewed by the Denver Fire'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and building reviews take into account any needs for life safety requirements and egress when adjacent to rail corridor. But currently there are no specific setbacks or agency specific regulations for development proximate pregnant railroads. But we did bring that up to the applicant.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The proximity is close, but we didn't have any specific regulation to measure it against.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So, Kenneth, where do you plan to place your parking? I'm assuming you're going to have a parking structure with that many units being built on site. What is the placement of the parking garage going to be?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that's what I was going to say during the site development plan. Right now, the the concept plan and we are not a vertical developer here, but we have submitted a concept plan that is that locates the above ground structure on the south part of the site.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so there will you know, again, as part of the step, we don't have a final step related to that or site design, but that is the desire and that was what was actually studied as part of the mobility study, having the the parking structure on the South Side, which would which is what was putting the traffic'",
        "'speaker_2': 'on to be on.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And I would just encourage that you all look at placing it closer to the tracks. I think it would pull the traffic off of the the street for if you put it further back rather than closer to the street, which will create some of the traffic issues that I just heard Mr. Moore talk about a few'",
        "'speaker_0': 'minutes ago. And so that could also be part of your buffering for protecting the residents if there was an incident. And this is something that I think our city is being really lax in addressing in terms of ensuring that we as a city are protecting human life when we are approving these applications and encouraging people to live'",
        "'speaker_0': 'in these developments by sheer, you know, approvals through all of our processes. So let me just see if I have any other ones and I apologize. Madam President, let me just look at my notes here real quick. Yeah, I think we covered all of them.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So thank you very much. And we'll let someone else sort of questions. Thank you. All right. Thank you. Councilman Ortega, Councilman Cashman.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Madam President. Kind of along the lines of Councilwoman Ortega's questioning, you know, Rio Grande companies been in that area as my math tape doing math on the fly. But I get 127 years. And, you know, we've lost enough industry in Denver that I don't want to put roadblocks in front of a long time a neighbor'",
        "'speaker_2': '. And so, you know, the letters that that they sent in, I thought, were actually quite reasonable. They expressed their concerns and just asked to be involved in crafting a solution that works for everybody along the way. And so I guess I would ask Kourtney and Mr. Ho both if you could comment on what your commitment is to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'involving Rio Grande in that discussion as things move forward. Yeah. Councilwoman Katherine, thank you for that question. And we have had several meetings with Mr. Peterson and Rio Grande actually spent almost 2 hours with him a couple of days ago understanding what his concerns are.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we actually spoke with the vertical developer today and confirmed that we'll be introducing the two of them, assuming that this goes forward to to have direct conversations about the future site plan. I think you meant you didn't count some.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I am here to thank you. Courtney, are you there that you can comment on that, please. As to what I guess what I'm asking is what is CPD's? How do you consider these conflicts moving forward where we've got a neighbor who's been doing business and supporting our taxpayers for 127 years and is concerned about their ability to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'continue doing that and making their contribution.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah. And I would defer I'm trying to see if there's someone from Deirdre from development services on. That could help. Can I have comment from the development services perspective because really gets handed over from, you know, redundant planning service to development services.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'For that, I'm looking to see if she. On here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And not.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'No, I'm not seeing. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh, wait. You know, we've got her in the attendees. Her hand is raised, and so we'll go ahead and get her into the panelists. All right, Deirdre, you might have to unmute yourself to answer Councilman Cashman's question or if you need it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Repost.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hi. Yeah, I would like repost. Thank you. I heard my name and then I. Okay. Thank you. Every person.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Go ahead, councilman.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Oh, yeah. So what I was asking thank you for for being here. You know, we've got an industrial neighbor to this proposed project who's been in the neighborhood for over 125 years and has concerns about maintaining their ability to continue doing business with hundreds of truck trips and auto trips a day.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I'm just wondering, as you look at a traffic plan for this development, how much weight goes into something like that, an existing industrial client as well as, you know, residential tenants?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, thanks for the question and not that I would want to pass this up on. Not sure if anyone. Dottie is also on the call by daddy because they review the mobility reports and they actually help with the stopping of those reports.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The Mobility Report is designed to identify all of the traffic background traffic and then of course future traffic associated generated by that development. And so that those mobility reports would take into account what is occurring with current traffic is associated with a current user.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So a neighboring industrial user, anyone in that area within whatever the scope was, whether it was a quarter mile or 500 feet, whatever they decided was appropriate for that study. And then they would determine based on that, you know, what Signalization was required and if there were improvements, that the project just could not accommodate because the traffic'",
        "'speaker_1': 'would become, you know, would overrun the amount of improvements that they could do.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They couldn't get.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Over that issue. Then that, of course, could pose a problem for a project. But in almost every case, in cases like this, you know, it's a smaller site. They've been asked to mitigate accordingly. And there would be a signal.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And of course, they would be looking at where pedestrians are crossing and, you know, whether there are additional lanes or turn lanes associated with new traffic being added to the existing count. So that's kind of my CPD planner view of it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm sure that Dotty has even more information they can provide that's provided during the administrative process of the site development plan review, but it is definitely taken into account during during that process. The LDR, the framework specifically identified a mobility report as something that needed to be done prior to approval of any site development plan, just to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'understand the feasibility and make sure that we understood.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There were any particular key issues that the applicants needed to be aware of going into it. And obviously for them to know if there were really big red flags when it came to traffic.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Thank you very much. And I guess the last thing I would say is getting back to you, Mr. Ho, you said you met with Rio Grande for a couple of hours. You're introducing them to the vertical developer.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'd like I'd like a little stronger commitment on your part to continue to involve them in part of the dialog. I know it's in cases like this, it's really a, you know, a compromise situation. Two heads better than one.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Three heads better than two type of thing. Absolutely. Councilman, Councilman, we've spoke with them on a number of a number of times. And right now, the vertical developer, Camden also is a long term holder. And so they know that they're not they're only going to be neighbors for for a long time here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I think that that kind of dialog, as well as dialog with the rest of the community, there were some, you know, during the LDR process and during the community information meeting, the community had a very strong preference, not locate the to the entrance and exit of the parking structure on the Ellsworth side, which is part of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'why we located down on the South Side and obviously other folks have other interests. I think that there's also a pretty high likelihood that that this light will actually when when all is said and done, may actually facilitate some of the movements from Rio Grande site and make it easier for them to access Santa Fe going north'",
        "'speaker_2': 'from Bayard because of the traffic signal as well. But absolutely, we're happy to have further conversation since we aren't selling the entire site to Camden, we will be part of we will also be neighbors for some time as well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we look forward to being part of that conversation. Thank you, Mr.. Thank you, Madam President. That's all I have.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilman Cashman. And we looked in the attendees and we looked for somebody from Dotty, but unfortunately, we didn't have them in the meeting. So sorry about that, Councilman. Next up, we have Councilwoman Torres.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Madam President. Tennis. I just wanted to make sure. One of the questions that I had when this came to LUDI was about connection to the Santa Fe Arts District and just wanted to make sure that that connection was made and that there was some conversation there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You still.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Can.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You hear me now? Okay, great. Councilwoman Torres? Yes. Thank you very much for the question and for alerting us to the fact that we were part of the Santa Fe Arts District. I know that we're working on changing the R.A. boundaries on the on the city website.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We did reach out to Ms.. Shayna Belton, the board chair, I believe, of Santa Fe. Our sister had both a meeting with her and then her presentation to the entire board. And based on that, you know, we followed up with her and she didn't have any specific concerns.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But we also welcome continuing a dialog with her and introducing her to the Oracle developer as well. So thank you very much for that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you for doing that. My only other question in this, we chatted about.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This a little bit.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'At committee, but given Councilman Ortega's questions.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'About.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Orienting parking toward the south where.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The rail.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Lines currently are, how would it impact your development or your plans for that property if in the future that moves those lines and they end up on kind of the northeast corner of that property?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah, based on my understanding of the seat change, it would actually remove the lines from the south and southwest of our property and actually move it beyond our northwestern boundary. So if that change happens, then we would not be under any influence of that other than potentially how they how they do a grade separated track at all'",
        "'speaker_2': 'of the intersections to the east of us. And the plans are far from certain as to how all that will work. So good question. But if they actually do that, make that change would actually reduce the significantly reduce the train, automobile, pedestrian and bicycle interactions around our site.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Those are my questions. Thank you, Madam Chair.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Madam President, to you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman. Next up, we have Councilman Sawyer.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Madam President. So I just need a little bit of clarification around the vertical developer who's, I guess, coming in next. So the the agreements that you've got with hosts, Kenneth, are those do those run with the land then?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is that will those covenants be binding on the vertical developer as well?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's correct, Councilwoman, that the those commitments are actually part of the. ANDREWS Andrew can answer them as well, but they're part of the development agreement. And so it's it runs with title. But I know Mr.. Mr. Johnson wants to address that specifically.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Andrew, do you want to jump in or. I feel like that was a good enough clarification. But if there's something else.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Excuse me, I'm you know, it's true. Around the land, there will be a covenant against the land.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Perfect. Thank you. Okay. And then just in terms of clarification around the zoning and the waivers, so there is no other in our in our zoning code. There is no other way to do what you want to do here than without waivers.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's just my understanding that it is our goal in our zoning code, Courtney, to not use waivers in general that the purpose is to of of our form based zoning code was.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To do away.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'With waivers and it is often as we can. So why are we doing waivers in this instance?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes, great. Great question. And it is a complicated rezoning with a lot of different moving parts. Through the LR process, it became clear that enhanced design was needed for this site based on community feedback. And so we we use the seven as, you know, something that we had an existing tool that we can use for these transitioning'",
        "'speaker_3': 'innovation flex districts. And that using this existing tool, we know that it might need to be customized a bit to fit in this specific location. And the applicant suggested to waivers. And those waivers we evaluated and we felt that the the policy was meant that, you know, a bridge to a future text amendment or, you know, in'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that thing that we we don't know if we're specifically going to do change the the seven. But we know that there is some issues with these two aspects. So it does meet the policy that we have for waivers in custom zoning.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. So I guess I understand that it means the policy that we have for custom zoning. But it. Doesn't that doesn't explain why we're using custom zoning in the first place. Really? So I guess can you flesh that out a little bit for me?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah. So the the innovation project setting blueprint in envisions including residential uses. You know, with the industry today doesn't have those standards in place to ensure a well-designed mixed use outcome. So by applying the design overlay, we're not going to get entirely residential outcome.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And that, you know, we can get some commercial uses here by applying the DOT seven. Okay. Does that make sense?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think so. You seemed like you sort of like jumped in and you seemed like you wanted to say something else. I thought it does. It's totally fine. Sorry about that. Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'No, no, no. It's like, uh, you know, this is a, I think that the G-7, it is applying an existing tool, but it's a way for us to get enhance design, get from a mix of commercial uses so we don't end up with a entirely residential product here.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. So this is going to give you the flexibility to put in the commercial that you need in the development as well. It's a kind of fill out that the bottom floor space. And activate that. Is that. Is that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is that what you're saying?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yep. Yep. Got it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. All right. Perfect. Thank you. I think that's that pretty much answers my question. Thanks, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilman. Next up, we have Councilman Sandoval.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Madam President. So, Courtney or Kenneth, I have a question for you. So on the overlay and they did see oh seven, it talks about feet. Can you talk to me about that in percentages? So of the waiver that you're proposing, what percentage of the building would be active street use?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I am going to need to do some quick math. Councilwoman. Maybe Courtney might be doing that as well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah. Because I mean, I write the waiver and I'm working on one for Tennyson. But people think percentage is not these feet that you're talking about. I need to know the percentage that we're talking about here.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Right. You know, I think it's interesting here because in this, you know, in this area is unique because both Santa Fe, Cal Math and Ellsworth, based on the the standards in the code would likely be designated primary streets.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so that's why the deal seven has so much of that nonresidential active street frontage that, you know, you'd see in Reno, you wouldn't see three primary streets. It does that that doesn't typically occur. It's typically it's like one, you know, maybe two.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So it doesn't really account for the three primary streets of the waiver is helping us apply this existing tool in this location. You know under the standard I think they would have to have normally. About what does that 200 and.'",
        "'speaker_3': '15 linear feet of nonresidential active use. Is that correct, Kenneth? I think we did the math, so.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so it's going down to 185 feet.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah. So what's the average? So there has to be a formula there. You would have had to do a formula. I didn't. You can do a formula where like you're trying to meet a goal of how much of a building where how much active are you trying to get to?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You're trying to get to 40%. Are you trying to get 50% or you trying to get to 70% trying to get in that sweet spot? 60%. That's that's what I'm trying to figure out with this waiver. Because what I'm doing and the reason I'm asking this is because I've never seen a designer really have a waiver before'",
        "'speaker_1': '. I've just seen a design overlay be redesigned and implement a new iOS eight or nine. That's what we were told we're doing and we've been working on on Tennyson Street. I'm trying to figure out where you're trying to get to on this active street use.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Like, is it going to be 50%? What's the goal?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I believe it's a 400 foot block and for the 185 feet would go to about 46%.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And yeah, so that, you know, and again, specific designs are. Are going to be determined during the inspection process.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So a little under 50% of their commission would be active street. Then is there a requirement, Courtney, in the design, the seven that talks about doors like how many feet a new door should be so that you don't have these big open spaces that don't get leased and don't get have rent and don't.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So you keep them a little bit smaller, but then you can break them up as they go on. Go on. Do you understand what I mean? I think you probably and.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes, yes, I talked to Christopher Johnson. You know, we've been in contact about the Berkeley Regis overlay. And I know that I think that the Berkeley Regis overlay that you've been working on and we'll have a standard talking about a frequency of entrances, is that what you're talking about?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The deal seven doesn't have that standard. And I think that, you know, those smaller embedded neighborhood commercial areas that the the Berkeley Regis design overlay will address, you know, that rhythm and cadence of those entrances is important for those smaller embedded neighborhood commercial areas.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But as I said, the Deal seven doesn't have a design standard existing currently to address that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. And then. Was it Ken or Courtney? Was it through the LDR process that you did that you decided that this site needed the design overlay? Or was that something that you had thought about prior?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That was through the LDR process.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. It was a recommendation through the processes that would I.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Okay. And then. And then can when you breathe, how much of the how much of this site will you keep and will you redevelop as a vertical developer?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hard to predict the future, Councilwoman Sandoval. Right now, where we would we would hope to, you know, of the kind of three main parcels. If you talk about the rectangle and the triangles, we're looking probably at one of the triangles being something that we would hold on to and develop ourselves.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's hard to hard to predict what the different markets are. We really actually had considered this site as potentially moving our offices to. Unfortunately, right now, the office market is a little bit challenging, but we hope that that will improve in the future.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we're still hoping to do that in the future.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So. You bet. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilman Sandoval. We've got Councilman Ortega at your back up in the queue. Yes, I am. One last question. So, Kenneth, I'm not sure if you would be the better person or Courtney to answer this question, but given that Santa Fe is a state highway, I would suspect that they would have to weigh in'",
        "'speaker_0': 'on adding a signal at that location. I know when the folks were working on the Gates project and they were talking about putting a signal on on Santa Fe on the southbound traffic side that involved that will involve course final approval.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So can you just speak to whether or not anybody has talked about that just yet? I know it's a little you know, it may be a little premature, but you at least want to know that going in. Right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Whether or not that will be approved. So has anybody done that? Kenneth. Here, you're muted. So here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah. Thanks again, Counselor Ortega. So we have spoken with kids, not specifically about this. Like we were actually talking to them about some of their plans around.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The realignment of.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The realignment of the railroad tracks. That's correct. And and what at least my understanding and certainly, Courtney, please correct me if I'm wrong. Well, this is a state highway. I believe that Denver actually has in this section of it, because it's not part of that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's I believe it's actually controlled by Dottie. Because they said that they are a referral agency, but they will not make that final. He suggested that it would not be their final decision here. But in any case, we have spoken with them, they're aware of it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And they've I think we included one of the letters that they had no opinion, but we had we hadn't gotten into that level of a site specific, but they.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Would have to give final sign off, even though he has some you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Know, I think that's more of a city. But but yeah, like I said.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Can you clarify that?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think that they are a referral agency and they will they'll get the application and they'll have an opportunity to review it. I'm not. In terms of who has the trump card or the ultimate authority. I am not I couldn't speak to 100% certainty.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If I may, I could add clarification to that. The court jurisdiction actually ends at Alameda. So it's from Alameda. Okay. This section is fully and entirely under Denver City and county of Denver control.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Got it. Thank you for that, Matt, and we appreciate this go round. Q Madam President, I have no further questions. All right. Thanks for jumping in there, Matt, to answer that question. Thank you, Councilman Ortega. The public hearing for Council Bill 20 Dash 0815 has closed comments by members of Council Councilman Clark.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Madam President. I think that there is certainly some things that warrant more discussion as we move through this. But there's a lot to be excited about here. You know, for the community, this has been a vacant building that takes up an entire block for some for over five years.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And and what we have through this process and I love that this went through that LDR is, you know, a new affordable, affordable housing plan. This gets deeper into the arms than the last one that we had in front of us with 75% at 80% or less of AMI an additional 40 units beyond the seven that would'",
        "'speaker_2': 'have been required. And 25% of those will be two bedrooms and 25%, three bedrooms, which are really, really critical and really missing in Denver as a critical need for affordable housing for families. We also have 10% open space.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think that the walkability, the activation of the main floors, that's something that we have to deal with. We have a plan that we didn't even talk about here because it's a seat off plan for Alameda where the community was promised a bike head bridge at Bayard to get across the Valley Highway and over to the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'South Platte River. That's going to land right there. We already have today. Stranahan Is the copper door coffee shop Crazy Brewery. There are, there's a barbecue place, there's a board game place and I was takeout food movement, climbing and fitness that's all over there on that side.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And you have the entire community. People are already walking and biking across here. We have to plan for that and I think we can do that in a way that works for our industrial partners. But the truth of this area is it is not all industrial anymore.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There are places, breweries, places where people are going to grab a drink, a coffee, where people are walking. And we have to look at how do we get them across, you know, a road that has really only been designed for cars and for cars to be going very fast if we're really committed Division Zero, this is an'",
        "'speaker_2': 'area where we have to be doing that with or without this project. And this project helps catalyze some of the work that we need to be doing that we probably should have already done. So I think it's an important piece of that that that adds in to that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know, I really want to thank applicants for working repeatedly, not just checking the box and saying, hey, we reached out to the R.A., but being present, hosting meetings, being at our no meetings, really working with the neighborhood around this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And this is something that the neighborhood supports and is excited about. So I think, you know, so more conversations as we continue to grapple with our city and its evolution, not just in areas that are industrial, that are adding new uses and breweries that also have food trucks in front of them, that have traditionally been in more'",
        "'speaker_2': 'industrial areas. But also, as we evolved from a city that was built around the automobile to a city that is built around moving people, we're going to continue to grapple with some of these things. And I think that this is a great opportunity to do that and to start to make progress.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I will be supporting this tonight and then and I would ask my colleagues to support it as well. Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Clark. And I will go ahead and add my comments that this rezoning passes all the criteria and the guidelines. And it's really exciting to finally see something happening on this site. And so I will be supporting it as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Madam Secretary.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Roll call, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'After I.'",
