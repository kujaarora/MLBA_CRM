        "'speaker_3': 'so many different people from our community in our in our council chambers. It was a very beautiful piece of artwork that you presented to us earlier, and it is exactly the spirit that we drafted this proclamation and this actual the ordinance that created Indigenous Peoples Day when we sat down and wrote it and as a community we'",
        "'speaker_3': 'couldn't think of anything else to begin except for the confluence of the two rivers. And those confluence of two rivers created such a great city and we live in such an amazing city, and we were all proud of it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And sometimes we and a lot of people from all over the country, all over the world, are proud of it and sometimes a little too proud of it. It's time to go back home. But I'm I'm kidding when I say that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But the really nice thing about this is that we are celebrating indigenous peoples day out of pride for who we are, who we are as a city, and the contributions of indigenous people to the city. Not out of spite, not out of a replacement of one culture over the other, or or out of contempt or or disrespect'",
        "'speaker_3': '. You know, I think of a quote that Cesar Chavez made very, very popular. And it stuck with me for a very long time. And in any way any time I have the opportunity, I do speak in front of children and especially children in our community that, you know, they often second guess themselves and where they're coming from'",
        "'speaker_3': ', who they are. And and I always say that, you know, it's it's very important to be proud of where you're from. And the quote that I used from Cesar Chavez is, you know, pride in one's own cultures does not require contempt or disrespect of another.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Right. And that's very important. It's very important for us to recognize that no matter who we are, where we come from in this society, that your pride in your own culture doesn't require to not require the contempt or disrespect of another man.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'What a year to be for that to just sit on our shoulders for a while for us to think about. Right. And so I wanted to just to thank you all. I think the commission there's going to be a couple individuals that are going to come speak.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you for your art, your lovely artwork, for us to see what's in your heart and what now has become a probably is going to be a very important symbol for the community and also just for the work, the daily work every single day.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We still have a lot of brothers and sisters whose ancestors once lived in these lands freely, now stand on street corners, right in poverty without access to services, right. Without access to sobriety or even housing or jobs. And what a what a.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'What a cruel way to pay back a culture that has paved the way for the city to be built upon its shores. Right. So we have a lot of work to do and these kind of proclamations and this day is not a day off.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's a day on. And Denver. Right. And addressing those those as critical issues. So I know that my colleagues are very supportive. I'm going to ask you to support this proclamation, as I know you always have done in the past.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm very proud of today. Oh, and we made Time magazine and Newsweek once again today as being a leader in terms of the cities that are celebrating Indigenous Peoples Day. I wanted to make a point out of that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman Lopez, and thank you for sponsoring this. Councilman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Mr. President, I'm going to ask my name be added. I don't think I could add much more to what Councilman Lopez has shared with us. I want to thank him for bringing this forward and really just appreciate all the contributions that our Native American community has contributed to this great city and great state.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I worked in the lieutenant governor's office when the Commission on Indian Affairs was created and had the benefit of being able to go down to the Four Corners for a peace treaty signing ceremony between the Utes and the Comanches that had been sort of that at odds with each other for about 100 years.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And just being able to participate in that powwow was pretty awesome. So and for those of you who continue to participate in the annual powwow, it's it's such a great opportunity for everybody else to enjoy so many of the contributions of the culture.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I mean, to see that the dance continues to be carried on as well as as the native language from generation to generation is just so incredible because in so many cultures, you know, people have come here and assimilated to the the you know, the norms here, and they lose their language and and lose a lot of the'",
        "'speaker_6': 'culture and in the native community that that hasn't happened. That has that, you know. Commitment to just passing that on from generation to generation is so important. And so I'm happy to be a co-sponsor of this tonight. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. Thank you, Councilwoman Ortega, Councilwoman Kenney.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you very much. And I also want to thank my colleague for bringing this forward. And I just wanted to to say a word to the artist about how beautiful and moving I thought this logo was and your description of it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think one of the things that is clear is, you know, the words sometimes don't convey the power of imagery or music or the other pieces that make up culture. And so I think the art is so important.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And when you talked about water, I was also thinking about land and I guess I just wanted to say thank you. Many of the Native American peoples of Colorado have been at the forefront or actually nationally of defending some of the the public lands that have been protected over the last few years that are under attack right'",
        "'speaker_2': 'now. And there places that you are the communities have fought to protect, but that everyone gets to enjoy. And so I just think that it's an example of where cultural preservation intersects with environmental protection, with, you know, recreation and all of the other ways that that public lands are so important.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I think I just wanted to say thank you for that, because I think we have some very sacred places in our country that are at risk right now. And so as we celebrate, I appreciate that there's still a piece of resistance in here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think that I just want to mention a solidarity and a mention, a feeling of solidarity with that resistance. So thank you and happy Confluence Week.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Can each and see no other comments? I'll just say a couple. And in a time of such divisive ugliness and just despicable behavior from our leadership, the reason I'm so supportive of indigenous peoples days because it means inclusivity.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It means respecting all, respecting those who have been silenced on purpose for a long time and whose history has not been told. And so we celebrate inclusivity in the face of such such evil times. Honestly, it is really evil times right now in confluence and inclusivity, in communion with community is what we're trying to be about and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'what we're trying to do. So thank you, Councilman Lopez, for embodying that and reminding us of who we are with that. Madam Secretary, do you think DC is listening? I'm just maybe not okay with that. Madam Secretary.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'I play salsa. Very. And as a result.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'And this year it's October 4th through October 14th, 2017.
