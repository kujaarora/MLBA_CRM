They're essential because nowadays families work and they're working one or two jobs and they're switching off back and forth.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And they're essential also because these kids just love homework and they love school and they just cannot get enough of it. And they even told me, perhaps we should pass an ordinance that creates more homework. Right. Didn't you guys told me that?'",

        "'speaker_7': 'It might have been the opposite. It might have been the opposite. It might have been the opposite where I was being lobbied really hard since they were here. So we know that we won't pass that ordinance, but it is amazing.'",

The city has been a member of the Denver Afterschool Alliance for a long time, already under the leadership of MAXINE Quintana, who's in the Mayor's Office of Education and Children and DPS.

        "'speaker_8': 'And that's you guys.

        "'speaker_1': 'So I really support the programing. And then later, as an adult, when my son was born, I did a lot of volunteering in the after school program at Lake IB. They have an after school gardening program and we worked to help get vegetable and flower beds built there so that the kids could participate and learn how to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'grow some of their own food, which they later used to sell in a farmer's market program at the school. And like got to learn how to start a business and learn some entrepreneurial skills about marketing and interacting with customers and customer service.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think that that the skills that children can be exposed to and learn in these afterschool programs really go, you know, above and beyond what might be taught in the curriculum at school. And I sort of want to echo what Councilman Brooks was saying, is that with all the cuts to our education systems, so much of'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the the core curriculum is really being narrowed into very specific bands of learning. And through the after school programs, I think you can really get exposed to, you know, a whole range of things that you might not have the opportunity to learn about.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'During your regular school days. So I'm a huge fan and very supportive of the programing and of this proclamation. Thank you so much, Councilman Lopez, for bringing it forward.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Then Councilwoman Schaeffer. Councilman Lopez, you have another comment? You know.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I forgot to mention something and the reason why and I further mention the reason why there was sit in the front and there was a particular reason why they did. And I think we had a little discussion earlier, and they they realize that there's so many people around this world, so many kids their age in this world'",
        "'speaker_7': 'that would do anything at risk their lives to do anything just so that they can come have an opportunity to learn and to be at their same schools. And I don't think they'd be sitting in the back now, would we?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It'd be sitting up in front. And there are so many people who fought throughout our history so that they could sit in the front and not the back. And I, I think I heard them say something about I mean, I asked them where they were going to sit when they were going to go to college.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I forgot, what are you guys going to sit in the front? Were they not going to sit by? And when they go back to Greenly, where are they going to go in the front? So I wanted to provide some context.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'm just blown away by these kids. And you're right, Councilman, we are going to have a bright future with these children. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Councilman Lopez, do we have any other comments from members of council seen on Madam Secretary, roll call.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'And Cesar headed to what's cool. USC, right? Yeah, USC. All right.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Good. Thank you, Councilman Lopez. Thank you. City council. And want to express just a few words of appreciation for on behalf of the school district and also the Denver Afterschool Alliance board for the city council, the mayor, Mayor Hancock support and the support of Denver residents for the work we're doing across the city to improve the quality'",
        "'speaker_8': 'and access to very high quality afterschool programs for all of Denver's youth. So, Councilman Lopez, you know, piggyback a little bit on what you said they were telling me earlier. They're coming to the school board Thursday night and they're advocating for a policy for more homework for for at the board level.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So maybe we'll be hearing more about that. I think everybody's really excited. So a couple of words about the Denver Afterschool Alliance. It's a collaborative of stakeholders, including the city and county of Denver, Denver Public Schools, many of Denver's community based funding groups, as well as afterschool providers.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And the work we're doing is focused around a vision that every child in Denver who needs afterschool programs has access to them so that we create a city where kids are safe, they're inspired to learn, they're prepared for success now and in the future.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'What we do in the Denver After School Alliance is we serve as an intermediary. What that means is we're a group that provides insight and technical assistance, and we are driving improvements across the after school space that are focused around data driven decision making, quality improvements, and the use of tools that allow us to chart access to'",
        "'speaker_8': 'high quality programs across the city and improve outcomes for kids. So that's really what our work is about. Don't to just say it's an honor to receive the proclamation. As the co-chair of the Denver Afterschool Alliance Board before you, you have a packet of material that's about the work we're doing.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You have information in there that you may share with your constituents about how to find access to afterschool programs. In the city and county of Denver, we have an online locator system that can be found conveniently on the city's website at WW dot Denver Gov Dawg Slash Denver Afterschool Alliance.'",

The club gave me social skills, confidence, leadership and happiness that I didn't know I had with all the opportunities that arose from becoming a member of the Boys and Girls Club.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I attend the club on a regular basis 3 to 4 times a week because it gives me a chance to relax, hang out with friends, play basketball. Stay on top of all my schoolwork. And it's also a safe place to call home.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The first word that comes to mind when the Boys and Girls Club is brought up is family. That's what the Boys and Girls Club means to me. It means coming together as a community, disregarding race, age, gender, and any differences that make us human.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'With the Boys and Girls Club, we come together as a whole to better ourselves and our community so that we are able to get something out of life. The second word that comes to mind is future. And that's also what the club means to me.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It means preparing yourself for the future in the real world so you don't have to struggle throughout life, all with the helping hand to guide you there, of course. I started at the Boys and Girls Club looking for a signature from Marcus can be former Nuggets player.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I did not expect to walk out with a great future ahead of me. I participated, accomplished and done so many things with the club, from sports to the team leadership program to community service to homework help to to being a role model to the younger members.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I've done it, and I'm glad to say that it is only a little part of what I've done. Without the club, I. Without the club, I don't know where I would be. And probably I'll run in the streets or at home sleeping, probably doing something that I shouldn't be doing.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I have to thank the Boys and Girls Club and the director, Julio, for that, for being there, taking me in and helping me realize what I want out of life. Quality afterschool programs really do make a difference and are important for kids and teens like me.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'If you don't believe me, look at Smokey Robinson, Denzel Washington, or even Shaq, all alumni of the Boys and Girls Club. I would like to close this off by saying A great future starts off with the positive attitude to stay positive and productive, and you too shall have a great future ahead of you.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'And then you can see some of the higher density campus buildings to the north. The image in the middle shows the site again with the in this case, Colfax Viaduct is on the left of the image and the billboard.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There is the existing billboard on the site that will remain. And then the image on the bottom shows the kind of typical development in this area, which is the one story warehouse kind of industrial flex type uses. I'm in terms of the process that this rezoning request has been through.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It went to planning board on August six. They voted unanimously to recommend approval. They went to the Neighborhood and Planning Committee September 17th. And now we're here tonight for the city council public hearing. All of the notification requirements have been met, which included posting the property 21 days prior to this hearing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We did receive a letter of support from the affected R.A. in this area, which is the Lincoln Park Neighborhood Association. And I'm very quickly walk through the review criteria that apply to all rezoning requests. First, the consistency with adopted plans in this case, comp plan 2000 Blueprint Denver apply as well as to small area plans.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So in terms of comp plan 2000, there are three main areas where we find this rezoning is in compliance with the plan strategies that relate to promoting infill development in areas that already have infrastructure and development, promoting mixed use communities as well as quality development that is compatible with surrounding neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And it also supports goals in the plans that relate to promoting high quality educational institutions like the Area Campus Blueprint. Denver was adopted several years before the campus engaged in the master planning process to consider moving the athletic fields to the south.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So it actually shows this area as an industrial and yes, it does show this entire area as an area of change. And since Blueprint Denver, we've adopted to local area plans that are more up to date with the campus plans.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The first one law, Lincoln Park Neighborhood Plan. This was adopted in 2010. And you can see the site has a blue star there. It is shown as a recreational use. So this proposed use is in compliance with that plan.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And the other applicable city adopted plan is the area west station plan, which also shows the site as recreation and open space use. And this is not an adopted city plan. But I did want to note that the Area Higher Education Center does have a master plan.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They updated it in 2012 to show the concept of the athletic complex here, expanding south past the Colfax Viaduct that is shown here and per the zone district that's proposed when zoning staff does development review. The master plan, as well as the design guidelines that have been adopted by the Education Center for this campus will be considered'",
        "'speaker_1': 'as part of review in terms of justifying circumstances, we do find that there have been changed conditions. The ownership for these two pieces have changed, as well as newly adopted plans that show this land becoming part of the Ariah Area Higher Education campus.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we also find that there's consistency with the neighborhood context and zone district purpose and intent. The campus education institutions own district are intended for these types of campuses, and as I noted before, the rest of the campus has the zoning that the applicant is requesting.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So based on compliance with these criteria, we do recommend approval.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And that's why. Thank you, Michelle Walter. We have two speakers for this public hearing and you all can come up to the front pew. Sean Nesbitt and Paul Galan.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Good evening. My name is Sean Nesbit and the director of Facilities Planning for Metropolitan State University of Denver. And I'm here to answer any questions you might have.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. Nesbitt. Nesbitt. Paul Galan. Paul Garland with DAVIES partnership architects and hair supporting. Any questions?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Sean may not be able to answer.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'All right. Thank you. Well, it is now time for that concludes our speakers is now time for questions of members of council. Councilwoman Canete.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. President. This is probably for Paula. I was just wondering if you can talk about what the pedestrian connectivity will be to get across Colfax, whether there are, you know, existing safe crossings or whether that's part of planning that you're talking about with the city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Great use. I'm just concerned about the safety of students crossing Colfax, and I realize we're under the viaduct and it's lower traffic. But I still feel like it's a it's a pretty hairy some some hairy spots down there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And just wondering what this one looks like.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes, I'm used to going to the capital capitol of iniquity and they so whenever I see in the we are the pedestrian connection from campus to that area was already pretty strong as far as the sidewalks we've connected them as well with, you know, accessible curves up and down there.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We've added ADA parking to the area, we've added pedestrian lights along the side as well. Then there's street lighting around the facility. We've added emergency call centers like we have around our campus as well. So that has been incorporated within the campus.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think we still probably have some work to do on on lighting from the fields into campus, but that's something we need to look at with the the other three institutions as well. But it's been pretty well incorporated to be a part of campus and not an island separated from campus.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And if I may, Mr. President, one additional question.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Go right ahead.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I was just wondering if you'd had any conversations. It's great. You have good neighborhood support. Do you anticipate that the field will be available or are there any intentions to try to make a community connection? I think, you know, it's it's a big move south of Colfax.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think it's great that you've built the trust with the community to have that support. But is there any connection possible?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes, there is. We've been we hired an associate athletic director this summer who is specifically in charge of the facility operations. And in those few months, the athletic director and associate athletic director have been working with Denver Parks and Rec on how to program the site.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So they just had a meeting last Friday. I haven't gotten the download yet, but we are reaching out to the Lincoln Park Neighborhood Association and believe it, their November board meeting or neighborhood association meeting to discuss the plans moving forward.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'This complex will come online in the spring. It'll be substantial completion right at the end of January or early February. And so the athletic department has been working with Denver Parks and Rec and other grants that they've been getting from baseball for tomorrow, which is returning baseball to the inner city program.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And Denver Parks and Rec are working on types of programs that we will have when we're not using it for intercollegiate athletics or academics, the summertime, the weekends, the evenings and things like that. So that partnership is really important to us, and we've stressed it every time we go to the neighborhood associations on how to make this'",
        "'speaker_8': 'open to the public. And so that will be really important. One of the connections we want to look at a year ago and want to continue to look at is that that pedestrian connection from our site to the park, which is a little rough on 13th Avenue.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So whatever help we could get from the city, planning on that would be great. But we've walked it a few times on how we can improve that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you so much. No further.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Questions.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Kennedy. Councilman Monteiro.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Isn't there a memorandum of understanding that meets you or your area? Foundation has with llama Lincoln Park.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Correct. There is.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yes. Utilizing the campus new facility in Memphis.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'There is an IOU that was signed when they purchased when the campus purchased the property at the end of 2008. Right. And that's this relationship. And the special staff that we've hired is staying with that MSU that we make sure we are reaching out to them.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And we're will that MSU that will be between the neighborhood and and the area. But will you have that on file and in the neighborhood group.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. Mean, I just have two more questions. Can you tell me what? So this is for two addresses, right? For 1550 West Colfax and then for 1400 Cottonwood Street. Correct. So what's going to be the address?'",
        "'speaker_8': '1600 West Colfax Avenue is the complex address.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. So so these addresses will go away.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes. Yes. We just want one address for the for the site. We do have one on a restroom facility now, because that was part of phase one. And it's on Shoshone and it's 1310, I believe, right around there for the restroom.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Now, phase two, we want everything to be under the one address to 1600 West Colfax that these two addresses. So I'm not mistaken were the the addresses on the parcels may purchase them they were separate parcels. One was Denver Housing Authority and one was from Beth Go.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Both were purchased in 2013.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. And then I just have one other question. So it's my understanding that you guys were going to install the B bike stations. Did that happen near the BALLFIELDS?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'No, that wasn't in our design. The Prairie campus was looking at installing them near the westbound light rail station, and I'm not sure where that is in development.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Can you follow up on that?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Absolutely. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'All right. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilman Monteiro. Are there any other questions from members of council? Seen none public 9669 is closed time for comments from members of Council.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Councilwoman Monteiro Thank you, Mr. President. I want to let the public and my colleagues know that we've been working on this for quite some time, and there's been an intensive community outreach effort by the by the property owner.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And there is a great deal of support, especially by llama Lincoln Park neighborhood, who states that MSU is a vital institution in Denver and a very valued neighborhood, neighborhood neighbor. So what I want to say is that all of this looks pretty simple, but there's been a lot of work that's backed this up and a lot of'",
        "'speaker_11': 'steps that have taken and it's gone through all of the proper mechanisms, including following the law. The Lincoln Park Neighborhood Plan and the planning board vote, which was August 6th, approving this. So I, I am supporting what we have in front of us and encouraging my colleagues to do the same.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilman Monteiro. Do we have any other comments from members of council seeing? None. Madam Secretary.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Mr. President. And good evening, council members. I'm Kyle Dalton with the Department of Community Planning and Development. This rezoning is an application at 1520 Graves Street from U2 C to UMC to it's located in the current Council District eight in the South Park Hill statistical neighborhood, the south edge, just north of Colfax Avenue on Grape'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Street. The request is to rezone the property to to add more dwelling units to the existing structure. The structure sits on a 19,500 square foot parcel with an existing two story apartment building and under the current two unit t use zoning.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Multi-unit uses are allowed as a conforming use, but they cannot be expanded to add more units. And so the applicant here is requesting to rezone in order to enable that. Although I'll note that rezonings do not prove a specific land use proposal or development project.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So the request, as I mentioned, is UMC to that stands for the Urban Neighborhood Context. The M. S is for Main Street, which it is adjacent to along the Colfax corridor, and the two is for the two storey maximum height.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Adjacent properties are also zoned in the UMC family UMC three along Colfax, and then you see a two unit district to the north and west and finally U.S. to be a single unit district to the east. As I mentioned, the existing uses, multifamily and along the rest of this block is also additional multifamily.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'On the 1500 block of Grape Street, there's commercial and retail mixed use all along Colfax and a mix of single family and multifamily further afield in the surrounding neighborhood. An existing context is generally of a 1 to 2 story in scale, a mix of residential forms, single unit two, unit multi-unit apartment buildings.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'As you see on the upper photo on this screen, the middle photo is the subject property, the existing two storey apartment building. And the lower photo is an example of the one story commercial forms you see along Colfax.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'This one is located immediately south of the subject property. In terms of process. The application was first for a different zone District two U-M's three the three story zone district. After receiving considerable feedback from the neighborhood, the applicant rescheduled their planning board hearing a couple of times and changed their application to UMC two, which is what is'",
        "'speaker_8': 'before you tonight. Ultimately, the Planning Board public hearing was held on August 21st of 2014, and following those revisions, there was one comment at the planning board and it was in favor of the application. And then the Planning Board voted unanimously to recommend approval.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The application proceeded. The Neighborhoods and Planning Committee was moved out in September, and that is before you tonight at a at this public hearing. We provided written notification to the registered neighborhood organizations and four of them have provided comment on the application all in support as indicated on your screen.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'All of these, I should note that the Greater Park Hill community incorporated no letter of support was received following that change in the application to UMC two and includes conditions with the applicant that they are meeting outside of the zoning regarding the future of their property and what they can use it for.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And the applicant has made those arrangements and can probably speak better to that since they are outside of the zoning. We also received some emails on this rezoning case. They are included in your packet, but they were all when the application was for U-M's three before it was revised to U-M's two.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That revision happened as as a result of a community mediation that was orchestrated by the the Council District Office here with staff, the applicant and the registered neighborhood organizations and neighbors here. And so following that mediation, the application was revised and the letter from Greater Park Hill community and support was received.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'There are five review criteria for this application and I'll go through them quickly. The first is we find the rezoning application to be consistent with adopted plans, and there are three plans that apply on the site. First is comprehensive plan 2000.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And generally, we find that this application is consistent with the strategies and the goals of Comprehensive Plan 2000 regarding promoting infill development in locations where infrastructure and services are in place, encouraging quality infill consistent with the character of the surrounding neighborhood, and continuing to promote mixed use development.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'This map amendment, this rezoning, would enable reuse of a multifamily structure in a neighborhood location near for high frequency transit where infrastructure is already in place. And so we find it to be consistent with comp plan 2000. Moving to Blueprint Denver, The Citywide Transportation and Land Use Plan Blueprint Denver identifies a concept land use of pedestrian shopping'",
        "'speaker_8': 'corridor for this site, as is one of the relatively uncommon sites where that pedestrian shopping corridor designation extends north and south of Colfax Avenue. So in this case, where Blueprint Denver advocates and a pedestrian shopping corridor land use, that means generally the same kinds of mixed uses of commercial, retail office or residential as a town center or'",
        "'speaker_8': 'neighborhood center, but oriented in a linear, linear pattern. It's also designated as an area of change in Blueprint Denver, which are the areas where the city has identified redevelopment possibilities and specifically along East Colfax. The plan calls for introducing mixed uses in order to support the major bus corridor along Colfax.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And we find, again, the application to be consistent with those land use recommendations in terms of future street classifications. Colfax As a mixed use arterial group street itself is a non-designated local. But but the rezoning will further the mixed use nature of the Colfax Avenue corridor moving into the Park Hill Neighborhood Plan, which was adopted in 2000'",
        "'speaker_8': 'before Blueprint Denver. The Neighborhood Plan doesn't have specific land use or building height guidance, but it does seek to assure that growth and development in Park Hill results in a balanced and compatible mix of housing types and densities, and that there be transitions between the development along Colfax Avenue and the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The U-M's to Zone District is aptly selected to do this. It actually provides a height transition from the three stories on Colfax down to the lower scale buildings already found in the neighborhood. And of course, our main street districts across the board have up building form standards and new standards that ensure residential protection where adjacent.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So there are additional if the building were to be expanded in the future, it would be subject to those residential protections in terms of setbacks and the like. So we find this application to be consistent with the neighborhood plan.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We also find it to be consistent with the second and third review criteria that uniformity of district regulations will be preserved and the application will further the public health, safety and welfare of the city, primarily through the implementation of the adopted plans.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The fourth criteria that there be a justifying circumstance for the application. This application is justified by the change in the surrounding environs. The significant redevelopment of the area along the Colfax corridor and the rezoning does recognize that change character in terms of adding more, more people who can live near the mixed use corridor and support the businesses'",
        "'speaker_8': 'that are thriving along Colfax. So we find it consistent with that. Finally, the application needs to be consistent with the neighborhood context, the zone district purpose and intent here. The UMC two zone district that is selected is consistent with the you urban neighborhood context that surrounds it.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It's also designed again to apply primarily in areas served by local streets, embedded within a local an existing neighborhood where a scale of 1 to 2 stories is desired. Here we find that the existing building scale of 1 to 2 stories is existing and is desire to continue as indicated by the residents.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So we find that that criterion is met. And so having found that all five criteria are met, CPD recommends approval.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. We have two speakers for this for seven or nine, Jim Hartman and Bob Gulick. So, Mr. Hartman, you can come on up and begin your remarks. Thank you, Mr. President. Jim Hartman, manager of Hartman Neely Investments, 2120 BlueBell Avenue in Boulder.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we'd just like to say a few things about our building here and tell you a little bit about our reason for the rezoning. Our company specializes in sustainable community creation, mostly through the renovation of historic buildings through the decades in Denver.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Other examples are recently in Lowery, Hangar two and Steam Plant Lofts and downtown, some of the loft buildings downtown. And we purchased this building in January of this year with the intent to reinforce some of the things that Kyle talked about.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Blueprint Denver this being an area of change, creating workforce housing along a transit corridor, all the things that Denver is known for in terms of good learning, urban planning and land use. To date, we've put in a new accessible entry so the building is more usable for seniors.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We've planted some street trees from the Denver Digs program, done some signage, lighting, bike racks, all to make the building a little bit more friendly. The important issues for our application are that, as mentioned, it's a blueprint blueprint Denver area of change.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The current zoning is really for duplex use, and even though it's got a conforming use category, it's not so good if the building were ever substantially damaged or destroyed by fire. For lenders and insurers, that presents a problem.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So the zoning will help with that. Again, would like to provide moderately priced workforce housing one bedroom for 750 or so a month, two bedroom for 950 a month. So that some of the folks that are working along the transit corridor in downtown have a really nice place to live.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We also believe a lot in the mixed use nature and what Colfax has become. We know a lot of the business owners along Colfax and there's a lot of mutual synergistic support that good residential adjacent to Colfax can provide.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The, uh, the pictures on your screen, the before and after give a good indication there are some not so friendly folks living here when we bought the building and we've transitioned that. Oh, thanks. Yeah. Okay. I should have kind of kept up with myself here.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Um, one of the things that was important to just transitioning this building, as Carl mentioned, was the mediation put together by Councilman Brooks, his office, and mediated by Steve Charbonneau. That was very helpful. And thanks again, Councilman, for that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The part of the thing outside the zoning that was key for Park Hill was a deed restriction. And we've put that in place. And so the things that were important for them were the two storey and the residential use.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And as Carl mentioned, we've got lots of support, so I'd be happy to answer any questions. Thank you, Mr. Hartman. Bob Garlic. Mr. President, members of council. Good evening.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'My name is Bob Garlock. My address is 609 South.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Gaylord Street in Denver. And this evening.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm here to respond to any questions you may have.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Garlock. It is now time for questions from members of council. Councilman Brooks.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Kyle, just a quick question for you. You talked about this quickly. Go over to Jim for questions. But you talked about adding units with the you you t you see zoning. You cannot add more units in that zoning, but you can add it in the u.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'M. S three. Yes, that's correct. Okay. And so so I guess my question now is for Jim. Is, Jim, how many units did this building have in their duty to you see zoning and how many will it have now?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And you t you ams two and how many would it have had if it was umass three?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It now has 17 units, councilman. And we we're thinking we had several more whether that's six, seven, eight somewhere in that range. And it's really more constrained by parking. It is by zoning. We want to provide the minimum number and then some four parking spaces.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And you mentioned this is a restricted property. So can you give us an idea of the RMI number that that's for your units? Well, the deed.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Restriction is really just for residential use as well as two storey heights. So it's not a no income restriction. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So you don't receive any any like tax credits or anything like.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That for this? No. We've just privately financed this and we're doing market rate units, but affordably priced. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You mentioned workforce. So, you know, I thought that was the traditional. Okay, great. And then one of you guys can answer this. Did. Before you all switch this back to the units three two or switched it to the UMass two.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Did you have the support of Fax Mayfair and DNA? We did. Yes. Okay. And so the only one who was dissenting was greater Parkfield community. That's correct. Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Councilman Brooks. Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Mr. Hurd, if you can just stay there for a second. I just wanted to ask about the size of your units. Can you just speak about that a little bit?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They're small in the mid five hundreds for a one bedroom in the mid 600 square foot for a two bedroom.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Correct. I want to commend you for your efforts in working towards creating some affordable workforce housing. We know that that price point really doesn't exist in the city of Denver anymore. And so for you to be able to do that without public subsidies is is a big, big deal.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Thank you. Councilwoman Ortega. Councilman Rob.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I guess I have really just.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'One question probably for.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Kyle. When we created Main Street zoning and then subsequently mapped it, we were really careful to work with neighborhoods, to be sure what was the area change and what wasn't. But you're saying that this particular parcel in Blueprint Denver was noted as an area of change?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes, that's correct.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then my my second question is, can you think of any other cases? I can't. At least on East Colfax, where we have added adjacent property to the Main Street zoning since we passed it.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yeah. Off the top of my head, I can't think of any.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. In the main reason is that this property is non-conforming or non-compliant with the you two. You see.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well, technically under the zoning code, it's a conforming use that just can't be expanded.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. That's all. That's all I needed. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Any other questions from members of council? Seeing none. Public hearing is now closed. Time for comments from members of Council Councilman Brooks.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Well, we have all been in these chambers when we've had very divisive rezonings, and this one certainly was headed for that with the greater Parkdale community in Mr. Hartman's group.
