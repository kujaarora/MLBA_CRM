        "'speaker_9': 'The subject property falls within the plan's growth strategy area of regional centers, which anticipates a 50% of job growth and 30% of new housing by 2040. The proposed rezoning will achieve this goal. Finally between Denver on the land use and build for general section policy three encourages owners to rezone properties from the former Chapter 59 Zoning Code'",
        "'speaker_9': 'to new code so that the entire city is covered by the Denver zoning code. Now looking at the Cherry Creek Area plan. This plan was adopted by City Council in 2012 and applies to subject property. The plan notes that the area where the subject site is located should benefit from new development, reinvestment and more intense use.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The plan recommends that the city modify land use policy, zoning regulations and design guidelines to encourage appropriate reinvestment to assure that these areas continue to mature in a positive way. The requested rezoning to see them exceed such change in zoning regulations and would enable reinvestment and development in such property as expressed in the plan.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Additionally, the future land use map for the Cherry Creek Shopping District designates the subject property as a regional center, where the recommendation is to continue to support a mix of uses, including office retail, commercial use, multi-family, residential and hotels.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The maximum building height recommended in the plan for the site is eight storeys. Therefore, the requested CMCs site is appropriate and consistent with Cherry Creek Area Plan recommendations. Stuff also finds the requested zoning meets the next two criteria.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The rezoning will result in uniformity of district relations and will further the public health, safety and welfare primarily through the implementation of adopted plans. The application identified several changes or changing conditions of the justifying circumstance, the adoption of Denver's zoning code in 2010 and the retention of the former Chapter 59 Zone District on the subject property, including'",
        "'speaker_9': 'custom zoning during the property to a 1979 site plan, is an appropriate, justified circumstance for the proposed rezoning. Overall, the proposed rezoning is consistent with the urban center neighborhood context that exists in the surrounding area and with the CMC's proposal and intent.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'With that stuff. Requirements, approval based on finding or review criteria has been met.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, friend, for the staff report. And this evening, we have two individuals signed up to speak, both online. Our first speaker is Meredith Gabel.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Hi. Can you hear me? Yes. Thank you. Good evening. I'm Meredith. Gabo and I live at two Adams Street across the alley from the subject's site. Last time I was in front of city council, actually, it was November 2018 for the historic designation of the his the Henderson House.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Community Planning did an exceptional job preparing the application. But today I'm in front of you opposing the rezoning of five Cook Street. I regret that CPD has yet to develop small guidelines. The property's own p you date. It could have been part of the zone map overlay in 2010 or 2012.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I forget when the adjacent block phase was being redeveloped as an apartment building, but both times they opted out. And now we have a 50 foot orphan lot asking for rezoning to see him exit with limited open space entry requirements.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The proposal for the project is 30 units plus retail, with no onsite parking and no mechanism in place from either Doty or CPD to administer the adjacent buildings, use a common access and parking easements in their deeds. And this isn't a parking agreement.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This is actually recorded. So. I know that the applicant is saying that in Cherry Creek East the there is a large availability of parking, especially at the seasons that Pudi has over 900 spaces, but those are required by the Pudi.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So any type of parking agreement would have to be above and beyond the requirements for the PUDI. But the reason why there is so much availability in Cherry Creek is, is because apartment buildings charge $100 plus monthly for a space and folks are just parking on the street.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'A presentation to the Cherry Creek Steering Committee by Denver Police explained how the majority of car break ins come from these apartment buildings. COVID pandemic has made everything a little complicated. I know that there have been meetings and things like that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I do have 70 people who came to me to sign a petition in opposition to this rezoning, the neighborhood association, actually. Well, let me skip that real quickly and just go to say that that enclosing no small lot zoning guidelines, no onsite parking, no way to enforce this monumental change for parking requirements.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I can only say no, and I hope that you take this seriously. I hope that there is an education component from that used to happen for neighborhood organizations so they understand how to work with the city so that we don't have things like that time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have a lot of speaker. Our next speaker is joining us online as well, Jesse Paris.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Any member of the council cannot be heard.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Yes. My name is Jessica Sampras and I'm representing the Black Sox and will win for self defense, positive action committed for social change as well as the Unity Party of Colorado and frontline black males. And I will be the next mayor of Denver in 2023.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I am against this rezoning tonight, even though it's supposed to be the consistency with adopted plans, the uniformity of district regulations for further public health, safety and welfare, justified circumstances, inconsistency with neighborhood contexts, zoned district purpose and intense.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I had several questions. Um, I think during the presentation they said something about there had been a traffic study or it couldn't have a traffic study because it was still plan developments. I want to know if there was a traffic study done on this, if there was a parking study done.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'As the previous speaker has alluded to, there will be no on site. Parking. So this seems like a disaster just waiting to happen. These units are not going to be affordable. I mean, I guess it's affordable for Cherry Creek where the average income is 120% AMI level.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But overall, this is not affordable. We have a housing crisis in the city and I guess Cherry Creek is not be exempt from that. By creating housing that is not affordable. Only 75% of units for them, we are 60% among and 10% of the units are only going to be affordable.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Out of the only 75% of that, 10% are going to be 6%. 25% are going to be at 80%. This just seems like a disaster waiting to happen. 30 units plus retail. What exact retail is going to be here?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'What exactly units are going to be here? What is the square footage of the units that are going to be placed here? As the previous speaker said, she had a system fine with 7070 people signed a petition in opposition.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'There was mention of five letters of opposition from three neighbors. Like I said, this is a disaster waiting to happen. So I would urge Denver City Council to may not vote in favor of this rezoning. And seriously, developer, go back to the drawing board and rethink this because this doesn't make any sense.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'You have a property that's going to be eight stories with no onsite parking and there hasn't been a study done. There is one thing I'm glad about this neighborhood agreement. So the affordability will be in place for years to come.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But outside of that, this is a disaster waiting to happen. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. That concludes our speakers this evening. Questions from members of Council on Council Bill 1019. Councilmember Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Madam President. Fran, could you describe the Cherry Creek East commercial overlay provisions that are referenced throughout the staff report and in the Good Neighbor Agreement? What are those provisions?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So it's still not approved. It's still on the works. But there is some setbacks that are going to be in place. I don't have the details of it is because I know it's changed recently. So. We still don't know what's going to happen with the overlay, but the application has been in the conversations and he said that'",
        "'speaker_9': 'whatever comes from the overlay, he's going to he's going to comply. So he'll comply with whatever setbacks they require.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And this is the overlay. It's being revised.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So, Councilman Hines, I heard that you were like today. I heard that you're working on kind of like the revision of that. And it's. I don't know if you can speak a little bit too.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Ahead, Councilman Hines, if you want to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Madam President. Councilmember Flynn, the the Cherry Creek East Area neighbors is currently in the process of creating both a residential and commercial overlay in the jerker case neighborhood. That is not an approved plan, but it's something that they've been working on for, I think, two years now.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So a considerable amount of time. So it's getting close to close to prime time. It's, you know, so we're still we're still in conversations. But but we should if the schedule moves forward as we're expecting it, we should see it in the next couple of months, you know, moving through the process.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. Can someone tell us what are some of the provisions that it is likely? To contain.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So and again, I saw it at the beginning when he was like giving very you know, it's I know that it's changed a lot in the last months. So that's why I don't want to go in what I saw.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'There's a lot of details like in materials of the facades. What's going to be the setbacks required for commercial uses? There's there's a lot of details are going to look. I think that some of some of the issues that CBD is having is like figuring out what's more the best use like design guidelines and what's code.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So because there was a lot of little details in like that, having certain materials in the facade or how high should the ground floor go up to where should be like the second story set but stuff like that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. I'm a little concerned about having this before us before that as a before that's nailed down. But I understand that that's not always up to us. Does 55 cook? That's the eight story building that's just north of this property.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'As I looked at that, does that have a five foot setback from the street? The primary street.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I'm not sure which one is 55 is the one on the Griffith.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's the, it's the eight storey building, the Griffith Griffith's apartments.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I'm pretty sure they having the fifth because the code right now requires 24. I think it's 20 foot in the fifth floor, so I'm pretty sure they have it on the fifth floor. A as I said, back.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'From the from the street.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I think so.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. So this would this would have a five foot setback. The property in question. We have a five foot setback from the primary and the side street. Yes. Okay. At least the ground floor.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes. Okay. No, no, no, no, no, no. Sorry. Like in the ground floor, it's not going to have, like, cmcsa. It has zero setbacks.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'As what?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Zero setbacks. See, I'm excited.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. Because when I looked at 55 Cook and the current building that's at five Cook, they are set back somewhat. And it looked to me like that could be at least a five foot setback. I'm just curious if it would if the new structure would match the Griffith's structure as far as the setback?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yeah, I think that that's also part of like the good neighbor agreement that they're going to match what's existing there. And I think that that's also guided in what's going to be on the overlay.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. Thank you. I do have I'm puzzled by when I looked at the site in question and the Griffiths Apartments that the eight storey building is literally this far from this, the building that occupies the site in question.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So under this eight storey but limited to seven under the good neighbor agreement, if there is a seven storey building next to it, would the neighbors have balconies that where they could like a stranger, a cup of sugar on the seventh floor?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Will they be that close together? Is there no set back from the lot line?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So they have like five requirements that are going to I'm sorry, they have five requirements that make them have certain said there will be.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. Do we know what that would be?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'No, I'm not sure. But also, like in the Good Neighbor Agreement, part of the design that he's proposing is that the windows are not going to match. He's going to try to make it so that they have certain privacy, the apartment, so that the windows are not.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Looking in.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There. And when I looked at the Griffiths, I'm not quite sure how that would work because the entire side that would face this new building is marked by balconies and and windows and things like that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And again, like, that's the tricky part of like the rezoning process, you know, like it's we don't really look at the other project.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's like, that's unfortunate.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I know, I know.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I wish Councilwoman Ortega were here to back us up on that. Finally, there's no onsite parking for 30 to 36 units.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So he has an agreement with the parking lot across the street. That's a parking structure. So he's going to have an agreement to provide the parking there because there's no way to make it feasible to have the parking like the biking requirements on site and the code allows to have an agreement.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It's going to be in the deed. So it's it's it's recorded with the land. And he would provide I think he's required .75 parking spots per unit. So he'll provide that across the street.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There's a building across the street. You mean to the east on Cook Street?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'South.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'South it's.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Go south. Okay to see a parking.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Structure like a.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Five story structure.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. Do we know that the owner of that parking garages is willing to lease spaces for 30 to 36 units?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I believe so.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. Is there someone here from the owner? The representative.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Of the owner should.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Be. Um.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Is the owner all.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Answer questions, I.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Think. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Because the way I read the good neighbor agreement before there could be a building permit obtained, there would have to be. Yes. Agreement for the part at the point 75. That's spaces per unit.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes, that's correct. So he wouldn't get the permits to build like he wouldn't be he wouldn't get this ESDP approved unless he has that like that agreement already. So.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So under this reasoning, the owner of this building could not redevelop it without getting a parking. Without leasing parking spaces from the folk across the people cross street. What? I wish I owned that parking garage.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But then he wouldn't be able to develop it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Correct. If I owned that parking garage knowing that the guy across the street couldn't develop it unless I leased him some spaces, I could set an interesting price for it, probably. All right. Thank you, Madam President. I think that's all I have.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilmember Flynn and Fran, the owner, we had two companies listed. Could you give us a name of the owner or we can ask them to raise their hand.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Canon law or canon law.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Law. Family.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Councilmember Flynn, did you want to restate your question?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. A couple of questions. Number one, about the parking. And is there have there been talks about leasing some of those parking spaces? Apparently, that will be a prerequisite to getting a building permit. And then as to the design of the building, how what are the anticipated setbacks?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Side setback from the Griffis units, which I'm looking at here on line of that is covered that that side facade is covered with balconies and windows of the neighboring building. So I'm curious just how close your north wall can be to the south wall of the Griffis Building?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I completely agree. It's definitely a design challenge. We do want to have offset windows, like I mentioned earlier. We're also actually included in the Good Neighbor Agreement. We have a requirement that would consider different ways to make that a facade is, as I guess visibly pleasing, is possible for the neighbors of the Griffiths.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So that could include a green wall or something along those lines. But yeah, we're very cognizant of that challenge. Right now we're kind of focused on the rezoning, but we do know that that's going to be a challenge and something that we'll have to compensate for.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right. So the first designs kind of basic math things that we put together have at least a five foot setback, but that could change and be be larger in order to kind of allow more breathing space between the two buildings.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So that's where we are with the facade on the north side. As far as the setbacks, that's also included in the Good Neighbor Agreement as part of the traffic use overlay that we, you know, agreed in principle to abide by, that's actually said within the agreement that will have five foot setbacks.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So it would be a similar setback to what you see at the Griffis. So just think of, you know, you see the existing building, the new envelope would follow a pretty similar envelope to what exists on the site right now.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That kind of gives you a good visual. As far as the parking, you know, we haven't had in-depth conversations with the neighbors, but, you know, we're just aware of there being, you know, low occupancy rates in parking garages in Cherry Creek.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So, you know, we're confident our ability to move forward there and find some long term parking agreements. But like Fran mentioned, we're not going to be able to get our permits if we don't get those agreements in place anyway.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So there's no way that there's not going to be parking accounted for in this project.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Why is it that there's no parking on your site?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Because of the dimensions of the site, it's extremely challenging to actually fit the required amount of parking and it's also extremely cost prohibitive. At a certain point, it's only 50 feet by 125 feet. Those types of dimensions make it really hard to try to build a ramp in there.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And if we want to have ground floor retail, which is something that was also included in the Good Neighbor agreement that the neighborhood really wanted, we would in it would have two ground floor parking only. And then we wouldn't actually have the, I guess the cafe or the retail tenant that the neighborhood also requested of us.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So it was just kind of, you know, the best way to move forward and to maximize the use of the site and this location and this kind of corner facing lot you want to have retail is to have the parking off site.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'All right. Thank you for those answers. I appreciate it. That's all right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Flynn. And for the record, if you could please introduce yourself. I know we've got you listed as Canon Law, but we appreciate you introducing yourself for the record.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right. My name is Canon Law. I'm the son of the owners of the property. So the current ownership is through my property LLC. The members are my parents who have operated and own this property since 2003. As an acupuncture clinic, we've been neighbors in the neighborhood for a long time and just intend on continuing to be neighbors'",
        "'speaker_1': 'in this neighborhood in perpetuity. And I hope that that's reflected in the amount of time that we spent in negotiating this good neighbor agreement and the number of times we actually postpone this hearing so we could have our voices heard here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Great. Thank you very much. Next up for questions, we've got Councilmember Hines.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Council President Minutes. Did you are.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You aware of this?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Miss Gable talked about 70 letters of opposition or of a petition. Are you are you aware of that?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Well, we she was aware that she could have done a protest petition. And I sent Harold the documentation to do that. She told me multiple times that she had letters of opposition, but the only letters I received were from her.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So, I mean, we have multiple ways through receiving everyone's comments and opposition and support, but I didn't receive any.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. So so that's I did notice a bit of a discrepancy between our packet and and and then the testimony from his that about the all the letters of opposition. So we, we don't have any way to verify that that all of those members, whoever they might be, are in opposition.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'No, but she has my email. She's emailed me multiple times. So like she could have sent them to me and of course there would have been part of the package if I receive them. So I everything that I included is everything that I received through the whole process.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'From the beginning, the public hearing was postponed multiple times.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And you describe to her the process, should she want to submit letters and or collect letters or encourage neighbors to submit letters?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yeah. Or to request a protest petition as well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Um, can you can you briefly describe what a protest petition is for our viewers?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I have never done one, so this would have been my first one. But I went through the process of asking like what it required. So I talked to our technician and he gave me a buffer of all the percentages of the buildings, how many signatures we required from each building.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I even got that map and then it requires I can't remember where the numbers because this was a few months back, but he was like us. I want to say.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Here, let me how about I phrase it in the form of a question? So the idea of a protest petition as if many of the surrounding but some percentage of the surrounding neighbors disagree that they can come together and they can file a protest should they meet that certain threshold.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So, you know, I'm not looking for specific numbers, but that's no, no, no, you're fine. And I don't understand why you're answering the way you are. But but just theoretically, there is a way to to lodge an official protest.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And should that protest be lodged, then supermajority is required to pass the rezoning. Is that right? Correct.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Um. Yeah. I don't. I don't have any, um. I don't have any further questions. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you. Council member Hines. Next up, we've got Council member Cashman.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah. Thank you, Madam President. I'm not sure if this is for planning or for referral, but. So we've been talking about that it's a requirement to have parking spaces to get the building permit. Okay. What I'm wondering is, so how long does that what type of contract do we have to see?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Because if it's a five year contract on spaces and they build, they're building it, what enforcement do we have that in perpetuity? They need to present parking. Oh. You're welcome, mate. Good evening.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Members of Council Nate Lucero, assistant city attorney. Here's your question. What do we do when when a new owner comes in and they don't have the parking agreement.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Or they they build the building? Well, in.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'One way or another.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Whoever occupies that premises is required to provide whatever parking it is that the city requires. So even the owner that is requesting the rezoning now is required to provide parking, whether that's on site or via a shared parking agreement.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The fact of the matter is the zoning code requires them to meet the parking requirement, whatever, whatever that is. So it could become a challenge at some point in the future, but that's not really the city's problem to solve.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's it's the developer or the property owner.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It is their problem to solve. And they have to prove to the city that they that they meet the parking requirements, whatever they are at the time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So their certificate of occupancy would. Be invalidated if they cease to provide that parking. And I don't intend to beat this horse too much more, but I'm just wondering what our enforcement tool is. Well.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So I think they would have to submit a site development plan. Right, that complies with the city's rules and regulations. And if they can no longer comply with that site development plan, then they would be in violation. Then they would be in violation of that and that would be a zoning violation and it would go to at'",
        "'speaker_11': 'least the Board of Adjustment hearing, possibly through the court process. So that's where our enforcement is.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right. Well, it sounds like it's not something you've dealt with thus far in your time with the city, but that you're confident that there are enforcement mechanisms. Yes. Okay. Thank you. That's all.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilmember Cashman. And we've got Councilmember Sandoval. You're up next.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Madam President. My questions for neatly Syria as well. Who does the audit on the parking site parking program?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I'm sorry, Councilwoman. Can you repeat that question?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Guess who does the audit on the offsite parking program? So if they do offsite parking right now and that parking goes away, who audits that? Mike What agency does the audit?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, I think it would be.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It would come back to community planning and development whenever there is a change in the site plan. I think that might be a question for Fran, because I really don't know how they address that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I mean, do you have an answer?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I can look into that and get back to you for sure.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Because this is an issue that keeps occurring in Council District one.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so I'm.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Sure it's going to occur everywhere else and nobody seems to have an answer. There doesn't seem to be a program to do the audit for offsite parking that we allow in the zoning code. Nobody goes back and audits these type of parking permits.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So Councilman Cashman has a very good point that what triggers an audit for the offsite parking program?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yeah, I can definitely look into it and get back to you with an answer, because if it's going to keep coming up, I think it's important that we clarify it. So thank.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you for the question.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilmember Sandoval. Seeing members in the queue. The public hearing is closed. Comments by members of Council on Council Bill 1019. Council Member Hines Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Council President I, uh, I suppose I'm a little surprised to hear about the, the 70 letters in opposition. But since we can't find them, I don't know if they're for sure. I don't know how to reconcile that. The testimony by Mrs. Gable.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And and so I just have to set it aside for right now because. Because there's no way for me to reconcile that. That having been said, the developer and the surrounding community as as as was already stated, had 11 meetings and they also took advantage of our we we offered a mediation session, which is something that the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'city offers at no cost to either party. And so they voluntarily entered into that mediation session. And after that, after all of those 11 meetings, they they came up with a signed Good Neighbor agreement, which was one of the requirements or one of the strong desires of the the R.A. that oversees this area, the Cherokee East Association'",
        "'speaker_2': '. Ah, no. And and I don't know if you noticed, but the affordable, affordable housing component was 75% at 60% AMI. And that's something that we as a council and in our discussions for the Golden Triangle Text Amendment decided was very important that we re the standard of of affordable housing to 60% AMI whereas you know, most of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the rest of the city it's 80% AMI. So I thought that was a great move on behalf of the developer to try to match some of the the value statements that we've made clear as a as a council that as I mentioned, it was a sign good neighbor agreement.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And regarding parking, I I'm not sure that that. I'm not sure exactly where that might fit in the five criteria. But. But what I would say is that the last Cherry Creek steering committee meeting, we had a a robust discussion about parking in Cherry Creek.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And several of the people who were there, including Nicole Masters, the head of the Cherry Creek North Business Improvement District, and and others, have talked about how there's plenty of parking in Cherry Creek, both Cherry Creek, north and east.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so while there might not be as much street parking anymore, there's plenty of parking in some of the structures. And as we already discussed, there's there are requirements, although we might not have all the details about exactly what the enforcement provisions for those requirements are.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We have the requirements nonetheless. So as I said, we've got a letter of support from the R.A. and the letter references, a survey that they performed to to to their members. And the survey did ultimately result in a favorable recommendation, which the Reno factored into their letter support.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So with I recognize that not any rezoning is unanimous or perfect for every neighbor. But but the the neighborhood spoke and and said that they agree and want this rezoning to move forward. I believe it meets the five criteria.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I hope that my colleague I will vote yes and I hope my colleagues will also vote yes. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Hines and I do agree that it does meet all of the rezoning criteria and happy to support it tonight as well and not seeing anyone else in the queue. Madam Secretary, roll call on Council Bill 1019.'",

Approves a map amendment to rezone property from S-SU-D to S-MU-3 (single- to multi-unit), located at 1360 South Birch Street in Council District 6. The Committee approved filing this item at its meeting on 9-14-21.": [

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. It's been moved and seconded. The required public hearing for Council Bill 1021 is open. May we please have the staff report?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. Getting in council. Brad Johnson, a senior city planner with CPD. I have before you today is a rezoning request for 1360 Bridge Street from as as you did as in you three. This is in Council District six.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In the Virginia Village neighborhood. Again, the request is for suburban multi-unit. Three. That's a maximum height of three stories in the in the zone district. Allowed building homes are suburban house, duplex, rowhouse and apartment building farms and the request is to allow for additional diversity of housing opportunities on the site.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Just a little more zoomed in shot here. We can see the site within the context of this block and the ones immediately surrounding. Currently on the site is a single unit home. The lot itself is just a bit over a quarter acre, a decent sized lot.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This thing. Zoning, as I said, was assumed. And then you see kind of a variety of zoning surrounding it on the face that it's on itself. You see a few lots of study in place in the directly to the south as in the three, which is what's requested here in the north end of the block, there is'",
        "'speaker_2': 'property that's zoned as as in five. So allowing five stories that there. Existing land uses in the area. There's the variety of single unit and multi-unit. And then, of course, you guys would be familiar with the sea. That's right.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Immediately to the west there. That's the big gray area that's stands for vacant. So you guys would be aware of that redevelopment that is potentially coming our way here soon. Uh, existing context. This is just a shot of the existing single unit home on the side.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then let me go clockwise here at the top, you see the a two story multi-unit structure there that's at north end of this block phase. The next picture below is on the opposite side of the block. So the properties, few properties there, single unit homes that face Clement Street.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The one below that is those those group of three single unit homes directly to the north of the subject site. Continuing the picture at the bottom center is part of that. See that rezoning also that's a vacant parking lot this you know, fence up right now.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then, of course, again, to the to the west is the city outside itself and most of it being vacant. But, of course, there's a communications tower and a small building there associated with that site. We followed the required process for Mapp amendment, which brought us to the City Council public hearing tonight.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Know, these are the alternatives that are present in the area. We haven't received any letters of support or opposition from Arnaud's. We did receive one letter of opposition from a member of the public with some concerns about the compatibility or incompatibility potentially of the building parties that would be allowed under this SMU three zoning with with the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'kind of single unit character perhaps to the West and further to the South or excuse me, to the east and to the south. So now to get into the criteria, we'll start with consistency with adopted plans, we've got Plan 2040 and Blueprint Denver.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We found that this rezoning would meet any number numerous goals and objectives of current plan 2040, just a handful of which are listed here. In terms of blueprint. Denver Future neighborhood context is suburban, and what's being proposed here is suburban, multi-unit zoned districts.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We did find the rezoning be consistent with a future neighborhood context. Feature place type is low medium, which calls for this kind of mix of of low and mid-scale multi-unit residential developments, small scale multi-unit buildings is a phrase that's used there, and specifically calls out that those buildings should generally be three stories or less and height.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So this kind of SMU three zoning is meant to allow just that type of sort of small to mid-scale multi-unit developments. We did find the rezoning to be consistent with future play style. The future street type is local and designated, and this particular street type allows for a wide variety of different land uses and farms next to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it. So certainly no issue with inconsistency there. The growth strategy for this site is all other areas of the city meaning it's meant to, or this designation of property around the city is meant to accommodate 10% of new employment and 20% of new housing through 2040.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And certainly by rezoning this property to allow for small scale multi-unit development. We do increase incrementally there the amount of units that we can facilitate on the site. So we did find it to be consistent with the growth strategy in that regard.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We also found the reasoning to that it would result in uniform district regulations and that would further the public health, safety and welfare of the community through implementation of our adopted plans. The justifying circumstances. There are a couple.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'One is the city adopted plan, the blueprint in particular with the little medium place type that I mentioned. It's really tailor made for this type of zone district. And then also just touched on the sea outside that. That's a very transformative project that's headed to that area and is immediately across the street from the sites.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And certainly changing conditions is something to consider there as well. Terms of a justifying circumstance. We also found this rezoning to be consistent with neighborhood context, zoned district purpose and specific intent. So with that, based on the criteria for review and the Denver zoning code, the staff does recommend approval of application 2020 1i-000 35.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Madam President. Yeah. I'd like to ask the property owner to step up. Mr.. What are you planning? Well, right now I'm kind of considering a few options, one of which is to front back townhouse development. I split the lot into four units total.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I also am considering a six unit townhouse concept. Okay. Thank you, sir. Sounds like that's well within the zoning you're asking for. That's for sure. That's all I've got. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Madam President. I want to follow up on that. Mr. Lopez, please. Over here in the packet, it has two duplex units, a lot split on North Side and South Side and two front back duplexes with two attached garages behind.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And that's the one that neighbors were shown. You're saying now that that's not what you're going to build or what you may not build?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Right now, there's there's no definite plan moving forward. The two duplex option is still on the table, but I'm also considering something with more density. A six unit townhouse option.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Mm hmm. This rezoning would allow apartment forms. Are you considering apartment forms?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I am also considering apartment forms. Really? Honestly, nothing is off the.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Table at this point.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Mm hmm. All right. Thank you. Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Flynn. Next up, we've got Councilmember Sandoval.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Madam President. With this rezoning, if this were to be rezoning to the north of the zone district, it's a protected zone district. Correct. This is different or. I'm sorry, Red. Sorry. Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Red room? Yes. That district immediately to the north would be a protest protected district as the city.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So remind me on a protected zone district if you use the apartment form. There has to be a type of setback because it's a protected zone district so the site can be there. The apartment form would have to be tiered correct on this from the north side because it's a protected zone district.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'On the side, along the side, that side on that line, there is that kind of requirement. I can find it for you if you want the specifics.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That would be great if you could remind me what the site interior set back would have to be with a protected zone district to the north of its.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know, just give me 1/2 here. So there's. Okay. So. So it's 25 from the Lott line in SMU, three for his side, interior zone, light line set back.'",
        "'speaker_7': '25 feet, correct?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's for anything above 27 feet.'",
        "'speaker_7': '27. And you're my knees. Is 3 a.m.. Three over 27 feet.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It does. It allows 40.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's what I thought.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Sandoval. Counsel Pro Tem Torrance.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Got your rate before you had it, huh?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, you did.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'My question is actually for Mr. Looper. The parking lot to your south. What is that? Is that used for any purpose?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's going to be part of the former secret headquarters redevelopment. That's owned by a separate developer. It also owns the property across the street from my property.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Have they talked to you about assembling?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Knows about.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Buying your property and assembling.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Them?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'No. No. I haven't had any contact with them. I sent them a letter as part of my outreach, but didn't hear anything from.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But the zoning that you're seeking is the same as the lot.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's the same as the lot. Yeah, that's. That's directly adjacent to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'My property, to the south. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'All right. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, counsel. Pro Tem Torres. The public hearing is closed. Comments by members of Council on Council Bill 1021 Council Member Cashman.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah, thank you, Madam President. I do believe this rezoning application meets the criteria that we're expected to judge it by. As has been said many times, we see that performers see that property across the street. The control group has, after on its third attempt, was successful in getting four tax credits to build 150 units of affordable housing'",
        "'speaker_2': ', which will be in the southeast corner of that site. And I believe part of it may be on that parking lot, but whether or not that's the case, that parking lot is owned as Mr. Loper requests for his property.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Expectations are that the affordable component of the fixed redo, which they're calling the dock, as a matter of fact, moving forward, that should begin, uh, ground clearing and permits, I believe, middle of next year. So with that said, I, you know, we've got multifamily, a few sites up from this property, multifamily immediately adjacent.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I would see no reason to deny this application. I hope my colleagues will join me.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Cashman And I agree this meets all of the rezoning criteria and happy to support this this evening as well. Madam Secretary, roll call on Council Bill 1021.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Sandoval.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Cashman. I can eat I. Sawyer. I. Torres.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I black.'",
