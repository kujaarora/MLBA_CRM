Amends a contract with Universal Protection Service, L.P. doing business as Allied Universal Security Services, by adding $1,500,000 for a new total of $5,500,000, adding three months for a new end date of 12-31-20 and adding required CARES language to the contract to allow the City to seek reimbursement for service related costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic for security personnel services at congregate and non-congregate shelter locations (GENRL-202054453-01).

        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Madam President. Just wanted to call this one out because we've talked about it at length. And I believe that we as a city have to repair the harm that we've done, and that starts with our contracting choices.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'For that reason, I think it's highly inappropriate for us to approve this contract as it reflects that we do not take murder and security seriously in this city. We approved a $4 million contract earlier this year in an emergency pinch for Allied, as we needed the staff to for the new congregate shelters.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Most of us thought that we needed some special security company to provide these security services. And because there was no company large enough to compete for the emergency contract we approved Allied, knowing that as contractors for RTT, another public entity paid for by tax dollars that they nearly murdered a black man at Union Station simply for for'",
        "'speaker_3': 'being black. They beat him within inches of his life and refused to make him whole in the courts. In fact, it came to our attention during committee that Allied not only continues to deflect real responsibility for their actions with this gentleman, they attempt to get a gag order to prevent the victim and his attorney from speaking publicly'",
        "'speaker_3': 'about the victim's brutal beating because of the current heightened race relations. Now, that seems a little backward to me, if you ask me. They tried to silence the victim. And that, I feel like, is something we need to be taking into consideration.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And now we're considering a $25 million contract that doesn't actually require special talent or training during the $4 million contract earlier this year. We know that there was a murder on their watch after we approved that contract. Nobody was fired.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Nobody was held accountable for allowing insecurity under a $4 million security contract. And it turns out that allied security scope it it doesn't actually require special training. All it requires is observing and reporting, never intervening. So it sounds like a job we should be allowing others to do, not necessarily a global security firm known for egregious harms'",
        "'speaker_3': 'ranging from gender discrimination, child abuse, racism. The list goes on. And so I'm a passionate no on this contract tonight. And I hope those of my colleagues who care about safety and dismantling racism will join me in a no vote.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'And I you know, the last time we talked about this and I said, I understand, Mr. Sapp, that you're the messenger, but I really don't. I think it's confounding to the political process. We're supposed to vote for things before the money is spent.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'All right. We've got Mr. Al Martinez up to answer your question.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. So funding has continued uninterrupted and will continue uninterrupted for the foreseeable future. We are in the process of awarding amendments to the base contracts that were funded as of July 1st. But you're absolutely right. Services have been interrupted.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Interrupted. We have many programs that are operating under the strenuous conditions. We have some programs that operate in in-person learning, some that operate a hybrid model, which is a combination of in-person and virtual learning. Some are doing 100% at home learning, and so it varies across the seven delegate agencies that we fund.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But funding has not been interrupted at all. We have a bill that another set of amendments that will be coming through that will be awarding Head Start COVID funding, which will support some summer operations that were funded just a few months ago, that took place a few months ago, when most as our programs are not open, they'",
        "'speaker_5': 'were allowed to request funds to open under COVID, and we gave them that permission and now we're going to give them the money that was associated with opening. So it varies really across the agencies that we fund. We also have vendors that are providing services, whether in health, mental health.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Some of these services are being provided remotely because with the rise in cases we are vendors are not allowed to go into the Centers for the Health Department role. So I think under the circumstances we are doing a very tremendous job in meeting the needs of the families that we serve in Headstart.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is it possible? And thank you for those answers. Is it possible to see a breakdown of the 321 children that this is paying for, what kind of service they're getting, if it's the in-person, the hybrid or the virtual?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Sure. It would just take it would take me a little bit of time to do that, because they're the mile high. Early learning has children all across Denver. They're in multiple neighborhoods and in zip codes. And so but I could surely put that together and give you a good idea of how many are in need or two'",
        "'speaker_5': 'or five at which center, how many are in need of two. One nine, you know, just throughout their primarily though in northeast Denver and southwest Denver that's out there traditionally where they have been located. But I could do that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I just need a little bit of time.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. That would be really helpful just because I anticipate our modes of providing services changing. And I would love to just have an accurate count of who's getting what and what there's a gap for or what we need to be putting in place.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So thank you very much, Mr. Martinez. That's it for my questions on that one. Madam President.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Madam President. Same situation here with Save Your House. They used to provide respite care, housing, and I'm wondering if the contract is exclusively the caseworker in the caseworker services or if housing is included and how caseworkers are doing their work right now during COVID.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. I believe we have Rachel Goldberg here ready to answer or Erin Hall.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I would direct that call to Erin Hall. She's the program administrator over that contract.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'It sounds like you want to know more about caseworkers and how they're doing their work. Nope. Specifically on Savio House, it doesn't have a number of how many kids you're serving here, so that would be helpful too. How many kids are you serving?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'How are you guys pivoting during COVID? For the caseworker caseworkers? And is this including respite care? Thank you. I can answer that question. First of all, Savio House, just to kind of give an overview, they have two branches overall.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They do have their treatment side, which the treatment side did use to operate a residential treatment center. The contract that this money is through is with their physical fiscal agent side, which is the Saville Management Group. And so this money actually funnels through Savio House, through our Denver Collaborative Partnership Program, which is actually Denver County's CSP, which'",
        "'speaker_3': 'is Collaborative Management Program, which is funded primarily through House Bill 1451 that was created like 15 years ago. So that's the structure. So Savio House actually doesn't provide the services there, the fiscal agent for DCP, so that the money through this this grant through the feds, federal government comes through the state and then through the county, and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'then we give it to Savio House to manage. They do not provide respite care through this money. They provide intensive case management and family advocacy that could include services in the community, that could include possibly sometimes rental assistance.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That also could include some of the impacts that cognitive has had on families. It's really needs based on family to family. There is a lot of flexibility on what we can and cannot provide under this program. And that was part of the motivation to have it go through DCP, because we can have access to provide services to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'families outside of the child welfare system. So how many families is it serving this year right now? It's 35 families, right. Currently this year. So and the the grant is anywhere from 20 to 40 is how it was written from the federal government.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And is there a way, since Sabio is just the fiscal aid, is there a way to get the report from the direct service provider on what the funds are being used for? Yes. Yes. Yeah, we do have a budget.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I can follow up with them to get a breakdown of how the funds are spent. Some. Thank you. That's it on that one from.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Great. Thank you. The next item up is Bill. 1110. Councilmember CdeBaca. Go ahead with your questions on Bill 1110.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Madam President. I mean, there's a lot of good stuff on here tonight. And I was a former youth provider, so having been a provider for summer youth employment and right in the middle of their shift to DPS being the prime contractor, essentially, I'm curious about how DPS with partners was able to recalibrate during the COVID'",
        "'speaker_3': 'summer and how these dollars were paid out to youth. I know we're extending it, so I imagine there were some complications, but I really would just like to know how we recalibrated. Where did the money go and how many youth were served?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. Thank you. Councilman CdeBaca, this is Tony Anderson. I get to be the director of Workforce Services for Denver Economic Development, an opportunity. Really appreciate the questions and the call out in the opportunity to talk about summer youth employment program this year.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'As you would all imagine, it was an interesting summer and we are really proud of what we were able to do in partnership with Denver Public Schools. I have Eric to be adored here joining me and will look to him to talk a little bit more about the program, specifics and total number of serve.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But essentially, we're here today for tonight asking for an extension of this contract for two reasons. First reason being to extend the amount of time that the youth have to actually complete the virtual job readiness training. I'll talk about what a normal summer looks like and provide a little context to this.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But essentially reason one is to give the youth more time to complete those virtual job readiness assignments. And then the second main reason was the major change. The contract is to allow a bit more proration to pay the stipends to the youth based on the exact amount of time that they completed of the virtual job readiness training'",
        "'speaker_5': '. And so going into this summer, we had a $1,000 stipends available for up to 325 youth to complete this virtual job readiness training, which was done through the Google platform, through Denver Public Schools. And essentially what we wrote in the contract is they could get 50% of that that stipend if they completed 50% of the training.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There was kind of a 1 to 1 portion and then a202 portion that they could get the additional $500 giving that $4,000 in their hand for completion. And what we found is we had to use that completed 75%, and we had some youth that completed 25%.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And rather than give them zero or give them just 500, instead of that 750, you know, the the spirit of the program this year was to get us get the full 325 youth enrolled and get as much of the dollars in their hands as possible.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so, you know, for us, a normal summer looks like in, you know, January, February, March, it's heavy recruitment of the youth and the employers for the placement. You know, April, maybe comes that time where we're matching up the youth with those employment opportunities and those work experience typically start in June and run June, July, August, giving'",
        "'speaker_5': 'us September for kind of final invoicing and then October for a final report. And as you would imagine, COVID 19 and the timing of that, which hit right in March, left us scrambling a bit. And as we saw other cities really canceling their summer youth employment program, we were determined not to do that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so we spent that kind of March and April period trying to figure it out and landed on what I think was a really fair and equitable solution across the board for folks. And what that did is and it sent us back into recruitment mode into that May and June and enrollment time period.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so youth just got a later start. Youth were starting in July and August and you know, just to allow more flexibility, which again was the entire spirit of our summer youth employment program. That's why we're coming forth with this extension request.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I'll pause there and hopefully Eris can jump in and talk about where we are today. Otherwise, I can definitely give an update. Yeah, sure. Absolutely echo the challenges that we face in terms of designing all the contract negotiations that took place as a result and then just the implementation.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I think it was a lot for us to expect our participants to continue to move into the virtual space and have all that screen time, etc.. But they're doing it right. Most of our youth onboarded in July.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They just haven't completed the pace that we expected. So we're currently serving.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'WhatsApp is looking for the numbers. How many students are currently in the process of receiving their dollars?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's 106. 106.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Awesome. Awesome. Well, I will touch base with you guys when you start administering the rest of those to find out completion percentages and what was more or most common?

        "'speaker_5': 'Several projects that made up that pilot were Elevate Denver programs. Many of them were under contract for construction prior to the outset of the program. So they were, in some cases, for the contractors, volunteer voluntary programs.

We are pleased to say we will be moving from this pilot now and in fact, with issuance, four have targeted a number of projects that would be great candidates now to enable the city to firmly establish this program moving forward.'",

We have a meeting set for just after the scheduled adoption of issuance for if that should happen to go ahead and outline a plan for those projects that have capacity and ability to move into the workforce program.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'They were partnered with our city partners such as Denver Art Museum and Denver Health, which had large dollars of construction. Those were already under contract before the program launched. But we do, however, now have a number of city led projects with dollars in issuance for that would enable us to firmly establish this graduate out of the pilot'",

        "'speaker_7': 'Local hire?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes, I can I can speak in rough terms from number of projects standpoint or a project count standpoint. It will be relatively small. There are over 450 total projects within the ten year program. But from a dollar amount standpoint, it will be substantive.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Perhaps when all is said and done, more than 50% of the dollars would be eligible to participate in this program. Looking forward, we have large projects that have more than $15 million of construction, such as Westwood Recreation Center, that would become part of the program.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So when, you know, when we tally up the total dollars, it will be a much larger percentage than if we look at the individual projects we have. As you know, Councilwoman, a number of projects that are from $50,000 irrigation sprinkler renovations to $250,000 paving projects where we're just laying asphalt.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Those are not ripe opportunities necessarily to put large numbers to work. But the bigger projects, particularly those that are vertical construction projects, recreation centers and whatnot, will provide great opportunity.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Councilman Hines just talked about earlier. So this really is a great deal for the taxpayers.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Huge public.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Outreach to the residents asking.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'But more recently, we have the lesson of the better Denver bonds that were put out in 2007, approved in 2007, and carried out in the in the ten year period after that during the Great Recession. And what we found what the team found was that not only did the bids and the work come in under our budget'",
        "'speaker_5': ', under our estimates, but it also allowed us to pool those savings and do even more projects. And now that we are in another recession, now is the perfect time to provide jobs. And and to echo Councilman Himes, it's also the perfect opportunity to lessen the impact on taxpayers by refinancing at a lower interest rate and paying them'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Flynn. Councilwoman CdeBaca, you back up?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. Just wanted to thank you, Madam President. Just wanted to throw some final words out there. There is a relationship in the in the world that we're ignoring when when these rates go down, they're going down for a reason and incentivizing us to take out more debt at the same time in exchange for that cost savings that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'we're perceiving. And so for regular people out there, it's like a cash out refinance of your home where you basically take out equity, more equity in order to pay back on, but you're buying down your points. And so it's a relationship that I think cancels itself out in the long run if we're still borrowing while we're experiencing'",
        "'speaker_3': 'some kind of decrease in our percentage rate. And so just wanted to throw that out there. I understand people feel very differently across the country and in our city about debt. And so still, I'm a no appreciate you all humoring me.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilman. Councilman Clark.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. I'm sure I just will respectfully disagree with the two analogies that have been used. This is very different than taking out credit card to spend where you would have to pay for that. We have a dedicated source of revenue for this.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This is not eating into budget for anything else like you would if you're spending on your credit card. And now you have to choose between spending this money or that money so that that analogy is not relevant to what is going on here, nor is it accurate.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And also, this is not a cash out refinance. This is refinancing our existing debt to lower our payments, reducing the total cost that Denver taxpayers will have on a suite of things that Denver voters already approved with with that revenue stream.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So this is also inaccurate. I just wanted to be on the record saying that both of those analogies were inaccurate representations of what is happening here. This is a refinance of existing debt, which brings our costs down. This is spending that can go to jobs of work that is already done and comes from a different revenue stream'",
        "'speaker_5': 'and is not eating up something else in the budget as increasing credit card spending when you have a decrease in income would be. Thank you, Madam Chair.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Clark. Councilman CdeBaca.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Madam President. Just to go on and clarify, it is the same thing because we're refinancing debt and taking out more debt, and it is similar in that we float the mills. So the city sets the multiplier when we're deciding what to multiply our assessed values at.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so that is something that directly affects the taxpayers at any time, especially during a crisis like this. So thank you.'",

It is effectively a $500,000 reduction over the four year period. The 2019 election were the most expensive we've ever had with a very competitive mayor's race.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Three open seats, three incumbents defeated. I would have used only $4 million of the $8 million fund. Even the sponsor of the original initiative, with whom I worked to rewrite this into a more workable system with the clerk's office and refer it to the ballot.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In 2018, they ran a simulation of the 2019 city elections, assuming that the Fair Elections Fund would have been in place then and published it on the website, on their website, showing that up to two and a half weeks before the May election, only $2.7 million would have been distributed among the 51 candidates.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I would not have submitted this recommendation if I had any doubt that it would leave the Fund without sufficient resources. The recent memo that we got from the clerk's office significantly overestimates the amount that will be needed. I shared my analysis with you all over the weekend.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I demonstrated that by backtracking some of its assumptions and the scenarios, and I found multiple areas where it was just overinflated. There was so much cushion in these figures. It could have been written by the Mypillow guy. But I do understand and I respect my colleagues who are persuaded otherwise and will vote differently.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I realize that the votes aren't there, here, aren't here now to move this forward. But the optics that I was concerned with is that with city workers forced to take between three and four weeks without pay through furloughs this year and next, because of our budget crisis that we wouldn't consider a half million dollar reduction in the'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Madam President. I know we have a lot going on tonight, so I want to be as brief as possible. I would say the clerk has performed his own analysis. And according to their analysis, the the fund needs the money that the people voted to provide it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I trust Denver elections know about elections. That's what they do, after all. And and when I have to decide between the validity of an elections analysis or a colleague analysis about elections, I'm going to trust elections. Also, I believe that the idea is to provide funding for everyone, not just incumbents.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I'm concerned that if we run out of funds, this could turn into an incumbent defense fund, not a fair elections fund. Thank you, Madam President.'",

I'll just start by saying that I totally reject the notion that anybody is considering this issue on either side in some attempt to gain advantage in any future election.

        "'speaker_7': 'Aside from that, you know, we identified as a priority to add more funding to the STAR program, which.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The mayor agreed to do. We in.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The letter offered basically of the items $371,800.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'To come out of.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That fund or two.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'To take it away from the police recruit class. Secondly, I don't know how many of you are aware of a recent poll that has been done that looks at where the public is.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In regard.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'To, you know.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Support of policing in our city. You know, we hear a lot from people who come to our meetings on a on a regular basis.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I don't discount their input, but there are a lot of other people.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That are in this city who have weighed in via this poll.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I'm trying to pull it up right as we speak. But the bottom.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Line is that when you look at and I'm happy to share with you all that it's saying that 60%.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Of the responders the question, one of the questions was asked, do you want the police to spend more or less or the same amount of.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Time in our neighborhoods? The answer was 60%. The same more was 24%.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And less than.'",
        "'speaker_7': '16%.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Was to on less. And so that's that's just.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'One of the questions. There are a couple of others on there. I think.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Where the public is on that. And then the.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Last thing is. Today's economic times and the challenges we're dealing with with our city budget. Have never been.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Worse.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Than they are today.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And the folks who drafted this particular bill gave.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'About how much money.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Would be needed for the 2023 elections. I think, you know, the conditions and the provision.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Absolutely give us the authority to do that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so given the fact that our letter suggested that as one of the funding sources and now we're saying, you know.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We we don't want to use it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think is disingenuous to the process that we're we're going through right now. So just want to share that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think this is absolutely an item that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Should.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We should be considering to address some of the priorities.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That council has identified.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In a time that we're asking for money for for a number of things when, you know, everybody else was taking cuts.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And, you know, some of those are really good and important items.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But at the same time, everybody's cutting. We've been adding.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'To this budget. So I just wanted.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'To share my thoughts about where I'm at tonight. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman Clark.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Madam President. You know, I think that it's good that we disagree and that we all have different opinions. That's democracy at work. What I struggle with is the attempt to portray this as something that it's not.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Rather than having a debate and all of us advocating that there may be a better source of funding than what's proposed. Arguments that I think have real merit. And I think we should. But I think we should be able to have this debate without resorting to dressing this as something that is not.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I completely agree with Councilman Cashman. I don't believe that anyone is trying to do this as an attempt to thwart what the voters had in mind or to keep their job. I think this has to do with the fact that we have a huge financial crisis and we were in that and we have a bunch of'",
        "'speaker_5': 'amendments that we as council asked to be included and want to change to the budget. So I just want to be clear, this does not gut the fair election fund. I believe looking over the analysis that there will still be plenty of money in this fund to fully fund the 2023 municipal elections.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Even if we were to choose to do this as the voters envisioned, even with this amendment and voters approved this specifically with the provision that this is an appropriate thing to consider and debate in the midst of a fiscal crisis.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This is the biggest fiscal crisis we've ever seen. So this is not the time to at least look at this then. Then when is that was built in to the bill? I believe that this is a responsible way to look at funding these things.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And again, not that there aren't merit to other arguments about, hey, there is a different way to fund it, but I think that this is a reasonable option. I appreciate that. Councilman Flynn, you know, brought this forward for our consideration.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I do think that it's an avenue to fund these amendments without taking away from other critical city services that have already been cut during this crisis and and to retain plenty of money for the intended use in 2023.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I will be supporting it today. Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Clark. Councilwoman Black.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thanks, Madam President. I'm going to say a lot of the same things that have already been said. I would never support an effort to override the will of the voters. Just as Councilman Clark just pointed out, this doesn't do this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In fact, the fair elections bill that voters approved allowed for this very scenario in the city might be in a budget crisis. Following up on what Councilwoman Ortega said about our financial crisis and Councilman Flynn's comments about the sacrifices our city workers have to make when they are taking three or four weeks of unpaid furlough days, I'",
        "'speaker_3': 'think there is no other better indication of the crisis that we are in right now. I do believe this bill ensures that the Fair Election Fund will be replenished so that adequate funds will be available for the 2023 election.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I, for one, will not be using any taxpayer dollars for my next campaign. I am going to vote yes tonight because in our letter that we all agreed to, we put the Fair Election Fund as a possible funding source.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I don't know why we would have put that in the letter if we didn't think it was a realistic option. So I agree that we don't have the votes here tonight, but just because of the fact that we put it in the letter, I will be voting yes tonight.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman. Councilman Torres.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Madam Sident I just a commentary that we sent six key recommendations to the mayor for budget changes with a number of suggestions for sources. It was the mayor who sent back preliminary approval for all those recommendations to come from the Fair Elections Fund.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There were other sources identified, and I think we put thought into those. And I would like to make sure that that we go back to those next week. While I believe the clerk made a good faith effort to support what the council might be going through right now in not necessarily opposing this move as long as the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'fund was made whole again. But I don't think we need to dip into the fund to get these things funded. I think there are other sources within the city. Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilwoman, can each.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Excuse me. Thank you, Madam President. So I have been following this discussion really closely, and I think that it concerns me that there is a narrative in our country right now that it's all or nothing and that, you know, two very subtle things that seem opposing can't be true, that it's all black and white.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I guess that, you know, I will just say that I feel like the letter was the function of a very crunch time line. People did their best. Some people apparently had time to review it. Some people didn't.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But there were not bad intentions there. Right. But it was also true that it was rushed and it is hard for human beings with the workload that this council has to meet very compressed timelines. So, you know, in terms of the analysis, I think it's both true that fewer dollars would be needed under a scenario in the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'past. But I also I don't know what explains the Clarke's difference in analysis, but I think people will behave differently in future elections where they know matching is possible. And so I think it is reasonable to say that we should go the conservative route and fully fund just in case to be prepared for this first cycle.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And that that's a prudent thing to assume that behavior would be different based on this law. It doesn't mean that someone you know, I don't know. I don't know if that's why their analysis came out differently. But but I think I just I think that it if I were in a different timeline, you know, we I'm not'",
        "'speaker_3': 'interested in sacrificing some of the items on our amendment list. Right. So I guess what I would say is, if this were closer to PAC thing, what I'd want to do is amend it and have it continue to second reading so that we can more thoroughly get a chance to evaluate whether or not things can pass with'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the sources that were proposed. Right. So, for example, I had none. You know, this was listed as an option for one of the amendments that I worked on, which was the staff contribution. But the staff contribution exceeds the value of this entire contribution.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So it does not these dollars are not enough to fund our entire list, even if we were to approve this tonight. But they may be a source that could help a few items get over the finish line that might struggle.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I will just say that I gave several conditions to Councilman Flynn on my support for this measure. One was that we didn't reduce the funding completely in 2020 because I thought it was important that the community see the ongoing commitment to the fund.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And the second was that it be restored to the full amount in the next year so that we would be made whole for this cycle. And I acknowledge we may be over funding it for this cycle. We don't know and I think it's fair for the community to see the full amount funded for one cycle and then'",
        "'speaker_3': 'we can evaluate if it really is only two and a half million, maybe we slow it down for the next cycle. Things will also get more expensive in four years. So you can see that taking a conservative route might continue to keep a balance.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But you you don't want the taxpayers dollars sitting there unused. So I guess that, you know, if this were, you know, a seven, six type situation or six seven, I might say, let's continue the conversation for another week so that we can see if indeed this might be the source needed to get some of these items over'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the finish line. But I would amend it to change the restraint restored amount. I'm not going to do that on first reading because I think that it's it's likely not going to pass. But I just want to describe the the fact that it could be a situation where we find some items from the sources that were suggested'",
        "'speaker_3': 'because there were very important reasons for those sources and they're reasonable sources. I think, for example, an $80 million parks budget can afford a $360,000 restroom expense, for example. I wouldn't suggest this or any other source for that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, there's a there's a reason why that budget should be carrying this, but it may be that other items do need these dollars. So so I guess that I just want to reiterate things that I've heard from people on both sides, which is that it's important for the community to have trust and for them to have'",
        "'speaker_3': 'trust. I think consistency of funding, even at a reduced level in accordance because we do have a fiscal crisis. And I do believe I just want to be clear that if I vote no on this tonight, I am in no way, shape or form saying that it is inappropriate to reduce the payment to this fund in the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'future. It may be necessary and it may be appropriate. And the goal then is to catch it back up. And frankly, if this city were to ever have a situation in. Where we had more qualified candidates than this fund could support.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We would have a moral obligation to run a supplemental. So frankly, I don't even feel like the fund balance is the determining factor. The determining factor should be how many dollars are needed, and it is our moral obligation to fund that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And that is what we have a contingency fund every year. We have a 2% contingency fund. Even in a recession, we have a 2% contingency fund for unexpected items. And these dollars could be if we have five recalls or retirements that were before the end of the cycle in 2022, for example.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we were not fully funded yet. We could then use a supplemental that is what that contingency fund is for. So I just want to be clear. The value of fair elections is not under attack today. Even the funding for fair elections is not under attack.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We have a balance in the fund today, but I do think we have not given the right details in this proposal to fully support the trust of the community by fully that funding it for at least one full cycle.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So. So I am likely to know tonight unless it looks like this is going to pass, in which case then I will be moving to amend it on final reading.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Councilman Herndon thinking I'm president. I want to thank my colleagues who have articulated quite nicely how what this doesn't do. So I won't reiterate that nor repeat it. I think that in this particular case, we're doing just what the voters allowed us to do.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And during the worst fiscal crisis most people can ever, certainly in their recent history, to not even consider this source of funds, I think, would be irresponsible, because most other sources and we could certainly have conversations about our reserves, but the percentage that we had going lower than that would make me uncomfortable.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Taking from other sources what we require more cuts to our city. And I, I believe that our city has had enough cuts, particularly for 2021. So considering utilizing some of these funds so that our city agencies wouldn't have to take even more of a deeper cut, I felt fiscally was the prudent way to go and that's why'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I am supporting this moving and I would certainly hope this would be something that we would consider to do. But I certainly appreciate the dialog and reasons why we should. And I don't I don't have any ill will towards the court because if I was elected recorder, I would have concerns as well.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But I think we should acknowledge no matter which analysis was done, click on Recorder's Office, Councilman Flynn's office. There are assumptions in that and you have to make those assumptions. So I would certainly I support this moving forward and I hope that my colleagues would consider it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But if not, we're going to have to make some hard choices about where else we're going to make cuts even more painful. Painful, deeper cuts. Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Herndon. Councilman Hines, I have you back up in the in the queue.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Madam President. Just two quick points. I do want to thank all my colleagues for the reason conversation that we're having, and I respect everyone here. Second is, I would disagree that the Fair Elections Fund is that just because the Fair Elections Fund was in the letter that we all agreed to it in the day we'",
        "'speaker_5': 'had to provide or the day we had to provide edits to the letter. I did share my reservations about adding the Fair Elections Fund and encouraged its removal. It remained in the letter that. So I just wanted to point that out.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Haines. Councilwoman Sandoval.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Madam President. So I have a question.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'For the mayor's office. Is anyone on the line who could answer a question?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have Skye Stewart perfect on the line from the mayor's office.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'All right, Councilman, can you repeat the question I just was asking?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Who was on the line? I didn't ask the question yet.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay, thanks. I thought I missed it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I just wanted to make sure you were a panelist. Thank you. So.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hey, Skye. Have in recent.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Times, in recent memory. Do you ever remember there being a budget amendment that came forward that promised to pay back a fund? So I've been racking my brain.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I've been going through all my.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Notes since working for Councilman Monteiro starting in 2012.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I can never write.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I called a.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Couple people.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Who served as electeds during the Great Recession. No one can remember a proposal.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Where we.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Take money from a fund but didn't promise to fund it again. How would that work?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So thanks for the question. In some ways, that's probably more of a legal question than it is one for me. You are correct. I don't remember a time when we have made that kind of commitment. I think, you know, typically everything has to be subject to a council approval of appropriation.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so it would have to be considered on a year by year basis based on our financial condition. So I don't remember ever being in a in a bill before. Certainly, I think there have been conversations in the past about a number of different things where there might be a priority identified, that there have been commitments to'",
        "'speaker_7': 'figuring out ways to get to that funding. But I think you're correct. I don't remember seeing it in a in a bill per se before.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then one other question. Remind me just of the process. So do did.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'City council always.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Propose to the mayor here where we should get funding for our amendments from? What funds.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Does is.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That historically what happens?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So another good question and I would separate out the two processes, the informal process that comes with requests that come in the letter to the mayor and then the formal budget amendment process, which which starts now as part of the budget being in front of Council for Public Hearing and action.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In the case of the request letter, it has been it's been something that's been talked about every year. I think we have always encouraged council members to think about what sources it might come from, but it has not been provided every year.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's it has depended on the council, I think probably depended on the economic condition. But many times it has been that requests come in and sort of say, use your judgment where these dollars would come from. Certainly when you were in the formal budget amendment process, you would have to identify that source, which means that you are'",
        "'speaker_7': 'addressing both the the new funding you want to create and what you think should be reduced. As part of trying to have a collaborative process. It is always helpful to have those discussions and those suggestions put forward, but it's not a requirement in that budget request letter.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So it has varied over the years. Sometimes we have had sources identified or suggested and sometimes we have not. And in that same way, sometimes the mayor has taken those suggestions and sometimes he has not.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, guys.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'For those.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Questions. So I just want to say. This one, is it? It's challenging to have a discussion. I know, Councilman Quinn, that you didn't have the opportunity to.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Push this through.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Committee. It's challenging to have direct files come. And I don't think that you did this to hide anything. It just was the time crunch that we always find ourselves in right now. Some public comment was made that we you were attempted to do this to hide something.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I don't think that and I think your intent was to be fiscally responsible. And you saw this as a fund. So with that, I'll just continue listening to my colleagues.'",

And I think, you know, when 71% of people in Denver say that they want something, it is not fair for us to necessarily, you know, change that, particularly in its first year.

We could shake some couch cushions and find money for council's priorities without defunding the Fair Elections Fund that 71% of Denver voters approved in 2018.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think that it doesn't make sense for us to tap this fund to this extent without further historical data and information to pull from. So I just wanted to put that out there. And thanks so much, Madam President.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'And that was the most I could get. So I'm sorry to say, Councilwoman, can you. I don't think it would be possible to get to the commitment for the full 2 million. It might be possible if we have a better recovery than we are currently anticipating.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But I do want to thank Madam President, all of all of my colleagues who spoke. It's a really difficult task, and I understand all of your reasons for doing it. None of our votes is is always is clearly black and white.'",

The property is located in Council District ten in the Cheesman Park neighborhood, is at the southeast corner of William Street and 13th Avenue, just on the north side of Cheesman Park.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The property is about 17,000 square feet and is the home of the tour's McFarland House. The request, as I said, is to be down from June 23, which is general urban context, multi-unit residential zoning with a 20 storey maximum height.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'So I'll go into more detail of what's in that in a minute. The applicants are requesting to lease on the property to allow for construction of a new annex building and allow for more diversity of uses. As I mentioned, the property is home to the charity MacFarland House, which is a Denver landmark built in 1899, landmarked in'",
        "'speaker_5': '1972. You can see the McFarland House is in the center of the property there. And then in the bottom right of the southeast corner of the property is the annex building. It was built around 1980 and is not landmarked.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That is the building that the would like to replace. You can see the existing zoning properties to the west of the same Jim U 23 to the north, three for three story zoning. To the east is another opportunity in custom zoning.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then to the south is open space zoning park. And here you can see the existing land uses. Property is currently used as an office mostly surrounded by multi-unit, residential and single unit residential with a variety of mixed use, commercial and civic uses scattered throughout the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Now you can see all the commercial uses along Colfax, two blocks to the north, and then, of course, the park to the south. Here you can see some photos. The bottom center photo is the subject property. And then the other photos are some of the surrounding properties.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then getting into what is entailed in the community. And also Pdg number 23 would be applied here. That is based on the free zone districts. Our you need to start with the base zone district and then modify from there.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So this is based on GM three, which again is general urban, multi-unit, residential, three storey maximum house, maximum height. The it would allow construction in the urban house building form. And then it is divided into two sub areas.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And a sub area a is the larger sub area where the existing series MacFarland houses, it would have a three storey maximum height. Most of the standard G suite requirements would apply and you get enough of that property as landmarks, structures, landmarks.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Some Area B would be the southeast corner where the current annex is proposed. New annex would go. That's limited to one story in height, 20 feet, maximum height, maximum of 3500 square feet of building coverage and would allow one foot side and rear setback so on south and east to let it sit in that corner.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'A would also require keeping the existing nine parking spaces and then would allow some additional uses on top of what is allowed only three over three, which again is residential. And then. Art studios, breakfasts and non-medical offices, which would be which is what this is.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then on top of that would allow medical offices, restaurants, retail and a few other accessory or temporary uses. This went to planning board on September 2nd, received a unanimous recommendation approval with one condition that was requested by the applicant that the food truck use be removed.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So that has been removed in the future. You have before you that was a condition of the good neighbor agreement that the applicant had negotiated with some of the neighbors. The at the hearing, 18 people spoke in support, six in opposition and three to withdraw.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'letters of opposition. In order to approve a rezoning, the city must find that these five criteria are met. Then there are additional criteria, criteria specific for parties that are going to after these five. I'll start with the regular five.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The first criterion is consistency with adopted plans. There are three plans that apply to this property. The first is Comprehensive Plan 2014, as described in the staff report, satisfied the proposed rezoning consistent with multiple strategies from Plan 2040 across several different vision elements.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Most of these are related to providing quality infill and a mixed use development and also promoting historic preservation. In terms of equity staff has found the proposed rezoning would be consistent with the strategy for the equitable, affordable and inclusive vision elements relating to providing additional amenities within existing neighborhoods to improve those neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And in terms of climate change, that finds the proposed design inconsistent with these two strategies from the environmentally resilient vision element relating to ENSO and mixed use development. Reducing the need for people to travel to get to services.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So staff finds the proposed rezoning consistent with Co-operative Plan 2040. The next plan is Blueprint Denver from 2019. The future neighborhood context designation for this property is General Urban, which calls for generally multi-unit residential with residents or commercial and mixed use embedded in those residential neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Consistent with the proposal, and commercial should be in a variety of building forms, including residential building form such as this. The Future Place designation is high residential, which again calls for predominantly residential, but commercial uses should be interspersed throughout, which is appropriate in this location.'",
        "'speaker_5': '13th Avenue is designated a residential arterial street, which again calls for primarily residential, but also may include a variety of other uses, including small retail nodes. The gross strategy designation is all other areas of the city, which is intended to accommodate 10% of new jobs and 20% of new housing by 2040.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then Blueprint Denver also includes additional strategies, recommendations that apply here, including multiple strategies about historic preservation. So the community would help preserve the existing MacFarland house and help with adaptive reuse so that it can be continued to use, be used and preserved going into the future.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So there are multiple strategies that the proposed beauty is consistent with along those lines. And then Blueprint Denver also includes recommendations around using custom zoning such as these, and says they generally should not be used except where there are extraordinary circumstances and there's not a standard district that would fit.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And that's the situation in this case. There's no standards on districts with the existing landmark House that would allow reasonable development of the property. Without an unreasonable number of waivers or conditions. So it is appropriate to in this location and for this proposed development.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'we don't give up. Just so you know, these ten townhouses weren't here 30 years ago.

        "'speaker_5': 'They really did. They came to the table, open arms, and we now have something I think we can live with again. I can't speak for my neighbors, but I think this is a wonderful idea and I hope to be able to go get a glass of wine at our new neighbors sooner rather than later.'",

My name is Brandon Gainey, representing the Department of General Services. I appreciate your time this evening. I will give a brief report providing a general overview of the security services contract tonight.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we have on the phone with us today, this evening, representatives from the Denver Security Office, excise and licenses, post purchasing and city attorney's office risk management and Dispo to assist with any questions and clarifications. And so I do think there is a presentation that we forwarded to City Council or actually to maybe to Zach.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I don't know Zach how we get that on there. And I can keep rolling if we want to wait or not wait on it. So I understand it's late. So it was just really one slide that we were going to keep up there, which was just an informative slide, but really want to start out with sharing the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'purpose of this contract, which is to ensure the safety and well-being of employees, residents and visitors conducting business in our city facilities. The security guards primary scope of work entails facility entrance screening for to sorry to prevent prohibitive items from being brought into city facilities.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Ensuring those that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Are entering city facilities are.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Provided with positive customer service and wayfinding and performing routine facility patrols to ensure security practices and protocols are in place. They also assist with locking down and securing city facilities during emergency and responding to emergencies in city facilities using in-person and video surveillance.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And lastly, we provide walk or safe walk escorts for anyone leaving a city facility, especially after hours. So the contract states the primary function of agents is to observe and report agents. They shall not use physical force against any person except for the use of reasonable force, only protect oneself or another person.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then only as a last resort. So responses to crimes in emergencies, they're coordinated with local law enforcement and public safety officials. Thank you very much for getting the slide show up there. And I also want to emphasize that these security guard positions are dedicated positions that the city would not otherwise have for the sole purpose of'",
        "'speaker_5': 'keeping people safe. These positions are filled by dedicated employees who are the city's advocates when it comes to maintaining safe environments for our city facilities. The contract consists of 109 different positions, employing approximately 130 individuals across.'",
        "'speaker_2': '19 city locations.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thanks to the Executive Order 136, which is the non displacement of qualified workers of city service contracts, we expect to keep the overwhelming majority of the city's existing security guards on the city contract. Currently, SEIU Local 105 represents security guards working in the city and county of Denver, and I understand they would also represent security guards under'",
        "'speaker_5': 'the new Allied contract. Security guard wages are governed by the higher of either the livable wage or the minimum wage, and currently minimum wage is higher set at 25 per hour. However, we know that market rate is the most important comparator and a third party analysis of the proposed contractual wages indicates that they fall within the 75th'",
        "'speaker_5': 'percentile the industry's market rate with contractual wages ranging from 17 to $24 per hour, depending on the responsibility experience of the position. The contract also offers a comprehensive benefit and wage package, including a $500 retention bonus to those existing employees who choose to stay on the city contract.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The contract will also invest up to $4 million back into our local mwb business community through the 16% minority and women business enterprise goals associated with contract. And then I want to talk just a little bit about the request for proposals and selection process that was was taken on through through this RFP process.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So the purchasing division, the selection committee, followed a fair and transparent process aligning with Executive Order eight, which establishes the policy and procedures for preparation and execution of city contracts. Selection Committee consisted of a cross-agency representation from Department of Motor Vehicles, Denver Animal Shelter Facilities Management, Denver County Courts and the Denver Security Office, all of whom are'",
        "'speaker_5': 'stakeholders in the city security program. Various members of the city teams work extremely hard to make improvements on the existing security contract by increasing training requirements, implementing a quarterly review scorecard and introducing punitive damages for contract noncompliance. None of those things were in the existing contract or are in the existing contract.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Lastly, I want to share where we see opportunities for improvement. I believe in continuous improvement. Continuous improvement is actually included in the contract scope of work. I believe in giving people an opportunity to learn and improve from mistakes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I, along with those that are here representing the contract tonight, denounced the inexcusable crime committed against Rivera's minute. And three former allied security guards that have been sentenced to prison as a result of the crime. I believe his contract can be used as a vehicle to change the way security guard services are provided throughout Denver.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I want us to lead by example, by leveraging the city's emphasis on equity in applying it to how this contract is managed. I want to thank you for your time, and I'll turn it back over to you. Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Brandon. And we have a 30 minute courtesy public hearing that we will hear from members of the community. We have 24 people signed up. But I want to give a reminder, we only have a half an hour allocated.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so if folks can keep their comments brief, we will try to get through as many individuals as we possibly can. And our first speaker is Jeremy Lee.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Council president. Can you hear me?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'On four questions. I'm sorry for Jeremy Lane.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, great. All right. Thank you. And then I'm assuming then Mike Daly is with Jeremy there.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's awesome. That's great.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Madam President. Thanks for this opportunity. I I'd like to just share a couple of things on on this matter. I'm seeing this as a real opportunity for us to influence, of course, the security services and Denver buildings, but honestly, to really effectuate change on the industry and this opportunity to do it through Ally.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think this is an opportunity for us to influence how security systems and services are provided, and working with a company to change their own company is a good thing for us to be doing the work with their employees, their interactions with our fellow Denver residents and and our guests.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I have started to work on the scope of services with with Allied, and I wanted to share just a little bit about the scope. One of the things that I have shared with them that I would think would be a mandatory thing to do is to provide an equity audit of all of their training programs with the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'potential to even certify or credential some of the programs that either get developed out of this or redesigned out of this. We also have recommended an equity blueprint or a roadmap that includes the strategies, goals and tactics for allied in this work as well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think more importantly, there has to be an intentional focus on some direct outreach to communities, especially the ones that have experienced harm from the Union Station event involving Mr. in that. And I would absolutely take the lead and leverage other community members in helping with that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The last thing that I would want to share with you in this opportunity, which I think would be a an important one for us to do as we think about the advancement of systems of equity is to talk about the timing of this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I've heard comments that, you know, was this timing of reaching out to me at the equity project reactive or was this something the company was thinking about doing? And I have to just be frank with all of you as council members, there's rarely a client that I have ever worked with that didn't do both.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They were reaching out on something that was reactive while having a commitment to undertake work intentionally. And I think that that would be the case here to undertaking intentional actions to provide restorative justice in the communities. Thank you so much for allowing me the opportunity to share my really vulnerable thoughts about this manner.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I do think it is a big opportunity for us to model what we mean when we say create a system of equity. What an opportunity for us to work through another organization just to do that. Thanks for the time.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Now I'm going to make remarks us on the SEIU one on five Representative. We as SEIU Local 125. We are a union representing the 100 security officers working grandly in the city and county of Denver. We support all universal getting this contract.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'SEIU has had a long and constructive national relationship with ALID across.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The country and in many other SEIU markets, where they have shown to be a responsible contractor in Denver and it has committed to continue being a.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Responsible contractor and keep this work. Union respecting the wages, benefits and rights this local, one of five security officers have already won.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Hourly, it has also committed to retaining the security officers.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Who have protected.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And security buildings for years, which means that the hardworking.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Dedicated security officers who you know and trust will continue to keep our buildings, public spaces and communities safe.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We will also be consulting with and providing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Feedback throughout training for this union's security officers.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'With our members and the Denver community's.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Best interests in mind.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We look forward to working with Allied.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And ensure good jobs and high quality services for the city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that's your time tonight. Thank you. Next up, we have Ian Tafoya.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Hello. Of City Council interview. You know, I had a chance to meet Ramiro right after this happened, and he was literally coloring in a book, and he wasn't sure if he was ever going to read again. I'm very happy to see that we move forward.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But beginning at that point, we began these conversations about the privatization of security of of islands, of merchant guards and oversight. But I want to go back one step and say to whomever is saying that the shelter experience is so damn great, then why aren't people going to them?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Right. This is just one entry point in a system that is so flawed and so broken. And I don't think we need that much security over the people who are going there. I work with these people on a on a weekly basis.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm out in the fields again. I want to say privatization. Who is that serving? And why can't they? Why can't the city sheriffs? And this is a solution I want to put in front of you. 19 locations, 109 positions.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The sheriffs have $150 million budget. We have a record low jail population. Why wouldn't we want them policing their own buildings where they have the most oversight? Listening to a private firm call people, civilians get real. You are civilians.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You are not military or police, but you act like you are policemen sometimes. We all know that privatized security has crossed the line far too many times to continue. It's also a place where people go to to seek power, to abuse power, where we might see people go once they're kicked out of the police department.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This is a three year three contract with two extensions, five years. If we had sheriffs, we had a oh, I am. Is there oversight or more public accountability on public property and to the union people? They would be a union with the higher standards and being included in with the Fraternal Order of Police here in the city'",
        "'speaker_5': '. And in the time where only 11 of these officers have weapons and were escalating, wouldn't you feel safer with the sheriff anyways? I will say, though, that a merchant guard system does need to have overhaul, that we need to be looking at this.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We've seen mistakes happening along the way and we're authorizing this private security. And I really think it's a fundamental part in restructuring the justice system. And the last thing I want to say is I have not heard a single community member, and I want you to be careful if any community member comes here to testify in favor'",
        "'speaker_5': 'that doesn't have skin in the game, because what I'm hearing are people who stand to gain from this and people are in the community who are frustrated and want something different. I think you can extend whoever is serving now in the interim, but I really want you to think about the sheriff, 150 million and the smallest population'",
        "'speaker_5': '. It would build goodwill to the public to interact with these people. Oversight is better. We should serve our own citizens with our own safety. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next up, we have Warner Smith.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Hello.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'My name is Warren Smith.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I've been with Allied for seven years. Retired military spent 22 years in the military and part of that was with the Colorado National Guard. I am a licensed security guard officer. They had my background check and everything before I could become a security guard with Allied.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I've been lucky in my seven years with Allied to work with different avenues. I was on the original 16th Street Mall project as an armed security, working with the homeless folks and stuff down there. I also lived in Samaritan House.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I was homeless, so I was able to talk to homeless folks and let them understand that I do get what they've gone through. I've been there. I also have been to a lot of training, which I really like with Allied.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We have training monthly, quarterly and yearly. One of the trainings is about safety, our safety program, where I, as security personnel can talk to my employer. The place I'm stationed at and let them know I see situations that are wrong.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I also report a bad officer. Now, security.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Work is not easy.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We are supposed to deal with our clients, take care of people answering questions, keep the peace. And a lot of times Reagan abuse. In fact, some officers have been killed just trying to help people out on the street.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This company is really good. I enjoy living here in Denver. I love the interaction that we have. And again, I am not a police officer. I know my role and in our training we learn that. We learn the laws.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We learn the things that we are supposed to do and can not do.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'De-escalation is one of the biggest things.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We try not to put ourself in danger because that is not my role. My biggest role is use my eyes and use a pen that is more effective, and that's what we try to do. Do we have some bad people and we find them?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But this is a great company and I'm proud to be with them. Thank you for your time. I appreciate it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And we're rounding out the half hour that we had allotted for the courtesy public hearing. And so our last speaker will be Morrow Zacharias.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. Thank you. My name is Mara Zacarias.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'm from Fort Collins, Colorado. I have a daughter and a future.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Son in law who live in Capitol Hill in downtown Denver. I watch the.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Play.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I am Rivero.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It is so upsetting.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That it's I'm actually welling up right now to think about the egregious abuse of this man. To think about how his life is altered forever, to think about how there.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is still no.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Settlement. And this company that we think is going to be good and is changing their ways. There is still no settlement. There is still no restitution. To Rivera obstinate. I think about the phone call that we just started.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And, you know, I've been here for four and a half hours. I heard about the diabetic person and the little boy who was on the call earlier. The diabetic. And keeping him safe. And you agreed to that resolution.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But you know, even a diabetic child, they can become incoherent, they can become aggressive, they can become anxious keeping if their blood sugar levels aren't out of whack. I wonder how an allied security guard would handle that diabetic child.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In light of what we've seen. You know, Ribeiro did nothing. He was an artist. He did nothing. And he has a traumatic brain injury at this point. It's been difficult for me to be on this call this whole time, listening to people from unions.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'People have an interest in doing this work. I appreciate that. But I am just here as a citizen who has an interest in keeping people safe. This is a company with a plethora of podcasts, CPR and PR information on sexual harassment, racial biases.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They're talking about coming back and doing some trainings in punitive damages for noncompliance. Allow me to mention what we know about organizations, because I am an organizational development expert. Organizations really learn from the top down what the values are from the CEO.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's not a matter of training. It's a matter of knowing the values of the CEO on down. I really hope that you keep us all safe. I really hope that this issue gets returned to providing for the safety of our citizens.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In the Denver area. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And thank you to all of our speakers who stayed with us through what we know is a very long evening and I'm sorry to the speakers that we weren't able to get to tonight, but we wanted to maintain the half an hour courtesy public hearing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so we will have questions from members of council. Councilman Haines.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Madam President. Allied security. You all have a credibility problem. I just want to start with General Services. So if I could chat with someone from General Services, I think that you're the stewards of the contract. There were the question I got.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Just start with the questions. There were three bidders for this contract, correct?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes. Councilman Hines, this is Kim.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay, great. And what were the other two companies?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The current contractor, HCA, and then Securitas.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. Um, were there any local vendors who placed bids on the contract?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I know those were the only three. There were two other companies that did bid. However, they did not meet the dispo criteria.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Hmm. Okay. So you said Securitas?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes, sir.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And are. Are those? Is Securitas also engaged in the very visible discussion about the shooting near the art museum? I know that Pinkerton was definitely identified. I don't know if security was also identified. Do you know?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I believe Securitas and purchased Pinkerton sometime ago. So they are both in nature.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay, so.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I can't comment on whether or not. If there's any sort of direct correlation there and how that that relationship works. I don't know those details.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. But I think it's fair to say that they also have a credibility problem here in Denver. So are there any local vendors who could perform this contract? Like why? Why did no local vendors apply.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Sought so yet? Great question, Councilman Himes. And I think that the issue that the city runs into is that it's the size of the contracts. So, you know, we're a fairly large contract. Several of our facilities are 24 seven with multiple positions.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so it is definitely the size of our contract that is a bit more difficult to staff and to be responsive to the RFP. It has been mentioned on a few occasions during some of our committee meetings and then some of our individual discussions that, you know, why?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Why can't we unbundle or split this contract into multiple contracts? We could do that. I think that there are some definite, pretty significant risks whenever you look at doing something like that for a security contract. And, you know, our chief security officer who is on the call, George Hunt, as well as our contacts here locally with the'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Department of Homeland Security, have definitely advised against doing that and for a few different reasons. And, you know, this could lead to significant risks, such as force on force incidents, communication protocol differences, some inefficiency of management, as well as difficulties in just managing any of our emergency or crisis response when we have to have a coordinated response'",
        "'speaker_7': 'around a particular issue, possibly in the downtown core area, which a lot of our buildings are.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So. So someone just mentioned that each SS is a local vendor. Is that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'True? You're a Colorado vendor. That's that's yes, that is correct.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And they have held the contract for 13 plus years. That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And they did apply. They met the the maybe threshold, but they were not selected. Is that right?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. And then Mr. Tafoya suggested that our sheriffs might could take the contract. Why? Why is that not a viable option or is it a viable option?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Sure. So we do work very, very closely with the Denver Sheriff's Department in several of our buildings where there are court functions. And because they do obviously operate very closely with with the courts. And so, you know, if we did the cost analysis on that, I would imagine that we would probably triple the dollar amount of what'",
        "'speaker_7': 'this contract is, double to triple what it is. And if you can just imagine the the salary of a sheriff versus a security guard, and you're really looking at apples and oranges there as far as how much that would be.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So and so it would be cost prohibitive to this prohibitive to the city as well.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so layered security was had the contract in Union Station on behalf of our duty is our right.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I believe so. There are allies Mike Daly and Jeremy Lee are on the line. If you have specific questions about that contract, I'm not well versed in it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Sarah Okay. So I guess the last question I have, Madam President, is and I don't know if it's general services, that is the best answer. RG Considered getting rid of allied security and replacing them with social workers that I think didn't pass.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Is that is that right?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think it was a 14 to 1 vote against doing that is at least what I saw in the media. And I don't know if perhaps Mike wants to unmute and just confirm that for Councilman Hines.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah. Councilman, can you hear us? Yes, sir. Yes, sir. That is true. McKamey said it was, I believe it was either 14 or 15 to 1 vote by our board of directors to not do that, sir. Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's all for now. Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilman Hines. Councilwoman Black.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thanks, Madam President. Several speakers mentioned a settlement. With Mr. Synnott. It can. Jeremy. Jeremy and Jeremy Leigh, can you please. Provide some information about that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. Councilwoman Black, thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we have I do have a joint statement from Allied Universal, as well as.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Counsel for Mr. Stein, that they have reached an agreement in principle to resolve the claims arising from the 2018.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Incident.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'April The agreement is subject to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Finalization of formal documentation.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Both parties were able to work cooperatively to address this unfortunate incident. So we do have an agreement in principle currently with that interested in.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'All right. Thank you. That's all I have, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilwoman Black. Councilman Torres.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Madam President. Also, for Mr. Lee and Mr. Daley, were your Denver staff or your Denver contracts unionized prior to working recently with SEIU?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Oh, not currently. Nope, not at all. So this is our first opportunity to work with the local SEIU.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But you've got union. Is it true that you've got union contracts in other states or other cities?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah, that's correct.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is that accurate? Okay. Thank you so much. Cami, just a question for you. Was the did the decision come down to a bottom line bid between the three vendors who bid it and made it to kind of the final round?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes. And thank you. Councilwoman Turismo and the evaluation committee looked at a lot of different criteria. So it wasn't just the cost of the contracts. And because all of the bids came in relatively around the same dollar amount and which kind of shows that they all fit the contract very, very well from a pricing perspective.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Really, what the evaluation committee looked at was the hiring and how the how the companies went about their hiring and background checks included as well as retaining because it's very important for us first as a city to maintain as many staff as possible from the current contract as well as the training.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I've spoken at length with many of the councilmembers and leading up to this meeting about our expectations as far as training with the city. We went from 24 hours of a mandatory training before going on to post to 40, 40 hours, and that's for an unarmed guard at the most basic sort of level.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And then the training increases from there as guards go to different levels as well. As, you know, I believe Warner Smith mentioned as well, the The Monthly, The Quarterly, the annual training on top of that. And also it was the transition plan, again, really focusing on how the this contract, because it is such a major contract for'",
        "'speaker_7': 'the city would transition very seamlessly and successfully from the current vendor to the new vendor. So having a well thought out transition plan as well as, you know, the focus on customer service and then of course the overall overall proposal, how that was proposed.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And because we get both the written and the written proposal as well as the the virtual interview since we're in a time of COVID. So it was a lot more in addition to the pricing of the contract itself.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is there any criteria or judgment on on unionization of those employees?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'No. And and our buyer supervisor, unfortunately, with purchasing is is no longer with us. And she did retire. Lance J is on the line. However, I can I can just say that the city remains agnostic whenever it comes to and comes to the the union question.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I don't know if Lance J. Wants to unmute, maybe add further add to that, but that is my understanding of that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's correct, Kimmy.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Lance. And then final question for you, Cami. Did agencies also have a minority owned business subcontractor or did they subcontract?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes. So they it was also a 16% goal for assistance contract. And that was achieved through a national.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And actually one more question for you. I worked in the Web building for over ten years. I worked in the Memorial City building before that. I don't recall major safety or security issues. Were there issues in the 13 years that each of us held that contract?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So when you say issues, do you mean as far as just kind of incidents? We do experience incidents less frequently now just because we have fewer people in our buildings. But I would say just about every day we would have some type of incidents.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You know, occasionally it would just be, you know, different types of prohibited items that are being brought in. We do have people that have medical emergencies that our security staff do do respond to and engage with both our security operations center as well as 911 to get assistance on that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But we we are quite busy, I would say. And also George Hunt is on the line. He's our chief security officer. He is he manages the day to day operations of the security contract. He can probably comment a little bit better as far as the incidents that occur in in our facilities.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I'm thinking much may be more egregious. Sorry, Brandon, go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'No, I was just going to say, I just want everyone to understand the city's procurement process. It doesn't really base it on historical data. You know, it's about the a fair and transparent process based on a request for proposals and what's submitted and then what makes it through as a response proposal.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Once our Department of Small Business Opportunity looks at it. And then it's a very specific criteria that that can be mentioned in terms of scoring that each selection committee member made up of, you know, diverse groups and city agencies works through.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So it's a very deliberative process. And so it's not really those other pieces kind of extraneous peripheral pieces typically aren't brought into that process. And so it is customer service is performance based, it's data and metrics. So I just wanted to make sure that that that piece is kind of understood as, as the city moves through any'",
        "'speaker_5': 'procurement of any contract.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you for that. Mr. Hunt, is there any information that you have on perhaps lawsuits filed against each assets in one of our buildings? I understand their daily conflicts, issues and coming through security, things like that. But I'm talking about things that would be really concerning.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So assuming I'm unmuted, I'm a little confused by the question. Councilwoman, are you. You're asking about my awareness of lawsuits for agencies or incidents on their own?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Both.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. So sure to answer the first part there. As Candy pointed out, incidents daily, whether that's in support of someone needing medical assistance. In the downtown core or at DMV's or at the animal shelter. Escalating all the way up to.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Unfortunately, incidents that would be much more violent and would be a direct threat or an attack on a. City employee at the animal shelter. They've had several incidents. We've had people typically about once or twice a week attempt to bring firearms into city buildings, whether that's the city county building or the Wellington Webb Building or the Empire'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Building. We've had bicycle thefts out of some buildings. We've had assaults occur outside buildings and sometimes inside buildings. So we to answer your question, we yes, we do have incidents that run the gamut of medical assistance for someone who's having some issue all the way up to violence.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then the second part of the question, I am unaware of any lawsuit related to HFCS and an incident that would have occurred on city property. The only thing that comes to my mind with HFCS that I'm aware of in any detail at all would be a employment h.r issue internally with with HFCS as a company.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And that was something to do if my memory serves me right was back in March and it had something to do with the sheriff's department and an NHS agent on duty. Some type of. Interpersonal drama there.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Oh, okay. Thank you, Mr. Hunt. And by definitely my last question, Cami, are these three year contracts each time? That have come before this one in particular.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So do we build them out for three years? Yes. So typically they would be bid out for three years plus the two one year extensions? That is correct. So typically, you would look at probably about five years if the performance is there.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Got it. Thank you. Thank you. Madam President, you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right. Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman Cashman.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Oh, thank you, Madam President. Tammy, could you talk a little bit about as I understand it, there is a quarterly review of performance and monetary penalties. I guess what I'm what.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm looking for.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'If you could please, as I said, talk about that a bit. But what is what do they have to do for us to say, take a hike?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you for the question, Councilman Cashman. I'm actually going to ask and George, once again to add, I'll defer to him on that question. And he wrote those pieces within the RFP and can comment better than I can.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'George, can you move again, please?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Sure.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So, Councilman Cashman's, excellent question. The Court You are correct. There is a score quarterly scorecard review. And that's. Seven pages, eight pages of very specific questions that deal with the operational status of the security vendor. I'll be very frank.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's not it wasn't it's not allied centric. It's it's security vendor. Whoever the security vendor partner is or ends up being for the city will also be subject to the the quarterly scorecard review process and that that from the city side would be staffed by a stakeholder committee that would include more than likely the same advisory committee'",
        "'speaker_5': 'that was on the evaluation. So EFM partners, dmv d0f partners, animal shelter partners, etc.. Those those of us that are intimate users of the security services. And the idea is to to rate the security vendor with how they're doing operationally and then also back office management invoicing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Are they listening to what the city needs? And that results in a score line, line item score and an overall score per site. So each patient in the city would receive a score. And if there were items that were that fell below a three rating or below on a scale of 1 to 10, that would instantly invoke'",
        "'speaker_5': 'a performance improvement plan by the security vendor. Who would need to address why the deficiency and what their plan is to improve it and an associate a timeline to achieve the the improvement. Does that answer.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Your question, George? If you can talk about the punitive tour item that was.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Sure. So in the punitive language, it's in the contract. That's something that that is not in the current contract with IHS as. We felt in in the general services group that that contract compliance that that was very crucial to have some teeth to the contract.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That just to your point, you know, some at some point you need to get someone's attention about trying to accomplish what the city needs, whether that's short staffing or continued short staffing, whether it's intentional or not intentional by the security vendor or refusal to do something that they're contractually bound to.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Is the idea behind the punitive language? And to give you an idea of the the den security contract for their security vendor also has punitive language in it similar to the to what we have. And that's, you know, a familiar path that the industry is going towards as far as the client is concerned.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And it's not something that Allied or other security vendors are not familiar with. It's a normal and normal thing. Okay. Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilman. Councilman Hines.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Madam President. And thank everyone who's still with us. Still a lot of people with us. It is late at night, so I apologize that I'm asking more questions, but I am surprised to hear that the bids about the bids were about the same for the various vendors and that the incumbent applied but was not selected'",
        "'speaker_5': '. So when you you mentioned that there was a scoring process in the selection committee. Does the incumbent have any sort of an advantage? I, I guess I'll go ahead and ask the next question. Change management is hard and it has to be carefully planned.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so, you know, is is there some value placed on that cost of change management?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Absolutely. That's an excellent question, Councilman Hines. And so I would say that the evaluation committee throughout the process was very mindful of that. However, I think that that there is something to be said for changing things up, to sort of improve upon things like transparency within data collection, our ability to review records on a daily, if not'",
        "'speaker_7': ', you know, real time sort of situation with incidents and you know, post who's who's posted where, what those hours look like. And the data collection I think was extremely challenging with with the current contract. And and I also think that some of the folks that were on the evaluation committee were also looking for more support out in'",
        "'speaker_7': 'these remote type of locations, which normally have maybe only one person on that post. And so what Allied was able to do through the proposal process was really put in a solid supervisor structure that allowed for a lot of oversight and support and training of those remote sites that we we did not necessarily have in the current'",
        "'speaker_7': 'contract or was not necessarily proposed on the current contract or with the new contract. So I think to answer your question there, there was a lot of discussion with the evaluation committee on that. And because it is such a major shift and change, however, I do go back to the fact that it's 136 does apply.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so really we are trying, you know, if if we can get a contract executed and, you know, and we're successful there, we can start that transition a.S.A.P and and start to get people information. You know, the current agent assessed folks information about the benefits package and what this looks like of coming over to the contract.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So that's the intent is to get as many people on the contract as possible. So perhaps that transition won't be as as difficult as it would be if someone was coming in and just replacing 100% with new staff.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well. So thank you for your candor. I mean, if we did not have transparency on data collection reporting, who's posted where support and remote location and supervisory structures, I mean that. That concerns me.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So we do have some of that. So that's and I don't want to misspeak there or I don't want to give the impression that we don't have some of those things in place. I think the evaluation committee was looking for improvements, looking for more of a greater sort of electronic transparency with some of those items.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. And then one other I guess one of very lot questions I'd like to hear maybe both from Allied and SEIU. Local 105i don't know, Allied Security. And frankly, based on the information I've heard so far and the responses from committee, you know, I'm I don't trust Allied.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'However, I do trust SEIU and the leadership team at SEIU Local 105. If this contract contract were approved, how can you ensure that SEIU will be a partner in making sure that security workers are represented? And how can you ensure that SEIU and its members will have a proactive role to ensure that we don't recreate situations like'",
        "'speaker_5': 'we've heard too often from Allied in Denver and and around the U.S.?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Mike and Jeremy. Can you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah. It's Jeremy. I'll answer that. So the answer to that is, it's just there's a real.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Appetite to.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Partner with our local SEIU. We wouldn't want to jeopardize.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Any.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'National relationship that we have. We've done some great work nationally.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We have not had the opportunity locally to work with these folks. We've had several meetings with them. They've been very positive. There's a real willingness to enter into a relationship to include training audits from their from their folks.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so there's no reason for us not to partner with them and to make this a successful relationship with those folks. So we're all in agreeance. It's going to be better for the program and it's certainly better for the security professionals involved.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So it's it's again, there's no reason not to do it. Every reason for us to continue to work on that relationship. And the SEIU brings another community voice to the table, which we think is critical, especially with everything that we've been talking about it, because contracts are.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Is the local SEIU, Luis Ponce. Is he.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'He's he's.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Here? Yes. Council members, council member Hines, thanks for your question. We take this with the highest responsibility to partner with earlier in order to better serve our community and to serve the working people that already in majority. You know, people of color, we we believe that by our universal respecting the union contract, keeping the hard fought benefits'",
        "'speaker_6': ', enhancing some of them what they have told us as well, us collaborating on training specifically our members on the only training that we already give to our members that we have given throughout the years here in Denver is going to be critical in in moving forward these this contract and really maintaining what the community has been asking'",
        "'speaker_6': '. Right. Which is responsibility and and and a mindfulness of of what the community really needs.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I think the the silver lining in all of this is that by having the union.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There is an accountability piece that probably, you know, wasn't there before. And now, you know, it will be.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There. And I think that that's very important for for the community and for city council members, too.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'To know that that by our members being local 105 sorry, by the workers being local one or five members, there's going to be an accountability.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And an oversight.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'By by the workers on their job and on their duties.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'All right. Thank you. And, Madam President, one last question for general services. What if what if, what if this what if you don't say yes? What if this contract dies tonight? What's the next step?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Sure. So I can I can answer that and Brandon and please assist if I, if I get anything wrong here. But we will, in essence, look at all of our options. Our our focus has been on doing everything that we can to support this contract going forward.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I don't know that we've spent a great deal of time thinking about the the alternatives with with any and with a lot of focus. You know, we we do know that we have options like potentially going to the other the other proposers for this RFP process or going out to RFP again.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so I know that those are at least a couple of the options that that are available to us. And that would mean that we would have to negotiate for some type of extension with our current provider. And because those processes, as you know, and tend to take some time, obviously a new RFP would take much more'",
        "'speaker_7': 'time than negotiating with one of the other proposers.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And if we add on our current providers one of the other options, right? And so that's why you would theoretically continue the relationship with the current provider if if we ended up selecting the current provider.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes. So business does have that agreement with the local 105 Okay.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman. The public hearing for council resolution 20 Dash 1042 is closed. Comments by members of Council. Councilwoman CdeBaca.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Madam President, this debate has taken a very disappointing turn. We cheapen the lives of black people and unhoused people in a way I couldn't have imagined to have a conversation tonight that even elevates a union contract or diversity training above the real and undeniable deaths of people at the hands of this company right here in'",
        "'speaker_3': 'our city, on our own taxpayer dollars makes my stomach turn. I wish that the workers we all heard from tonight could start an employee owned company to compete against this narrative that only these companies, these global companies, are capable of competing or implementing these contracts.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's almost as if we're taking a step back in what we're even expecting of police. We've said repeatedly that police are ill equipped to deal with the challenges our city is facing, yet we're employing a company to observe and report and then call the police.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Why exactly are we employing people to observe and report when we need, especially in the places that we're employing them, when we need experts to guide, to support, to connect, to de-escalate, to comfort, to assure the people in those spaces.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Why are we paying for them to observe and report when we are actually all aware of incidents where they've gotten fatally physical? Why would we not recognize the financial interest of those who were supporting this contract tonight? We're not telling our citizens we want to protect them.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We're telling them we're willing to give them money whenever they want it, no matter what. We have no standards. We have no expectations of protection of life. We have no intent to do the hard work to find out what really makes people safe.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If the job is observing and reporting, then it makes no sense to me that we're only contracting with one company to do this work. If we can unbundle. If we're nearly 50% reduced in our in-person venues, if we're insistent on civilizing this role, why aren't we taking the moment to do it now?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Explore creative options. The sheriffs could have a civilian nice branch of their department. We could do this in a way that creates more accountability and opens us up to less liability and vulnerability with predatory companies. The same issue raised by Ms..'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Jolly for not wanting to unbundle the issues of communication protocols, use of force, a lack of a coordinated response among multiple contractors if we were to have them. Those are the exact same real life challenges that led to a loss of life on this agency's watch in our facilities just a few months ago.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'A settlement after three years and an attempted gag order on this victim doesn't show that ally is changing its ways. It shows us that they know that paying off this case and paying for trainings is needed in order to to silence the opposition to this contract.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's the only leverage they have in this moment. And it was cheap for them to use it. While this company should be doing these things because it's good business, Denver should be doing our own good business and denying this contract we can revisit after they're better trained.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'When the local cases are settled and paid and they're doing a better job at being humans. We'll come back to it. A simple Google search shows us that in other city councils across the country, they are standing strong and finding this company to be out of alignment with their values and refusing to enter into contracts with them'",
        "'speaker_3': '. Why is Denver not taking the lead knowing that they have a history of wage theft, sexism, racism, harassment, intimidation, abuse of force, etc., etc.? Those are all red flags proof a track record that we need to take into consideration.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We weren't even told they were in the top running or even in the RFP process for this contract when we had these same issues on their $4 million emergency contract. Until they build a better track record. We need to take human lives as serious as some of us take derogatory comments from national chains.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We decide to boycott them in the name of justice for comments. But right now, we're giving $25 million to a company that has stolen lives from people in our very own city. We need a boycott on any entity perpetuating racism, classism, and facilitating murder with taxpayer dollars.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's all I have to say tonight. Thank you, Councilwoman Gilmore or President Gilmore. And thank you, everybody who stayed to testify. And I apologize on behalf of our body for those of you who stayed and were unable to testify.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman CdeBaca. I don't see any other hands raised. And so I will go ahead and share my comments. I have looked at this closely and. It's a little bit too late. It's a lot of learning, a lot of shuffling.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But it wasn't going to be done unless we asked the questions, unless we held it up in committee, unless we had this courtesy public hearing. But it still seems a bit hollow because. It feels like it's a house of cards a little bit.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It feels like there's a lot of change management going on now. When I didn't see it in committee, I didn't hear it on the phone. And so I have regretted and I don't regret any of my votes. I do not.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's not an issue that I have. The one vote that I regret is the vote on this contract at the beginning of the pandemic when we were hiring them for our shelter care. That is the one vote that I regret and I won't regret it again and put that to fate.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I will not be supporting this tonight either. Madam Secretary, roll call, please.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'CDEBACA No. Clark.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'When?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Brendan.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hi.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'No.'",
