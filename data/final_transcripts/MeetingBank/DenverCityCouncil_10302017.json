    "AS AMENDED a bill for an ordinance amending Article IX of Chapter 24 and Article I of Chapter 38 of the Denver Revised Municipal Code to prohibit smoking of tobacco and marijuana products on the 16th Street Pedestrian and Transit Mall and to regulate smoking of tobacco and marijuana products in certain public places. Amends the Denver Revised Municipal Code regarding smoking prohibitions and marijuana products on the 16th Street Pedestrian and Transit Mall.  The Committee approved filing this bill at its meeting on 10-11-17. Amended 10-30-17 to give Council opportunity to re-evaluate the smoking ordinance to assure that the enactment is for public benefit and positive health outcomes and that certain populations are not unnecessarily impacted by the ordinance in negative outcomes.": [
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, President Pro tem. Now, I'll do a quick recap on the resolutions we have. Nothing has been called out under bills for introduction. Nothing has been called out under bills for final consideration. And Councilman Cashman has called out Council Bill 1125, the Breathe Easy Ordinance four amendments and under pending no items have been caught out.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Madam Secretary, please bring up 1125. Councilman. Clerk, please put 1125 on the floor.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I move that council 1125 be placed upon final consideration and do pass.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It has been moved in second and councilman second. Oh, sorry. I need a second from the left side or the or one person on the right side. All right, Councilman Cashman, thank you. It's moved in second. Did Councilman Castro, you want to offer your your motion to amend it?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I moved to amend Bill number 17, dash 1125 as follows On page three after line 20 to add a new section, the entitled reporting requirement, the Denver Police Department shall prepare a report concerning tickets issued pursuant to this ordinance and distributed to the City Council Quarterly.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman. I believe you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You got a second?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. First, it's been first, and second it comes members of Council Councilman Cashman.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mr. President. So, as you're aware, I will also be preparing a follow up amendment to add a sunset clause. I want to read comments regarding both. At this time, I am fully in support of discouraging smoking in public places.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I have no question that secondhand smoke is a public health hazard. I'm dealing right now with a family member who never smoked herself, but due to her parents heavy cigaret habits is struggling with the effects of COPD. If the result of this legislation is improved health health outcomes for visitors to the 16th Street Mall, I will consider'",
        "'speaker_7': 'the bill to have fulfilled perhaps our most basic charge as legislators to protect the health and safety of the community. My concern, however, since I first heard of this proposal or something similar a couple of years ago, is that it could be unfairly wielded to harass particular groups of people in an effort to sanitize the mall, not'",
        "'speaker_7': 'from health impacts, but from the visual impact of those members of Denver's community whose presence casts a bit of a shadow on the All is rosy in Denver backdrop that businesses would like visitors to experience while visiting the mall.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'm aware that should this ordinance pass this evening, those mall denizens who wish to exercise their God given right to threaten their own health have only to walk 51 feet down a side street to avoid the bill's reach and find a spot to light up outside the reach of the long arm of the law.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I just want to be absolutely sure that those who decide to not take that stroll, either due to obstinance or ignorance, are warned or ticketed without regard as to whether they are 17th Street lawyers. Conventioneers in town from L.A. or New York.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Or those who are on the streets because they have no home to which they can retreat. Mr. President, I am very much appreciative of your willingness, your your indication of your willingness to incorporate in this legislation, this requirement that the police department report regularly to council with information as to who is being cited under the requirements of'",
        "'speaker_7': 'this bill. I know you felt the data could be gathered through rules and regulations, and I thank you for your honoring the feelings of those concerned that the extra weight of ordinance would ensure compliance. I think another important element of this bill is missing.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'As I mentioned, it will be addressed soon. That is a sunset requirement that would force council to fully assess the result of this ordinance two years down the line to ensure it is being enforced in the interest of public health and not just for public relations.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I fully agree that a sunset clause should not be used indiscriminately, and I would point out that this is the first time in my time on council that I have requested such inclusion. I urge my colleagues to consider supporting both of these amendments.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Castro. And I just want to alert members of council the way that we have it. We were going to do Councilman Cashman's other bill for other amendment first, but he read his data amendment first. So just just so you're keeping up with that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'He's going to read his Sunset Amendment next. And in there, just so you're clear. Okay, Councilman Flynn, you're.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thanks, Mr. President. If I could through the through your chair, direct a question to Councilman Cashman, because I'm curious that there it's a very barebones amendment and it doesn't address the type of data that I would expect to see.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So in other words, the DPD could comply with this simply by giving us a number each quarter since we issued, you know, 38 tickets. Should there have been a requirement in here as to what pin what measures of data you were seeking?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Sure. No, I intentionally left it. The General I'm working with Chief Kenyan us, who has told me that they will be able to report if a person is transient or if they list an address for a homeless shelter.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The addresses they report will also tell us if they're local residents or from out of town in discussions with our city attorney. It was suggested that we keep the ordinance a bit.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Flat, clean.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so as to allow for changes. We might want to add additional information down the line. So I look forward to working with the department on that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. Thank you. Thank you very much for that clarification.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And thank you, Councilman Flynn. And also say two members of council before this was brought up. I misspoke and said it was going to be in rules and regulations. It's actually going to be in the training bulletin for the police for this specific ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that in the ordinance, I think you're going to have that greater flexibility of what kind of data you want to see. So that's right on. Councilman Espinosa, you're up.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No, I just wanted to thank Councilman Cashman for bringing forward this amendment. I think it. You know, it's an important component for me to support this this legislation because it, you know, it helps to allow us to, to, um, review and monitor, um, the, the, the effect that this, I mean, who's been affected by this ordinance and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'if anybody is disproportionately affected by this ordinance. Our committee I, I went over the the that the CBO, the National Institutes of Health, the CDC sorry. Center for Disease Control. And their statistics on who smokes and how certain populations are disproportionately smokers and that it should look like an ordinance without this sort of provision could and the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'subsequent sunset provision could simply go in the direction not of public health outcomes, but to sort of disproportionately affect a very, very specific population. And in that is not a sort of a good use of government to sort of, you know, bring a heavy hammer down on a very, very specific street in Denver under the guise of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'health concerns, because we have these health concerns citywide. And so thank you for bringing both amendments forward, because I think there are two very vital components. And I do think the sunset is important as well, because when we did, you know, one of the first things we had to address when I was a new member of council'",
        "'speaker_2': 'was the sunset on the marijuana moratorium. And I think, ah, the legwork that this body did in the run up to addressing that sunset improved our legislation going forward. And I think that's what this has the potential to do, is let's give it a shot in this limited way, see what sort of outcomes we're getting and compel'",
        "'speaker_2': 'us or future councils to, um, to, to sort of make the necessary tweaks and improve or expand, you know, because if we are getting genuine great health outcomes, there would be no reason to sort of try and capture that in a larger area.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So thank you, Councilman Cashman.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right, Councilman Lopez.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I also wanted to chime in on this. I think this amendment makes a lot of sense. You know, I know that there are some concerns out there in the community. And I wanted to make sure I mean, a lot of the folks here, I think almost everybody shares those concerns.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think, you know, Councilman Brooks, in his in the in the ordinance addressed a lot of the things that we were concerned about in terms of does this kind of does the violation lead to any kind of incarceration?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It does not. Does it lead to the courts and getting tied up with with with with too many fines? It doesn't. You know, I think we also have to remember that folks that smoke. Wear different clothes, have different titles, are from all walks of life.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And it is not just the, you know, smoking is not a crime. But making sure that you at the same time policies like this are very common, especially that the Mall is becoming more than just a pass through a walk through mall that people have.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'People are sitting down having meals with their families, especially on the actual mall property. And I think when you when you think of air, when you think of healthy environments, that's one of them. So does this end up with somebody becoming arrested?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It does not. Does this end up with somebody, somebody in court over a fine? Most likely not. It is not a criminal violation. What it does is I think it gives folks an opportunity to educate folks about where and where not to smoke.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, my conversations with with Councilman Brooks, it seems like all those bases are covered. I think that the data collection is important. Right, because I've seen the data in other cities and it's disproportionate. And so I want to make sure that in our cities and I think this is why I support this amendment, that we measure'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it, we make sure we have a good understanding of who's who's in violation and who isn't, and then and then move from there. But at the end of the day, I think it's a good amendment where. Good audience.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Lopez. Councilman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I just want to speak in support of this amendment. It is critical that we have fair application of the law. Otherwise, I think we if if the data shows that there is disproportionate application, it would subject the ordinance to a potential legal challenge at some point in time in the future.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so this ensures that we are, you know, applying equally across the board. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you, Councilman Ortega. Hey. And I will just say this. You know, I want to thank the folks who came up. The opponents of the bill, actually, Denver homicide allowed to have the conversation because it allowed us to to talk about the depth in which we went in to develop this ordinance to address those issues'",
        "'speaker_0': '. And I just want to go into them just a little bit in this section of the code, which does not allow smoking on our municipal and hospital buildings. It is a criminal violation today. This section of the code makes it a civil infraction.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so when we add the 16th Street Mile, that is a civil infraction, meaning that there can be no fines up to $99 or, you know, time in jail. One, two. We have something in this city. You know, we have these these programs in the city, homeless court, drug court and things like that, which waive all fines'",
        "'speaker_0': 'for folks experiencing transition, homelessness, all kinds of things in their life. And so that happens every day. And we wanted to make sure that this was a part of this as well. And lastly, we are already doing audits on the 16th Street Mall and Denver Health is doing that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we just had an audit of for 3 hours, there's more people smoking on the mall than I even realized, 3 hours, people smoking in the mall, five blocks over 80 people and just less than a handful were people in transition or people experiencing homelessness.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I think it's important that we track that. I think it's critical, but it also it's also critical for us to see what is the original intent of this bill, what was the original intent of the Clean Indoor Act when we passed that, it was because of health issues.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so this is a campaign and if it's not shown as a campaign, we'll go back and look at it. And so I'm going to be in support of this, even though from the very beginning we were going to put it in the training bulletin.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think. I think if we put it within the ordinance, it strengthens it and and lets folks know that we're serious about it. So I'll be supporting this councilman as well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Is there anybody here to answer a question or is it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, there are people here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Who are you? So I just have one, two questions because I keep thinking about the unintended consequences of sort of the third door down and each direction from the mall. The first question is, is there a smoking ban on Larimer Street right now?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No. The only smoking smoke free zone is on on the pavilions within Union Station.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Because that that is my concern. And I don't know how we'll address it in real time if it becomes one where, again, people might congregate in those in those still desirable places to hang out, you know, 50 feet away from the 16th Street Mall.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And just the last piece and I think Councilman Lopez brought this up, 4500 municipalities take it to the next level of smoke free zones, more than 16th Street Mall, more than their municipal buildings, but parks, every commercial area.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so this is just a small step for the city of Denver. Madam Secretary, roll call on the amendment Cashman.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I can each I Lopez.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'II.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Black.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Clark, I.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Espinosa. Hi, Flynn. Hi. Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I please close the voting and thus results.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sorry one is missing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh, that's me.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Nine eyes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right, nine eyes. The council. Bill 1125 has been amended. Councilman Castro, I want you offer up your Second Amendment.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I move to amend council bill number 17, dash 1125 as follows On page three, line 23, after the year 2017, add the following language to the sentence and sections 20 4-3, oh four B6 and 30 8-9 will be repealed two years after the effective date.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. It has been moved and seconded. Comments. Members Council Councilman Cashman.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mr. President. As I said, I made my my comments earlier. I would just reiterate that I think having the sunset as as Councilwoman Espinosa recalled earlier regarding the marijuana ordinance causes us to take a little bit more in-depth look.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. So that's the reasoning behind this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. No other members. Um, Councilman Flynn, can I. Can I go first? Just. Just as a sponsor? Just to set the tone a little bit? No.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Oh, okay. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I tell you, Flynn boy, he's must be the Broncos playing tonight. So. So I'll just say, you know, I appreciate, you know, the councilman with his concern and, you know, sun for me, I have a personal deal with sunsets, unless it's a financial or fiscal issue to the taxpayer.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But to to put a sunset on this is to say, what is the importance of us doing this health initiative in the first place? We might as well not do it. We might as well not take the step in addressing secondhand smoke.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We might as well not do this important initiative that cities are doing this all over the country. And so I am against this this sunset. And I think it actually hurts the overall amendment. Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I, again, maybe would like to through you asked Councilman Cashman why the two years? Because I'm generally very predisposed to sunsets, especially on new policies, so that we are forced to evaluate them. But two years seems like too short of a time.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We talked before the meeting and I had suggested five years. And so, Mr. President, through you, maybe Councilman Cashman could address that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Councilman Flynn. Yeah. The reason for the two years is if and I do not expect this to be the case, but if the ordinance was being inappropriately applied or inordinately applied in a certain direction, I wouldn't want to wait five years to correct that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I think two years would be sufficient time to assess the legislation.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'All right. Thank you. Although I would point out that we we could repeal it the next week that we that we saw a problem. So I do have a problem with just two years. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right, Councilman, I it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. I just want to remind folks, when we created the lower downtown historic district in the changes to the B seven zone, we had two year reviews with a six year sunset. And, you know, it gave everybody a chance to see how the program worked.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And at the end of the second two year review, everybody said, this is working fine, let's remove the sunset. I think this gives us an opportunity to really monitor, to look at the data, to figure out, is this working the way we anticipated it?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I mean, at any time we could amend the ordinance, we could institute a sunset, we could remove the ordinance. But I think by having this in there, it just ensures that we're going to do a deeper look at the end of the two year time frame and determine, do we want to keep it?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Is it making sense? No different than what we did with the lower downtown historic district. And I mean, you see the success of what we have down there today. So I'm supporting it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Okay. Thank you. I just want to point out one one more just quick point, because I think context matters in the context of health initiatives in the city, in the context of this ordinance that we're actually looking at as a larger bill.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have never did any kind of sunset over that. So when we said, hey, we're going to look at municipal buildings and hospitals, we didn't say, you know what, let's let's look at who it's disproportionately affecting and let's put a sunset on that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that's why I feel like it's a little different when we talk about health initiatives.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Councilman Lopez Yeah, thank you, Mr. President. I do have a question. If you if it's okay and Chief Quinonez, if you want to come to the microphone. So my question is, Chief, as this ordinance, as it becomes law and somebody smoking in one of the zones on 16th Street Mall, that's not allowed.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'What is the protocol? Is the protocol to issue a ticket right then and there or is there a warning? How many warnings is it at the discretion of an officer? Is it necessary to give a ticket? I mean, I just want to just kind of figure out from a law enforcement perspective what what the protocol is, what'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the approach is to an ordinance like this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Councilman Lopez, David Cannon is deputy.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Chief of operations for the Denver Police.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Department. We are still working on the training bulletin that was referenced earlier. I anticipate this being like other civil violations where our first preference is an advisement. Really, we want to stop the.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Behavior if a.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Verbal advisement suffices and then that's the preference. If we don't write any citations and we eliminate the smoking on the Mall, we consider that a success. Really, it's going to be the responses that we get from the people that we're trying to advise that that may dictate going to the next step, which could be a written warning'",
        "'speaker_2': '. Or then the citation really the citation will be the that the last the last course of action that we'd.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Like to see. Okay. So it's not necessary for an officer to write a ticket right then and there?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It is not necessary. They do have discretion to do that. But like I said, we are doing the training bulletin. As we speak, we're waiting to see the final draft of the language and then we'll put that in place.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I just wanted to ask you a question. Council President Brooks, in your conversations with the Downtown Denver Partnership, can you talk about what kind of signage, how, how frequent that's expected to be up and down? Yeah. Great question.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Understand, they don't need to wait to have an officer come and tell them, you know, you can't smoke on the mall. Can you talk about that?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Great question. Thank you for telling that up. After all, this is a campaign. And so, you know, there are downtown Denver partnership folks in the audience here. But when we presented we presented the sign in committee. The plan right now is to have the sign every other block.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We're starting this December 1st. And one of the things we're going to do is twofold. We have $10,000 from Denver Health for signage. And we're going to get some signs on the busses up and down the mall. We're going to pass out leaflets to individuals up and down the mall that will be designed by the bid in'",
        "'speaker_0': 'our office and will work with them in conjunction. And if we feel like we need to beef up kind of signage and things like that, we'll have that definite conversation. I think that's important, but it's at least going to take us a good 30 days ahead of time to start ramping this up.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And talking to Chief Quinonez, one of the things we talked about is. People don't need to. This is not a citation driven exercise. It is a please go 50 feet over there, please. We're trying to do not smoke in front of someone.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Please be respectful. And there's not a just chief canyon as their security on the mall as well from the downtown partnership. And there also is RTD security on the mall saw a lot of individuals being able to to, you know, tell folks what to do and give them direction.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So can you just answer one last question that also includes the managers of the building so that adequate notification is also within each building, you know, maybe as people are walking outside or whatever, so that, you know, they know they have to be 50 feet off.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. I mean, this is one of the nice things about the business improvement district and also, you know, which is within the downtown of our partnership is we've been meeting with those individuals, we meet with all of the restaurateurs, we meet with all the businesses, all the building owners to talk about the kind of signage and the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'kind of education that they need to get their folks in the building.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I just want to make one last statement, and that is that. I personally have a hard time being around smoke because I have asthma and when I am around it it is very challenging to breathe. So I support the ordinance, but I think the amendment is important as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you, Councilman Espinoza.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah. Just hearing this conversation again, I already mentioned my concern about unintended consequences. But I do think there are actually more things that even coming to mind as we're talking. You know, if we're if we're illicit means solicited and if we're involving other security officials to sort of help with the reminders, you know, I'm worried about there'",
        "'speaker_2': 'being different sorts of confrontations and other things that have been prevalent on the Mall. And so I think that that only reinforces my desire to have a sunset to so that we're we're we're doing that sort of in-depth, deep dove with the FA, meaning the police on the data that they have on the sort of interactions that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'are going on with the Downtown Denver Partnership and and sort of what kind of outcomes are being happening. You know, because also, you know, one of the concerns we keep hearing from our visitors and stuff like that about the mall, you know, again, if we're pushing a concentrated group of smoking population 50 feet off the mall, if'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that happens to be in the direction of a particular hotel or the convention center, you're going to get some feedback, different feedback there as well. And so I just think having a two year sunset forces us to have this conversation about all the things that we're not talking about or thinking about right now.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So it's easy to recognize that there are definite health benefits to not having secondhand smoke in a particular area where they're high concentrations of people and getting that out of there and doing it in a respectful way, you know, and not prohibiting people from coming back, obviously, after they have their smoke.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But if they're lingering in that one spot for that smoke and there's a concentration, you know, or there's some aggressive behavior because somebody is trying to exercise their civil liberties, you know, it would just be good that we're sort of making sure that we're having that conversation in two years time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think I think you, Councilman Espinosa, two quick points. The security on the Mall nor the RTD security are permitted to write tickets. One, two, since the security mall has been in effect, we've seen a 15% drop in criminal activity and confrontations and things like that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I hear you. I hear what you're saying, but we haven't seen those issues three since. The pavilions in front of Union Station is a smoke free zone. And I've said this a number of times. That is the perfect test case for how this is going to go, because you would see you would think that there'",
        "'speaker_0': 'would be groups of individuals on each side of Union Station, but there's so many people and Denver is so dispersed that it just kind of spreads out evenly. So it's it's very interesting to feel like we have a great test model and we're excited to see it move on.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Lopez, I saw you back in the queue.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah, I just I just wanted to just to chime in on the amendment overall and look. You know, I have a great deal of honor and respect and admiration for, uh, for Councilman Kash, and I think he is.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'With this amendment, I think it's, you know, it shares a lot of our sentiment about, you know, making sure that we're doing right, making sure that the citations are not something punitive. It's going to land on somebody's case for a record, but potentially get a job, things like that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, I do understand the intent for the sunset. I absolutely do. But I keep thinking about. And this wasn't too long ago and this was when we had the ban at smoking. Denver health and for a long time you know in council in Boise and brought it forward for a long time I was I was very'",
        "'speaker_3': 'neutral on it because I thought to myself, man, well, what if we're going to get the wrong people? What if this is the folks that are hanging out outside of the hospital? What if this is I mean, this is just is it going after the nurses?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is it going after, you know, folks who are just stressed out and need a quick smoke? And it's sort of the idea of the sunset, but the idea that the reason why I didn't support it then and and and and I'm not going to support the amendment now is because I think that data when you have that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'data requirement, we didn't collect the data and now this one does. It takes time for that data to to kick in. Right. To really learn from it. However, you know, in no way is my opposition to the amendment and opposition of of of the idea or than the need to bring it back to constantly review our policies'",
        "'speaker_3': '. I think we always should. Or Councilman Cashman's, heart or mind on this. I, um, I just think we need a little bit more time to study that data. And, and also because this is just comes from my experience being on the council when we did this for Denver Health and all the property, all the public property around'",
        "'speaker_3': '. And that is a very big property. Right. So and it has proved to be not a big deal. And as a matter of fact, it is. I went there all the time. You don't smell. You don't smell any smoke around around the hospital.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I spent a lot of time, unfortunately, there with family. And that was the one thing I, I felt good about, especially with with a grandmother who had smoked all her life and was no longer smoking. When she would smell, she'd want one and bring having her walk around without having that was a good deal.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So, you know, respectfully, uh, you know, I won't support the amendment, but I do support the data collection. I think we're heading in the right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Direction, Councilman. All right. Thank you, Councilman Lopez. Councilman Espinosa, back up.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah, I just wanted to stress that my concern isn't actually the effective efficacy of this ordinance on the 16th Street Mall itself. It's the unintended consequences to the rest of our businesses and and in downtown Denver that are not in this area that has got this, uh, this special civil rule.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So. Well, it definitely, you know, has an effect at Union Station. Union Station is, is, you know, you just have to be on the sidewalk and you're you're sort of unbowed. This is definitely a situation where, um, where you will displace U.S. people with this addiction.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And, and, you know, we definitely, you know, it won't be in the reporting that the police department's doing if it's having an effect on businesses, you know, uh, adjacent to the mall, uh, public spaces adjacent to the mall, Skyline Park, Larimer Square, um, you know, Lazy Street, uh, the, the, the, the mall shuttle, I mean, not the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'mall, the, and so it is, you know, the Renaissance Hotel or something like that. There's a lot of other, uh, you know, uh, participants here that are within, you know, just, just outside that 50 foot zone that might in fact, impact.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean, is that going to be enough for us to address a different sort of set of ordinances? And how do we get that if we don't actually open this up for a conversation, a designed, uh, and planned conversation and some at some point in time?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The concern also is, you know, you're very mindful of the concern about the the concerns about the camping ban. And I would not want to find us in a situation where a population is being disproportionately impacted or there might be some unintended consequences that we're then having to try to, you know, tiptoe around or address with other'",
        "'speaker_2': 'means when in fact, we could just revisit the originating ordinance in a manner that actually would do sort of multiple things. So having a sunset date, I think, forces us to have that conversation in a way that we otherwise just wouldn't voluntarily do.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right, Madam Secretary, it's been moved and seconded, voting on the amendment to sunset on 1125. Now Secretary Raquel.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Nine Eyes Council Bill 1125 has been ordered. Excuse me.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'President Brooks, may I just clarify? It was brought to my attention that there was something in the motion that suggested it needed to be published, which that's not the case. This is a final reading that is substantive amendment.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This was a non substantive amendment. This is the data requirement.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's right. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So do we vote again? Why don't you make a new motion, a motion to approve on final reading and then vote again? Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. All right. It's good to have lawyers in the room, huh? Okay. I move. That counts. About 1125 be ordered. No, no, no, no. You must be adopted to be adopted as amendment. As amended? Yep. Be adopted as amended.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Can I get it? Can I get a man? Our second. One of the two. All right. It's been moved and seconded. Madam Secretary, roll call.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Cashman. I can eat right. Lopez Ortega. Black Eye. Clark Espinosa.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'You will need to vote otherwise your last. This is your last chance to call it an item for a separate vote. Councilman. Clerk, will you put the resolutions for adoption and bills for final consideration on final passage on the floor?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I move that resolution, resolutions be adopted, and bills on final consideration be placed upon final consideration and do pass in a block for the following items. 114611351077. 1136113911481150113411541226110111041105110611071108110911 ten 1111111211131114111511161117. 111811191103.
