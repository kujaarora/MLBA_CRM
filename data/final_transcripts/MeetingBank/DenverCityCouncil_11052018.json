        "'speaker_4': 'And as an African-American serving as an elected official here, I realized that I stand on his body, on his shoulders and what he suffered and the violence he suffered because of the color of his skin. See, the thing about Emmett Till and and Preston John is that they didn't commit any crime.'",

There's still folks in this country who are being shot and murdered in our streets just because of the color of their skin.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Because they're black. We have to do more. This is an a very important proclamation, I believe, Councilman Brooks, because it doesn't just recognize something that's in our past, but something that we can correct today. And we can correct today in our governance, we can correct today in our society by standing up for people who are oppressed.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Councilwoman. Councilman, this is a beautiful building. Yes, very historic. But in this time and in this day and age of people that are houseless, I think that it should be used for better and serve the better public. And it should be used for people like a HUD housing, like Roanoke Apartments are on a bait and log.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so I, I do not feel that we should use it for people who already have money for houses that they could get elsewhere. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next up, John Paulson.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hello, counsel. My name is John Wilson. I'm with Historic Denver. I really want to take this time to to support the ownership on this project. I think this is a wonderful project for the Capitol Hill and Uptown neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This has some very unique qualities from a standpoint that was mentioned earlier by Caroline of the city that this was a multifamily property that was brought in to bring the middle class up to the areas of the mansion development.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And now it can be used again for that housing. It was in really, really rough shape in the very recent history as far as the ownership just mentioned. And this has been a wonderful turnaround. And I just want to state that this is one of the tools of historic preservation, is actually these tax credits, the state and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'federal tax credits to be able to get this done. This is, I would say, the ownership group here as doing wonderful work. And I think they're doing it in many ways because it's the right thing to do for their project.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And it's also a beautiful thing to do for the city to preserve something like this, for this neighborhood, and to have it reused again. But they're also bringing it forward because this is financially advantageous for this project and we're hoping to see many, many more of these going forward.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Historic Denver has been fighting for these types of incentives for historic preservation for a long time. We are continually to fight to fight for them. We had to do that with the reauthorization of the of the tax code nationally.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we're hoping to have more incentives as well. And we want to have more developers like this who see the assets of Denver and really want this to be a part of the future of Denver as well as, you know, have this be a useful building to be able to live in.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I want to thank you. And I also want to encourage you to designate this property so all of this comes to fruition. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next up, Jesse Paris.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening, members of council. My name is Jesse Paris. I'm running for City Council at large 2019 and I am neither for or against this. I just had a few questions on this proposal. What will be the EMI level for these apartments?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'How many people will be living at this property and. Yeah. That was it. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next up, Chairman CQ.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I just want with you. My name's Chairman Sekou. Organizers have founded Blackstar, a movement for self-defense. Champion of the oppressed. The vulnerable. Poor, working poor. Homeless folks, senior citizens.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Students.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And others. After listening to. What was said. And having a conversation with the owner. What we're talking about here is ten hotel rooms. And ten apartments or 11 hotel rooms. It's a small little thing here. And it's been done.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'In a way. That. Satisfies the need for housing for folks who can't afford it. All of this is going to be market rate. And there's some folks who can't afford market rate. Some people go to six, go to a Super eight, some people go down to the brown.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But just cause you go to the Brown Palace to make you better than the folks that go to the sex, you just can't afford it. It's a part of America that if you can afford it, get it. And if you can't afford it, then you need to organize yourself so you can get what you need to get'",
        "'speaker_10': '. Just like they organized themselves to get what they want to get. So what you have really here is a question of those that are organized versus those that are not. My job is to organize the folks. That's not.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And because I'm organizing, the people that don't have it don't mean I'm opposed to the people that can get it. I'm just down for when I'm down for it and you'll be down to what you down for. So I want folks to get the wrong impression that I got this Marxist-Leninist class thing going on.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I want to see young white folks go at it. You know, I'm saying they're not going to win it like, you know, we should have did in the Civil War. But that's not story. But what we have here is an opportunity to correct historical wrong.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We just celebrate in an analysis the murder of press the DA. What better reconciliation is to get folks in there like press to John act like we believe in what we said and at least just get one unit.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Or just get one part of the name of the president on something, something concrete other than an empty proclamation that don't carry no legal weight whatsoever. Let's make it meaningful what we do here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Your time is up. Next up, David River.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'David Roy Bob. Good evening, council. I live at 742 West Ninth Avenue, grew up in this neighborhood. My family were at the Children's Hospital for a long time, so I always walk through there, see the historic area. I mean, it's awesome.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There's always a story there and I'm glad for all the work that historic Denver is doing. I went to the the West Side history meeting and it's bring together people that carry them stories. And, you know, I just support support the historic designation of this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I just wonder there's any stories from our long term residents. I know it was a it was a hostel, was a boarding house, but there's a lot of stories used to be the Crusader just is right there in and a block away at the right there by their motto was where the robbery was planned.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And it's also part of the district that crosses crosses Colfax. So I hope with the passing of the X Y that changes the districts, I hope back and you know, we could see more straighter lines the districts. And I hope this building brings more life to the community and more opportunities for the low income residents.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I hope to keep it affordable because that building once was affordable. So if we keep the historic designation affordable to stay the same and if, you know, to see if it's going to change after this change and if there's going to be more resilience, because I know the hospital is growing, so it'll be interesting to see'",
        "'speaker_1': 'if it brings more growth on that side. And Will and and I know these past the Emily Griffith and I know used to use an old buildings and I hope to see more old buildings used for housing and opportunities and bringing people back to the community safe on the streets.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. That concludes our speakers. Are there any questions from members of the council? Councilman Flynn. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'd like to ask the owner. The restoration that's going to occur. Are you? You're restoring the front from what I saw here, the the porticos or whatever the structure was on the front. Are you also looking at the Washington Street side and restoring that as well?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Excellent. Yeah. So we actually did a entire survey of the property right from a window perspective first. Had to replace probably 40% of the windows with divided light wood windows, which is somewhat of a challenge in itself. A lot of the windows were restoring back to the original is also inside the building and all the new systems'",
        "'speaker_1': 'are upgraded plumbing, electrical, HVAC, wood floors or lacing and the original wood floors which were fur back in 1907. All all new trim where it needs trim, but restoring the trim and the handrails that were existing. So, yeah, it's a full, full renovation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. And right now in Washington Street side, there's parking right up against the facade where there used to be a lawn. Are you what's your plan there? So that that will continue to remain parking for the project? Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Flynn. Seeing no other questions. The public hearing for accountable 1160 is closed. Are there any comments by members of council councilman?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I and my whole district judiciary team has got some wonderful examples of historic homes, and we've done a great job of preserving them. And in remembering the history of Denver and Capitol Hill is another great area where we got some beautiful homes.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And today I rode by the building checking it out to see it. And I can tell the work that you're going to do is going to really restore that building to its beauty and and the tender, loving care that you're given to.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I really appreciate what you're doing. There's going to be Capitol Hill is growing. We'll have more residential, more commercial development there. And there's going to be a wonderful asset. And and I hope we will have more historic buildings preserved in that area.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman. Knew seeing no other comments. Madam Secretary, roll call.'",
