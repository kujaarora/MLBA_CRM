        "'speaker_5': 'I'm going to move into the next set of criteria which talk about PDS specifically and how the request is meeting the intent and purpose of the Pudi zoning. So we have an additional set of review criteria on top of the standard five rezoning criteria for PWDS.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The first criteria is that the Pudi District is consistent with the intent and purpose of such districts, as stated in Article nine Division 9.6 of the zoning code.

So the Pudi is consistent with the surrounding industrial and urban neighborhood context as seen through the split of the sub areas and the significant public benefit as I've covered the privately owned but public accessible open space requirement as a gateway to'",
        "'speaker_5': 'the new 39th Avenue development, as well as a higher standard of street level activation through transparency and additional requirements for parking lot screening with amenities to enhance pedestrian character around York Street are all contributing to the required significant public benefit.'",
