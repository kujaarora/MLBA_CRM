And so for a period of, I guess, going now on 14 years, we have had to extend the maturity date of'",
        "'speaker_6': 'that so that we were able to work with the developer so that he would be able to find the financing to build the housing. We came to committee in 2012 as part of our series of loan portfolio workouts, and we essentially called the loan at that point.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We had said that if by January 2014, this developer was not able to find financing, namely through low income housing tax credits, that we would do a deed in lieu of foreclosure. 2014, obviously is his past. January 2014 has passed.'",

Ultimately, what we want to see there is the development of affordable housing. So we're willing to work with the developer once again to fully realize affordable housing on that property.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'One thing to keep in mind is that although we do have a deed in lieu on the property itself, it doesn't come close to making us whole.

Encourages quality infill development that's consistent with the character of the surrounding neighborhood and also encourages high quality, mixed use development that would support diverse housing needs in public transportation.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Blueprint Denver identifies Alameda Avenue as a pedestrian shopping corridor, and you see that hatch lines representing area of change along the corridor. Four properties fronting Alameda Avenue. Alameda Avenue is a commercial arterial. These are regionally significant streets that carry traffic as well as other modes of transportation, including pedestrians and transit, to access mixed use conditions and to'",
        "'speaker_6': 'connect various districts and particularly commercial districts throughout the city. Irving Street is an enhanced transit corridor or excuse me, Irving Street is a residential collector, and collectors are intended to connect neighborhoods to other neighborhoods or to commercial street arterial streets and Nevada Places Local Street The Westwood Neighborhood Plan was adopted in 1986 and recommends mixed use development'",
        "'speaker_6': 'as part of a business district fronting Alameda. It recommends improving the linkage or transition between the Westwood neighborhood and Farnham neighborhoods to the north. It's a just providing services and products through this development, fronting an Alameda that would benefit surrounding residents and also suggest ample street frontage or excuse me, ample front and rear setbacks with landscaping.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And you'll note in this photo that there is no on street parking. And so there's a fairly intensive street condition with traffic moving right next to the sidewalk. And so this could be the purpose of this recommendation is to create some more of a buffer between that street condition and future development.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I would point out that the Plan West with plan recommends or references B-2 zoning, which allows for commercial and residential mixed uses and also allows for 1 to 1 floor to area ratio with no specified height limit. The rezoning request of the Zone District would result in uniform application of district regulations.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It would further public health, safety and welfare by implementing the recommendations of these adopted plans. The justifying circumstance as a changed or changing conditions, including the need for housing in Westwood neighborhood to support existing and new businesses and public transit along Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The other condition is the demolition of commercial structures on the site that took place about 15 years ago. And I just point to this 1995 aerial showing, commercial block buildings fronting Alameda. They were demolished by 2000 in this aerial image and still largely vacant site today.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The final review criteria is consistency with neighborhood context, zone, district, purpose and intent. The urban edge residential mixed use zone districts are intended to improve the transition from commercial mixed use. Areas to lower skill residential areas. They allow for diverse uses and building forms that activate the public realm and create safe, walkable and pedestrian skilled neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'An Era five zoning would allow for limited commercial. And more flexible building standard that would allow for landscape buffering along busy streets such as Alameda Avenue. Upon finding that these review criteria have been met, CPD recommends approval of this application.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I would also mention that there are two representatives, if you care, to pose any questions to them about their rezoning interest.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. Atkins. We have three speakers and I'll call all three. Out to the front pew Bob Golic, Arthur McDermott and Jason Hahn. And Mr. Golic, you can go ahead and take the podium and begin your remarks.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Mr. President, members of Council, good evening. My name is Bob Golic and my address is 609 South Gaylord Street in Denver. Change conditions are what support this rezoning request. There's a revitalization going on throughout the entire Westwood neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We have new development and new infrastructure in Mawson Road, which is just two blocks west of the subject site. There's a new park called Quattro Viento, meaning four winds which recently opened at the corner of Alameda and Newton, which is two blocks away from the subject property.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There's already a five story building at Alameda and Federal a little bit further to the west called Los Altos de Alameda. There's a desire for people to live near transit. Alameda is an enhanced transit quarter with RTD service, two light rail stations, two two separate light rail stations, as a matter of fact.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And that'll help lessen the reliance on cars, people who work downtown. We always see people who work downtown in these areas need transit. They really need transit. They don't just desire they need transit to get to their jobs and to get back home in a safe, reliable manner.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This will provide that access to several hundred new residents. It will be on Alameda if this is approved. I believe that we as a city are very fortunate to have a two acre parcel that's basically an infill site and that we can it's an opportunity to redevelop on Alameda Avenue with the infrastructure already in place.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This zoning request is already supported by Blueprint Denver. It's an area of change for pedestrian shopping corridor. The shopping quarters, as defined in Blueprint Denver, are for high residential density. We're providing medium to high residential density. Housing always drives retail, and that will be the same with this on Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The more residential units, the more people we can put on the street, the better all the commercial businesses will do along. Alameda The Westwood Plan recommends mixed use development along Alameda quarter to improve the transition between the neighborhoods, which is what we are providing.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The proposed air zone district is the correct zoned district. It's a good solution for the site. It limits development above the first floor to only residential development with ground floor commercial along with additional residential units. This provides a good transition to the existing neighborhood south of us and buffers them from the Alameda corridor.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'In some instances, this could be considered a down zoning curve. We're coming from a commercial zone district. We've had an extensive outreach program for this rezoning, and Mr. McDermott will speak to that afterwards. Planning and a result in the numerous letters of support, by the way, that are part of the Application Planning Board and CPD have given'",
        "'speaker_6': 'their support, planning board, unanimous support. I urge you to do the same, and we will answer any questions you might have.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank. Thank you, Mr. Garlic. Arthur McDermott.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Good evening. I'm Arthur McDermott. I live at 2290 South Adams Street in Denver. And it's very nice to be here this evening for this hearing. My wife and I own a small company that does big things. We develop apartments.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We develop market rate apartments, and we develop affordable apartments. In fact, we've developed over 3000 affordable apartments. We've got really good, strong partners. Transamerica Insurance, for example, is one of our partners. J.P. Morgan Chase is another one of our partners, the Royal Bank of Canada.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'RBC Capital Markets, I just mentioned is one of our partners. We have Raymond James is one of our partner, so we have blue chip partners. We are recognized for the quality work that we do. A few months ago, Dora came to me and asked if I could find a site in the Westwood area.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They came to me because we had had a very successful project with them called Dahlia Square, Senior Partner Apartments up in the Dallas Square area where Councilman Chavez's district is. We went out and searched for a spot and we found the two acres that is before you this evening.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We need to go to the higher zoning, the more stories to make the project feasible. We have to have 25 more units, which would bring us to a total of 98 units to really add for the economic feasible of the property.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Building affordable housing is tough work and many, many years ago Mayor Wellington Webb told me, You just don't realize how tough it is to build affordable housing, but we've solved that problem and we ask for your support this evening.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. McDermott. Jason, hon.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Hello. Good evening.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Uh. No more population means. You know, but great developing. I believe it. So. Well, this I I'm. You know I'm speaking. Yeah, that's it. Yeah. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. Han. That concludes our speakers. Is now time for questions. Do we have any questions from members of council? All right. Seen there in question. The public hearing on 822 is closed now, but. Oh, my God.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I apologize, Councilman Lyman.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes? I was wondering if somebody could please explain to me that this overlay allowing adult businesses in why that's included in this.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So the use overlay won the business. Is a means that Denver can provide for the First Amendment freedom of speech, right? That due to Supreme Court case law, it's incumbent upon every local government to provide for this. And so Denver's policy is to.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Not create new but to retain existing, which provides options and flexibility in the future.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So is there an existing?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There was existing you will one adult use and existing your to billboard. The billboard is expires with this rezoning but you will one is retained.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And have you heard from the community about this use being retained?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I have. And when I provide this explanation, it seems to satisfy their inquiry.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Councilman. My apologies for that. Now moving on to comments from members of Council Councilman Lopez.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. President. You know this the when rezoning this this area, it looks a little tricky. You know, before it was B2 and B2 was kind of a broad brush of a zone district for the area, really allowed everything.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And on on this site, I think for those of you who have ever been to this area, used to be the airplane bar and you just where the store the field goal after the 1978 think 77 championship game field goal post ended up at this bar.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so that's why it's a very popular place. Long gone is the bar. You know this you know, the structure there were pretty blighted. So they were leveled. It's been empty and vacant for at least ten or 12 years, I think I think even more I think probably close to 15.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, there have been houses behind this. We've looked at other uses, including commercial. Part of the problem with this particular area is that Alameda is a is a seat on. Corridor and any inlet or any cut through or anything like that has to go through cedar.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They won't allow it. They just won't allow that turn in from Alameda because it's considered a state state highway. So it's always been tricky. This particular use, however, is meeting a big need in our city. It fits the area.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think, you know, on numerous occasions I think I've seen Mr. McDermott and the folks with the development come to the community. Community met extensively with the with the organization, I think with West Virginia, those of us with residents.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Barnum, the whole gamut. Boku West, which is down the street and they're right. This is an area that is developing pretty quickly. A lot of blanks being turned around. And there's the problem in this part of town is, you know, there are folks who want to create businesses.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There are folks who could pay rent. There are folks who would buy. There just is not very many structures, is not the infrastructure is not there. The the bones, the brick and mortar is not there. And it's very expensive for folks to build.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So that's basically the challenge in this area. We've looked at it as a grocery store. We looked at it for different we looked at at a soccer field, one at one point. It's kind of a tricky corridor because that intersection is still not modernized, and that's going to be changing through public works later on this year.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'However, this particular zone district, I think, helps address this need and kind of ushers it in as opposed to just amx3, which would only allow three stories. The other thing I think that you didn't mention, which was and of course, we looked at this because the other story that's needed is due to the the east, the southeast'",
        "'speaker_3': 'corner, which creates a it's the ground kind of slope. So you can need that that extra floor, which would create, I think, the 4 to 5 building on that side just so that this building could fit on this site.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And it creates that that foundation for it. But it also makes sure that that structure is safe. That's the reason why we're going there. We're looking at this tonight and we're going for this actual zone district as opposed to just leaving it at some other mixed use zone district.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So in short, this is a you know, what seems to be a very good use. I think this is addressing a huge need for the neighborhood, but also for our city. And I think the fact that we don't have very many folks here, if any, opposed to it, speaks a lot to the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I don't want to prolong the obvious. And, you know, I'm in support of this. I think this is a good use name. What I said my colleagues also support.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Councilman Tony. Thank you, Councilman Lopez, any other comments from members of council? So, you know, Mr. Secretary, roll call.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Brooks, I.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'We will wait for technology to catch up. It has been moving and second in the public hearing on 841 is now open. May we have the staff report?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Good evening, Theresa. Looser with community planning and development. Soon as I get to the white. Okay. Here we are. So Council Bill 841 is to rezone property located at 6900 through 7100 East First Avenue. It is located in the property is located in Southeast Denver in Council District five, in the Lowry Field statistical neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Many of you know the history of Lowry. I don't know if you want me to go into the detail of this, but through the seventies and up until 2005, the Air Reserve Personnel Center and the Defense Financing and Accounting Services were located on Buckley Annex.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There were 3000 employees. In 1993, after it was announced that the Air Force base would close, the Lowry reuse plan was adopted by the city. And then in 2000, we adopted our comprehensive plan and re adopted the reuse plan as a supplement to our current plan.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then in 2000 to Blueprint, Denver was adopted. And at the time we thought that the finance and accounting services would stay. So the area was designated employment. On the Blueprint Denver map in 2005, the Department of Defense and Air Force announced closure of Buckley Annex.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So in 2008, the Buckley Annex redevelopment plan was completed by the Lowry Redevelopment Authority. It was not adopted as a city plan. It is a concept redevelopment plan that was developed after a public planning process. And it does provide a framework for land use, transportation, building height, all of the things that we normally have in our small'",
        "'speaker_5': 'area plans. In 2011, the property was vacated by the Air Force, and in 2012 the transfer of the property was complete to the Lowry Redevelopment Authority. And in 2013, the Buckley Annex General Development Plan was approved largely based on the Buckley Annex redevelopment plan.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So this is an illustration of what that redevelopment plan looks like and a purple dot showing you the property that we're discussing tonight. The property is about two and a half acres. The property owner is Larry Redevelopment Authority.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The proposal is to develop, redevelop vacant property into new row homes. And so the proposal is to rezone from oh one to general urban neighborhood rowhouse with a three storey height limit and a waiver of that height down to two and a half storeys, but from 30 feet to 35 feet in height.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'One is a former Chapter 59 zone district that was brought over into the new code, as is. There were no height limits. I'm losing my voice. Excuse me while I take a drink. There were limited uses. You'll see on the list here.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Correctional Institution, elementary schools and libraries were the only civic uses. Residential care and shelter for the homeless were the only residential uses allowed and so on with the other land uses. The General Urban Neighborhood Zone District does allow multi-unit.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's a multi-unit zoned district, so each zone, each housing unit will face the street. And this is something that was specifically outlined in the general development plan. So there are provisions in the Denver zoning code that allows some variance of heights and setbacks in bulk.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'However, you have to have an existing pattern on the block to conform to. So there is a primary street block sensitive setback and an administrative adjustment to building heights and bulk. But again, you have to have an established pattern on the block to adjust to to adjust your new development to.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And since the property we're discussing is vacant, these remedies aren't available to this applicant. So as to our review, the first submittal of this came in with a request for some parking raise of parking requirements to two parking spaces per dwelling unit and an increase in the multi-unit parking requirement from 1 to 1 and a half per'",

        "'speaker_5': 'But it's our practice on Barclay Annex to notify everyone surrounding Barclay Annex. And today you have a copy of a comment letter with your staff report.

        "'speaker_5': 'So that's the criteria that you will use tonight. As to our adopted plans, the relevant plans are current plan 2000 allow re reuse Plan Blueprint, Denver and the General Development Plan for Buckley Annex. So for Comprehensive Plan 2000, we're told to promote infill development in Denver at sites where services and infrastructure are already in place to encourage'",
        "'speaker_5': 'development of housing that meets the increasingly diverse needs of our present and future residents to encourage quality infill development with the character of surrounding neighborhoods that offers opportunities for increased density and more amenities to preserve and enhance and extend the character of our primary street system and to modify our land use regulations to ensure flexibility that accommodates'",
        "'speaker_5': 'our changing demographics and lifestyle. The Lowry redevelopment plan did not anticipate that the Air Force would leave Buckley Annex. So it was adopted in 2000 and well after in 2000. And then in 2005, when the Air Force left.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The plan was silent on that. So it is not applicable to this rezoning blueprint. Denver Also well, 2002. It is an area of change blueprint. Denver We didn't think the Air Force was leaving, but we did think that if it did, it would this Buckley Annex would be an area of change.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We hoped it would remain employment and that was the extent of the land use concept. Just the thought of in Blueprint Denver, although four areas of change, we did discuss them as areas where we wanted to channel growth, where areas where we wanted to focus the new growth that was coming to the city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And specifically to Lowry. We wanted to be able to create a new neighborhood, and that was discussed in Blueprint Denver. And we also wanted to address the edges between our areas of stability and our areas of change. So the land use concept does talk about special design considerations.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I'm sorry, I have to take another drink.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I know how you feel.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So. There is some discussion of these transitions between areas of change in areas of stability and particularly height transitions, which is one of the features of the general development plan. So the transportation aspect of Blueprint in Denver First Avenue is a residential collector, street collectors balance, mobility and land access.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And Quebec is a residential arterial street which basically emphasizes mobility over access. And this is the sub area of the general development plan that was adopted in 2013. It's called the Community Park Mixed Use Center. Some area for this property.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The General Development Plan calls for mixed use land uses. But in this portion of First Avenue, it calls for attached and detached structures no more than two and a half storeys in height, with entrances that orient towards Lowry Boulevard and Pontiac Street.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'As to uniformity of district regulations. The proposed zoning with a waiver is unique in itself and therefore uniform to itself, but it also is uniform to the remainder of Buckley Annex, and we've already re zoned with similar waivers.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And as to public health safety in general welfare, the proposed rezoning furthers the public health, safety and welfare through implementation of the city's plans, including the Berkeley Annex General Development Plan. So the next set of criteria are justifying circumstances and consistency with neighborhood context and zoned district purpose and intent.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The Code states that a rezoning may be justified when the land or its surrounding environs is changing or has changed to a degree that it's in the public interest to encourage the redevelopment of the area or to recognize the changed character of the area.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So the changed or changing character of the area is, of course, the announcement of the Air Force leaving Berkeley Annex in 2005 and the subsequent sale of the property to Lowry Redevelopment Authority for Redevelopment. The current plan blueprint Denver.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The Buckley Annex General Development Plan provide policy support for a substantial public interest in encouraging the redevelopment of the area to meet our citywide area of change planning goals. As well as meeting the planning goals for Buckley Annex.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So the neighborhood context is characterized by multi-unit. Residential land uses irregular pattern of grid blocks, sidewalks, presence of alleys, consistent orientation to the street. The zoned district purpose and intent promotes higher density residential neighborhoods, reinforcing development patterns that in existing neighborhoods will creating the same sort of pattern in our new neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And the H3 specific intent is allows for urban house and rural house building forums no taller than three stories. Staff believes this rezoning does is consistent with the context in that it is multi-unit residential located along a collector street with orientation to that street.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It is furthering the grid pattern of the existing surrounding neighborhoods will take access from alleys and will have that multi-unit rowhouse use that our general development plan calls for. So with that, staff believes that all of the review criteria have been met and staff does recommend approval of this application.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. Lucero. We have four speakers lined up and I will call off for Bob Golic, Monty for Brian Word and Kevin Yoshida. So, Mr. Golic, you can go ahead and begin your remarks.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. President, and members of council. My name is Bob Golic and my address is 609 South Gaylord Street in Denver. Here this evening on behalf of the Lourey Economic Redevelopment Authority for Council Bill 841 series of 2014.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The Boulevard one property that you're looking at this evening, it seems like a very small portion of Lowry, but it is a very significant portion. It's one of the last undeveloped tracts that we have. As Teresa mentioned, it is an area of change in Blueprint Denver.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And that's very important because there have been significant changes to in particular that have occurred on the Boulevard One property over the past few years. The first is that the United States Air Force turned control of this property over to the LRA in May of 2012.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And the second is that the LRA immediately started planning efforts on this and sought approval of a general development plan, which was obtained in 2013 with a vote of the Denver Planning Board. And that general development plan established subseries throughout all of the Boulevard One property.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The sub area that we're discussing this evening is called the Community Park. Mixed use debris and that's sub is about 25 acres. The subject property you're looking at this evening is just one parcel in that sub area and it's about two and a half acres that subtree that two and a half acres per the GDP is limited'",
        "'speaker_6': 'to two and a half storeys. And since we're applying for the grade three zoning, that's the that's the catalyst for the waiver and here of limiting that height down to two and a half storeys. It's a good zoned district for this because it only allows single family, residential allows both detached and attached, which is exactly what the'",
        "'speaker_6': 'general development plan has recommended and is approved. This grade three will provide a transition from the existing residential neighborhood outside of Boulevard one that's to the north, the first Avenue coming in to the more development area of the Boulevard One along Quebec Street and throughout the center of the Boulevard One property.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The proposed R three, as I mentioned, is the appropriate district because of the allowed uses and is compliant with the GDP. This MAP amendment will bring the zoning in the conformance with that approved general development plan. We're providing or proposing nothing outside the parameters of that approved GDP.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We have support of the Denver Planning Board and we have the support of community planning and development. And I urge you to do the same and will answer any questions you might have. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. Garlic Monte Force. Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Good evening. I'm Marty Force. I'm the executive director for the Lowry Redevelopment Authority. Address is 7290 East First Avenue, Denver 802300. The application, my supplemental letter that's attached to the staff report and Teresa staff report I think together are quite throw in describing the conditions and the rationale for our rezoning tonight.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I'm going to focus my comments on the context in which you're reviewing this application tonight. Most of the 866 acres of Lowry Air Force Base closed in 1994. And today, Lowry is a thriving mixed use area now with more than 25 to 25000 people that live, work and recreate and go to school at Lowry.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Tonight's Grade three application applies to only two acres of the 70 acre boulevard, one site, which in turn is the last phase of the 866 acres of Lowry Word on planning. Like the rest of Lowry, the 70 acre boulevard, one neighborhood has been thoughtfully designed with significant public input, starting in 2006 and over 60 meetings.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's documented in our application. The resultant final plan balances many diverse interests. It is consistent with the Denver Comprehensive Plan and Blueprint Denver. It meets market demand for urban living and it accommodates growth and provides new amenities for the surrounding area.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The community input. Over the last seven years and those many meetings that we've had had some critical modifications for the Boulevard one boulevard, one plan. Specifically, we have fewer units than was originally called for. We reduced the units from 1200 overall on the site to 800, a medium density area similar to the Lowry Town Center area.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We lowered the height of the buildings. We have a maximum height of five stories we're calling for, but we have no higher than three stories most of the time. More parking, parking ratios, as you heard, we waive originally had in the application.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We took that out. We're going to deal with that through design guidelines on the site and traffic the projected traffic on the site is the same as when the site was occupied by the Department of Defense. That was 9500 vehicle trips per day.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We did a transportation study as part of the GDP that demonstrates that the adjacent street system can accommodate the proposed development and was approved by the City Transportation Department during that process regarding waivers, in some cases, in order to replicate the building forms and the patterns elsewhere in Lowry and Boulevard one, we requested waivers with the zoning'",
        "'speaker_6': 'to provide that consistency, as is the case with tonight's application. Today, we have demolished a 600,000 square foot building. We've recycled 40 to 42000 tons of old roads, parking lots and runways. The Phase one infrastructure and street work is currently underway for the previously zoned areas.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So this, of course.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I apologize. Your 3 minutes is up.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Sorry. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Brian. Brian were.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'd finished for Imani, but I don't know what you're going to say. Good evening. My name is Brian Wert. I reside at 250 Eudora St Denver and I'm a member of the LRA community or as I were called, Community Advisory Committee CAC and have been for 20 years.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I stated this at the last lower Larry's zoning hearing, but want to reiterate that the public process related to Boulevard one, also known as Buckley Annex, has been the most intense of the public processes all through the redevelopment of the Lowry Air Force Base.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The Boulevard one plan is, as Marty mentioned, and the GDP that resulted were modified significantly by the input that we received through the public process in her absence this evening. I want to mention that Councilwoman Sussman has followed this process every step of the way, attending many of the meetings hosted by LRA, as well as our CAC'",
        "'speaker_7': 'meetings. And Councilwoman Johnson did the same before her so that the Council representative from District Five has been involved with or followed the process all along and on the basis of the very public process and the GDP, which is the basis for this application, I recommend your approval.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. Ward. Kevin Yoshida. My name is Kevin Yoshida.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'My address is 8025.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'West Colfax.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Avenue in Lakewood.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm an architect and.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Consultant to the Lowry Redevelopment Authority and available to answer any questions.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. That concludes our speakers is now time for questions. Do we have any questions from members of Council? Councilman Brooks.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I want to give Mr. Force a chance to finish his comments. Thank you. Actually, I was almost finished. I was just going to urge your approval of the application tonight so that we can continue what we started here with the development of this important infill site and and add to the great legacy of'",
        "'speaker_6': 'city neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Councilman Brooks. Any other questions from members of council? Scene nine public hearing aid for one is now closed. Time for comments, Councilwoman Canete.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. President. As one of the At-Large council members who helps to represent this district, I I've done absolutely no work on this rezoning. But what I can say is that I have continued to receive and respond to communications that come from residents of Lowrey and the surrounding neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And it's very evident that over time, the process that you've created has worked through stage by stage and the flow of communication lessened. And now you're here with, you know, supportive comments. And I believe that that's a testament to the work.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I, I know that Councilwoman Sussman would would wish that she could be here. And I just as a council person who has watched how hard she's worked and also how seriously she's taken the feedback from the residents of Lowry that their concerns that they raised with you throughout the process about density and height had to do'",
        "'speaker_0': 'with the concerns about the transportation system being able to keep up with the population. And she has you know, I think we all know how closely she has taken that to heart and has really been a leader in thinking about how we can transform transportation systems in existing neighborhoods, bring increased transit to neighborhoods that are not core'",
        "'speaker_0': 'city neighborhoods. And so it just wouldn't feel right to to vote on this and this rezoning tonight without acknowledging her leadership and her work. So wanted to do that very briefly before I urge all of our colleagues to support this rezoning.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Canady, are there any other comments from members of council? All right. So, you know, Mr. Secretary, roll call.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Brooks. Hi. Brown I thought I can h i layman. Lopez. Hi. Montero. I never i. Mr. President. All right, Mr. Secretary, please close the voting and announce the results. Ten 90909 821 have been placed on final consideration and does pass.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'One pre adjournment announcement on Monday, December 15, 2014. Council will hold a required public hearing on Council Bill 972 changing the zoning classification for 6200 leet stale dry. Any protest against Council Bill 972 must be filed to the Council offices no later than noon on Monday, December 8th, 2014.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Seeing no other business before this body, this meeting is adjourned.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Denver eight TV.'"
