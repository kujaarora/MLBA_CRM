        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Council President This is a little bill, but it has a very big story behind it. And it's historic because it is actually creating the first dedicated revenue stream or the fund to receive a dedicated revenue stream for transportation and mobility in our city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, in the in the day, we thought that transportation funding came from the federal government, maybe from the state. But increasingly, as we know, unfortunately, many of these obligations have been eroded at the federal and state level and they have left it to us at the local level to meet the needs.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we also now understand we need more than just roads. Right. We heard a lot of testimony tonight about the need for multi-modal safety infrastructure that supports those who roll, those who walk, as well as those who drive.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so we are doing something tonight that was the product of a lot of collaboration. In particular, my colleagues, Councilwoman Black and Councilman Clark, were in long conversations with the administration trying to be collaborative partners and thinking about how we could be transformational in mobility.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So this fund will gather an estimated $9 million or so in its first year. That's not quite transformational at the at the outset, but we have now a a first, which is saying that a stream of funding coming into the city will be dedicated on its way out for mobility and safety.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so that's why it's important. And it's then upon all of us, again, to continue to collaborate, to make sure that we grow that fund. So the source for this fund is parking revenue, and it's not all the parking revenue in the city, it's just the increment.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's the new amount that we're adding. We need to maintain the general funding. We need to maintain all the things that the city does every day. But the increment will be dedicated to this and we need to keep thinking about what are other ways we can grow our mobility investment to be able to make a dent in'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the safety and the efficiency of our city. So I again, just want to thank the administration in particular. We went through several leaders of Dottie during the time that's the Department of Transportation Infrastructure with you, several directors at the time that the conversation started.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Till today, we have the support of the Budget Management Office figuring this out and moving a little bit from a a long held position that that they had to evolve and understand the benefits to the city of taking this step.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And, you know, all of the frontline staff who helped to estimate figure it out. And I think, you know, overall, while I called out several of my colleagues who were kind of in the in the discussions with the administration, I think overall, this body in year after year has prioritized mobility spending in our budget agendas.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think that overall council support helped to make this winnable by knowing how important it was to this body. So it's a it's a little step but a big day and I'm pretty excited about it. So, you know, I we're already in the consent agenda.'",

We all deserve the freedom to get from A to B safely, no matter how we choose to get there. And that's a value statement that I've said many times as a candidate and as an elected official.'",

I've mentioned to Dori many times, so this isn't a surprise for them. But another thing that we could consider is redesigning our transportation budget for the mode of transportation and we want people to take as'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Council. I. Can you hear me? Okay?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. So thank you. So, hi, my name's Chester from District nine. And I just I'm curious about the, the budget in the board of directors and how the process for, for the so called Reno art district, how it works because in the 23 River North Neighborhood Plan, it mentions, you know, a name change to the area to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'improve its attract ability for investors. It mentions you know there's a huge emphasis on on the art and not as much of a preservation on the local culture of the area. And I'm just curious about, you know, why an area that was historically black and Latino and historically, you know, neglected and not invested, you know, magically becomes'",
        "'speaker_3': 'becomes rhino and and has a name change. And I mean, the 23 River North Plan is pretty much a guide to gentrification in the city. And so I would just I'm just curious if there are indigenous people at the table and who's at the table and what their board of directors looks like?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Because. Because. You know, there, it just feels like a lot of a little bit of an erasure. You know, the whole process of of Reno art district feels very much like an erasure of culture and of history and and of people because, you know, there's been a lot of displacement that's happened in that area.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And it doesn't feel like everyone's been at the table or had an opportunity to remain in that area. It feels like the city of Denver is very much made it comfortable for wealthy white people to move in at the expense of black, brown and indigenous people.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And that's a real shame. It's a real shame. And and I just wonder how the River North, how the rhino art district feels about that and what they're doing to to correct that harm a in a restorative and transformative way for the community.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Our next speaker online is David Hagan.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Hi. Good evening, counsel. I'm also a District nine, and I'd just like to, uh, to kind of just stick with the same stuff that tested said. Um, it seems to me that I'm curious to how much of that budget is.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Going to go towards preservation of the people that have lived in that area, the preservation of the people. Five points in G as in what are we doing to keep them there and not just move them on and bring more, more gentrification in that area?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'What are we doing for affordable housing in that area? Is any of that money set up for affordable housing or. Who? Who does the market work for? What are we doing? For the people. What are we doing to keep the people there?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I mean, it wasn't that long ago that Joes was was tried. They tried to push him out because of the unhoused folks buying forties at his liquor store or whatever. And he recently sold, I believe, but what's left of the original people.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Do we care about them or are we going to move them over to another neighborhood until we decide to gentrify that neighborhood and build it arena or some other obstruction? It's just I just want to I just want to really highlight on the gentrification and make sure that we're not we're not forgetting about that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We've got to be doing something about that. Gentrification is colonization, and we should be better than that by this point in time. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Madam President. Let me put my hand down. So my question is for Michael Kerrigan. Michael.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Can you tell me.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'How far off of Brighton the boundaries extend? I'm just curious if this includes the Salvation Army site, which is now owned by the city of Denver.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. Essentially, it it goes from a railroad track to railroad tracks. I'm not sure where the Salvation Army building is. If it's if it's immediate, the river at.'",
        "'speaker_6': '29th Avenue.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That would be included within the district boundaries.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It abuts the river. I believe 29th is the cross street. So it's. It's on the east side of the river, not the west side.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Even the railroad tracks are on the west side of the river. So that would be that would be included in the district.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. So what how does that then apply when the city owns property? So I know we used to have the. But we'll have the park down there now. Where the police. What was the the place where they would auction bikes and vehicles off that were picked up and never claimed.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But in this case, we we own that building now. So how is that handled differently from any of the other properties?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So the the city truly owns it. The assessed value of that property would be zero. So that property would not be paying any of the four mills or the or the lineal foot charge into the district.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Thank you for that. That's that's all I had for questions. Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. Thank you, Councilmember Ortega. Councilmember Hines.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Council President. I guess this is either either of you could answer this. I'm sure this isn't in my district. And so I'm not as familiar with the demographics of the people who live in this area. But historically, was this.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It's my understanding that it was a railyard and a bunch of warehouses. Did people live here historically or was this main mainly just a storage area until it became, um, you know, until into housing started to get built in this area.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Do you want to introduce yourself for us?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, the executive director for the Rhino Art District in the sixties, it was really mostly gentrified and turned into more of an.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Industrial hub.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Back then. There are still a few houses left, including mine, where I live. So that's kind of the makeup of the district. Does that answer your question?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So you you mention in the sixties it was gentrified, so people used to live there and then they got they left for warehouses.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, well, it's kind of always this workaday neighborhood, I think generally. But then it was, you know, they started building more warehouses for for industry. And, you know, there's always been an industrial corridor, primarily. But some of that happened in the sixties, too.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Councilperson.'",

Now in our emergency room and urgent care centers, our hospital, our ambulatory care centers, and in outpatient behavioral health visits due to the well-documented impact of the pandemic on mental health.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We did this while maintaining high standards of clinical care meeting or exceeding performance goals across a range of services. We also maintain our reputation as a leading trauma center and currently are caring for record numbers of trauma patients.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you, Counselor, for allowing me to speak tonight. This is going to be one hell of a sandwich. Back in September. A friend of ours that we've been advocating for experiencing homelessness was left in her bed for two weeks after being struck by a car.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'And we were also assured that she would be released to some sort of housing that would be of assistance to her because she was not going to be able to take care of herself. What the Denver health do they release her to the 48th Street shelter.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It took them half a day to get her there. They not they kind of knocked her over. She was laying on the sidewalk and then they made her stand up on a leg that she almost recently had amputated.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'This is what experience she had. Mine wasn't that bad, but I was definitely left alone there. It wasn't the greatest experience, but I'd like to focus on her experience. And then I'd also like to think in the jails.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Why is it that we take Medicaid away as soon as you get to jail? Then why is it that we're making the the inmates pay for everything out of their own pockets without having any money because they're in jail?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So it makes it really difficult to have any money. And getting services while in jail has been very difficult for the people that I've spoken to. It's been almost non-existent, to be quite honest. Meds, medication is not been provided for people that we've spoken with.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Mental health. That's just a joke. I mean, that might as well not even talk about that because it's not it's completely non-existent. So I hope that in this budget that's going on. We have some money for these things and we're going to start paying attention to and advocating and making sure that these things happen and that the'",
        "'speaker_9': 'people that are marginalized in our community because this is not acceptable, it's disgusting. And then also, I just wanted to say before I get off here, Hines, that Walnut, Larimer, Lawrence are all in the right now. And then that stuff spreads over and then gentrification happens, money goes up.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So it's not just.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Asking that you stay on the tour.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you so much. Have a good time.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'In a press conference and prayer meeting that was held in front of Denver Health a few months ago, back in the summer, I had an opportunity to hear from several Denver health workers and how they were being treated and the evident discriminatory practices and lack of equity that comes from Denver Health.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Even with the.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'And and it was because of the color of their skin that was evident.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Once the investigation was done and there was a comparison in the.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Outcome of those particular cases and other cases.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Good afternoon and thank you for the opportunity to address you today. Members of the Council. My name is Juliana Thomas and I am a proud retired union member and I am very active in our community. Presently, I am a volunteer at the Redeeming Love Fellowship Church.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I helped to run a food bank there, along with the volunteer at Sidney Elementary School as a substitute teacher. Social emotional. So my thoughts tonight are the same as present as the previous speaker about the injustice that has been taking place at the U.S. health.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Most humanitarian efforts, I would like to say, such as hospitals, daycares and orphanages where initiative by Christians. My faith in God tells me that there must be a difference in the world in how we treat one another. We are taught to love our neighbors and ourselves is when we as Christians use our influence to try to correct'",
        "'speaker_6': 'the moral and ethical issues that go on. This is where we are meet with the contention, which I'm glad to be to be a part of. When a group in society is oppressed or is suffering and is constantly denied the privileges and rights of the institution that the majority enjoys.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It is called social injustice. Therefore, it is unfair and will ultimately lead to contention, discourse and uprising such as what we are seeing in our society today. Injustice is sin and it should not be tolerated. There should be no respect to persons.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There should be no differences. And in how we treat one another and how we do our jobs and how we go about serving our community. One thing that I stand by, God is not mocked whatsoever a man. So that's what he's going to reap.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Now, I was also a part of the community praying for racial justice at the Denver Health. We prayed that day for Denver health leaders to do a couple of things. Three things in particular that I remember. First, that Denver health leaders would have the courage to honestly face institutional racial injustice.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Second, that Denver health leaders have the humility to accept community responsibility. Third, that Denver health leaders have the moral strength to respect the rights of their workers. As Denver Health Council, one of our pastors who prayed that day said, We wanted to ask God to shake every house so that our elected officials use their power to guide'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Denver health on a path of demonstrating racism or dismantling excuse me, racism and protecting workers rights. I ask you all tonight, have you done all that you can do to support the workers who are courageously united to make Denver health the best place to give and receive care?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It is our responsibility to stand up for those that are treated unfairly, and I stand with those that are fighting against the injustice at Denver Health. Thank you for your time this evening.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Our next speaker is Brook Bender.'",

        "'speaker_10': 'Denver. Many emergency departments are stabilizing those patients that they can and sending them back out into the community. Our treatment on demand therapists outreach. Those patients offer support and linkage to treatment. What we've seen so far is an increase in patients entering treatment through this program every year, including during COVID.'",

They were super kind and genuinely there to help me. No judgment. Our hopes for next steps for the treatment and demand program is to expand beyond the three treatment providers we have'",
        "'speaker_10': '. We're only reaching a small portion of the patient population within the hospital that have substance use disorders due to a limited capacity of the team.

As you know, Denver International Airport is very busy. It's the third busiest airport in the nation, the eighth in the world.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'They see about 69 million passengers every year. Just in 2021, Denver paramedics have run over 6000 calls and transported almost 2200 patients from the airport alone. You know, this is an important operation for us, the airport being.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Kind of a vulnerable population out the location wise from where any medical help could get there. So those 60 over 6000 patients would be calls that would have to come from our downtown 911 system. So having our paramedics there is is vital to serving that population.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'law enforcement. We we should all agree that hospitals should be patient sanctuaries, which balance the rights of vulnerable patients with the need for public safety. We know from our work at the Colorado Freedom Fund that Denver Health at times functions as a really active, aggressive, willing participant in this patient prisoner pipeline.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I mean, this in the most direct, direct way, counselors at the Colorado Freedom Fund, we regularly pay bond several times a month for people disproportionately black and brown women who are accused of assault, where the assault at issue is flinching, panicking, spitting or otherwise being less than one's best self when in the custody of a Denver health'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Just one solution is safe staffing so that workers have the support they need to provide the best care while also actually interrupting racism. Another solution would be providing real anti-racism training for workers building systems which support them in coming forward when they experience or witness racism together with his patients, the community and workers.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Denver Health really can disrupt this patient, prisoner, pipeline executives and top leaders. They just can't do this alone.

        "'speaker_3': 'They have to wait. They have to take turns. Legibility can be an issue with the paper. Record storage is an issue for the paper record.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'We often have to start all over with our patients that are very well known to us. And until the chart does arrive, at times, finding information can be challenging in a paper record.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There is nobody outside of the jail that can review the paper record, such as outside Denver Health Doctors. There's really no ability for data collection. It can be challenging to determine.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Madam Chair and City Council Members, thank you for the opportunity to speak today and also thank you to all the other speakers who brought forth so many important points. My name is Sarah Rowan and I'm an infectious disease doctor at Denver Health.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I live in Denver and I'm fortunate to live one block from the Park Hill State outdoor space. I'll be speaking about our four public health clinics, each of which serves a vital role in the Denver metro. I personally see patients in two of those clinics, the sexual health clinic and the infectious disease clinic.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The Sexual Health Clinic is the largest provider of free and low cost sexual health services in the Rocky Mountain region. We offer those services to about 15,000 patients per year. In addition to testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections, we also provide access to contraception and comprehensive HIV prevention services, including the HIV prevention pill.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Also, if patients test positive for HIV anywhere in the city, we've worked hard to make sure we can offer immediate HIV treatment at no charge. Our outreach arm, which I supervised, provides free HIV, Hep C and STI testing at community sites throughout the metro.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'When the pandemic hit, our team leveraged our experience, our medical expertize, and our community partnerships to be the first agency to provide free community based COVID testing in conjunction with numerous nonprofits and shelters. Additionally, we provided technical assistance to other agencies and testing infrastructure as testing infrastructure was developed in the city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We worked closely with homeless service providers in our community and we spent a great deal of time serving those who are houseless and unsheltered caring about the tragedy at the rescue mission. The reference to Salvation Army. These are all very familiar sites.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Our infectious disease clinic provides care for 1500 patients living with HIV. We're one of the largest insecure sites in the state. We have national leaders in HIV research and treatment. We treat hepatitis C, which is prior to COVID, was responsible for more deaths than all other reportable infections combined, and the incidence has skyrocketed in the face of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the opioid epidemic. Through our community partnerships and coalitions, we're continually innovating new ways to bring Hep C and HIV treatment to people where they are, rather than rigidly demanding that people come to us.

        "'speaker_2': 'role in the COVID vaccine response has been invaluable. The Metro Tuberculosis Clinic provides free services for the region, ensuring that tuberculosis does not spread in our community. And the patients with active and latent TB, many of whom recently arrived in the United States, receive excellent medical care.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In summary, our clinics are instrumental in treating and managing conditions of public health significance conditions that, if gone untreated, lead to high costs for our community through outbreaks, costly hospitalizations and unnecessary suffering. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. And our last speaker this evening is Rosario CdeBaca. Rosaria, we might need you to unmute. I think we're still showing that you're muted. Okay. Our producers are letting me know. It looks like you're. Not they are now.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We're not seeing anybody at the computer. So we're going to go ahead and move on here. That concludes our speakers this evening. Questions from members of Council on Council Bill 21, Dash 1219. Council members say the Barka.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. Thank you. I have a couple of questions that were sent to me from workers at the hospital. There was a an equity study that was done by the equity project. And workers are wondering why Denver Health is refusing to produce the study and share the results, specifically with workers who participated, even if not with the rest'",
        "'speaker_2': 'of the general public. I'm going to have to defer to the Denver Health Partners if we can promote Stephanie Signer.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Take your money. Hello, this is Robin with the CEO, Denver Health. I apologize for not being able to speak before we had some technical difficulties. The equity the equity study that Councilman CdeBaca asked about was conducted under attorney client privilege.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And it was done so so that the confidentiality of the employees who participated would be protected. We have shared generally the results of the equity study with our organization, and I have offered to sit down with any member of city council who would like to hear the results of that study.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Abstract. Of that study.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'As we said, the study was conducted under attorney client privilege and is not going to be released its entirety. But we're happy to sit down and share with you the same information that we shared with our with our employees that came out of that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So does that mean that there were no disparities found or what was the point of doing the study?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So the study was intended actually to, uh, to hear the voice of employees at Denver Health, and it was not just employees. We also conducted stakeholder interviews with people both inside the organization and now. And it was intended to allow people to speak frankly about the experience of being a person of color inside Denver health the findings'",
        "'speaker_10': 'and that. And we shared them with our our employees as well as with community organizations outside of Denver Health and certainly with our board of directors really fell into four buckets. One of them was that race matters. Denver Health, like all organizations made up of people, have issues dealing with systemic racism, disparities and issues that affect the'",
        "'speaker_10': 'day to day lived experience of people of color in our organization, as in our society. And our employees came forward and told us about some of those. There was also some concern that, um, as the institution dealt with issues of systemic racism, of health equity, health inequities that exist in our society and that affect our patients as'",
        "'speaker_10': 'all patients unfortunately are affected across the country, that there would be there was some concern would we take this seriously? Would we move forward to address these issues? There was there were themes around transparency and communication, making sure that we did, in fact, actually share the results of this of the work out.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And then, more importantly, give voice to people in our organization in developing the plan that we would use to address the findings. And then finally, the last finding was around our role as an anchor institution, which, as you might imagine, is extremely is supported by by our entire workforce.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The idea that Denver health can be part of the solution to both economic challenges that our our patients face, our communities face, but also issues around how to promote opportunity for people of color, especially those who historically may not have had opportunity, was something that was embraced by our employees.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But the point was also that we have many employees who have who've experienced the same the same lived experiences, the same economic challenges, the same issues that the people throughout our society have. And so we pulled all of that together and working within the organization, with our city council, with employees across the organization, with our equity steering'",
        "'speaker_10': 'group, we have developed a three year strategic plan that is Denver Health's commitment to addressing issues of systemic racism, of of the challenges that people of color face both inside our organization and their everyday lives. And we are now we've released the draft to to our CEO council, to others, to our board of directors.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And we're in the process of releasing that to the organization as a draft. And the reason we're just we're releasing it as a draft is because these issues have been widespread and historic. And we fully expect that even with the initiatives that we've identified to address some of the feedback that we've gotten, this is going to be'",
        "'speaker_10': 'a work in progress for a very long time to come. We've identified a number of things in each of the the findings around creating and engaging work, workplace, engaging, inclusive, workplace, addressing issues of inequity for patients in conducting and creating and ensuring that we have a fair and accountability system and a fair and just climate and then'",
        "'speaker_10': 'making sure that we have the infrastructure that we need to address these issues. We released the report, the the study, the three year strategic plan. And we're now in the process of actually developing very detailed work plans for each of the initiatives again.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And as I've shared with you, Councilwoman. These are longstanding issues and problems. Denver Health has never and we'll never say that we don't have many of the same issues that every other organization in our society has. What we are trying to do is understand what those issues are inside our organization, how we can address those working with'",
        "'speaker_10': 'our employees, and how we can address those issues, working with community members and patients to address the health inequities and disparities that exist. So we're moving forward with that plan. And as I said, I'm happy to sit down and go through that with you, and we'd be delighted to hear the ideas and suggestions you have for how'",
        "'speaker_10': 'to move forward on some of the things you hear from your constituents as well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The study conducted.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I'm sorry. I didn't hear your question.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'When was the study conducted?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The study was conducted in late in 2018, 2020. I believe going into 2021.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Include attrition rates disaggregated by race and ethnicity.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'No, this study does not. This was intended to give opportunity for the voice of our employees in our community to bring the issues forward.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Do we have attrition data over the last couple of years disaggregated by race and ethnicity?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We we have we have some employee data, although I will tell you, we're in the process right now of working to gather that information. The most recent information is, of course, challenging given what's going on in the labor market.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But we are we are working together that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And what is the current attrition rate?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I don't have the answer to that question right now, but we can certainly get that to you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Additionally, what efforts are being implemented or taken to secure hazard pay or premium pay for the frontline workers that took on the risks early on in the pandemic?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So Denver Health is not paying hazard pay to any of the health care workers. However, we have done a number of things that are intended to address the the workload that our staff has been experiencing over the last.'",
        "'speaker_10': '18 months. I'm just going on two years, frankly. We have introduced critical staffing, incentive pay. We have introduced and increase specialty pay for those health care workers that are particularly impacted by COVID. We have, unfortunately, like all other institutions in the entire country, we have we are experiencing labor shortages and oftentimes are asking our employees to work'",
        "'speaker_10': 'extra overtime shifts. We have voluntary overtime agreements in place with them so that if people volunteer to step forward and take on extra work, if that fits within their their particular life situation, they get paid not only their their pay plus and overtime rates, of course, if they're working overtime, but there are additional bonus payments made to'",
        "'speaker_10': 'them after they can. They conduct a certain number of shifts. We have recently announced are in the process of implementing an increase for all in compensation for our employees, raising our minimum wage to $17 or and giving 3% salary increases.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So $70 or 3%, whichever is higher and making sure that we have that available. As you know, Denver health is a safety net institution and we are using the resources that we have available to target those dollars as best as we can at the front line and the central hospital workers who have struggled throughout all of COVID'",
        "'speaker_2': '. So the employees, the frontline workers got a 3% increase in salaries. Will there be another 20% increase for the executives like there was last year?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So the 3% increase will actually be effective December 5th. So employees will seed in their, their salary, their paychecks. Uh, I think it's December 28. The increases other than just the 3% increase, um, we also could doubt that, like shared with you every year we conduct salary surveys where we look at the wages that are paid at'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Denver Health and we compare those regionally to wages paid for similar roles across across the region. Where necessary, we make market adjustments in compensation for any role that has fallen out of line with the market. Um, Denver Health organizational philosophy is we look to pay at the 50th percentile for all roles in the organization.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'When those roles have when the compensation for those roles is different than the market surveys show us, we make adjustments for those. So it will depend on what has happened in the marketplace for any given role. We will be looking at additional market adjustments in the beginning of 2022 as we get the salary of the salary survey'",
        "'speaker_10': 'information for, um, for roles here at Denver Health.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Are you seeing that any of those efforts are improving the attrition rate?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That's a really good question, Councilwoman. Um, I would say this. The answer is yes in that Denver health at the last point in time where we could collect information about vacancy rates at hospitals, nearby hospitals in the region, Denver Health was actually faring somewhat better than other institutions.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But I'm going to say that's within the context of we are all in crisis at this moment in time. So everyone is struggling with staffing. And again, it's not just Denver Metro, as I'm sure you know, it is.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Hospitals across the country are having a really difficult time right now. Institutions are somewhat less willing to share information more recently. So we have not been able to update that in the last month or so. But um, through the time period that we were able to get information while we were also in crisis, we were doing a'",
        "'speaker_10': 'little bit better than some of the other hospitals.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I know you don't have the actual attrition rate for Denver health, but it sounds like, you know, the area's typical attrition rate. Do you what is that?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It's again, it's going to vary pretty significantly by job role, I can tell you. For nursing, for example, at Denver Health, our, um, our turnover rate has, has historically been significantly lower than national rates for nursing nursing personnel.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So, you know, again, it will vary by job click, job, class and role. Denver Health generally has run a lower turnover rate than many institutions and where there are national numbers available, like in nursing. Denver Health has historically done better than the national averages.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Benedict.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We had information and we're taking note the whole ceremony to get back with you from the safety committee to give us a presentation on the study. It would be nice to see the actual attrition rates and the comparisons by job classification as well as if it's possible disaggregating by employees by rate that race and ethnicity as well'",
        "'speaker_2': '. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Council members say to Barker and thank you, Doctor Wittgenstein, for your answers. I've seen no other folks in the queue for questions. The public hearing is closed. Comments by members of Council on Council Bill 20 1-1219.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Not seen any. Give it a second. Councilmember CdeBaca, you're up first.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. I would just like to share that I have been appalled by the lack of leadership of this organization, especially when it comes to racial equity within the organization. Several times I've had conversations with leadership to really discuss what it means to create equity, and it falls on deaf ears over and over.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And while we desperately need this agreement to pass tonight, I encourage my colleagues to dig deeper with this organization. Talk to board members, continue to raise the concerns because what is happening on the inside of this organization is really disappointing, given this is our health authority.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so tonight I will be a yes, but I am extremely disappointed.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilmember CdeBaca, Council Member Sawyer.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thanks, Madam President. I have some concerns as well. I really do appreciate Denver Help's partnership with the city.
