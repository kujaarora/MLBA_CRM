        "'speaker_4': 'But I'm thinking when when Denver was horses in in dirt streets and then the automobile came about and the uproar that must have taken place then is this profound change happened to the community. And then later on when the individual homes that dotted our city became neighborhoods and two acres around a house became ten feet apart.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And the upset that that brought and so while change has happened and is going to continue to happen, it becomes ever more important to do as these families have done tonight. So I look forward to approving this and urge my colleagues to join me.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Cashman. Seeing no other comments, I will just add again, I know these are both in Councilman Cashman's district, but I feel like they are very close and personal to me. As I mentioned in the last one, I grew up a couple of blocks away from here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This house is actually on my maybe run is too generous for what I do, but my morning jog route. I see it every single day and I also see and have watched, I'll say with a little bit of horror, what has happened across the street and what will happen to every house in this community if if we'",
        "'speaker_0': 'don't have citizens who step up to do exactly this. And I so nowhere is there more of a stark reminder of what happens if we don't have citizens who are committed to preservation in our communities, then that corner where you can see what was and now will be compared to what the market will do if left unchecked'",

    "A bill for an ordinance adding a new Chapter 58, Wages.  Amends the Denver Revised Municipal Code to add a new Chapter 58, Wages, creating a citywide Denver Minimum Wage. The Committee approved filing this item at its meeting on 11-12-19.": [
        "'speaker_0': '11 eyes countable. 1120 has passed. Thank you very much. All right, Councilman Hines, will you please put counts, Bill? One, two, three, seven on the floor?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I would love to, Mr. President. I'd like to take a moment of personal privilege. And in addition to board member elect Tim Anderson, I would also like to welcome State Senator Jesse Danielson to the attendance tonight. Thank you very much for coming.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I and Mr. President, I move that council bill 19 1237 be placed upon final consideration and do pass.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman. It has been moved. And second urn and Councilman Hines, before we jump into it, you have a motion to amend?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes, Mr. President, I do. I move that council bill 19 desk, 1237, be amended in the following particulars. One on page a, page two line seven ad. Whereas, the city has a long history of embracing equal pay for equal work and finds that it is in the interest and the best interests of the city and workers that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'all persons be paid not less than the minimum wage, regardless of age or disability or ability, but that where minors are enrolled in a certified youth employment program that meets the criteria established by this ordinance, and ditto they are receiving valuable educational training and or career development benefits to justify up to a 15% reduction in the minimum'",
        "'speaker_1': 'wage paid only to youth under the age of 18 enrolling in such certified programs, and that no person other than such minors shall be exempted from the requirement that all workers be paid the minimum wage for work performed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman. That has been moved and seconded questions or comments on the amendment by members of council and Councilman Hines.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. President. The Colorado State statute granting local excuse me, local governments power to enact a city wide minimum wage. States that, quote, all adult employees shall be paid not less than the minimum wage enacted by the local government.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'End quote. This the ordinance conforms to this guidance to treat all employees the same, and it does so by defining worker broadly as any person performing work without distinguishing between or creating any exception for any class of worker.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The proposed WHEREAS Statement affirms the legislative attempt to create a uniform wage for all workers and highlights the fact that no exception for those of differing ages or abilities is provided other than the own. The one very narrow exception for an emancipated minors and a certified youth employment program.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The statement also provides the rationale for the narrow exception for an emancipated minors under the age of 18 in certified programs. I bring forth this amendment to provide additional clarity about our legislative intent for the minimum wage ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman. Councilwoman.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mr. President. As the lead sponsor of the bill, I just want to thank Councilman Hines for working so collaboratively to find a way to affirm our intent and underlying it, if you will. And I just wanted to encourage my colleagues that I'm in full support of this amendment, and we're happy to have it move forward'",

        "'speaker_5': 'We do. Mr. President, thank you for your forbearance, colleagues. I know that we had this in committee a couple of times, but because we want a complete record and we have folks from the community who may not have heard all the details, we are going to give a brief summary of the bill to make sure we all'",
        "'speaker_5': 'know what we're voting on tonight. So and also, I want to thank I'm sharing this presentation on behalf of my other lead sponsor, Mayor Hancock, and his team. And I want to thank the co-sponsors who've worked with us on this bill, in addition to Councilman Haines, Councilwoman Ortega, Councilwoman Torres, Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And she could not be here tonight, but is in strong support co-sponsor Stacey Gilmore. So see if I can work my technology here. So we under the state law that gave us the authority to consider this bill tonight has some legal requirements for outreach to the following sectors that you see here local governments, businesses of various types'",
        "'speaker_5': ', labor unions and community groups. And we did complete outreach to each of these groups. You guys got all of the numbers in committee and they are in the appendix of this presentation. But that was robust input and it was influential input.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This is a summary of some of the changes that were made to the bill based on feedback and advice that we got from the community, the businesses that engaged first and foremost. We'll talk about wage levels in a minute, but we made changes and updates to the enforcement options that will especially help the auditor help to enforce'",
        "'speaker_5': 'the bill where there are particularly vulnerable workers who may not be comfortable making a complaint. We have improved data reporting for this council to be able to monitor how enforcement is going more time to find workers if there are unclaimed wages that are found before those expire to the general fund, and also a certified employment training exception'",
        "'speaker_5': 'for minors who are getting something of value other than just doing the job. So all of that feedback helped make this a better bill. Principally you've heard this around a month ago, but we heard really strong feedback that it was important to slow this down just a bit, to allow businesses more time to plan and adjust, but'",
        "'speaker_5': 'that it was very important to workers to still begin right away because they were so far behind the cost of living in Denver. So you see here that our final proposal has wages of 1285 in year one. That's $0.95 less than the original proposal, but still impacts 50,000 workers in year one.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So still strong impact, but a little bit easier for businesses to adjust to on a short time frame. And then two steps, 1477 and 1587 to catch up with how far we are behind the cost of living in our city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But then we use the Consumer Price Index to keep up. So you see that we made significant changes to the proposal based on stakeholder feedback. You also will recall that we added a exception for use in those certified employment programs that Councilman Haynes's amendment spoke to, who may be paid not required, but maybe paid up to 15%'",
        "'speaker_5': 'less. And they in order to get that reduced wage, those employers will have to really meet standards set out by the Department of Economic Development and Opportunity. And we have Deborah Cameron here from that department tonight to answer any questions.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But first, they'll seek a certification. Second, those programs that qualify will be required to maintain a curriculum that actually identifies what it is those youth are learning with that, including job competencies, career paths that that job can lead to.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then also, they will be required to have meaningful training outside of working hours. So it's not just that you learn on the job. You have to be getting classroom training or some other training of value to justify paying the lower wage during those working hours.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then you will need to be recertified annually. We did hear significant feedback about the TIP credit throughout the process. But just a reminder, we are not legally able to make any changes to the TIP credit under state law.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So that is why there is no change in this bill for that particular tip credit. It was and remains $3.02 per hour for those who are food and beverage workers receiving tips. There is a really robust enforcement regime in this bill.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I would call it best in class, modeled after many of the cities across the country who've gone before us. And it includes both a process for the auditor to enforce on behalf of the people of Denver and recover wages and enforce.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But it also includes a private right of action for a worker who has been lost wages under this law to be able to sue directly and get redress through the courts. So it has two important pathways. This bill will have a significant impact on the people of Denver.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Even in its revised form. We will be giving a raise to 90,000 employees who live and work in Denver. Who live and work in Denver. Additional workers who commute in will benefit as well. This is an overwhelmingly adult population.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think some of us have a nostalgic sense that the minimum wage is jobs held only by youth. But the truth is that the majority, 95% of the folks in our city doing this work are adults. They're parents with kids.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They're single or they're married, they're single parents. It also disproportionately will benefit women and people of color, including African-American and Latinos. So this bill represents not just race and gender equality and advancing those goals, but income inequality overall.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We have several staff members who will be here during the question and answer portion for council members if there's anything that you need covered. So Sky Stuart is here from the mayor's office and Evan Dreier. They particularly can answer questions about the outreach process if any of those arise.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I mentioned Deborah Cameron's hear from Dito, and then Frank Romans was our lead drafter. But of course, cursing Crawford, our legislative council was involved as well. With that, Mr. President, I turn it over to our public.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. All right. We have 23 individuals to sign up. This are signed up to speak this evening. We have a one hour courtesy hearing. So I will ask I'm going to call five at a time up to this front bench.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So as soon as I call your name, you can step right up to the microphone instead of fighting through from where you're sitting. So I'll call you five at a time. And then if the speaker speakers before you have said what parts of what you were going to say, feel free to reiterate what they're saying.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But if anybody can leave a little bit of time on the clock, then we'll try and fit as many people into our hour as possible. All right. So the first five, if you could come up to this front bench right here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I hope Lewis, Laurie Tabak, Betsy Murray, Patrick Horvath and Curtis Chong. If you could come up and app Lewis, you are up first.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Allen Lewis.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Allen.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Natural Grocers here to answer questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you. All right, Laurie, talk. One might have been left over from the other one. Sorry about that. All right. Betsy Murray. Get your.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I was first. My name is Betsy Murray. I'm a former 30 year resident of Denver. In fact, Washington Park. So I appreciate the discussions this evening. I do currently live in Parker, Colorado. I'm here this evening representing the Home Care Association of Colorado.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And I want to thank Councilwoman Kennish on making those adjustments that they did on the first year to adjust to the wages situation, especially as it relates to Medicaid in the home care industry. That first year, we still haven't had mass approve the final Medicaid rate, but we're hoping to have that by January one.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So that will be enough to cover those costs. And this is the kind of night that providing services can be rather challenging for home care workers. We appreciate their service, and we're concerned about meeting the needs of clients with personal care services and homemaker services for January 2021, which is the second year.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We ask for your help in securing those Medicaid funding rates for January 2021 with the almost $2 increase in minimum wage. This funding would be approved in the 2020 Colorado legislature, which is what is of concern to meet those needs in January 2021.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And health care policy and financing. And the governor currently not asked for a adequate funding to cover the Medicaid rates for that second year. I've been working for almost 30 years in the industry, and the original rates were $7.88.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So we have come a long way, but we have more to go for sure. But that's that's the rate. That's how long this program has been around. And it's an extremely valuable program for keeping people in their homes.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Uh, in a continuum of care. This impacts approximately 4200 clients in Denver, according to health care policy and financings numbers and 57 agencies that provide Medicaid services. Again, support in raising the Medicaid rate would be appreciated.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you very much. Thank you for your time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next up, Patrick Horvath.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening, council members. My name is Patrick Horvath. I direct the Economic Opportunity Program at the Denver Foundation. The Denver Foundation in 2020 will be serving the seven country metro Denver region for 95 years. We're located in Council Member Hines Perfect ten.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We're actually moving in June to another part of his district from Cherry Creek to Capitol Hill. So pleased to be here and pleased to have supported this committee for so many years in our community grantmaking program. We focus very narrowly or very with with great energy on the most vulnerable people in our community.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The people our most marginalized people live in historically oppressed communities. And we do that through a lens of core values, to core values that are very important to the Denver Foundation. One that people excuse me, who are directly affected by an issue are the people who should be involved in designing the solutions to that issue.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And the second that everything we do must advance racial equity in our community, these guide our grantmaking and they also guide our policy advocacy when we apply these core values to our attempts to make our resources available to the community and to take action on policy issues, it's very easy to see how they come down on this'",
        "'speaker_4': 'issue. What would our community partners say about this? We've heard it at public hearings that Councilman Kanis and the mayor have held for the last several months. They've shown up in droves. They've shown up with energy and enthusiasm, and they've indicated their strong support for this bill.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And secondly, what would be the impact of this on racial equity in our community? Advancing racial equity in the Denver community, half of the Latin community workers in in Denver City and county and 40% of black workers would get a pay hike through this bill.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Centuries of systemic oppression and institutional racism have locked people of color in our communities at the very bottom of our wage economy. This would begin to saw a few to put a little bit of a dent in that lock and to begin to provide opportunities to combat some of these structural issues that have so deeply affected our'",
        "'speaker_4': 'communities of color and our partners in our in our lowest income communities. The Denver Foundation enthusiastically supports this bill, and we urge the council to vote in favor of it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next up is Curtis Chong and I'll call the next five up, Tyler Fox, Berhanu Yali, Jessy Danielson, Roble Work. Who and the honorable Terry Anderson. Go ahead. If you'll forgive me, Mr. President. Um.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm not able to see the clock up there on the wall. So if you could give me a 22nd.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Warning, we'll do my time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'My name is Curtis Chong. I am speaking representing the National Federation of the Blind of Colorado. And we support the notion.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Regardless of who sets it and regardless of whether there is one, if there is going to be a minimum wage, it must apply to everyone, including people with disabilities. Including the blind. In our federal government, there is a provision of the Fair Labor Standards Act, Section 14 C, which when I was a teenager, enabled me to earn'",
        "'speaker_1': 'a whopping $5 for 16 hours of work at a time when the minimum wage was a dollar 60. This kind of situation for people with disabilities must not occur. And we applaud the city of Denver for. Supporting the concept established by the state which says the minimum wage applies to everyone and we interpret that to mean everyone'",
        "'speaker_1': ', including the blind and other people with disabilities. If that is, in fact, what this bill is intended to do. We support it.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'That carried the bill through to allow local jurisdictions to set the minimum.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'And so, again, thank you so much for your time and consideration and your hard work.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Having the city and county of Denver move forward in such a significant historic way for the workers.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In this area means a lot to me, and I know it means a lot.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'To the 100,000 workers that you're going to help fairly.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Immediately. So I'll just conclude by saying again, it was my intent as a sponsor of the bill.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'To remove.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The barrier that the state has in place for local communities to see what's right for the workers that they represent. To give you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The power as local leaders to decide what the minimum wage should be and thus.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'What the workers should earn in order to live where they work and thrive.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next up, Rochelle Walker.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thanks for your time tonight, y'all. My name is Robe. I'll work who I use him, his pronouns. And I'm an economic justice organizer at Colorado Peoples Alliance. Thanks to Councilwoman Venetian Mayor Hancock for co-sponsoring this effort that will have over 90,000 workers here raised in our city.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'This has been a long time coming. The fight for 15 has been ongoing for six years in the state to change the narrative around wages and drive this particular demand that started with a McDonald's strike back in 2013 in North Platte.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And continuing here tonight and 2016, Copa co-chaired a successful effort to raise Colorado's minimum wage to $12 by 2020, which included a broad coalition of community and labor groups, including together Colorado, SEIU, United for New Economy, the AFL-CIO, the Policy Center, KLP, the Colorado Educators Association, 9 to 5.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We, along with our allies, understood then that 12 was a positive and achievable step, but wasn't enough for the workers in our state that came. That campaign was both about immediately improving material realities for our communities and setting us on a trajectory to fight for more.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'In 2018 and 19, Kopel led the work here Thrive Here, a coalition which includes our allies from the AFL-CIO, SEIU Together Colorado and Good Business Colorado. We worked together to start shifting the narrative around local control and wages back in 2018.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And we're successful in passing local wage option with Senator Daniel Danielson earlier this year, making us the first state in the country actually to repeal preemption over wages. After passing this legislation across the street, we are excited to learn that folks here in this building are ready to move with urgency to give workers a raise.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Again, we had a strong partnership between community and labor groups, including ourselves. Some familiar faces together Colorado, SEIU, Denver Area Labor Federation, the Working Families Party towards Justice, the Painters Union, the United Food and Commercial Workers Unite here in the Bill Policy Center.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'This coalition connected with thousands of supporters across the city on this issue and generated hundreds of emails and calls to the mayor and city council. And I think a lot of you all probably heard some of these messages.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The culmination of these efforts is what you have in front of you here tonight, an increase in the minimum wage to 1587 and enforcement mechanisms that ensure that folks are paid the wages that they are owed at its core.'",

And then he jumped in with me to work on this bill before we were even done with our post-election vacations. Thanks. And our apologies to the staff team that has supported us before their vacations were over.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But to Skye Stewart and Evan Dreier, thank you. Frank remains to my aide Chris Lowell and our legislative counsel, Kirsten Crawford. I also want to thank the work here, live here, the coalition. And I think that they described themselves best, Robel did with the nonprofit Faith Labor members for having faith that the arc of history bends toward'",
        "'speaker_5': 'justice and not giving up and to at caring for bringing the voices of those who are impacted to the front and making sure that you were in every conversation to those from the disability community tonight. Thank you for being present.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I am proud that our bill at no point had a carve out for people with disabilities and I am happy to underline that fact tonight. But everyone who does the job gets paid the same under this bill, and I'm very proud of that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I appreciate you making sure that you, too, were visible in this bill and in this conversation. So we're 20 years in the making for the history that we're making tonight. It was April of 1999 that the state legislature eliminated local control for wages just as cities across the country were starting to think about whether or not'",
        "'speaker_5': 'they could act in the face of a one size that did not fit all federal minimum wage. Here in Colorado, we had families living in poverty who were building power and trying to engage to hold local government accountable.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And because of the state law, they could not pass a bill for everybody here in Denver. But they did pass Denver's first living wage ordinance. They covered for job categories 20 years ago. But here we are. The people of Colorado took matters into their own hands.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So the state said, it's our job. And the people said, okay, do your job. And they said, Let's raise the wage in 2006. And then again, the people of Colorado came together and said, let's we raise the wage in 2016.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Now, a lot of people in metro Denver were disappointed when the state raised the wage to $12. It's going to get there on January 1st, 2020. But if you think about our vast and diverse state, you can imagine that finding the right wage for Denver and Rifle and Grand Junction and lineman.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I don't know that that's hard. I think it might be impossible. Our cities are so different. And so the legislature made history when they said, we see that. We see that our state is diverse. You need this local power.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And they gave it back. They gave it back. And we heard Senator Daniels and the other sponsors, Dominique Moreno, Jovan Melton, I'm sure I'm missing a sponsor. But to all those legislative sponsors, so our residents, they face the demands of cost of living here.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They have to pay wages here. So now they need our help here and we have the power to do that. So we can't cover the full history of wage stagnation tonight. But if we can all acknowledge that it's real and that especially for those in service sector jobs, someone used the word irony tonight in their testimony.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I think that's right on every new high tech job we create here in Denver creates five additional jobs and three of them, three of them are low wage service jobs. So in our city, like so many other cities, we cannot have economic success attracting high wage jobs without attracting these sister jobs.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And they're going to disproportionately in our in our city and others be filled by women and immigrants and refugees. Folks, we've heard from tonight Latin X and African-American residents. So while we can and we should move to work individuals and train them out of those jobs into better opportunities, there will still be someone who comes along to'",
        "'speaker_5': 'work those jobs. That's the way our economy is built. And so we have only one option. We have to transform the jobs. We have to transform the economy. It has struck me so many times during these months that we've been working on this bill, that this is so much like the climate discussion.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Our economy is hooked on cheap labor, like it is hooked on cheap oil. And we have to transform our economy off of cheap oil to save our planet. And we have to transform off of low wages to save our communities.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And that is transformation. That is not going to be easy. Now, we didn't have a lot of speakers with concerns tonight, but we have heard from them throughout this process. And I think that it's really important that we recognize that we are not.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We may have a really bold and strong audience before us tonight, but for better or for worse, we're not the first. And this is not unprecedented or untested. So what we know is that the economic research tells us that in cities that pass wages like this, there are still restaurants to eat out.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There are still people employed at about the same rate as counties or cities next to them that didn't raise the wage, that there are still firms doing business. So what I know, though, is that an economics study never changed the mind of anybody with a deeply held value.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It doesn't work in climate and it doesn't work in wages. Some people really deeply believe that higher wages will destroy businesses in spite of 20 years of studies that are peer reviewed by economists. The studies are not going to change folks values.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I also know that studies are an aggregate of an overall economy, and they do nothing to predict what will actually happen to one person's business. So it was very important to us to listen to each of the stories, particularly from our locally owned businesses that, you know, are not huge corporations, but our members who probably look'",
        "'speaker_5': 'a lot like those of us in this audience today working hard to make ends meet and meet payroll. So I'm proud of how many small businesses we have in Denver. I appreciate what they contribute. I appreciate that they wrote and visited and called, and I appreciated that we improved this proposal to make it a little easier for'",
        "'speaker_5': 'them to transform. But I do think it's important to underline that transformation is necessary. I don't believe that our businesses are any less resilient than Chicago or D.C. or Seattle or the other places that have gone before us.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I have faith that they can and will evolve and transform. But I acknowledge it may not be easy, and I thank them in advance for stepping up because our city and the families of their employees depend on us figuring out how to do this differently and better.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I said that, you know, this this process was very personal and based on deep values. And, you know, my parents worked very hard and only because they made decent wages that their unions fought for. Life wasn't easy.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But I always had a roof over my head and I always had food to eat. And it's personal for me because when I join Denver's movement for economic justice, raising wages wasn't an option. It was illegal, or the other strategies we had were so politically impossible, they might as well have been illegal.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I only started working on affordable housing because I could not figure out how to raise wages. I knew nothing about affordable housing and during that time I started to work on what I call the other side of the equation, which was lowering the cost of living.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And we've heard throughout this process about both sides of the equation. Folks want us to work on lowering the cost of living and raising incomes. And tonight, what we recognize is that we lost ground in the 15 years that I had to only work on affordable housing because I couldn't work on jobs.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Things have gotten worse, inequality has gotten worse. When we started the conversation during my start in the movement. We were talking about poverty, about families having poverty. We still have that, but now we're talking about losing entire communities that might be displaced.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We're talking about schools closing because some of our neighborhoods have lost so many families with children. Minimum wage parent, working families with children that the schools are no longer viable. So the stakes have gotten so much higher. And tonight is about catching up, right?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It is about catching up on that income side of the equation. It's about acting before it gets worse. You know, I've had folks say during this process, you know, I can't believe we're looking at wages that are like San Francisco or like Seattle or name your city, right.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Name whatever big coastal city that people love to hate on. And they say we don't need wages that high. And and they say, you know, look at the cost of living there. And I say, we don't want to wait.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we're the big coastal city. Tonight is about stepping up before it gets that bad. I don't care what the wages are in those cities. We set our wages based on two things state law. Our wages conform with state law, and they do not.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'By the way, for the record, stop at $15. The wage in 2022 is $15.87. And it will grow every year with the Consumer Price Index. It will go to $16. I can't tell you what year, but it will go there and then it will keep growing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So tonight's about acting before it gets worse, before we rise from the 28th, 20th, least equitable city in America. We don't want to get any higher on that list. This is a list where we'd prefer to not be listed at all.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The most inequitable cities in America, where 20 tonight is about getting parents a few extra hours with their kids. It's about getting them a couple of hours off work to go to the doctor and catch something early before it becomes untreatable.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It is about. Making ends meet. It's about the chance to stay in your city that you love. And it also happens to be history. And so with great gratitude to my entire colleagues and all the time you spent learning about this and being here tonight, I will be enthusiastically voting yes to raise Denver's minimum wage in 2020'",
        "'speaker_0': '. Thank you. Thank you, Councilman Canete. Next up, Councilman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. President. So that's kind of a tough act to follow, right? Councilwoman Kenney is very eloquent in just covering so many different aspects of why this is so important. And when you see all of the wealth building that is happening in our city, it has not been trickling down to benefit everyone.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And, you know, we have had many conversations among city council to look at what are those policy issues that we need to shift the needle on to make sure that there there is actual benefit to people in our communities who are struggling, who are having to leave our city because they can't afford the price of housing, whose'",
        "'speaker_6': 'jobs have not been affording them the ability to stay in our city. And I want to say a big thank you to Councilwoman Quinn, each for her leadership role in and her tenacity in in staying the course to move this needle, along with Mayor Hancock, who has has been unwavering as well in this process.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm honored to be one of the co-sponsors of this effort, because I think it's a step in the right direction. It's one of many steps. As you know, we have worked to ensure that our big contracts in the city now have a commitment to local hires, making sure we've got language in the contracts and not just local'",
        "'speaker_6': 'hires, but commitments to apprenticeships, so that we're continuing to make sure that people have access to livable wage jobs. The work that Councilwoman Kenney did with Councilman Brooks in bringing forward a dedicated revenue stream for affordable housing and work that is happening right now with DHS playing a role in accelerating a number of projects by being able'",
        "'speaker_6': 'to bond those funds, a number of which are moving forward right now. So it's not just that this is the only piece that is being looked at in terms of what we need to do as a city to raise that bar for everyone.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's it's that in combination with a number of other things that are still being talked about. As you know, our environment is also critical, and we know that changes that are happening have an impact on low income and minority communities.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And what are we doing to make sure that we're closing the gap on food deserts and access to healthy food? Those are just some of the additional things that are being talked and talked about and worked on the issue of mental health.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And as you know, the voters were very they were supportive of the the initiatives that passed last November that create additional resources to assist us in dealing with some of those issues as well. And so I just think that the the work that has transpired with input from so many of you who were champions and really for'",
        "'speaker_6': 'your advocacy in coming to the public meetings, for making phone calls to our offices, for writing letters and just being there as well to express the importance of this. And I just want to be clear that that input was not just from workers.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There were lots of businesses who came forward. And I want to thank Councilwoman Kenney for the work that was done in listening to that input, because we had some small businesses who were concerned they'd have to lay off workers.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so there were some changes that were made that reflected those concerns as well. So the bill before us tonight really is is from listening. To the input from everybody, from all of those public meetings. So again, I'm just happy to be one of the co-sponsors and look forward to putting this into action.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So thank you, Mr. President.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I also want to thank Councilwoman Kenney for her leadership on this critically important issue and for taking public input to heart in crafting this historic wage proposal. I want to thank Matt Hancock and his staff as well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'While I recognize that mandating these increases in salaries will challenge some small business owners, asking our workers to exist on less than is being proposed tonight has challenged them for far too long already. With the proposed increases, we're getting closer to the point where two people working full time at minimum wage will be able to meet the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'basic monthly financial needs of a couple with two young children. We're not there yet, but we're getting closer. Unfortunately, even with these changes, a single wage earner with a dependent child falls far, far short of meeting those needs.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I did want to say on a personal note that I know I'm privileged at this point in my life to have a job where I can pay my bills, where I can put a little bit away. But as a young man, I was a single father with two small children, and I was not in that position.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I was not earning enough money to meet my bills. And I know what that feels like to worry about paying rent, to not have enough food in the refrigerator, to not be able to send your kids to school wearing the clothes that they would prefer to wear.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I know the embarrassment that comes with that. And I know government food programs and making that drive. So. This is long overdue. And as has been said by several people, it's only a start. Finally, Mr. President, you know, I had the privilege a few weeks ago to visit Atlanta, Georgia, and spend a few hours at the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'National Center for Civil and Human Rights. And I spent about 3 hours reading documents and looking at movies about people like Dr. King and Andrew Young and Gandhi and Eleanor Roosevelt and people who made their lives of civil rights and human rights work.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And the last document that we looked at before we walked out the door, I want to read a paragraph from that. It says, After the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, many civil rights organizations shifted their focus to education, social welfare and employment issues under the leadership of Dr. Martin Luther King'",
        "'speaker_4': ', Jr. The Southern Christian Leadership Conference, SLC framed inequality as not limited to racial discrimination, but as the result of income disparity. The SCLC partnered with labor unions for fair wages and safe working conditions and formed Operation Breadbasket, a nationwide campaign to ensure fair employment practices.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The organization then launched the People's Campaign. It's the Poor People's Campaign, its most ambitious campaign for economic equality, and the second phase of the civil rights movement. I'm sorry that so many years later we have not moved further down the road to equity and equality.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But as I said before, I am pleased that we're taking this step to move closer to that goal. And thanks again to the sponsors for this hard work. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman. Councilman Hines.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I want to also thank the people who have come before me and spoken tonight. I won't rehash some of the same things that have already been spoken. I definitely want to thank Councilwoman Cage. She is still there.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'She's hidden behind the president's computer. I want to thank her for all her hard work and her months of hard work and her willingness to to support the amendment that that I brought forward tonight, basically. And I want to thank the mayor as well for for your consideration and support of making sure that the people in Denver'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Frankly, you know, it isn't the bill that if I were king, I would make it. But I also refuse to let the the perfect be the enemy of the good. I think that this is a great move in the right direction.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm proud to be a co-sponsor of the bill. I think that I think that there were people you know, if I were king and I were to make a decree, maybe I wouldn't have been perfect. And and it was good that we went through the stakeholder process.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And it's good that we went through the thought process. And we heard from a lot of different people. I would say I was a little surprised that I mean, I guess not everyone listens to me and every opportunity when I'm on television.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I said a couple of things personally in committee that I want to repeat just. For the record, I, I grew up an only child of a single mom, and my mom never made more than $26,000 a year.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'She currently makes $8.10 an hour. She doesn't live in Denver. Denver's perfect ten. I tried to get her to move here to Colorado. She's. She's stubborn. I got my stubbornness from someone. It's my mom. And. When I was when I was 18, I asked my mom, why do we move around so much?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's because we got evicted because we couldn't afford to pay rent. And my mom sheltered me from that. And she what she did for me, what I could not do for myself. She wanted a better life for me than she could have for herself.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I was so excited that she could come up for inauguration. She lives in rural Texas. It's hard for her to get out of town and she's got a bunch of dogs. She's in Tard Rescue, but different story.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And but she came up here for inauguration. And inauguration was in the morning of July 15th. And then between inauguration and my first Denver city council meeting, which was right here the evening of the same day, she lost her front tooth.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And she refused to come here tonight on the 15th. She had already lost the rest of her teeth in her mouth and could not she she was too proud to come to council because she didn't want to embarrass me.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But the reason she couldn't. She lost her front tooth is because she couldn't afford dental care. She hadn't been to the dentist in decades. She made that sacrifice for me, for her own child. And I can only imagine all the single moms here in Denver today and all the people here in the city today, the 100,000 people'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that this bill will affect just the people who live and work in Denver Light. If I get, I don't know, the 100,000 people, but if you are a 10th, the person that my mom is and I'm sure that you are.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I am so proud to help you get closer to being able to survive in this city. And the last thing I'd say is Denver's leaving the leading the way in Colorado. And we're I'm proud that we're part of the National Movement for Disability Rights.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I want to say this as someone with a disability, we're the first in Colorado to do so, and we're the first city nationwide to eliminate sub minimum wage for people with disabilities on the first try. As soon as we were able to do that, we with as Councilwoman Kennicott said, it was always part of the plan.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The amendment makes it explicit and clear that that's what we're doing. Denver is once again leading the way. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Guzman. Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I. I want to, first of all, thank Councilwoman Cain each for allowing me to come on Isaac as a co-sponsor of this. When I looked at the a few months ago when the proposal was made, it had been long been in my mind that even before the legislature acted to allow us to do'",
        "'speaker_4': 'this, that the the way to address the high cost of living in this city and the income inequality was too heavily weighted on us up here. The last four years that I've been here, at least we have spent.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Tens of millions. I didn't actually tabulate at all. Maybe it's in the hundreds of millions. On subsidizing the social costs of having low wage jobs in the city. And it was it was all well, not all, but primarily on the public sector.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And it came home to me in a few votes that occurred on housing, on subsidizing some housing programs that I remember saying on one of them and one which I voted no, that I thought it was ridiculous for the city to set up a fund into which employers contributed money to subsidize rents for lower income workers that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'they employed, that we would subsidize the rents that landlords were demanding for vacant apartments. I said, that's wrong on two ends. If the vacant if the apartments are vacant, the landlords should gradually lower the rent until they fill them.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And instead of the companies contributing to our fund so that we can subsidize rents that are too high. They should put that in your paycheck so that you then can go out and get it on your own. I want to acknowledge something that I think has been referenced by a councilwoman, Kenny, and I remember Councilman Cashman as'",
        "'speaker_4': 'well, and again in a letter that I got from a constituent in my district who operates a small business. This is going to be difficult for small business. And I think we need to acknowledge that it's going to be a difficult thing for small business.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Not every employer in this city is, you know, name your your big multinational corporation. In fact, the base of employment in this city is small business, and this is going to be hard for them. But you know what?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The costs of subsidizing the social costs, the price of subsidizing the social costs that we've been doing up here for at least in my first term, they've been pretty difficult also. My homeowners and my property owners, all property owners in Denver pay a half mil on your property tax to subsidize the cost of continuing to pay you'",
        "'speaker_4': 'below $15 an hour. And I think that's it's time today to bring everybody into the solution. And this bill, I think, goes toward doing it. And with that, I'm very happy to co-sponsor this and to support it. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman. Councilwoman Torres.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Thanks to Senator Danielson and those at the state who helped us get here tonight, but also to because I'm seeing so many friends in the audience from labor. Pedro choreographs this house. Then he says companeros they SEIU are you Pat Lazaro her daughters who have fought for this as long as.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They have as well.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So thank you all. I want to commend the work of councilwoman can each the mayor's team on both a strong bill and a comprehensive process. We can't be blind to the income struggles of our residents, and we have to recognize the overwhelming pressures and take deliberate steps to assist those who currently make less than $15 an hour'",
        "'speaker_5': 'are more likely to be people of color, women, and those without a college degree. And if we approve this tonight, 50% of Latinos, 38% of African-Americans working in Denver will get a raise. We're struggling to find enough housing for our residents.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We cannot meet our needs solely through housing funds, through fractional inclusion of 80% Army units, Section eight vouchers, public housing, senior housing. These are all limited. There are waitlists. Our residents have to earn more across the board. A perpetual conversation exists in Denver.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I've been in the city for 19 years. It's been there that long and probably decades longer than that about resident representation in city meetings and civic conversations and relates directly to this conversation. Residents in District three have multiple jobs to live and survive in this city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They are working their second or third job when the R.A. meets. They're working when the neighborhood group takes votes of approval or opposition. They are working when we have town halls. They are working all the time. And we have a responsibility to support our families and support community wealth building efforts.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This includes increasing the minimum wage, but it will also include wage theft protection and increasing asset ownership. I thank all of our speakers here tonight, all of the community and those who wrote me in either support or concern.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I believe that this bill represents all of those narratives and those needs, and I look forward to voting in favor of it tonight.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you, Councilman. Councilman Sawyer.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I also want to thank Councilwoman Kenny tonight for her leadership on this issue and her willingness to be open to community feedback. I think Councilwoman Ortega said it best earlier. This was truly a collaborative process.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I know that even though there weren't they weren't very many. There weren't many or any, I think small business owners. I'm here to speak out against it tonight. There are a lot who are concerned about this proposal, and they have spoken out to a lot of us in writing via email previously, and they're concerned about their businesses'",
        "'speaker_5': '. And and that's an important part of the conversation. These are big and tough conversations to have, but we have an opportunity tonight to do something bold for our most vulnerable communities, to combat displacement and gentrification in a real and meaningful way in the city of Denver.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In most cities in America, there are strategies that we can employ to help support our workers better, when we might have more flexibility with housing options and other costs of living. But Colorado's kind of a unique state, and our state level legal structure leaves us with sort of few ways as a municipality that we can actually take'",
        "'speaker_5': 'action to support our workers. So I also want to thank our state legislators who are here tonight, some of them, and who are working to make those changes on a state level. And I want to urge all of you to help support them in their fight to make some of these changes on the state level as well'",
        "'speaker_5': ', because that's where many of these things need to happen. We as a municipality are doing what we can, but there is actually very little that we can do. There are a lot of state level guardrails that we need your help in advocating with.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So is this bill a perfect solution? No. For some of you, it's too much too soon. For some of you, it's not enough. It's not a perfect bill. Right. But it is a reasonable, actionable thing that we can do.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We can do something to make the lives of the people in city of the city and county of Denver better. I've said this in this chamber before.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's a motto I live by.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I think it fits this bill. And this evening, perfectly imperfect action is always better than perfect inaction. So tonight, I'm thrilled to act, to do something to help our most vulnerable community members. I'm so excited to be supporting this, and I'm proud.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So thank you, Mr. President.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'I'm raising my kids in Denver. So I'm raising a third generation. And I just want you to know that this will impact the next seven generations. So it's an honor to be supporting something that has such great impact that I won't be able to see, but hopefully my kids and my grandkids will.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And thank you for the mayor to the mayor to take such a bold stance and to support such an initiative. I know he's from Denver. He's a Denver native, and I know he cares deeply about the minimum wage and these issues.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So growing up and a small business in La Casita that my family started in 1975, I understand what minimum wage is. I grew up with the letters. I grew up with generations of family letters. And I understand when employees are paid well, they enjoy a better mental state.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And then physical state where employees are healthy, they improve, their.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Performance is improved.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'They are happier and they're motivated to work on behalf of you. When business owners have happy employees, the company runs better. And this is why many companies, even in industries where low wages have historically been the norm, will voluntarily pay minimum wage to their workers.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Motivated workers may also be more likely to pursue a career advancement in their current workplace rather than departing. And they also enables employers to train and promote workers from within. So for me, as a small business owner in Denver, as my family has been a small business owner since 1975, the conversation of the impact of this minimum'",

Their kids might be able to stay at North High School and stay at Skinner and stay in Bryant Webster because Northwest Denver historically was a low working class, hard working class neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And it has changed and that has been very challenging for me to see personally. And so this is maybe one step in the right direction. And I keep hearing my colleagues talk about a perfect bill. There's no perfect bill.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This is democracy, and this is democracy at your finest. Look how many people are here in these pews on a cold, snowy night. That's democracy. And democracy is not perfect. But I will tell you that you have leaders up here who are hearing the voice of the people.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So on that note, I'll just end with a quote. I love Dr. Martin Luther King. He gives me inspiration. And as a leader, sometimes it's hard to find inspiration when you hear complaints all day. So you have to go to some sources, right?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You have to continuously find inspiration in this job to keep you going. So Dr. Martin Luther King said all labor has worth it is a crime for people to live in this rich nation and receive starvation wages. It is a crime to have people working on a full time basis and a full time job getting part time'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Year. An individual working full time would still only make $26,728 a year before taxes. That's less than half of the army. Unfortunately, even with this increase and the going rate for rent at at least 1500 dollars a month, a minimum.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'And it is a conditional cost of living.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Index.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Because it doesn't quantify all of the factors that affect our cost of living. A minimum wage.'",

I realize the contextual limitations of this increase and will support this symbolic incremental increase with the hopes that we recognize and brace ourselves for continued and a more robust movement to demand that our economy work for all of us.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We must face the reality that we will never catch up at this rate. Our economy isn't just hooked on cheap labor. We were built on free slave labor. While we fight in this paradigm for survival. We can never forget that this economy was built to chew up and spit out our wage workers.'",
