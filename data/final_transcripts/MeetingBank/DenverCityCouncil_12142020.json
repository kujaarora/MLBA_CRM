    "A proclamation of support for studying Community Choice Energy (CCE) as an option for local governments in the State of Colorado.": [
        "'speaker_0': 'And so seeing no other council announcements, we have no presentations tonight, we have no communications. We have two proclamations being read this evening. Councilmember Hines, would you please read Proclamation 1453 for us?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Madam President. I will. So the proclamation is titled Proclamation in support for studying Community Choice Energy as an option for local governments in the state of Colorado. Whereas, 14 cities and counties in Colorado, known as the ready for 100 communities, have committed to obtaining 100% renewable energy by 2025 to 2035 and 34 communities known as'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Colorado Communities for Climate Action have organized to advocate for stronger climate policy. And. WHEREAS, these communities, which represent when more than 1 million Coloradans cannot reach their ambitious energy and climate goals within their desired time frames unless they require greater choice and control over the energy sources comprising their wholesale electricity supply.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And. WHEREAS, the Governor's Policy Initiative, entitled Road Back to 100% Renewable Energy by 2040 and Bold Climate Action, explicitly supports local commitments to 100% renewable energy. And. WHEREAS, the ability of the community to achieve ambitious energy goals is currently limited by the energy supply mix and the decarbonization decarbonization timeline of the electric utility that serves that community'",
        "'speaker_1': '. And having the option to procure electricity from alternative wholesale suppliers may enable communities to achieve their climate or excuse me, achieve their energy goals substantially faster and at lower cost. And. Whereas, there exists a local energy model called Community Choice Energy, also known as Community Choice Aggregation, which is a proven approach to expanding local control over energy'",
        "'speaker_1': 'sources and lowering electricity rates by introducing competition and choice into the wholesale electricity sector. And. WHEREAS, under CCU, communities may choose alternative wholesale electricity suppliers, while the electricity continues to be delivered by the incumbent utility, which continues to own and operate its transmission and distribution system and manage customer service and billing, thereby allowing communities to choose a'",
        "'speaker_1': 'competitive power supplier without affecting non procurement related utility operations. And. Whereas, in the wholesale opt out model of CCE, individual customers retain the choice to opt out of their community CCE offerings and receive electricity supplied by the utility under its traditional bundled service.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And. WHEREAS, a thoughtful study of CCE would answer key questions and illuminate the potential benefits and challenges of enabling CCS model in Colorado. And. WHEREAS, a well-designed CCE program would likely drive lower rates and cleaner energy for all Colorado communities, not just those that would Adobe city by introducing competition and community level choice into the supply of'",
        "'speaker_1': 'wholesale electricity while maintaining the viability and strength of Colorado's investor owned electric utilities and without imposing additional costs on the utility for its bundled service customers. And. Whereas, while CCE has the potential to allow Colorado communities to make local energy decisions, meet their energy goals, reduce energy costs, foster local economic development, and keep more energy dollars circulating'",
        "'speaker_1': 'locally through more local employment and fewer energy dollars flowing to distant utility employees, executives and shareholders. It is nonetheless prudent to study the economic and technical visibility and the regulatory implications and legal impacts of CCE before considering CCE enabled legislation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And. Whereas, CC is an innovative concept which other states have already successfully implemented, thereby thereby giving Colorado the opportunity to identify best practices and lessons learned from their experiences. And. WHEREAS, a CC study bill entitled Public Utilities Commission Study of Community Choice Energy was introduced in the Colorado legislation that would authorize an informational proceeding at the PUC'",
        "'speaker_1': 'to receive input on key questions about CCE from a broad array of stakeholders and invited expert speakers to determine whether the apparent promise of CCE for Colorado's energy and economic future does indeed have merit. Now therefore be resolved by Denver City Council.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That Denver City Council concludes that it is a public interest to better understand the potential benefits and challenges of community choice. Energy in the state of Colorado and Denver City Council does hereby indicate its support for a thoughtful study of CTE at the Public Utility Commission.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And Denver City Council does urge its legislators and all Colorado legislators to support the study before that so that we may obtain the information needed to determine whether the apparent promise of 64 communities for eight communities and for Colorado's energy and economic future has merit, merit and is worthy of being considered for implementation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Adoption of this resolution in no way obligates Denver City Council or Denver to participate in community choice energy, energy if and when. The study does show no benefits to Colorado and is subsequently implemented by passage of enabling legislation in the future.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sorry. Go ahead, Councilman.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And one one quick note. If if colleagues, if you checked Granicus, this has been updated and the public facing view does save Denver City Council and argue it just has denver. So the public sees that it is Denver city councilman as I read it, as it is published to the public.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilman Hines, your motion to adopt.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I move that we adopt. Proclamation number 20 that 1453 seconds you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman, it's been moved and I believe Councilman Ortega was the second. And we'll go next to comments by members of council. But just wanted to remind folks that because we do have interpretation services happening simultaneously and you did a great job, Councilman Hines.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You were right on. But just that we speak a bit slower so that we can allow the interpreters time to do their job. And so and we've had it moved and seconded comments by members of Council Councilman Hines.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Madam President. And thank you for to our interpreters, for all you do. I apologize. So I am excited to bring this proclamation forward for three reasons. First, climate change is real. Yes, Cohen is here and it is destructive to our community, our lives and our livelihoods.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But climate change is also here, and it threatens our habitability on this planet. We're seeing it all over the world from Venice, Italy, where their newly installed water barrier system still didn't stop flooding recently throughout the city. We're also seeing it here in Colorado, where three of the state's largest forest fires in history all occurred in 2020'",
        "'speaker_1': '. We cannot afford to lose focus on our climate. Certainly not for our children and for our children's children. But we also can't afford to lose focus on our climate for us today. Second, communities like Denver deserve the ability to direct the ways we want to generate energy.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Call it local control. Denver Rights Want more control over our own energy sources. We have the most polluted zip code in the nation. 80216 located in District nine and it is socially and environmentally just that we move quickly to stop the continued destruction.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Three. This is a demonstration of collaboration between levels of government. We are doing everything we can to mitigate climate change, including partnering up and down the levels of government to preserve our habitability on our beautiful planet. Finally, to be clear, this is a Denver City Council proclamation in support of a bill that it passed, would direct the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'PUC to conduct a study on Community Choice energy. While I and maybe my colleagues might be on board with Community Choice Energy entirely. The proclamation is just supporting the bill that creates the study. Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Hines. Madam Secretary, roll call, please.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Hines.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hi.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Cashman. I can. I. Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Sandoval. I. Sawyer, I. Torres.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I black.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I see tobacco. I. Clark.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Herndon.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I. Madam Secretary, close the voting and announce the results.'",
        "'speaker_5': '13 eyes.'",
        "'speaker_0': '13 eyes. Proclamation. 1453 has been adopted. Councilman Hines, we have 5 minutes for the proclamation acceptance. If you'd like to introduce. Who will accept the proclamation?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But thank you, Madam President. Representative Gideon was planning to accept the proclamation. She was the bill's sponsor and. And is the one who asked the city council to initiate the proclamation. I just received a text message from her saying that she is stuck in traffic and will be unable to accept the proclamation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we have the 5 minutes to move forward. So thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, congratulations, Councilman Haines, on the proclamation, and we'll wish her well in traffic. We don't get to hear that much anymore, so we'll move on. Councilmember Ortega, will you please read Proclamation 1552 for us?'"

    "A resolution approving the Collective Bargaining Agreement between the City and County of Denver and the Denver Police Protective Association, for the years 2021-2022, that resulted from the 2020 impasse arbitration award.  Approves a collective bargaining agreement with the Denver Police Protective Association for the years 2021-2022, that resulted from the 2020 impasse arbitration award. The last regularly scheduled Council meeting within the 30-day review period is on 1-4-21. Councilmember Gilmore approved direct filing this item on 12-10-20.": [
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. It has been moved and seconded questions or comments by members of Council. Councilwoman CdeBaca.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Madam President. I would like I see Rob Ness, Nisga'a and Kirsten Crawford on the line, and I would love for them to explain to council members and the public what council members options are tonight for votes, considering this is a contract that was arbitrated.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So if that's possible, Kirsten, can you can you let us know? But evening council members in the Senate may be up here and they're all. Well, yes, that's a good question. And a few of you have asked us as well.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So there are a number of reasons that this agreement needs to be memorialized in writing. Beyond just the award that the arbiter has rendered, but starting in no particular order under Section 9814 of the charter, both the terms agreed to by the parties and the decision awarded by the arbiter require a written agreement.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's explicitly laid out in the charter, but there's other really important reasons. The the parties, as you know, are bound by the arbiters decision. It is binding arbitration. So both parties are bound to abide by what the arbiter has decided, but also beyond that can choose voluntarily if they mutually agreed to deviate from the decision.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So in order of determining finality of the parties decisions as to whether they accept the arbiters award or choose to continue to negotiate for reasons of finality, the agreement needs to be put in writing. There's other reasons, too.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They're just highlighting. One of the most important articles in the agreement that is beyond the scope of the Arbiter Award is Article five, which contains a provision where the city does not mandate any more fair share fees be extracted from the officer's paycheck.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's based on a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision. And so Article five says we will take the dues if an officer agrees that they would want us to do so in writing. You know, some of the other reasons is projected liabilities need to be encumbered and the only way to recover is through a written agreement.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In other words, the contract. And in this particular situation, counsel is the one who has to determine whether a contract is approved here. So that's clearly counsel authority. There's other just charter interpretation reasons, but those are the most important reasons.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And thank you for the question because I have had others ask us as well. And so let me summarize and tell me if I am capturing this. So a vote tonight is not symbolic. And in fact, our vote tonight, it constitutes our agreement or disagreement with the arbitrator, which is required.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Correct. No, that's not correct. The the arbitration decision is being analyzed. So it's not a discretionary decision. So my question here. So my question here is, given that we do have yes, no or abstain options to vote here tonight.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This it doesn't it's not symbolic. It does allow the public to know where we stand on this agreement. But the agreement has to go into effect. No matter what. What if you get a council that votes this down tonight?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'What happens with it? Well, I mean, if we're in that particular framework, we.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Would be.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Discussing the potential litigants and outcome of litigation because the binding decision is enforceable and someone is bound to enforce it. But that's not a discussion that I don't think that anybody would want to have right now in a public session.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we can discuss that if that's what does the charter. Can you explain for the public a brief overview of what happened after the last vote? I'm happy. We're happy to do that. I feel that potentially John Griffin and Roberts were better suited to talk about the process because they were intimately hands on involved at every step'",
        "'speaker_5': 'of the way. So perhaps we want to hear from them first. Sure. John, I would appreciate if you could speak up and brief the public on what happened between the last vote and this one.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Three. Do you have specific questions you'd like to have answered?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. Who was involved throughout the process? What offers were on the table? What happened through negotiations?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, as you know, negotiations are confidential.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I will defer to Robert Nassau on some of these questions. But to overall answer, the mayor's office, the city council and then other people from Budget Management office were also involved in discussions. I'll hand it over to Rob to speak more if there's anything else to add.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah. I can speak to process. I'm leery to discuss any her. To address anything that was specifically said during those discussions because of their confidential and privileged nature. But after the. The tentative agreement was rejected by city council.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We had an obligation to go back and try to continue to negotiate a replacement contract. Through those negotiations, we were able to come to an agreement on most every aspect of the contract, with the exception of five issues that remained in dispute and based upon the nature of those disputed issues, final offers from the city were developed'",
        "'speaker_1': 'in concert with the mayor and City Council, and ultimately those final offers were presented.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'To the arbitrator for resolution.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So can I get some clarification on the confidential nature of. Essentially an autopsy. The charter does not require this to be confidential. And I was told at the beginning of the process that we choose this confidential process to protect both parties, leverage in negotiations.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Now that negotiations are over and there is an arbitration agreement or arbitration decision, what requires the process and the offers to now be confidential? After it's been said and done.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, the best answer I can give you is that negotiations do not end with this particular contract, that negotiations will continue not only with the EPA, but locally, by the way, on fire contracts, on on share of contracts.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I would counsel against disclosing anything that may tip the city's hand in future negotiations.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So there's. Did you. So do you agree that there's nothing that requires us to maintain a confidential process in the charter?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I don't believe that there's anything in the charter that specifically requires that. But again, I would counsel against disclosing anything that was confidential.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. And I would like to weigh in on that as well. That is not one member's decision to unilaterally decide what to disclose when it's attorney client privilege and confidential information and negotiations discussed in executive session. That is the client's decision.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And, you know, the corporate parties are the client, which is comprised not only of city council but members of the other teams. So that is a discussion that the body would have to have before one member of not just decided to release information.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Did city councils offer? Was it allowed to be presented to the arbitrator in there in the hearing?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I can speak to that somewhat.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And Rob can jump ahead because the corporate authorities could not come to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'An agreement. No offer was presented towards the arbitrator.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'What prevented both corporate authorities from presenting what their offers were to the arbitrator or the arbitrator to decide between?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They disagreed.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But their their position was not presented to the arbitrator.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The aisle at Rob. Tim, did you actually to talk about this?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'My understanding is that the city offers something as an entity. So if the city cannot, if the corporate authorities inside the city cannot agree, then no offers submitted. But I will rob chocolate. That's exactly right, John. The final offer issue by issue presented by the city was the city's offer.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It wasn't the mayor's offer. It wasn't city council's offer. It was the offer of the city collectively as the corporate authorities.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'For the city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Is that are we joined together as one in an ordinance or in the charter?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The Charter defines corporate authorities for purposes of collective bargaining as the mayor and city council or their representatives.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so because that's plural, it suggests that we would have. Separate offers as well. Correct.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I don't agree with that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Why would they not refer to us as the corporate authority if it was synonymous with the city?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I believe the mayor is one corporate authority, and I believe that city council is also a corporate authority.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so in an arbitration hearing, why would both corporate authorities not be able to present their position?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The corporate authorities did.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Present their final offers.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'On all but one issue, and that was the issue of salaries in 2022. And on that one specific and discrete issue. The corporate authorities were unable to come to an agreement on what offered 2% to the arbitrator, and therefore none was made.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Is there any? Limitation to city council, putting forth an ordinance that makes this process more transparent and public in the future. It can. Council Members. Gibson Crawford Legislative Council. I neglected to introduce this stuff a couple times. Now I apologize.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You know, we are talking to President Gilmore about continually, continually and sometimes daily and hourly about process improvements along the way and whether something can be codified and who it finds is a discussion that we're having. And happy to talk to you more about that, too.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But to say kind of a vague or ambiguous question about can we put something in ordinance? Yes, the devil's in the details and we're discussing that now. And final question, where any city council members present in the first and only hearing with the arbitrator?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilwoman CdeBaca, Councilwoman Canete.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you very much, Madam President. It's been difficult to determine how to. Speak tonight on this issue. I very much respect the benefits of confidential negotiations and privilege, and I will honor them in terms of the the details of the process.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But as an elected official, I cannot stand silent without an observation, which is that this outcome happened because of a disappointing failure to good faith negotiate with this council. And I will say that that. In my opinion, was a perversion of the charter.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And requires a systematic solution such that the good faith obligations extend between the branches of government in the same way that they do to our bargaining partners across the table. With that, I will be voting for this tonight because of the legal consequences that will occur.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But I could not remain silent in what I consider to be a bad faith outcome between the branches of government. That requires rectifying. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Canete. I'm going to go ahead. And I don't see any other hands raised. And so I want to just let folks know that this body has worked together over the last five months to shore up this process.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I came in as president July 20th and that same exact week. This is when those negotiations were happening and through us as council working together, we have shored up this process and we have a stronger role in collective bargaining.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I really believe that these new protocols that we've put together will strengthen our role. And council has held our ground. We are now viewed as an equal partner in the negotiation process, which, as we all know, we haven't been viewed as an equal partner in a very long time, and we are an equal partner now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We met in executive session with sometimes a majority of council and if not, the others were briefed. We met during mayor council. We met and luti committee. We met six times to shore up our position and evaluate proposals.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I'm proud of the work that this Council has done together. We pushed each other. We asked questions. We were unhappy with some things. We pushed back. And when we outlined this process way back in August, we determined that we were going to have a representative and John Griffin was our representative.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And like Kirsten Crawford said, I was sometimes talking to them daily, sometimes more than that. And we made sure to create plenty of time for council to talk. Now you've got to start out in a good fashion sometimes to get a negotiation to where it needs to be.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I agree with the criticisms that have been lobbed, Mark, tonight, because we weren't. On even footing when we started out, but we did the best that we could with what we've been given. And I had just that conversation today with Kirsten Crawford and Jonathan Griffin, how we share this process up so that this is not just'",
        "'speaker_0': 'a guidelines that the city council came forward with, but that we codify this in ordinance in some way so that this never happens again to another city council, so that there is a process related to it. And that's going to entail us working with the city attorney, Kristen Bronson, and the mayor's administration to make sure that we'",
        "'speaker_0': 'don't put something forth and then it doesn't take effect. We need to work with them, ensure this up. But that is the work that we've started. And at the end of the day, that's how you start to undo these systems that have been wound so tight for decades and decades.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This council started that work. This wasn't the outcome that a majority, a supermajority of us wanted. But we have started that work and I'm proud of that work and we will continue to do that work. And so with that, seeing no other questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Madam Secretary, roll call, please.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'CdeBaca. Now. Clark.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Herndon. I ain't.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Cashman. I can. I. Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Cinnabon. I. Sawyer. No. Torres. I. Black. I. Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I. Madam Secretary, closed the voting and announced the results.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Three days. Ten Eyes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Ten Eyes. Resolution 1528 has been adopted. The next item up is Resolution 1415. Councilwoman CdeBaca, please go ahead with your questions on it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Madam President. I put I called this off a consent for questions because of an event that happened this weekend. GREENE Latino's has been through the leadership of and Tafoya collecting trash throughout our encampments with a crew of volunteers.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And every week, they they come up with loads of trash that they have nowhere to dispose. And I'm wondering if this contract would allow them to to continue some of the innovation that they've started. Well, what they're doing is buying those large waste management bags that an individual can buy for their residents, where they call waste management'",
        "'speaker_5': ', to pick it up when it's full. And I'm wondering if this contract would allow for us to be able to do that specifically for our unhoused residents at encampments.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you for that question, Councilman. And go ahead, Christina.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. And apologies, Christina Ulrich, administration supervisor with the General Services. Thank you, Councilman, for that question. So this contract is actually limited to pick up at specific two city facilities. In addition, it is limited to trash compactor, dumpsters, front load service and vehicle impound facilities.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I don't believe that it currently has the capacity to pick up those bags as you as you're referring. And what would it take to modify to allow that sort of service for people who are not entitled to a dumpster?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I don't think that we're prepared to answer that question at this time. And this amendment really does focus on adding the cares in the female language. I do think that is a conversation that we could potentially have offline when we have some more information available.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Is it possible to make sure that that conversation happens before? We? Finalize the Keres language. It feels like picking up trash where there's not a dumpster in a bag like this during COVID makes a lot of sense. If we're spending millions on hazmat cleanup when a situation has escalated beyond repair.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so for this to be a reimbursable thing within the CARES Act language I think is critical right now. Is there any opportunity to modify that language to make sure that this is part of the services in that contract?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm sorry. You asking apologies to modify the CARES Act language. That language specifically cannot be modified in any way or shape because it does come from the federal government itself. And at this time, we actually only are looking seeking reimbursement for about 1200 dollars through the CARES Act for services received through this year.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And as you're aware and less that cares funding is extended. Those services can only be through the end of this year. And that's really what this language covers. So the event that took place this past weekend, the city will be getting a bill from the organizers of that event for the costs of the bag and the pickup'",
        "'speaker_5': '. Is that something that we would add into the contract that we are currently spending down and whether we get reimbursed by the CARES Act or not? Is that something we would pay for? Because that is not covered under the current contract.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I don't believe that's something that we would pay for tying it to the contract. However, as I stated, this is really just specific to that cares and funding language. So I think this is a conversation for us to have offline, just as we gather some more information on that topic.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. That's it for my questions. Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You councilwoman. Thank you, Christina. Councilman Hines.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Madam President.'",

A major obstacle to new housing construction in gentrifying neighborhoods is the fear that new units will induce additional housing demand, increasing local rents and fueling further gentrification.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Although this is counterintuitive, there are many plausible mechanisms by which an increased concentration of wealthy households could make a neighborhood more attractive to other wealthy households. However, there is little to no empirical evidence on this topic. We study induced demand for new apartment complexes in gentrifying areas, using listing level data on rental prices from Zillow and exact'",
        "'speaker_7': 'household migration data from in future preliminary results. Using the spatial difference in difference approach suggests that these induced demand effects are overwhelmed by the effect of increased supply in neighborhoods when new apartment complexes were completed between 2014 and 2016.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Rents in existing units near the new apartments declined relative to neighborhoods that did not see new construction until 2018. Changes in in-migration appear to drive this result. Although the total number of migrants from high income neighborhoods to the new construction neighborhoods increases after the new units are completed.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The number of high income arrivals to previously existing units actually decreases as the new units absorb a substantial portion of these households. On the whole, our results suggest that on average, in the short run, new construction lowers rents in gentrifying neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I would like to add that this is not the only study available. I could have used a few others, and I would like to also add that there's some people that will say that adding some fly is not enough to solve the issues at the lowest end of the income scale.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This is, of course, correct, but adding supply is going to be a necessary precondition in preserving those affordable units that already exist. And when you consider that this project has 49 affordable units, that is an extra bonus. Gentrification is simply a symptom of population and job growth, outpacing the housing stock.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'If you don't build homes in one area, those needing housing will build up the available housing in another. The solution to this are actually pretty simple. Zoning wealthy areas, especially those zoned for only single family homes, increasing number of units per square mile in urban areas, and abolishing wasteful zoning regs like parking meters.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'The production of 326 apartments as well as some. Absolutely. Needed commercial space in this neighborhood. It fits with the plan for this area. It's something that will provide housing for 400 people, at least with construction of a building that size.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Who will not be buying in places like Globeville and Alegria, Swansea, and instead will proceed to rent in this new building, assuming it's built. This is critical for promoting the connection of Denaro to the rest of the city.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right now, everybody who lives there has to drive because as people said earlier, it's next to everything and it has nothing. Producing this building will mean that the area will likely get better transit, it will absolutely get better pedestrian infrastructure and will promote the increase in the amount of green space that's provided in the area.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And in reality, as somebody who lived in an area that used to be effectively derelict Union Station and then was developed, it has the potential to help promote the production of a vibrant neighborhood in a place where right now there are a number of apartment buildings and a number of industrial buildings that don't provide all that many'",
        "'speaker_1': 'jobs. We as a city have a shortage of housing. We don't have. Enough places for people to live. That's why there are homeless people on the streets. There are people like me who have a moderate amount of income who can afford the rent, the rising rents.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that inherently pushes people out of the places where rents used to be low. If we produce buildings that provide some affordable housing and also additional market rate housing, that decreases the likelihood that people like me will end up displacing those with low incomes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To me, this building could potentially be my home when it's built, and if I live there, I won't be displacing some homeowner or some renter who is living in the Highlands or who's living in Greece. Thank you.'",

At long last, it's clear that the housing crisis and cop terror both are exacerbated by the development that prices people out of their homes and neighborhoods and vice versa.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'As the Gas Coalition can tell you better than I, every time the developers come around to lap up and another opportunity for profit in the housing industry, they always promised to devote a substantial portion.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Of their projects to low income units.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And it never seems to quite happen. Certainly not to the degree that meets the needs of the working families in the cities, the ones that make the city run. So I'll just reiterate the yes coalition proclaims the following.'",

The US Census tells us that in the last decade of apartments built in this city, 51% were luxury units, 32% were market units and 17% were low income units.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That makes 83% of apartments at market rate above. And if we wonder why the suffering of our houseless neighbors is so widespread with residential space that might house them sitting empty. This is a major reason not to mention that outright homelessness is not the only consequence of gentrification.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Thankfully, in the Elyria, Swansea community, I can still not afford to move out. So the problem is not a supply and demand issue too, because there's plenty of housing in. Last year, supply and demand was the issue. Why has the problem not been solved?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's because we keep building what is not needed. If we you just heard 51% of the units built in the last ten years. Partly you do because of such dramatic changes in land you use. Our luxury units. We've seen the reports out in Denver's media that suggest that they are mostly vacant and I house we have also'",

        "'speaker_1': '470%. And people still have the audacity to come on here and suggest a building. More of this is going to solve the problem. How does any of this align with anything that's equitable? None of it does. In Olivia, in Swansea, since 2010, the rent has the median.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Same of the problem. A 470% increase in total property tax values in the span of under two decades is traumatizing to a community. And if city council cannot understand that and finally change the tide in Denver's housing crisis, then when will it ever start?'",

        "'speaker_5': 'The affordability that that the developer is providing is not relevant to this area. It doesn't meet the needs and it was not agreed to by the community.

        "'speaker_5': 'My equity means should mean that this development process recognizes past harm and does something about that. Equity has to be a lens by which all the aspects of development are examined, and we need longer community engagement processes that involve the the developer and the community directly, as well as changes at the city level to make that to'",

We have to be on the defensive with project after project coming in and around our communities.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We need the city to stand up and protect its most vulnerable citizens, not the folks who can afford luxury homes and apartments. Our communities.

I stand in opposition of the proposed rezoning a 3225 ten Argo Street as part of Build 20 1159. This rezoning request is very similar to a request the City Council approved at 2535 East 40th Avenue.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In this case, the developer requested to rezone and propose city council to make a decision very quickly. The developer stated it was costing them money not to have the property rezoning. And by condensing the timeline for rezoning, there was insufficient time for the community to work with the developer to come to an equitable agreement.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Two years later, the property currently sits vacant while scrappers are breaking in and stealing whatever value is left. And that's clearly an indication that this timeline was not urgent and that the developer dictated the conversation in that case and not city council.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In this case, the developer is from out of state and pushing for a reason to 16 stories of primarily luxury apartments. This is not what the city needs. We have been let down by CDP and host as far as pushing this project through without proper analysis of the impacts and not working with the community.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The city needs to do more to structure the development. These development plans to require affordability. To lead the conversation when it comes to reshaping our city. Currently the city is not doing enough to protect the interests of its most vulnerable residents.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The city lets these developers push their interests. Instead of the council standing up and fighting for the interests of its residents. The conversation shouldn't be happening between developers, residents and Arnaud's. The city needs to step up and be part of the conversation and dictate what defines affordability in these development plans.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I ask that you listen to the people of the city instead of outside interest in development.

        "'speaker_6': 'Not very well. So you already have a depressed community that you're bringing in low paying jobs and high paying rents. That doesn't make any sense. You add into that? On December 26th, the federal moratorium on evictions ends now in Denver.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'They're just going to wait for the property value to double and then sell it. They don't care if anybody's there. And then we keep building stuff that people can't afford. You think there's a lot of homelessness on the streets right now?'",

        "'speaker_1': 'I understand that change is always going to come, but I also know that we have the power to get to decide what gets changed and how it changes. I am speaking out against the zoning classification for 3225 ten Argo Street.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The five point area has already changed so much, and allowing the change that the building can be raised to 16 storeys is nothing more than a gateway to more gentrification and terminating the ability for low income members of the community to afford living there.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'We also see that the residents of this city, not necessarily the private the private donors, have been bearing the greatest burden, especially through proposed mill levies directly through property taxes or passed down to the renters. It is decisions like this that puts Denver on the map as the fastest gentrifying city in the country for Latinos.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So as a city declared racism a public health issue, it is your responsibility in this moment to prioritize affordability and equitable planning. The well-being and stability of our neighborhoods matter and this and the well-being and stability is a part of our safety.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'So what are we doing for those 44% that can't afford to live at 60 and 80% or the 1300 or whatever I employed?

        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Madam President. A. Libby I think my questions are probably for you, and I'm just trying to get to my notes. Is Libby still on?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You should be. Absolutely.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm still here. Okay. Thanks. Hi, Libby. So I'm curious about some of what I read in the Rhino plan. And the Rhino Plan was one of the plans that was brought up in terms of guidance. Right. Yes. That is the applicable malaria plan.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. So what I'm trying to understand a little bit more because it was pretty specific about how many units stand to be developed in that district. Do you have any sense of how many housing units have been built in?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'What is the Rhino District since this plan was adopted? I did allude to it in my presentation. See here. And I'm looking at for the plan, page 37 that says and just let me know if this is. Your recollection as well that there's market support for nearly 900 single family attached units and 675 multifamily units to the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'year 2022. Okay. So we're close to that at this point. In the 13 years since the narco market began developing, there's already been 980 apartments developed and 337 more are under construction. 337 are currently under construction. And then this would add 326.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then I'm not as familiar with what's proposed on the vacant land north of Delaney, but I believe that's looking at probably another 1000 units or so. Okay. And I'm not sure if you have this information, but I'm curious because the plan also alludes to this how and how much of that housing stock has been developed under'",
        "'speaker_5': '50%. Am I? So that could be host projects. Denver Housing Authority projects. And I'm.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Just not familiar.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'With the district enough, so I'm trying to get a sense.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Of.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'What affordability has been developed. And. And this is. I'm sorry. Who are you looking at? The entire area that falls within the Rainbow North Plan.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Or are we just looking at it in our goal.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Market?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I am looking at.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So it looks like this alludes to the entire. The entire area. I think it's looking largely at underutilized land area. But what it's telling me and this is page 70. Four of the plan. Let me get over there.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. So. This is referencing. Different opportunities. And I think it's looking largely at the Todd areas. But what it's talking about is. Under the section create a compact, mixed, used, pedestrian friendly. Todd Is this area fall within that TODD area.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I just thought this plan.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So this does not fall within your 40th employee of Todd districts.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This is pretty much on the opposite side. And I think back then, that was referring to what would now be like 30th and Blake. But this is in that far southwest corner. Got it. We're looking at that. Actually, the plan does reference to narco market.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And does it reference for dinner, though? Let me take a look here. What specific is in the Todd area? It does reference very specific affordability goals. Do you recall if the dinner go section referenced anything like that? I don't recall offhand, but it was.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Fairly vague on just wanting to increase that intensity and mix of residential and commercial uses in the area. It also did not address how tall those buildings should be. Right. Okay. Okay. I'm finding it here. So in there, create a compact, mixed use.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Pedestrian friendly development. It says encourage a mix of uses, including residential, retail and office uses. Provide a range of housing options, including workforce options in terms of site type and size, both sale and rental. Okay. So it doesn't have any metrics in the same way that the total area does.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. Have we tracked overall how many? Affordable units have been developed in the Reno area pursuant to the plan goals. We do not have those numbers. We did look around at some affordable housing agreements in the area. The nearest you to nahco market is in city gate.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's just kind of southeast across Brighton Boulevard and that has 25 units at 80% i. But we don't have a full analysis, you know, and the totally there are various developments that have been built over the last 10.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To 15.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Years that include a few units at a variety of levels. But. I don't think it's anything that's getting around 50% and there's been nothing so far developed and that's a narco market immediate area.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you so much, Libby. Those are all my questions for now, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilman. Councilwoman Black.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Madam President, and thank you for the great presentations, CPD and for all of our speakers who are here tonight. I have some questions for CPD and a couple for host and a couple for the applicant. And for a CPD after evaluating the criteria, you're recommending approval of this, but planning board also voted to approve it'",
        "'speaker_5': '. But tonight we have another rezoning on the agenda that neither CPD nor the Planning Board are recommending. Can you please help explain how CPD decides whether or not to recommend a rezoning and what kind of way that recommendation carries?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So first off, as far as how we recommend a rezoning that's analyzing again our four criteria with consistency with the plans and for the start up in front of me. Which we place a lot of weight on, especially with Blueprint Number and the comprehensive plan having been adopted just last year after extensive public input.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then we look at whether or not it will also be uniform with the district regulations of that new zone district that's being proposed. And then also considering the public health, safety and welfare and whether or not the proposal will further those the justifying circumstance, there are several that we can look at, but for this one, it'",
        "'speaker_5': 'came down to the fact that this neighborhood has already changed significantly and the comprehensive plan and blueprint number were adopted after this I.B. Zone district was in place. And then furthermore, we consider whether or not the proposal is consistent with the neighborhood context that is on the list of purpose and intent.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And in this rezoning, we found that this did meet all of these criteria. I did not manage the other project that Sarah Carson will be presenting later tonight where we're recommending denial. But it did not meet the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Criteria for.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Various reasons. So the fact that you are recommending that this does carry a lot of weight. I mean, in my five years on council, I've never seen one come to us that you didn't recommend, except for the one that's later this evening.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So it does meet all of the criteria according to your evaluation of it. It does. And as I mentioned, we don't consider whether or not this project is perfect or might be better, but we try to be as objective as possible in comparing this with all of the applicable goals and strategies in those plans.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I do want to point out to you, because a lot of folks reference the number of goals and criteria in these plans, and we acknowledge that a particular zoning project isn't going to meet every single one of those goals and strategies, but we consider those that are most applicable, and a lot of them also fall upon'",
        "'speaker_5': 'the city's responsibility to implement. So it's not on the private sector to implement.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Every single one of these goals and strategies.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. I appreciate the analysis that you've done. So a couple more questions. Do any of Denver's plans call for this parcel to remain industrial? No. And what does Blueprint Denver recommend for this parcel? If you could remind us, please.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The future place type for this is higher residential area where commercial uses are prevalent and buildings are generally the tallest of residential places and it falls within the urban center neighborhood context that again anticipates a high mix of uses good street activation and taller multi-story buildings.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So using that criteria, that's how you came to support this particular rezoning. It just sounds like that's exactly what you're describing. And on slide ten of your presentation. It shows different heights and it shows this as 16 in there.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Are all of those already rigzone on that slide 16. All of those are outlined within the dashed white line are being proposed as another project that's actually going to the planning board tomorrow night where they're signing some of the Chapter 59, as well as industrial zones in order to better specify what's allowed in these areas.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so if that's approved, that would also result in some taller buildings. Although it should be noted that the existing pads.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Also envision some buildings around 200 feet.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Tall. Okay. All right. That's all I have for you. And Madam President, I have a few more questions, if you don't mind. Thank you for hosting. I have a few questions. One of the speakers tonight referred to unmet promises made by developers to build affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Can you tell us about any agreements that developers have made that they did not follow through with?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Uh. Hi there. This is Andrew Johnston from the Department of Post. There's. A lot of agreements that the city enters into with developers. I'm not aware of any off the top of my head that where a developer has failed to meet their obligations.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Usually if they fail to meet their obligations.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's before the project's finished and we engage in a conversation with them.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To rectify the situation.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Is that what you're. Does that answer your question?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. Because someone. One of the speakers. Allege that that it's a common thing and I'm not aware of it. So I just was wondering if that is something that's happened. Deborah, did you have something to say about that?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No, I just wanted to say. Not to my knowledge. And I also wanted to just mention that Andrew has been in this position for less than six months, and I'm coming up on a year. So to the extent that there is any any other projects that have occurred prior to our employment in host, we're not aware of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'them. We're happy to check and let you know. But I have not heard of any.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. And we recently just received the 2019 report from hosts. Can you please tell everyone who's watching how much was expended in 2019 on newer and preservation of units as well as support services in 2019?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I know that in combined in 2018 and 19, I'd have to look to get a breakdown by year. But I know that as part of the housing and inclusive Denver, we've expanded $112 million creating units. And in those in that, we've created 2500.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And 80 affordable units. And I can give you a little bit of a breakdown on the income levels that that were addressed through that, because we have actually 51% of what we have that what we have funded serve households at 30% and below of area median income, including a high percentage for homeless.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I can go on if you want anything more specific. And in that category we've spent. A total of 86, about 57 million for households at 30% or below.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. Well, thank you. I just wanted to make the point that that the people of host are working very hard to create new housing units for people at all income levels and to preserve housing and to provide services for people in need.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I just wanted to make that point because I feel like a lot of people come to our council meetings and they don't think we're doing anything. But actually you are all are doing quite a lot. I also know that in 2020, in this extraordinary year we're having, you know, we're spending, you know, $15 million of carers'",
        "'speaker_5': 'dollars to help people experiencing homelessness and to try and get people into hotels and shelter. So contrary to what we might hear, you all are doing really tremendous work out there. So thank you. Okay, two more questions. Madam President, if you don't mind, I'm making up for the last few months when I've only said here and I'",
        "'speaker_5': '. I have some questions for the applicant, Mr. Hill. I have a few questions for you. So you're agreeing to build 49 units of affordable housing that will remain affordable for 99 years. If you had not agreed to this under the current law that the Denver City Council passed a few years ago, how many units would you have'",
        "'speaker_5': 'to build?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh, you're on mute.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I apologize. Thank you, Councilwoman, for your question. We would be required to build zero affordable units within the project under current law. Instead, we would be required to pay an affordable linkage fee of $1.50 per square foot, which on this project would be about $600,000.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. Or you could build five units, right?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Oh, yes. In lieu of linkage feed, you could build five units instead of the 49 year old.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Correct. And how much will it cost you to build 49 units?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, it's a great question, Councilman, because of the construction type, which is high rise, concrete and steel. These units cost us $400,000 per unit times 49 units. You're talking about $20 million of affordable housing that we're voluntarily building.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So under the law, though, you'd only have to pick and read thousand dollars.'",
        "'speaker_1': '$800,000? That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. And earlier this year there you brought a different project to us that council did not approve. How many units were in that project? How many affordable units were how many total units and affordable units were in that?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes, Councilman, to be for your question. So that reason for shut down in May of this year was a 625 unit project also. That was 12 stories, also high rise, 625 units. We were proposing 63 or 10% affordable at 80%.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that was rejected 7 to 6 of the council.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. And my final question is, do you own the property now for this rezoning?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'No, ma'am, we do not. The current owner that operates the the distribution facility on the site is actually retiring and shutting down the facility, which is why he came to us. So so there will be no jobs remaining on site, whether we like it or not.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. But if you if this does not pass, are you still going to buy it?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'No, ma'am, we will.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'All right. Thank you, Mr. Hill. Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Black. Councilman Cashman.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Madam President. I have questions for Mr. Hill. She is still with us. And if you could save me some research, I don't have your materials up from the file. How many? Two bedroom. Apartment three. Are you building as part of this?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'A minimum of 20% of the of the affordable units will be two bedrooms.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'In total in the project.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's also 20%. So our our affordable unit mix is proportional to our market rate unit mix. The price will be 20%, two bedrooms across both market rate and affordable.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And how how large are your two bedroom apartments?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'About 1200 square feet.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Of 1200 square feet. And you said something about that. You had built 168 affordable units in. Where are those? Sure.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good question, Councilman. We have committed we've signed three host agreements today. The first one we signed about 18 months ago was at Colorado and Athens, near near the Colorado station light rail stop, just south of the Ford dealership.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We're under construction on 360 units. 36 of those are affordable and merely adjacent to that. We have a second phase. It's 200 units. 20 of those will be affordable that we're committing to 49 affordable units here. And the remaining 63 to get the 168 was what we committed to and assigned to be reserved earlier this year, but'",
        "'speaker_1': 'was shot down.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Thank you. The 10,000 square foot green space you talked about on this project is that one chunk of land that. Could be a Frisbee space. Or is this? How's that? What are we doing?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Great question, Catherine. So we are adhering to not only the Denver Green Building Ordinance, but also the rhino design overlay. Those two things are the driving factors that are leading us to take the option to do 10,000 square feet of ground level, publicly accessible, private, green space.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And it's a combination of additional setbacks along really a runway frontage, which is on the nado. So the right of design overlay requires additional setback of 40 feet. And then we're also providing a pocket park, if you will, about 5000 feet in a triangular shape at the southeast corner.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Of this tank. And my let's see. Oh, why did you opt to build this without going for government tax credits?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's a great question, Kathleen. The primary reason is that a project of this size and scale for 2002 door, 300 units to $120 million project, the subsidies that are available to us in the form of tax credits and low interest loans are really not meaningful.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's very small dollars, unfortunately. We're building 20 million square feet of the housing with the 49 years. I believe the budget for affordable housing for 2020 dedicated to actually building for the housing is 30 million. So we clearly they can't give that all to us.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So it's not usually material. It's also it slows down the process. We don't know what we're eligible for and we're not. And really, to be honest, because we're market rate developers, we are private market developers, we do not have experience building separate, affordable housing, tax, credit, housing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's all inclusionary for rising. We do it. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'My last question.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Just another.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Detail. As I remember, you're building parking for, I believe, 360 cars.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is that correct? They're about? Yes, sir. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. That's all. Thank you, Mr. Hill.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Madam President. Councilman.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Cashman. Councilwoman Ortega, you're up next.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Madam President. Some of my questions have been asked, but I wanted to kind of hone in on some of the comments that have been made about the fact that there are 20,000 vacant units in the city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I wanted to ask Deborah or someone from Host if you can verify that and identify how host is looking at those vacancies. I know that some of the rents have started to come down on market rate housing in our city and wondering is there some solution that the city is exploring to figure out how to access'",
        "'speaker_2': 'those units? Thank you, Councilman Ortega. Since I'm on the production side, I'm also on the preservation side, I should say, but I personally do not know how many units there are at this present time. I know that in the past we have worked with VHA to identify market rate units that were that we felt were being underutilized'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and created a whole program around that. It was not terribly successful, to be honest with you, and it didn't result in the people taking advantage of those units. That program that was started by Eric Sullivan. Yes. You're referring to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah, I think it was called. Were those all just concentrated on downtown or did any of them look at, for example, some of the affordable units in Councilwoman Black's district? I think to my knowledge, I think it was everywhere.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think they were working to identify units everywhere, and they were working with employers to try to identify people to occupy those units. And there was a whole subsidy set up for two years and and everything, but it was not wildly, wildly tapped into.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Thank you for addressing that. Certainly. I'm going to move on with my next question. And this is to actually partially it's true host, but it's it's really targeted to CPD and. Libby. I don't know if. Anybody else is on representing the upper management of Canada.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I want to know in. In the zoning process. What specifically is being done per the, you know, updated? You know, blueprint Denver plan. That that looks at how you will address zoning applications that are in neighborhoods that are already experiencing displacement.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Do you just rely on hosts to play a role, or is there something more that you all do or are looking to do in the process? So let me give you an example. So when the Cedar Site was being looked at as a redevelopment site, I know Councilman Cashman played a big role in making sure that there'",
        "'speaker_2': 'was a very robust community engagement process that took months and months. Lots of meetings that took place at the school I attended several of them and staff from from CPD were involved in that process, you know, along with the developer who would bring updated details of what was being proposed at the site that required a rezoning.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We've had lots of big parcels that have been resolved in the guests area, in the downtown area. You know, we've got a football stadium. We've got a number of big projects that are coming along, the 825 corridor. So some.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'How do you all sort of decide what that process looks like? Is it based on the size of the parcel? Is it based on the size of the development? Because some developments can be vertical and be as big as some projects that take up more, you know, landmass, but may have an equal or lesser number of of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'units on larger, larger parcels. So can you just give me an idea of how those are looked at? So first, the question is to CPD them to host in terms of the role you play in that process.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I'll take a stab at that. I haven't been with the city for that long, so I'll call on Kyle or Sara to augment my answer if I don't hit on some of it. But we have been more recently doing an equity analysis on sites that are five acres and bigger, where we look at a number of'",
        "'speaker_5': 'factors related to vulnerability to displacements, access to opportunity and increasing housing and employment opportunities and the rezoning that's going on in the rest of the Navajo Market, because that does cover close to 13 acres that walks through that entire equity analysis and categorizes where these sites fall within those three equity concepts.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'With these smaller sites. Since this one is one and a half acres, we have considered whether or not we should start doing that more of an equity analysis on this. But so far, we look at we look at the plans, we look at the maps, including the recently developed tracking vulnerability to displacement map, to get a general'",
        "'speaker_5': 'idea as to what's going on in the area. And quite frankly, five points is categorized as less vulnerable. Whereas gee, as an Elyria swamps, you are very vulnerable to displacement. The socioeconomic factors within five points are quite a bit different.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. And then I want to focus for just a minute on open space. So when you look at the de narco market property, the entirety of what made up the narco market area. How did CPB decide that? Instead of looking at the area in its entirety and trying to figure out how much open space was needed in'",
        "'speaker_2': 'general, CPD allowed it to be piecemeal in terms of the development. And that, I think, really did a disservice to the amount of open space that we would have otherwise been able to see developed on the site.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I don't know that. I don't know Kyle or Sarah. Either one of you could speak to that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And this isn't this isn't isolated to this property. We've been seeing this happen with some of the other larger sized developments where, you know, their master planned, but yet they are allowed to be sort of piecemeal in terms of the rezonings that happen.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They come at different times. It's not like one massive rezoning that looks at, you know, different scales in different locations. They're all sort of piecemeal. I think this lone flake property was an example of of where some of that happened.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It didn't all get resolved all at once. So I'm just curious how you all are making those judgment calls where by doing it that way, I think we're shortchanging how we address the need and the demand for open space in our city as well.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Sure I can speak to that. Evening, sir.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hi, Sarah.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So, you know, it's I can't speak as much as some of the things that have happened in the past, but currently it's one of the reasons why we have the large development review and ADR process is so for larger redevelopment areas, we can have a conversation around whether there is a minimum requirement for open space for sites'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that are five acre or larger to have at least 10%. So no matter what, that's going to apply to the large site. But then we can also talk about whether there are some qualitative aspects we want to add on beyond just quantity or even additional quantity for for large areas for this area.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'As would be noted, there is a general development plan which was our, our older flavor of doing LDR. Now you have these larger sites where you need to coordinate development that would specifically look at open space. And when you see that rezoning that's been mentioned a couple of times now that's associated with that, you'll see that open'",
        "'speaker_3': 'space has been one of the major components that we're coordinating there. But for this particular site, it's small enough that it didn't trigger any of those bigger conversations.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Thank you. I had one other question that I wanted to ask, and I think what I'll do is allow my colleagues I see we've got some others that are are plugged in. And so maybe I'll just get back in the queue as a president if nobody else ever asks that question.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sounds good. Councilman Ortega, thank you. Up next, we have Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Madam Prince. I want to follow up on the on Councilwoman Ortega's conversation a little bit, because I sometimes my observation is that if we build more density, we increase displacement and gentrification, but if we don't build any density, we also increase displacement and gentrification.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So it's like, what do you do? Everything you do makes seems to make the problem worse. But when I look at this site, Libby and maybe Sara also and also Deborah. I look at this site and I'm looking at the map right now.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It is completely isolated from Globeville. You can't get there from here sort of thing. You got the river. You got the Burlington Northern Yard. The massive railroad yard. You got the Park Avenue Viaduct, I-25 in some places and into the south, even to get to five points.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Although this is in the five points neighborhood, you can't get to five points. It's about a mile and a half away. It's over under the Broadway subway. You got to cross the U.P. and the RTD main lines for the A-line.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And it's in an area that's completely industrial. So we're displacing no one here. And so I'm having trouble understanding the theory that adding density here will cause displacement in Globeville or Elyria, Swansea that are so disconnected from this submarket.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Can one of you explain? RC Actually, I know Irene Aguilar is in the audience too, so I don't know who would be best to answer that. Lydia, Do you want to take a crack at it first?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah. And this is, as you noted, certainly an island that is surrounded by a lot of barriers where those impacts to displacement may not be direct. But I think that there's a fear that by creating more of these high end apartment homes, the the median income value of five points is going to go up.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And that's going to create more pressure on Globeville and Elyria. Swansea, where they're concerned that their property taxes might increase, their property values might increase, and eventually they won't be able to afford their own homes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Mm hmm. Okay. I see Senator Aguilar has come in. Kyle Dalton's face just popped up on my screen to a kind of someone to help me understand this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Got everybody here for you?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Somebody help me understand this. Damned if we do and damned if we don't. Argument for displacement. Irene. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Members of council.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So let me address as I think the the biggest concern here, which is that when you build upscale housing, there is sort of a trickle out effect on pricing. And there are some recent studies that show that you can see that happen.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I think the other thing that is that the community is concerned about here is whether the return on jobs is the same as what potentially could be held. And that's looking at it from an economic prosperity point of view.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I think the broader thing that most I shouldn't say this, I don't know what people who testified here today are thinking about. But one broader question that this always brings is that there isn't that much undeveloped land in Denver.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And in some ways it's just an opportunity lost in terms of where could you put affordable housing in Denver? But I think based on what we have right now in our zoning code and ordinances, this is actually a pretty good deal, is the best we could get based on our current law in the city.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so I think that addresses sort of where the concerns come from.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Thank you. I don't know, Sara, Deborah, Kyle, anyone else have anything to contribute to that answer that is that pretty much covered?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The only thing that I would say about this project is and it's proximity to to to Globeville and to downtown is, you know, it's on the edge. I mean, we look at it as an opportunity to house people who work downtown so, you know, minimize their their travel and, you know, the need for vehicles.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And, you know, you can walk everywhere downtown. But there are so many places where people work downtown, but they can't live anywhere close by. So that was kind of our approach. And we're we're. Anticipating that through the development.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I don't remember if she said this or not. There are lots of jobs that are that are created through the construction and then into even the operation of the property. You know, I can't speak to what types of jobs those are, but those are some of the way that that we approach this.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Thank you, Deborah. Libby I'm flipping through the slides from the presentation. This area, the growth area strategy here is that this will supply 15% of new housing growth in the city and 5% of new employment in this future growth area.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Is that I read that correctly.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So how does eliminating the industrial zoning, how does that contribute or damage the prospects for a 5% increase in employment?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That. And I can't say specifically how many jobs this site would add and how that is kind of dispersed across this entire growth area that applies to the entire city. But I'd say more so it's driving up the amount of people who can live in this area as well that could provide employees to future jobs.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then also, it's not just about this site as well with that vacant land that's northeast of Tanaka and Del Gagne. If that's free zone, that actually anticipates significant more commercial developments than what would be at this site, the 5800 square feet of commercial space.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'At this one, the applicant anticipates providing maybe seven jobs.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Thank you. Yeah, there used to be a lot of jobs down here. I think the family of one of my kid's grade school teachers had one of those produce outlets down there for many, many years in.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The old narco market.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Came in on refrigerated train cars, things like that. Last question, Libby, I guess, for you is what's being proposed here seems to fit exactly with all the planning that's been put in place. Right. It's high residential.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's it's it's it's mixed use that fits. And it seems to me that a lot of people who have testified here, actually their argument is with the plans that have been put in place over the years. And I'm wondering if you could opine on that for a second, that what is what what we're really arguing for here'",
        "'speaker_6': 'is to redo the plans to take out this kind of high density, because when we've spent, you know, Blueprint Comp, Plan River North and we've planned for this, when the opportunity comes along, we have people saying we don't want it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So please applying for me on that. What are your thoughts? And in other words, are we arguing more to redo the plans and lower the projected density? Or. Or is there a way to argue that this does not meet the criteria?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Because what you've presented seems pretty clear that it does.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I appreciate that. And like I said, we try to be as objective as possible when we're looking at comparing any rezoning requests with these plans. And does it fit or doesn't it fit? And so I certainly believe that my analysis leads to this does fit the plans.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It does meet the consistency criteria. Now, what.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'About in other words, it fits. But a substantial number of people are arguing that they don't want it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Right. Right. And I don't know if that means that we need to go back when there was that few years of extensive public input put into these plans. But obviously.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You're not going to please everybody everywhere either, right?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes. All right. Deborah and Kyle, people are. Madam President, can I ask if any of the other planners or Deborah have a comment on that? Sarah. Sarah.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. I just wanted to speak very, very briefly to the alignment of the affordable housing goals from the from the city perspective. And Mr. Hill spoke to what he would pay from a linkage fee. And we know that that linkage fee ordinance in that ordinance, it requires 80% area median income housing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So, you know, this one, they reached a little deeper and and hit the 60% mark. Which which is great. Would we want deeper? Absolutely. But it but it is difficult from an economic feasibility perspective to achieve that. I know that they did make an offer to reach deeper all the way down to 30%, but of course, that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'results in fewer units. So but this does me what is required in the ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. In other words, we could ask for 20%, 30%, 50%. But it couldn't be built.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Through.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Without. Without a lot of your money.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah. And I guess I would speak to that as well. Is that the money that we earn through the linkage fee and through property tax and all of the sources that have come together to create our funding, our funding sources, is that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Those funds are then used for the affordable housing developers who focus all of their attention on creating 100% of affordable housing. So we do not have funds to subsidize the market rate developers might see. And as they do, that's why we call it voluntary.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Right now. Thank you, Madam President. That's all I have.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilman. Councilman Sandoval.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Madam President. I have a couple questions, so I have a couple of questions for CPB. We were talking about our large development review process and our ADR. And we've had these conversations about five acres, whether that should be the trigger or not.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yet. There has been some discussions throughout the city and on planning board. If five acres is the actual correct criteria because we're talking about putting like five acres would meet a certain criteria, but rezoning from industrial three storey zoning to 16 storey zoning.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Actually puts more strain on some infrastructure than the Audi process does. So my question about the Audi process. There's more. I know. Mr. Hill has been here for several reasons, and some of them are contiguous. They've just broken up.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'My personal. My personal. Why do we allow that? Why do we allow his former rezoning in the spring with next to this site? It was the it was the storage unit. How do we allow that? I mean, are we monitoring that?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Even though, yes, they're separate parcels and he would want to read them them separately. Are we sure we're not? How what would a trigger look like so that we could have them actually go through the process together? That makes sense.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You pick an input. I'm thrown down. It does make sense and I haven't worked on the LDR process and I don't know why Hill and his teammates have opted to purchase these kind of one by one. I think he could either speak to that or Kyle or Sara too, if you want to provide a little bit more'",
        "'speaker_5': 'context as to sort of that where that five acre threshold came from for LDR and whether or not there is a way that we could encourage developers to come to us more proactively with a longer term vision in their areas to do that equity analysis.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I can I can start and then I Disney record Africa is going to jump in there but to hear a little bit more about their approach here and Kyle please jump in because actually did a lot of the work around creating our new reality, our process.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If I get something wrong, please speak up. But yeah, you're you're definitely right, Councilwoman, that we've heard concerns about how do you get the right trigger for when you should be having these conversations about what's coordinated the developments area and we're certainly open to suggestions there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There are all kinds of ways that you can try to identify trigger for example, like if you have enough of a change in intensity or land use, for example, then perhaps that's enough. So it's not just about it could not be about the size at all.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's your point about a change significant enough from something like industrial to allowing a bunch of residential? So I think we're definitely open to having those conversations and learning from there really hasn't been that long that we've had the LDR process in place now.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So learning from it and looking for ways to reevaluate the triggers, we certainly, wherever we can encourage, try to look for these connections ourselves and encourage applicants to think about things comprehensively and not go side by side. But right now, under our current rules, there's nothing that precludes this applicant from from doing it that way.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I do think it'd probably be good to give up a chance to, to talk maybe a little bit about how your approach here.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You bet they do, Sarah. And then your councilwoman cannonball to your question. So we have done a number of reasons recently. Let me just go through each quickly to clarify. So the two phase deal that we did agree, agreement with hosts in Colorado and Evans or Evans not to five, but four.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That was five and a quarter acres over the threshold. We actually did a good neighbor agreement and a development agreement with the city whereby we committed to more open space, a 20,000 square foot pocket park and a total of 32,000 square feet of publicly accessible private open space that was above and beyond what the LDR process required'",
        "'speaker_1': '. And we did that voluntarily. Then D.A. got a three or four rezoning. There was a period a few months ago where it was kind of a lot like an adjustment and a cleanup. Those two parcels together represented the exact same time and it was still below the five acre threshold.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So those were simultaneous free zones. But this this free zone and the one adjacent that was denied it back in March. You're right, those were two separate reasons. The reason for that is we tied up the first site, started the new zone process for 6 to 9 months into that process when this current owner approached us and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'said, you know, basically you're buying our neighbor, we'd be interested in selling as well. So we had a separate process, 6 to 9 months behind with two different owners. But one one more thing to point out, we were the original buyer and the master developer that's in our market area.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we did do and what the new developer has to do it and also show us there is an application coming up. They still have to do the river activation and public open space along the river that we committed to back in 2007.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So that green space will be part of their development but benefit all those around, including us. And then our green space here. The 10,000 square feet that runs along the Navajo is a continuation of that green space that goes all the way down to the river.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yep. All right, so I. I understand. And thank you for that answer. I understand. But I still don't understand how, even though they're nine months apart, when I'm thinking about land use, I'm thinking about seven generations. I'm not thinking about nine months.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Nine months is a drop in the hat, with all due respect. So the fact that these two parcels together could have gone to an Aldi ah process. It means a lot to me. It really does. It just you just get different outcomes when you go through more of a public process.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So my next question is when you. Is there a way that maybe this could be for hosted applicants? It says in the packet, I can't see anything where the development agreement is signed. Is it signed or. Everything that I've read says it will be signed.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I don't understand. It will be signed. Is it signed or is it not signed?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I mean, this is Andrew from Host. And the if you're talking about the voluntary affordable housing agreement, it has been executed by the developer. So we do have that agreement executed by the developer pending a positive outcome tonight vowed and we would complete the city side signature to complete the execution.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then did they get recorded on the title?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It does get recorded against the land. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. So if they sold, it would still run concurrent with the land? Correct.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. So I have a couple more questions. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh. Did you have a couple more questions yet? Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Go ahead. No, that's.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. My family will keep my version working for you. Yeah, well, you gotta. You gotta be careful. Oh, sorry about that. So. One other question. So there was a comment made earlier by one of my colleagues that says this site couldn't be developed if you had 50% affordable.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I just want to know, in your opinion, to the applicant and now I know, I understand I absolutely understand that I may be asking questions that are not relevant to the criteria, but I do feel it is our job at City Council to ask questions that are get around a well-rounded idea of the proposal in front'",
        "'speaker_5': 'of us. So although some of my questions may not pertain directly to the five criteria we are asking we are required to vote on, this is our only opportunity as council members to ask questions. So with that, Mr. Hill, have you is it your.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Business. Two. Do you are you a land long term landholder? So oftentimes I'll give you a reframe my question. Often times developers come into neighborhoods, they buy the property, they resell them, they build them, and then they sell them to for profit entities and they sell them off.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Do you do that or are you a long term landholder? What's the longest one long term land that you've held?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. Great question, Councilman Sandoval. Typically, we stretch for investments for ten plus years. So this is a ten year investment. Could be longer, but we go into this for ten years. There are some comments made by some figures that we're out of town.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'As I mentioned in my opening remarks, I live a mile from the park. Well, I walk my two year old down river. So this is close to home for me. It's a ten year investment. Long term is all relative, and that might not seem to matter to some.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And it does for others. But this is on a ten plus year investment. It'll take that long to get through the multiple phase redesign. And keep in mind, the original investment goes back to 2007 and we're still active building across the street today, 13 years later.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I would consider us long term. Yes. And I think you had a question about the amount of affordability or not. I don't want to miss your question.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So there was a comment saying that you couldn't be it you wouldn't there wouldn't be a project if you had to do deeper affordability. And I can say my my comment for my comment question, but I believe there is a way to do more, deeper, more affordability.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It just means you don't make as much profit for people first. You put people over profit. So is that accurate or not? It's it's all like a business, like. Right. My family's in the family making business. We have to sell them for a certain amount to make profit.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So but you are in the business of building buildings and making a profit, correct?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes, I'm in the for profit business. It's not it's not a nonprofit, but it's a great question. Councilman, thank you for asking. At the end of the day, we do have to raise capital for the city to get it built.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have to raise debt financing from a lender that expects their money back, plus interest as well as equity. And those equity investors want a better return to the lender for the additional risk that they're taking. So the capital markets in this environment for urban infill are very challenging.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's very hard to raise revenue of capital right now. So it's not a matter of making less money. It's getting the project off the ground. If you can't build it, there's no money to be made. And we push this to the absolute brink of financial viability and economic feasibility.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's unfortunate that because it's highrise, they cost 40,000 to build. So it's 20 million, but that's the reality of it. I would also point out it's just a small parcel which just over an acre and it's a triangle, so you kind of have to lop off the corners and then you got 10,000 square feet of open green'",
        "'speaker_1': 'space and you have less than an acre of usable land. So, you know, I agree completely recognize that there is a need for deeper affordability, more of it across this entire metro. But we feel it's a good contribution to the city's affordable housing needs.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we hope this leads directly to others in the area doing similar where we see we could soon see hundreds of units available to states in minus meter.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. One last question. Do you feel that COVID has changed your profit margin, like your performance? Is that what you said, a comment earlier when you were answering this question and you said that it stretched? Do you do you feel that because COVID has I believe COVID has impacted all of us.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'None of us have been not impacted. Has it impacted your profitability or your performance in these type of projects?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Absolutely. Without a doubt. Metroliner down by 10% and your reports are down. More occupancies around the common earlier, about 20,000 available units. I think that's right. And the way I'm getting there is that current vacancy in Denver across the entire city is 7%.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There's 250,000 apartments in Denver. 7% of 250 is 17,500. So I think we do have those 20,000 vacant units. So, yes, profit margins are down, rents are down, occupancy were down. And that's all the more reason that it's going to be very challenging to capitalize this project.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We're hopeful we can do it, but I know that by pledging 50% affordable to 30 to 50% am I, as was requested by the U.S. coalition, unfortunately, I would not be able to do that to build that project.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The capital markets are not there for that depth and that amount of affordability. Especially for.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The youth. Think of then president.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Sandoval. Councilwoman CdeBaca.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Madam President. Can you move over, Erika Reiter? No, let me go. And Alfonso Espino. Yep. We should go ahead. This first question is for Erica writer. Erica, can you tell me what the impact your perception of the impact of these decisions on single parent families and their kids about what is affordable?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Uh oh. I'm going to let.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'My daughter, who has been.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Waiting for hours to stay, her piece about how this kind of project would affect a family like ours. My name is Mays Ramirez. My name is Mae Ramirez, and I'm eight years old. I am against the zoning. I want my leaders to care more about people, not buildings.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'What happened to the homeless people who were made to leave? This is not how people should be treated. Kids are also leaders. Please vote no on this. We are all watching. We are all part of this community. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. Now for Nola. Nola, can you talk a little bit about equitable, equitable development and what you believe is needed in this neighborhood from developers and perhaps what you asked for from this developer and where there was an inability to.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Come to some agreement. Sure. I think one thing, if it's okay, if starting with this is that what we've been missing out of this entire analysis and conversation is an is an actual look at what is happening with displacement.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And unfortunately, we don't have that analysis. You all don't have that analysis to look at. But there should be measurements that look at both the data points of vulnerability, like we mentioned, but also even at the change over time when you have extreme amounts of change and this is something that other cities are using, I sent host'",
        "'speaker_5': 'of Income Risk Index that they're using in L.A. and that's the type of thing that you could look at, where you would both the extreme changes that are happening in particular areas like these, and also points of vulnerability, like the amount of renters and the amount of rent burden in those incidents.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I just wanted to say that because what those types of what that type of analysis could do is look at the all of the changes that are happening in the area. Right. So so guess in specific in some ways that it doesn't have protected affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we have very, very little protected affordable housing. You know, we have three units in the field. Those are affordable housing that's protected to put deed restricted, affordable housing. We have very little of there are some scattered sites.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There's some habitat units where they could repurchase the homes. But there's very, very little deed, restricted affordable housing, which means that everything is vulnerable. All all the people's homes, the residential.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Homes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Are vulnerable. And we know that nine out of ten of our neighbors are at risk of displacement.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I would say during the pandemic.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's it's everyone and every single person that we talked to, our most recent survey was rent burden. And 89% of those people were heavily rent burdened, meaning they're paying over 50% of their income on rent, which is an impact major impact health.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But getting back to what some maybe equitable things that could be done with the developer, with a private developer or an affordable housing developer could be things like income sharing. One thing that we talked about was ongoing a way to ongoing share that income of.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The project with.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The neighborhood. That was something that they weren't willing to look into more.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They offered us a $5,000 contribution defense fund. That just wasn't.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Enough. And we know that to address the impacts that are happening. All right. What about community land trust?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Where part of the land.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And that also wasn't an option we brought up in in our last meeting. Again, did not have extensive conversations. We didn't have the time to do that. But on a per market, a per market unit impact fee, we again didn't get there with that once.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'What about working with affordable housing developers, bringing in the types of partners that can acquire?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And as as.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Mr. Hill already said, that this wasn't a possibility for this for this project. I could talk more, if you want me to, about the protections that could be put in place by the city and so on. But oh, okay.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Can you actually speak to a couple of comments that were made? One comment was about the fact that this is a pretty isolated area, although it's been highly developed over the last few years. I think it's important to have a community perspective about how displacement is impacted or facilitated, even in areas where there is development of space'",
        "'speaker_5': 'that is not actually physically taking anybody's house away. So can you talk a little bit about that one? Do I mean to talk to or I'll get you another. How does displacement happen if they're not actually taking houses away from anybody?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So there's a something called price shadowing, which is when an area starts to feel the impacts of other developments, because not only does that development then brings more attention and demand in that area, but you start to see the impact to property valuation overall, which, as I said, 470%, we're already having huge amounts of change in that'",
        "'speaker_5': 'area and just we just can't take any more right now. There's so many pressures from so many angles and a 16 story rezoning just isn't what what needs to happen right now. But looking at not only the property value changing, the rent burden going up, you know, every every rental that you see is going to be, you'",
        "'speaker_5': 'know, in proximity to Reno, you know, like that that dynamic that is is a huge part of what's raising prices. And how about the comment that was made that, you know, there's really it's not really possible to do over 20% affordable housing in in a build like this.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Can you talk a little bit about that and what you know about what is possible? Well, I would say that that's not possible potentially in a 16 story building.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Because of the type of construction cost that that James was describing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So in my opinion, a smaller four or five storey zoning would facilitate affordable housing better. But, you know, we've worked with a lot of different types of developers. We've had some really exciting and creative conversations with.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Helpers.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That are happening that are interested in in community land trusts, in strategies, in impact, investing in different ways to try to figure this out, because we need that deeper affordability and we need ongoing ways to build the economy in in the areas that have been historically disinvested.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Nola. You might want to stand by, but that's it for my questions to you right now. My next questions are for CPD. The Rhino Plan doesn't actually call for this tall of a building. Can you explain how we got to 16 stories?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Right. As I mentioned, the run up plan did not specify the building height ranges that should be allowed in here. They did allude to the design standards and guidelines, but those actually applied just across the street from the nahco.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so then we had to look at our most recent guidance within Blueprint Denver, and that's where it calls for among the highest, tallest residential buildings within this future place.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Type and context.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so we we have we're not actually measuring this against the Rhino plan. It's somehow out of the boundaries of the Rhino plan. Is that accurate or. When you say across the standards don't apply until across the street?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'What do you mean? So let me clarify. This site absolutely does fall within the Rhino North neighborhood plan, but that didn't provide any guidance. And so it alluded to the rhino urban design standards and guidelines. But those don't.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Those don't impact this exact site, but impact pretty much everything else in the narco markets to the east. And so why would that have been left out of the plan? Is that an oversight or what was that about?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I don't know. Considering the plan was developed in 2003, I'm not sure why they left it that open. And so with the parts of the plan that do specify a building height, what is the tallest building height mentioned in the Rhino Plan?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Specifically to do Argo market. As I mentioned, it is not anywhere in the regular plan. I would have to look at the final plan. In order to find those other.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Mentions of heights.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In other areas outside of the narco market. Do you know of any other single building in the Reno area? That is 16 stories today? No. And can you explain to me how far outside of the 38th and Blake affordability overlay are we with the normal market?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I do not know specifically. I just know that that that in terms of hate overlay does not apply to this site. Do you know why? It just fell outside of the radius when that plan was developed. And how far is this from the 38th and Blake Station?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Let me pull.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Up a.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Map. Although I can say earlier from my report, we're about three quarters of a mile from the station itself. Right. So less than a mile away from the 38th and Blake Station where we designed an entire affordability overlay incentive to capitalize on TOD.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Not a single building that is 16 stories in the entire Reno area. The closest tall building is on the other side of the tracks in Union Station. Can you tell me about the. The building height for the river along the river in the rhino plan.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'What are the building heights allowed in the plan? Along the river. And which stretch of the river on the Arkansas side. And so with the narco market itself, since that's largely where my analysis was limited to the buildings along there are allowed to be only eight stories tall.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And. When you. So Councilman Flynn spoke to the building form and said this matches perfectly with the rhino plan. Even though the Rhino Plan building heights are not specified for this building, that would be the tallest building, double the height of the max building in all of Rhino.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'When he said that it complies even with one criterion of the five we're supposed to be considering tonight while it actually doesn't. Do these rezonings have to meet all five of the criteria or just one criteria? They absolutely have to meet all five of the criteria.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I don't think that Flynn was alluding to the River North Plan so much as that this meets the Blueprint Denver guidance regarding the future context, future place type and growth area strategy. I get that. But he was more alluding to criterion two and five, almost as if those were the only criterion that mattered.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And it's very strange that we don't have building heights for a development that is on the river. But I'll move on to my next piece. Can you tell me how CPD defines public health, public safety and welfare? And it can be fairly broad in interpretation for this.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We focused on the fact that this is adding sidewalks in an area that currently doesn't have them. It's adding trees. It's adding streetlights. That would create a more safe, walkable environment. It's also introducing affordable housing to the area, commercial space and jobs that will create more of a mix of uses in the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And it's complying with the green building ordinance that will add 5% greater energy efficiency than the building code requires. And then we often rely and tie that back to the fact that it's implementing adopted plans and is.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Associated with.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Various health goals within those plans. And so how do you also define community benefits in CPD? Those we don't necessarily define because we're not in charge of. Managing or implementing any kinds of community benefits agreements. That's something that is solely between developers and the communities and executed between those parties.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But we recently did pass two area plans on East, Central and East Area that highlighted community benefits as a prerequisite for of zoning. But we don't define them in CPD, is that correct? And I am not as familiar with those neighborhood plans and haven't had the opportunity to apply them to a rezoning.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So if they're included in those, then that's a step forward in the right direction for how we can help get those types of benefits with future rezonings. But CPD does not have a definition of community health, safety, welfare or benefits.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'If Kyler Sarah, if there's a spot that I'm missing here where we have a specific definition, please chime in.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm happy to try to jump in here. I'm Kyle Dalton with the Department of Community Planning and Development.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thanks for the question. We're tasked with reviewing an application, determining if it meets what's.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Required in the code language that Libby's outlined, as is the code language that applies. So I think Libby has accurately identified what we heard from the applicants and what we identified as why this application meets those criteria in the circumstance.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So public health, safety and welfare here is sidewalks, trees, street lights, commercial space housing and 49 affordable housing units.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I think Libby also mentioned its consistency with the adopted plans.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But not the plan of the area that it's in, which is the Rhino plan.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Again, we review the application against the review criteria and we found it was consistent with the review North.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. Can I get a host for my next questions?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mm hmm. They should already be on.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Host What are the current gaps in affordable housing in Denver? Like, what brackets of am I? Are we missing? And to what degree?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, I would direct everybody to the Department of Hosts dashboard, which gives you lots of detail. But I will say that the greatest need excuse me is that the 30% and below area, median income level, and that's where we devote most of our resources.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And specifically in our neighborhoods that are vulnerable to displacement. What is the bracket that's most needed in those neighborhoods?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, I would imagine that it would be the same. I mean, you know, under 30% area median income. Is anything.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'What. What is the amount of units that we need citywide in those and my brackets.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hang on. Have a sec. And I don't have those. Memorize. I'm pulling up our dashboard so tight with me for just a moment.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'While you pull that up, maybe you can answer this one. Was the community contacted during the negotiations with the developer so that host can understand the need of the neighborhood?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah. Well, we one of the very first questions that we always ask the developer is if they've made contact with the neighborhood. Like the community.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But a host.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But does host reach out to the community to discuss their needs with them directly before negotiating with the developer?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No, that's not part of of what we are we are charged to do. That is the developer's responsibility. So we encourage the developer to do that and we encourage the community to they they need to have a two way conversation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's where community benefit agreements are created. We're really not a party to those, but we just require that they do engage the community and have a meaningful conversation.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Does host recognize that there's a fundamental power imbalance in those kinds of negotiations?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. I you know, we do recognize that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And by not engaging the community or acting in accordance with what the community needs, is that equitable?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, it depends on how you're defining, equitable if you're talking about just one particular area. But, you know, I would remind you that we are charged with providing equitable equity across all of Denver. So we have to focus on opportunities that are in all of the different neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so when we're looking at those lower income populations, yes, we do. We do consider that we are looking for, you know, as deep affordability that we can achieve through those discussions. But we cannot mandate we I want to remind you that we cannot mandate what developers do.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We can encourage. We can negotiate. But but we cannot mandate.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But does host have to accept the voluntary units that are offered with your recommendation for a rezoning?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Do we have to accept what they what they what they offer? No, we don't have to accept it. However, without an affordable housing agreement in place, the project would not be without agreement. In principle, it cannot advance to the planning board without a signed agreement in place.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It does not advance here to council.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So a signed agreement is essentially an endorsement from host.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It is an acknowledgment that we have agreed to the ability that we think can be achieved through this project.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But not that host has actually engaged with the community or met community need.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know, that's not that's not with as I said, it's not within our purview to. We can't we can't mediate the negotiation with the with the community. We can't we can't mandate what the developer is doing as a result of what the community is requesting.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We can only negotiate with what we can do within the parameters of what the ordinance requires and try to encourage that to be as low as possible so that it does meet the community needs.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so what does inform your understanding of community needs when you guys are negotiating on behalf of a community?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean, there there are community. There's data on the community. And let me I did pick up. Let me see if I get it. The units. Before I go there, I just want to make sure I don't forget this part.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The percentage of households that are cost burdened in the 0 to 30%, which includes homeless, is 86%. And that that's 2019 figures. So the number of units that that represented in 2018 was 38,000 all households, 44,000. And that's just in that area that that median income bracket.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So in all households in in Denver, there are 167 households with 105 Casper and we have about 24,000 units that are income restricted with. Looks like about 2000 of those meeting meeting that need we have to chip in to chip away at it a little bit at a time.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So that's a good start. Add an analysis. Have you all as host done an analysis of the impact to involuntary displacement of this development?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I have not.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I understand that. What is your understanding of the potential indirect? Impacts, negative impacts of this development.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, what everybody has spoken to today, you know, but there are you know, there are economic impacts. I mean, any development that occurs, not just this one, is going to have an economic impact in to to the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It also has the economic input impact to two elevators in Denver just as a city. So it depends on on where you are in that continuum. But I would also remind you that that the city in host does focus our effort across that continuum.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So while there is a huge need and we do devote, I think I said earlier, 58% of our resources toward the 30% and below area median income households. We do also have an obligation to hit the households better in the 31 to 80 and the homeownership as well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we have to balance all of our resources and we have limited resources. So the way that those 30% units are achieved is through the affordable housing developments that occur using low income housing tax credits, because the way that those tax credits work is they bring in lots of free money.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So those investors put money in upfront and they that's the way that the projects work. They have very little net. When you have very little debt, you can make really low in low rent.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I just have one last question for you. Yes. Is this project meeting any of the gaps that we have in that 30% and my bracket?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It is not because I believe that the the developer offered those, but they were insufficient for what your request was.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. Can I speak to Chase now? Can you tell us, Chase, what the value is of this land with what is currently on it?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You mean can you clarify the question of what the value is at 16 sort zoning or the value is as a vacant warehouse?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'How about both?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm not I'm not in the business of valuing industrial real estate. But I think your point is that it's worth a fraction of what it would be worth, which seems to presume.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And was there a real give and take with guys, coalition and or residents in this neighborhood?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. Thank you, Councilman. Great question. I'm glad you asked it. We included in your your package a letter that was issued on December 9th that outlines our communication goes back to May of this year. So for seven months, unfortunately, we could not find common ground.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We tried, but the give and take was was very evident. So let me quickly walk you through how that went. So starting in May and looking at where we are now over countless Zoom calls, emails, etc., we increased and increased our affordable housing by 50% from 10% to 15%.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We proposed the Community Benefits Agreement that, in addition to offering that affordable housing provided eight economic and non-economic concessions, that CBA is included in the package as well. So I won't we do that. We also explored deeper affordability because we were told 60 to 80 that nobody in the D.C. neighborhoods would qualify for this experience.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we we proposed 30 to 50% and it was only 21 units. It wasn't as much, but we offered 21 affordable units in the 30 to 50% range. And we came back a few years, as recently as two weeks ago and offered them 21 units of 32, 50 or 49 and 60 to 80, and they accepted neither'",
        "'speaker_1': 'one, unfortunately. And, you know, they had always kind of dug in on the 50% at 30 to 50. And then in our call last week was the first to progress away from that stance. And it was mentioned that 40% at the full range of amenities, which I assume means to the 90, would be something they would consider'",
        "'speaker_1': 'or I don't want to I don't want to speak for no other. You can kind of jump in. But another offer was, I believe, 20%, 30 to 50 plus profit share where we gave profits in the units to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'For more affordable housing and obviously no as onerous. You can see for yourself that we unfortunately never came. Never found common ground as a bridge too far. And we just couldn't quite get there.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So your offer did not change. Regardless of the options put on the table.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'No, that's respectfully, councilman. That's not what I said. We're all for change materially. 50 over 50%. So originally offered 10% affordable. We increased that 50% to 15%. We then offered 21 units at 30 to 50, Amy, which is the Amish range they requested.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We then offered a CVA, so we did it and we did it. I don't think it's fair to say that we did not move off of our original stance and but they dug in until as recently as two weeks ago on the 50% at 3250.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Amy And that's what we could not commit to.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so what made you go with the higher AMI bracket versus the deeper affordability for your final offer?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah, that's a great question. Gasol So you have to remember too that there's there were many different organizations in our lives that we were discussing this free zone with. So we reach out to 13 different RINO's and neighborhood educator organizations of the 13 eight engaged in that with us.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Of those eight seven issued letters of support. So GSA is one of those eight. What we heard from the most is organizations, many of which spoke tonight was that they were focused on the amount of affordability. So they wanted 15% of a 16 story building because they got 49 units, whereas the GSA coalition was finding 5 to'",
        "'speaker_1': '8 story zoning, even if it meant 50 units or 80 units, and they might only get 12 affordable units. And there's no right or wrong. It's just a difference of opinion. But the other groups have supported us, one, and we're focused more on the aggregate amount and number of units.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So 15% of a 16 story building is more than 50% of the five story building. And so we were focused on maximizing the amounts, hence the 15%. And that garnered a lot of support in the community outside. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Are any of the other organizations that support the work involved in equitable development or the equity plan in the neighborhood?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Gosh, the 13 hour news and neighborhoods issues. I can't tell you the mandates or mission statements of all 13, to be honest. I think you'd have to reach out to them individually or.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Nola, can you speak to that? So I mean, I think evident in the amount of support for this project was that none of the people that wrote these letters actually came tonight. Most of the the so and is the only R.A. that's of the neighborhood and.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They also had a lot of questions that I never saw answers to from the developer. And they had they actually wrote the letter for the previous reason and didn't engage in these conversations at all. They were really interested in benefits for garden place for the school, the elementary school, and Globeville.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I believe there was some sort of agreement about the pickleball court on the last and maybe a donation of some sort was made to the school. So that was that interest. Both the Business Association and I don't know who the other supporters were, but they have stayed very neutral.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They don't want to be involved. And I've spoken to members of all of those organizations.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Don't agree with that decision because a full, equitable analysis and process was not done. You know, it takes, you say, countless emails. Okay. But, you know, there weren't that many emails. How many emails do we do all the time?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We actually had meetings and two meetings with you guys. I mean, that that's not an equitable process and we just touch the surface that the amount of people that have been involved in that process for the Reno Arts District was involved in the in the last meeting that that that consequence they sponsored.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And, you know, they have a lot of questions as well. And I just don't think we're at the point through an actual, equitable, equitable process to get to the place where we're this is a good land use. Alfonso, my final two questions are for you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'How would you, as a resident of this neighborhood, characterize or describe the negotiation process between the community and the developer? And do you believe that the asks of the community were unreasonable?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. So to the first question, as NOLA already said, there was actually only. To. A 1 to 1 an hour conversation that actually happened between the Coalition and our development committee, which is made up of residents and other neighborhood organizations.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There's only two that actually ever happened. The rest of endless communication that Mr. Chase is willing to is simple email communication, which I'm sure anybody is used to and would not consider that an actual thorough conversation. It doesn't merit the word, and I think that's what it should have been.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, it was something that was engaging us in a true way. As Mr. Hill has already said, we were always a bridge too far for them. Right. And I think part of the reason for that is because of negligence on the side of host who is currently taking a neutral stance by saying that they didn't engage in'",
        "'speaker_1': 'any conversations around what is the actual need in our community because they want the developer to do that. But if they came to that agreement, which they did before we ever engage in those conversations that they say they recommend, they were.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Putting us in a very tough position that undermined any process that would have seen a positive outcome. So having to face that, you know, it's difficult to even call those two brief conversations that we actually had as very genuine, the nothing really ever moved.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So yeah.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And and real quick, is this the largest development, either Noella or Alfonso? You can you can respond. The largest development that you all have dealt with in your your work in the community. The the Clayton Street 4041 Clayton.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Was is larger that was.'",
        "'speaker_5': '700 units.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But as was testified, it's been sitting.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There for years. Got it. Thank you. That's it for my questions. Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilwoman CdeBaca.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Councilman Hines.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Madam President. I want to thank my colleagues for asking a lot of the questions that I had already. So and I want to thank all of our staff and all the people who have been here tonight.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So great questions. Great answers. I want to ask maybe host just to get a little bit of context. The housing market took off in 2013. Am I right about that here? And that's before host was in existence as a as an entity.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But was it about 2013 2014 and my when the ballpark at least.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'About 2012 it started improving in 2012.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Before 2012, did Denver have an affordable housing crisis?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Oh, yeah. Denver has always had an affordable housing crisis.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I mean, I started in. Amanda Sandoval, well, will attest that my very first nonprofit job was working for her mother and doing an inner city neighborhood revitalization and affordable housing. And that was that was a long time ago.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So so we've had we've had an issue for a bit since the beginning of Denver, I suppose. Is there a city that we should be modeling? I mean, is there in the US? I know that there are different governments outside the US that make that model a little different, but is there a US city there that we'",
        "'speaker_1': 'should be modeling that that I should be doing a lot of research on to make sure that I understand how they're doing it right.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We've actually just recently last year, I guess completed a peer cities study that and it's kind of all related to the linkage fee and, you know, zoning incentives and things like that. But we researched our consultants, researched numerous different municipalities across the country, settled on five, and some of them are similar to what we're doing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Some of them have affordable housing issues that are worse than ours, you know, like San Francisco, things like that. Places like that. I think we did a can't remember Pittsburgh or pencil are Philadelphia. I think we looked at it Austin and I'm forgetting the other two right now.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But but yes, the answer is we are outreaching to that. I just finished a series of meetings this past week with poor cities across the nation, like numerous cities across the nation that are, you know, having dealing with affordable housing and trying to collaborate on solutions that work in one area another.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So it's kind of like a roundtable discussion where we share ideas. So happy to get you the other cities and let you know a little bit about what what we've found. I don't I don't have them in my memory.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So that's fine. But but there isn't a city in the US that has no affordable housing issue and is also a desirable city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah, not. Not to my knowledge.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. The last question that I have is, should we be, if we're lucky, to get the Colorado General Assembly to change the Telluride decision? Is the city of Denver working now to determine what our how we might incorporate that change?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Into our affordable housing strategy.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We are. We have been having a discussions. We've got stakeholder stakeholders that we're meeting with. We put a temporary hold on a lot of those discussions, but for a variety of reasons, including COVID and and staff capacity, capacity as a result of COVID and things like that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But. But yeah, we have been working all of last year and it's a high priority for us in the coming year to address that. And yeah, if the news that I hear is that it sounds positive and what that, what that will, you know, it will result in legislation that will help us create a minimum standard for'",
        "'speaker_2': 'what we can ask developers for. I think we're the we as a city will have some work to do about figuring out exactly what all of the the details are to that. But yes, the answer to your question is yes, efforts are underway.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good. I'm happy to hear that, because while that may not directly impact this rezoning, why it sounds like Mr. Hill is interested in an additional development in the city, and so I and certainly the other developers. So thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Hines and Councilwoman Ortega. I want to check with you if it's okay. I'm going to go to Councilman Kinney. We haven't heard from her yet tonight. All right, Councilwoman Canete.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thanks, Madam President. To answer a question I wasn't asked, I've seen the best practice research on Inclusionary since I've been working on it for many, many years. There's not a city in America that has a policy that goes above 20%.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Just to be clear, most are between ten and 15% because of economic feasibility. And so my questions are going to touch on that a little bit in a minute. But first, I want to give Deborah, who's just a moment, if she would like to correct something she said.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Deborah, you mentioned that if there's not a build alternative agreement, the project doesn't get to keep going. It doesn't get to go to, as you know, the planning board or council. But that's not exactly what the law says.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I just want to be clear. If there's not a build agreement, then what happens under the law?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'True. And you probably have to supplement this, you know, with with my limited knowledge here, less than a year. But it does go and it's presented. But then the planning board, I believe, has to decide whether or not they want to advance it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so that's yeah, that's I don't know if the staff wants to speak to it. The law allows developers to pay a fee. That's the short story. Oh, yeah. I just want to be really clear that the law does not require a build alternative plan.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It allows that. But if a developer doesn't have that, the law requires one very simple thing, and that's not up to the planning board. I just want to be really clear. The law has and so let's I just want to get the record straight.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's fine. I appreciate that. And and I guess I misunderstood your question because I thought, you know, we had discussed earlier that there are opportunities to pay the fee, do the build alternative or, you know, do the of the voluntary.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Those are the three options.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So and I just want to because, you know, Councilwoman Sade Abarca asked you a question and she said, what if host didn't think the plan was good enough? What if you said you've offered us to build this many units and host said, we don't think that plan is good enough?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Your answer implied that the project would be stopped and that's not the way that it works. So I just want to get back one final time here so that everyone's on the same page.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah. My apologies. It is. I mean, people and when we talk to developers, you know, we tell them you've got three options. And our very first initial meeting, we lay that out and, you know, you can pay the fee.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And as as Mr. Hill indicated on this particular project, it's like $600,000, which doesn't you know, it barely creates one unit. Or they can do the build alternative, which is a calculation that in this particular instance creates five units, and those are all automatically at 80% area median income.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Or they can choose to negotiate with us. And, you know, the way that we presented is you can help us achieve our affordable housing goals in Denver by engaging in these conversations with us and demonstrating your commitment by doing, we always start with 15%.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Sometimes you end up with that. So, so, so we're very clear if host decided this plan wasn't good enough for yourselves or for the community, you do not have the power to stop the project. Neither does the planning board.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I just want to make sure that record is super clear. Yeah, I think the question.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Is that when it comes to planning board, planning board does ask is there an affordable housing agreement in place?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Right. So thank you for that. Rick Banks, I want to ask you, you've got a lot of experience in this field. What's the amount of subsidy required to get a unit to 80% of am I to get a unit to 50% of am I to get a unit to 30% of am i i in dollars?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Uh.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh, gosh.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And he just turned his camera on. He's going to he's going to he's you can phone a friend. It's 1030. So right after I got my you know.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The reason that I'm the reason I'm.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Struggling with this a little bit is because.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think of it in terms of the projects that we fund. So the city of Denver provides get financing and we provide only a portion.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Of that gap is the state. I want the whole what's the whole what how much you know it costs X amount to build to get it down to the same level is a total amount of subsidy. We you're right we only provide one piece that subsidy.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Andrew where where are you jumping in to help?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I was going to my internet timed out.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The but I can tell.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You the difference between for instance, a 80% Army unit would be 1800 dollars of maximum rent per month.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I don't think that's what she's asking. Now.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm I'm frankly asking like a unit costs between 250 and $400,000 to build, depending on the construction type in order to buy down the rent to that unit. Developers typically figure out what the subsidy per unit is. So in in tax credit projects, it might be $150,000 per unit.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I mean, I can throw out some numbers that I've heard, but if some you know, if you'd like to if you guys don't have it, it's okay, right?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I don't have it off the top of my head. But I will say that I think you heard Mr. Hill say that his particular units are costing 400,000 per unit, but the subsidy, the cost for an affordable housing unit is probably somewhere between 180 and $200,000, just just to construct that unit.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so when you're talking about the amount of subsidy required, it's going to depend on how big that project is. So say you have a 37, $37 million project you're going to be getting, you know. 7 to $10 million in tax credit equity.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You're going to come in with.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I don't want to take us. Yeah, it's okay if you don't have the number, but it's $5 million. Sorry. I'm going to cut you off if you don't have it. Let's just. Let's just go with this. Does it take more subsidy to get a unit affordable to 30% of BMI than it does to 80% of BMI?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. Yes. And where does the subsidy come from in this type of a project?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In this project. It comes from the developer's pocket.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, let's be more specific. What? What, what? What money is coming into the developer's pocket? What subsidizes the affordable units?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We don't subsidize that affordable unit in with a dime.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But when money comes into the project, it comes in for the market rate units. Right. So the market rate units are what subsidizes the affordable units? Yes, absolutely. Okay. So if there are fewer market rate units, what does that do to the amount of subsidy available for the affordable units?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, there's not as much.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. So I just I want to describe because one of the things that's playing out in the question and answer as well as the testimony is two issues, which is, one, what does the community need to what could this project deliver?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Right. There is a question underlying a lot of my colleagues previous questions about feasibility. Is it feasible to do what the community needs? Right. And I think that in order to do that. So let me just say, what's the typical number of units in a five story building?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I mean.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'On an affordable it could be anywhere from if it's a tax credit project, it's going to be about between 60 and 80.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Units. So what? So if we have 60 to 80 units and we wanted half of them to be affordable, we'd have, you know, 30 units, let's just say. But you'd only have 30 market rate units to subsidize them.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Right. Am I doing my math? Right?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You would just have to have really high, high, high rents to subsidize them, depending on what area median income you're trying to achieve.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The questions I'm asking are intended to show the math that has to happen in these projects, right, where there's no public subsidy. So now I want to ask the question, because one of the ideas was it was implied by one of our speakers that, yeah, we understand there might be a limit to how much they could do'",
        "'speaker_5': ', but then they should get tax credits. Are you familiar with any building in the state of Colorado that has been 50% market rate and 50% tax credits? Have you ever seen that? Have you seen it in any other city or state?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Is it your impression that the competitive tax credit projects. So this. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well I'm sorry to interrupt. So you you know, there are there's something called the Safe Harbor Law that if you're doing like a bond deal, certain types of financing, you have to provide at least 20% at 50% area median income or 40% at 60.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So if you provide the 20% at 50, the rest of them could be market.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So in your experience, though, that the tax credits are typically awarded to buildings that are 50% market rate? Have you seen that in Colorado? No. Okay. So I just you know, it's just a question about what's feasible. So one more question about there was a question about doing an economic analysis of the impact of this project.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So can someone, maybe the applicant or the the staff from CPD remind me how many acres this project is?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Just over an acre.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Just over an acre. So the five point statistical neighborhood, do we know how many acres that neighborhood is? This is this lives in the five point statistical neighborhoods. So I just want to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Write I do not.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Write square miles anything. I was looking it up. If any of the staff have that figure. I guess my question, you know, and you know, we've talked a little bit about studies. You know, I was in the Anti Displacement Network.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Has anyone like Irene or the host have seen a tool that allows you to determine what the displacement impact is of a one acre project on a hundred hundreds of mile? You know, my many square miles. Is anyone seen a tool that allows us to mathematically determine the future impact on displacement of a project of this size'",
        "'speaker_2': '? I haven't seen one that that speaks to the.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Displacement.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Impact. I've just seen studies that refer to the economic impact, the positive economic impact of affordable housing along transit.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah. And this is again, to this question, it's it's important to say that if we're going to vote on the the completeness of an application or its ability to meet the criteria based on doing or not doing an analysis, it's important to know whether that analysis is physically possible given the math and the tools that we have'",
        "'speaker_5': 'at our disposal. So I think with that, I will go ahead and let us move on. Madam President, thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilwoman Canete. Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Madam President. I've got four quick questions. So the first few are for Mr. Hill. So if you can, you can you tell me if you are familiar with the Work Now program?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman Ortega. I am not the first.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Okay. So this is a program that the city partners with, along with the state, and it is a separate standalone entity that is working with both union and nonunion apprenticeship programs and they are plugging people from various communities.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we're mandating that in some of our city funded projects so that people from impacted neighborhoods can benefit from the construction jobs. So no, if anybody had talked to you about utilizing that tool as a way people hired on the job to do some of the construction jobs.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I would have to look to learn more something. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I will put you in touch with Katrina and work that program. Secondly, can you just speak to you've talked about the square footage or the percentage of the commercial that you're proposing. Can you just speak to what types of jobs you think might be part of that commercial area?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that 5% that you were referring to yesterday?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And thank you for your question. So obviously, when the product is being built, we anticipate sort of 2100 jobs for the duration of the construction, which is 2 to 3 years. So they're short term jobs. What's the project is built?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We anticipate there being nine full time staff for the apartment project and another six or seven within the commercial space, depending on what it is, is that a restaurant would be hire. Is it a dry cleaner? Would be less.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But on average, we expect six, seven, eight in the retail commercial space, plus nine full time staff in the building for the rest of.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And in your guess, were you. Committing to at least make those job notifications available and create the opportunity for local residents to maybe take advantage of those through the application process.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes, thank you for your question. Or the CBA that we proposed that we sign. They have not signed it yet, but we intend to honor everything in that agreement despite accepting it. And there were eight different bullets aside in the affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Two of those technologies when you mentioned so an affirmative marketing agreement was mentioned in the CBA where we commit to explore and institute a neighborhood affirmative marketing agreement for five points and neighbors.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So that's in the residential and.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Executive jobs program so that the first opportunity to apply for the affordable units developed on the site and as well as. Not only the people within the retail space but also target GST and five points businesses as a as a hopeful ticket and a commercial space.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So the CBA does touch on that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Great. In the. Report from the staff. It spoke to. Drainage. So input from which water spoke to the drainage issue and the fact that you would need more in-depth engineering on the site and potentially need to do a detention pond or something along those lines to address runoff from the site.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So have you done any of that analysis and is there any expectation to have the city fund any of those costs?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'No, ma'am. We're not asking the city to fund those costs, but we have done our investigations. And what we determined is that because we actually fall outside of the target market, metro district and GDP or just across the street, we can not benefit from their onsite attention to the district.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have to do our own on site attention and water quality. So we'll have an underground detection pulse likely beneath our garage. This is exactly what we're doing across the street right now. And furthermore, this is in large part if not, I don't say excuse me, but this is in large part why the Green Water Foundation supported'",
        "'speaker_1': 'our project. Is it current? Industrial use is not exactly good for the river, which is the main block away. And furthermore, it's a brownfield development, as I believe you know, comes Ortega, but not all. They realize that this is a brownfield development.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's been historically contaminated site. It was part of an undocumented landfill. So we have engaged CDP to go through a voluntary cleanup plan, a vehicle to arrive at a no further action so that we can ultimately build and occupy this this site as residential so that those cleanup efforts will be have to be completed for to ratify'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the building. And as well, the water quality one or two issue ought to be handled on site within our within the boundaries of our site without any city or state assistance.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And will you just clarify that if you were just doing commercial or just some other type of industrial, that the cleanup would be different than doing it as a residential?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's correct, Councilman. If it maintains we maintain it as industrial, no cleanup would be required to complete it. Can you continue to operate it as industrial site without the cleanup? But to do residential and have people live and sleep on this in this building on the site, we have to get to a ground.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. And then my last question. Couldn't tell just from the. The site plan if the spur to the west of the site is an active for an answer.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Great question. The most proximate line is inactive. If you go to the site. The most proximate line is half of the ground and half out of the ground. The next proximate line is actually the elevated light rail line, but the closest line that grade is in.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. So your proximity to rail then, do you know what the distancing is between you and the the cars? Just on the other side of the RTD corridor is the storage yards, right?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The closest active line and grade is 60 feet from our site boundary, and then our building is 75 feet off of our boundary. So 85 feet to the nearest active line of crude.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. So that's. In your application, were you asked to check the box on your proximity to where you were?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well and accurately, Councilman, your your concerns with the adjacent property that was denied the museum in May kind of brought all this to light. And so we reached out to CDP as well as started our safety investigation with our civil engineer to make sure we were accounting for this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And our first residential unit because of the 12 over 412 levels of residential over four level garage, our first level of apartments are 50 feet above the ground.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. So so essentially you're using your garage as sort of that buffering, if you will. That's okay. Thank you. Madam President, I have no further questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilwoman Ortega. Councilwoman CdeBaca.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Just a couple of questions that have come up based on other comments. Nola, can you speak to. The idea that just because we aren't currently assessing the economic impact or the impact of potential displacement, can you speak to that?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And is it possible for us to extrapolate to determine what the impact would be if it is? What kind of things would we analyze and assess? So I think obviously some.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Some of the things.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That I said before about property, the property value changes, what the sales data of homes selling. The conversions from homeownership to rental which we've seen a 17% drop in Globeville in the last three years. The Rent Burden. There's a concept called the rent gap, which I don't want to totally get into, but the idea is a similar'",
        "'speaker_5': 'analysis to what land speculators do when they look at this is a piece of land where I'm going to get a lot of income out of it. And it's the percent change of property value, minus the percent change in median rentals over a certain period.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So, you know, land speculators would look at that and say this, this is the place where I can raise rents significantly and make quite a bit of money and the land steeper. So the analysis would be the reverse of that, to say there's a vulnerable neighbor, vulnerable renters in this in this neighborhood that need to be protected'",
        "'speaker_5': '. I think also looking at what are the amounts of like D.O.D., for instance, there's four duty stations right in this area looking at public investment like I-70 and National Western, and it's improvements and parks and all of these things, you know, maybe separately.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But but, you know, how much of that public investment is happening just to look at the pressures that are happening in the area. Another thing that's important, like I said before, is are there affordable housing, existing protected protections around affordable housing in the area?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Are those going to expire and do. Yes, they aren't going to expire because we don't have any. So those are some examples. So so it is possible. Also, can you speak to the criteria about public safety, health and welfare of a neighborhood?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'How would the neighborhood? Because I know you've spent a lot of time on this with the healthy block captains and social determinants of health. How would the neighborhood define something that furthers the safety, the health and the welfare of this community?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's for you, Nola. How how would the neighborhood define a development that did that or. Yeah. What would make a development that furthers the safety, the health and welfare of this neighborhood. You know, I think just because of the circumstance right now, the first thing that we always talk about is the affordability because of the displacement that's'",
        "'speaker_5': 'happening and that that is is the priority because otherwise we won't have neighbors anymore or the the ones that are currently there. And many have been living there for generations. I think, you know, other other. Things that people care about or would look to would be something that builds the local economy, that builds a sustainability and ongoing'",
        "'speaker_5': 'improvement in the pollution and conditions in the neighborhood, something that involves the neighborhood equitably, so that the neighborhood feels like they're a part of that. They can be they can enjoy that bus stop and they can enjoy.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The types.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Of amenities that that might come to be. So something that builds builds community is community development. And do you believe this development does that? No, I don't. Alfonso, can you can you speak a little bit? You mentioned it briefly in your comments, but can you speak a little bit about the acreage?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We are talking about one and a half acres, as if it's only one and a half acres here. And this is a unique situation, as Councilman Sandoval highlighted, because we're basically multiplying that one and a half acres by 16.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Can you talk a little bit about why this is different and why this shouldn't be treated like just one and a half acres?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. So if you were to do the calculation of an acre and a half, 60 story development that comes out to over 1 million square feet, to be exact, it's 1,045,440 square feet. So to imply that is just because it's only one and a half acres, it's a small project and it doesn't have an impact'",
        "'speaker_1': 'on our communities, is a false narrative. It's objectively untrue. And I think that council needs to recognize that this is a small project and it will have an impact on our communities. Earlier, some council members expressed a misunderstanding as to how a development project that sits seemingly disconnected from the residential areas that have been historically here can'",
        "'speaker_1': 'impact the property values or increase displacement. And, you know, even though it's just an acre and a half, this is proof of that. I mean, the entire grain corridor is proof of that. If you actually look at how many housing units have been built in the original land use that is residential in the communities of GS and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'five points, you would see that not a lot has actually been changed. But yet there's been, as I alluded to earlier, a 470% increase in property values. And those two things are not disconnected.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. And so what you're basically saying is that the buildable area in in this project is exponentially higher than what you would have anywhere else in the city. And so when you take buildable area into consideration, this project is well over the five acres, actually over 21 acres, I believe, of buildable area that's impacting this neighborhood'",
        "'speaker_5': '. So thank you for both for highlighting those things. Thank you. That's it for my questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman CdeBaca. The public hearing for Council Bill 20 Dash 1159 is closed. Comments from members of council and. Just a quick reminder here as well, we still have two other hearings on the agenda tonight. And so if your comments could be brief, we'd much appreciate it so we can get the other folks up.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'First up, Councilwoman Black.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thanks, Madam President. I needed to go first before I fall asleep. I'll go as fast as I can. You know, having Mayor Pena here tonight for the proclamation was a reminder of where Denver has been. I know a lot of the people that we hear from didn't live here back in the 1980s.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Some of them weren't even born yet. But as a Denver native, I do remember this terrible recession that Mayor Pena reminded us of. And during that recession, people were leaving Denver. Our economy tanked. Downtown was a ghost town and housing was really cheap.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I remember looking at a house in 1990 that I could not afford in Washington Park. That was $69,000. I should have bought it because today I'm sure it's worth millions and millions of dollars. Even in this century, a little over a decade ago, there was a good supply of housing in Denver.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And when the supply is high, prices are low. And it's basic economics. Stopping new housing developments and limiting the supply will not make it more affordable. Lower supply will, combined with an increasing population, will result in even higher housing costs.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Since 19. Since 2010, more than 100,000 people have moved here, including many of the people who speak at our council meetings and public comment. It's expected that by 2030, another 150,000 people will move to Denver City. Cities across the country and the world are growing and are experiencing housing shortages.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'People want to live in cities. We cannot address the housing crisis and the shortage by stopping development of new housing. This developer, Cyprus, came to council this spring with a project that would have included 63 affordable units. It met the legal criteria and aligned with the plans, but it was voted down.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's 63 affordable units for 63 families that won't be built tonight. Cypress is back for another proposal that includes 49 units for 99 years and houses negotiated a good agreement. If it's voted down, that's 49 units of affordable housing that Denver won't have.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'If you combine that with the 63, that would be 112 units that we won't get. Is spending many millions of dollars every year to address homelessness and to find housing. Of course, it's still not enough, especially during our current crisis.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We talked earlier about the millions being spent recently, and even tonight we approved a financing to help the Colorado Coalition for the Homeless construct 90 more units. The city and county of Denver does care and we are working on solutions.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That said, our country is a nation of laws and private property and Denver cannot take units from their owners and redistribute them. Alternatively, we need to encourage developers to build new units, whether by carrot or stick. I think we're all hopeful that some state legislation will pass and in the future we will be able to require units'",
        "'speaker_5': 'from developers. But those units will be in new developments that are not yet built. Stopping development is not the answer to our housing crisis. Unless people start moving away from Denver, we will need more housing. And of course, we will need to ensure that until we are out of this current economic crisis, we will need to extend'",
        "'speaker_5': 'the eviction moratorium. This project meets our legal criteria, aligns with our plans, and will provide much needed housing. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Black. Councilwoman Canete.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thanks, Madam President. Before I speak, we do have a custom of typically allowing the district councilperson to go first, even if they aren't fast enough to chime in as we all kind of jump in. And I did just want to if my colleague would like to go first, I'd be happy to see the floor to her since'",
        "'speaker_5': 'it's in her district.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you so much for for doing that. I appreciate that. And sorry about that. Councilwoman CdeBaca, please go ahead. First, as you might imagine, I've been looking at this screen since about 430 this afternoon. So apologies.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I rather actually close this out. So go ahead. Okay. Thanks. So I, I really appreciate the discussion we've had tonight. I think it's a really important one. And I am sorry that it's happening so late and before other topics, because it's really important for us to spend time on it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I want to say that I, I believe the things that I'm hearing from residents who are opposed to this project tonight. I believe that growth and development is a factor in displacement pressures and prices. I, i we may disagree about whether you can back out the transit stops, the parks and the thousands of other units to'",
        "'speaker_5': 'attribute what the impact is to one building. But I I'm not at all trying to argue the fact that there is there is impact collectively of all of these things and that each building or development contributes to those impacts and that we need to do more to study and evaluate them.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think the debate that we're having in so far tonight is about whether or not this tool of market development is the answer to mitigate all of those concerns. And so we have a scale mismatch, right? The scale of the pressures that NOLA and all of those who testified, you know, described are so great.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Right. The pressures of population growth that Councilwoman Black mentioned, the pressures of, you know, transit infrastructure and the pressures of, you know, all of those things. And so to be able to say that each one individual project can meet the scale of that is, I think, the concern I have about the the asks.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I believe in asking development to mitigate its impacts, but it has to be within the the market economy that it operates. That's the tool. It's not a tool for public ownership of land when you're leveraging and redevelopment, generally speaking, unless you're in a bigger area.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So the more you know, I do think it is unfortunate that the city didn't have a mechanism to sweep this in. I actually thought we did have a mechanism to sweep in disparate developments, even if they happened at slightly different locations and at slightly different times.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I did think we had a mechanism to sweep them into LDR. So I will commit to spending time with staff to figure out why that didn't happen. Maybe we just were a little too far apart in time, but that allows developers to game it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So if we have a bigger redevelopment area, then our potential to mitigate impacts grows because you can, for example, put a tax credit project for 30% or 50% of housing on one spot, which works because they have to generally be self-contained to get to those and my levels.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then you can do workforce or you can do business, you can. The bigger the site, the more you can try to get to the scale. But even still, you're operating in a market economy. And so the challenge I have is, you know, I think it's legitimate for a community to say we can't take any more development'",
        "'speaker_5': 'and what we want to do is oppose this project. If that is what we're happening, that we absolutely be within the right, that would be you know, I'd suggest you talk about the criteria, you know, of the zoning, but but you don't have to say we could possibly support this.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But what becomes hard is when the testimony before a council is, hey, listen, we really don't want the development, but if you did these totally unrealistic things that don't work in a market economy where someone has to pay for the land, they actually have to pay for the construction materials, they have to pay for the construction workers'",
        "'speaker_5': '. And yes, they have to pay their lenders. Their lenders are going to charge them interest. Those are not optional things. The challenge is trying to use this tool to solve those problems at that scale. And I will just share with I my colleagues have been very enthusiastic about the legislature making changes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The number one concern I hear from people about the state legislature making this change is they believe that local governments or the community have unrealistic expectations of what inclusionary can deliver. They think that we're out there saying it can solve homelessness, it can solve all these things, and they think it's a set up for them.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so the more we can demonstrate that we understand that this is a tool and we need a whole bunch other tools, like we need the things that, you know, Nola described. Right? I agree that we need them.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I've advocated for them. We might have different timelines, different ideas, you know. But I think that in a place where people have to pay for land, they have to pay for construction materials and workers, and they have to pay interest on loans and lenders to get money.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There are limits to what we can do in a particular project. So I say all this not to say that I know this is the magic great number I think we've out tonight has surfaced a lot of issues.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I've said before, we are not focusing enough on the displacement conversation and to the extent we're only doing it in rezonings, we are not doing a service to Greece or to any other neighborhood. You know, we had the folks in East Colfax here tonight is we can't just have this conversation around rezonings because it's already private land'",
        "'speaker_5': '. When they're before us, it's already too late. Right. It's not going to be public land or it's going to be a parcel and you're only going to be able to do one thing on it, not five. And the neighborhood needs five things.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I think that so we surface that issue, we surface the fact that we are not as a city consulting with the community in the process of doing our negotiations over the development agreement. That's a problem. It's not the way every city does it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'San Francisco seats the committee takes input before they negotiate with developers. We could do that. So that is an issue. We've surfaced and we have surfaced. The incredible pressure that this neighborhood is under. I think the only issue I'm taking is about the ability to solve all those things in scale in this tool.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Right. So I want to just touch on the criteria real quickly. I think that the project does meet those criteria, and I think for those reasons I will support it. But that is not a vote against the things that this community is asking for.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's a vote to try to pursue them at different scales and with different mechanisms that are better designed to get to them. You know, could could this project have done 3% more? They certainly offered to do some 30% of my units.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And the concern was they weren't enough. I'm not saying it was perfect, but I'm saying it seems in the realm of what these projects typically can carry, and that is when there has been independent analysis by city consultants on the feasibility, when they put in all those costs in cities across the America have done these feasibility studies'",
        "'speaker_5': 'and they all come out about the same place, which tells me we're not missing something by major degrees of magnitude. It tells me that we're in the realm of what this tool can deliver, and we should keep pushing it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We should keep pushing this tool, right? We should keep pushing the the envelope. But we are not out of the realm of of what other cities and other places with like less restrictive laws and similar economics can achieve.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So that tells me something. And in light of the criteria, I have to vote for this tonight, but we'll keep doing the work. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Kinney. Councilwoman CdeBaca.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Madam President. And while brevity is convenient for us at 11 p.m., a project that's going to impact a neighborhood forever warrants deep care and thorough consideration that might be inconvenient. So this will not be brief. Before I begin, I want to restate what's being considered tonight.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We're considering a development that is 16 stories where there is a current warehouse, there are no height specifications. In the end, the plan for the development of this area, specifically the Rhino Plan, despite it being adjacent to the river and the project itself is designed to capitalize on the river activation.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The tallest allowable height in all of the Rhino Plan is eight stories. There are also no affordability incentives for this area, despite it being built next to the 38th and Blake Park Station less than a mile away. As you heard, the community benefit of housing was negotiated without community at the table defining their needs.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This rezoning is being proposed by a developer who has yet to buy the land because of the exponential value increase resulting from this rezoning and it being necessary in order for them to purchase the land. Our task tonight is to make sure that this rezoning meets five criteria.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I want to speak to criteria one and three. First, I want to inform you that I attempted to serve as a convener for residents of our neighborhood and the developer. Between the introduction of this bill and tonight's meeting.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'At that meeting, my hope was deeper negotiation around community benefits. I was disheartened but unsurprised to see a consistent issue arise, an issue that will increasingly become a worse issue with our newer area plans that have just been passed.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That issue is the definition of community benefits, affordability, public safety and welfare. As a city, we've passed area plans that require community benefits as a condition of rezoning. Yet during this meeting, I had reflected to me that we as a city do not define when we as a city do not define community benefits.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We're essentially tossing the ball to developers to define a community's benefit for us. The power dynamic of a rezoning such as this is set up with that imbalance from the very beginning. A developer with millions of dollars to spend and millions of dollars to be gained have the responsibility of conducting a process of convincing low income residents'",
        "'speaker_5': 'that they need this developer's project. They have all of the tools to literally and figuratively paint a picture of what could be without telling the residents what the unintended consequences of the project might be. They have millions of dollars to convince you and the residents that their perception of the community and what it needs is superior to'",

        "'speaker_5': 'And we're not getting affordability.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So thank you for the question. This parcel is not located within the height incentive overlay. If it was, then I would to get the additional height they would have to provide affordability. But it is not located within that portion of.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'How close to the border of the affordability incentive overlay is it?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I will share my screen and bring that map back up. So the project is roughly represented by the star. I would say it is. Eyeballing it here is a two or three blocks outside of the height incentive overlay.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So one block away from the incentive overlay and we would default to the higher height instead of the lower height.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I think that that's you were asking a very reasonable question, and I don't. Think that I'm not intending to default to anything. And if there is a question over which I guidance should be used, I think that that's a perfectly reasonable discussion to have.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I based my findings on the more recent guidance rather than the more restrictive guidance. That was my analysis and what was supported by CBT. However, it is an objective fact that there is one plan that says three stories and there's one plan that says five stories, and there's an overarching plan that says eight stories.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So there is conflicting guidance. There is not a strict answer one can divine. And there has to be one does have to be chosen. I believe that I have to be supportive, but it's also reasonable to come to a different conclusion.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And why was the vulnerability of the neighborhood and the affordability incentive overlay not considered?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So the affordability overlay incentive was not considered because it was not. This parcel is not in the overlay. If it was in the overlay then it would have been considered. I do not know why the or how the boundary was drawn four years ago.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'When. This incentive was put in place. Perhaps folks who have been with the city longer would have a better memory of that. However, because it's not in the overlay, it was not able to be considered. The overlay was not able to be considered for this parcel.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But we didn't take into consideration the fact that it was part of the initial overlay application area.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm sorry. I do not. I did not understand the question.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So the red line is where the design overlay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes, correct.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And we have the blue line that cuts that in half. And this is right on the edge of the blue line. I just don't understand why we would default to the higher height with no affordability instead of the lower height.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It. You can't answer the question. That's it for my questions. Council. Councilman Gilmore.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you, Councilwoman CdeBaca. Are there any other questions from members of council? All right. Seen none of it. A moment. The public hearing for Council Bill 20 Dash 1190 is closed. Comments by members of Council. Councilwoman CdeBaca.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Just to reiterate, Madam President, this is not consistent with the intent of all of the affordability mechanisms we are trying on and trying to make fit for our cities needs. If we have conflicting plan guidance in an area vulnerable to displacement and we've had an overlay incentive right next to it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Why not simply go with the lower high incentive, knowing the implications of going with the higher height incentive without an affordability incentive overlay? It doesn't make sense to me. And so this to me is very clearly not consistent with the plan that matters the most to this area.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I don't think we should just be picking and choosing which plans that we're following. It doesn't make sense. Any plan, anything can be consistent with any plan. If we have multiple plans to cherry pick from, it doesn't make sense.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This is not consistent with the plan for this area. I would encourage my colleagues to recognize that the station plan was designed specifically for this area, and there may have been overlapping guidance, but there was a reason that this was specific with the station plan.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There's a reason that we were trying to capitalize on the toady nature of this area. And I and and I encourage you all to recognize that I'm a no on this one. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Seen no other comments on this one? I can see how James had to make a subjective decision on it. It's disappointing that maybe the council office doesn't feel like they were communicated with or had an opportunity to weigh in on it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But this did go through planning board. This was part of the process. It went through committee. And so seeing that it does meet all of the guidelines, even though CPD staff needed to make a subjective decision, I will be supporting it this evening.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Ten I's Council Bill 20 Dash 1190 has passed. Councilwoman Kenny's, will you please put Council Bill 1215 on the floor for final passage?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes, Madam President. I move that council bill 1219 be placed upon Senate consideration and do pass. Did I say that right?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. That was perfect. It's been moved. May I get a second.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Sergeant?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Herndon. The required public hearing for Council Bill 20, Dash 1215 is open. Can we please have the staff report?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hello. I just want to make sure that you can hear me. And you can also see the PowerPoint presentation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yep. Thank you, sir.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Awesome. Thank you so much. Well, I'm Sarah, Course, senior city planner in community planning and development. And I will be presenting this exciting rezoning case for you tonight. Slash this morning for the property located at 36010305 and oh seven North Race Street.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So the rezoning request is to hear from you as you want to. You are h two and a half. So we'll start off with some background information over the review criteria and then I'll have the staff recommendation. And so in the background information, this is located within Council District nine.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Councilwoman Zellerbach is district zooming in. It's within the whole neighborhood. Zooming in even further. Here is the property. It's about 10,400 square feet. Almost a quarter acre in size. And it has a one story multi-unit residential building on it that has four units.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The existing zoned district of USA A1 allows the Urban House building form as well as the detached accessory dwelling units. The proposed zone district or the requested zone district also allows the Urban House building for and detached accessory dwelling units.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But in addition to that, the requested zone district would also allow duplexes, tandem houses and row houses. So here is an image of the existing zone districts. As you see, this property is outlined in red and it's zoned U.S. one as well as many, if not all of the surrounding properties that are adjacent to it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So primarily most of the properties around it are also used to a one. But in addition to that, there are a few other properties differently, including zone districts, OSA and um, access to x. In terms of the existing land use.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Right now, the property is multi-unit residential. There are other multi-unit residential uses in the area and there are also more or less primarily two unit and single unit residential uses in this area. Here's the image of the property today.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So as a reminder, it's a single storey building that has multi-unit uses. It has four units within its. The surrounding properties are primarily single family homes that range from one or two stories in height, and there are also a few two unit structures that are single storey.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Before I go on to the review criteria, I want to talk a little bit about what can happen within the existing zone district today or the existing entitlements. So as you saw, it's zoned single unit, but there are also four units on the property.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There's a section within the zoning code that addresses this scenario and essentially allows that the multi-unit dwelling uses to occur and also for those units to continue whether or not the building is modified or demolished. So I'll point you to that blue summary box essentially is summarizing what's in the zoning code, and it says that the existing'",
        "'speaker_3': 'building today may be modified or demolished and rebuilt as a four unit structure as long as it complies with the Urban House building form standards. In addition to that, as we see, the property is quite large. So there's another option that could be done.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There could be maybe a zone law amendment that can happen where there could be three lots created that could each have an urban house as well as a detached accessory dwelling unit. And that could get to a total of six units.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So that's a little bit about what can kind of happen on the property today. In terms of the process, I just want to point you to the italic texts in terms of the public hearing at Planning Board. So Planning Board voted 6 to 4 at the public hearing to recommend denial.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And those who voted to recommend the denial cited that the application didn't meet certain review criteria. In terms of the public comment, the whole neighborhood association submitted a letter of support and they cited the idea that the Rowhouse Building Forum would be suitable for their neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There was a letter of opposition and in that letter they stated a concern for the added density, as well as concerns of traffic and parking. There were five letters of support similar to what the neighborhood association said, claiming that the Rowhouse building for could be a good fit as well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And there was one letter indicating support of the project specifically, but no mention of the actual proposed rezoning. So moving on to review criteria, I'll go through each one of these individually. In case if you forgot what they are.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The first one is consistency of the doctor plans. I'd like to point out that this property is a little unique in the fact that there is no neighborhood plan as well as no small area plan that applies to it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So there are only the two city wide plans that apply to this property that we use as part of the review criteria. And they are the comprehensive plan and blueprint Denver. So moving into the comprehensive plan, this application was consistent with some of the strategies outlined in the plan, which is great.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'However, there was an inconsistency with one of the strategies identified the strong and authentic neighborhoods vision element, and that was saying to encourage quality infill development that is consistent with the surrounding neighborhood and also offers opportunities for increased amenities.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Moving it to Blueprint Denver. So Blueprint Denver identifies the future context. And the future context for this property is urban. And the urban context says it should vary from multi-unit to compact, single unit residential, as well as have small unit residential and low intensity mixed use buildings that are typically embedded in single unit and to residential areas'",
        "'speaker_3': '. We found that the application is consistent with this criteria. Blueprint. Denver identifies the future place types and the future place type for this area is residential and residential. Low says it shouldn't have single and two unit uses on smaller lots and that accessory dwelling units and duplexes can be appropriate as well as buildings up to two and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'a half storeys. We found that the rezoning request is actually inconsistent with this criteria or with this policy. Partly because the current zone district right now today aligns well with the place type that's identified place type of residential low.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And the proposed zone district would actually allow multi-unit residential uses at a scale and building coverage that is not consistent with this place type. In addition to the residential workplace place type, there's also specific guidance in Blueprint Denver kind of guiding us on how we apply this residential low place type to propose rezonings, which I'll talk about'",
        "'speaker_3': 'on this next slide. So it outlines kind of three main things that we look at when we're evaluating these rezoning requests in the residential low area. The first one is looking at small area planning guidance. Unfortunately, there is none for this property looking at is there significant neighborhood input?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And there was. We're kind of neutral on that. There is a mixture of neighborhood input that we had and then also looking at existing zoning patterns, which today the existing zoning pattern is us, you a one. So in addition that I want to point out, we use that criteria that the land use patterns are not a consideration'",
        "'speaker_3': 'when we evaluate the appropriateness of zoning changes in the residential place type. And the evaluation is more specifically for a request to change the zoning to from single unit to then allowed to unit uses. But this rezoning request goes beyond two unit uses and is actually asking for multi unit residential uses.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So in this case it doesn't even necessarily apply. Moving on to blueprint Denver's growth area strategy. So this area is identified as all other areas of the city that should see about 20% of new housing growth and 10% of new employment growth.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we found this application to be inconsistent with this criteria because the proposal and district of you are two and a half would allow additional housing types that would then allow for significantly more housing growth on the site than what blueprint Denver anticipates.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Another thing that we look at is the fact that the future place type informs the growth area strategies. So we look to we look to see that these applications are meeting the future place type as well as a growth area strategy.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Next. So uniform your district regulations. So the proposed rezoning will result in the uniform application of zoned district building form, use and design regulations. It is consistent with that criteria. Next the proposal the proposed UN District does further the public health, safety and welfare.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'However, the proposed zone district is also inconsistent with Blueprint Denver's plan policies and therefore does not contribute to implementing the city's adopted land use plan. And because of this, it does not further the public health, safety and general welfare of the city through implementation of the city's adopted land use plan.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we could say that the application is inconsistent, at least with that aspect of review criteria. Number three. In terms of justifying circumstances, looking to see that there was a change to such a degree that the proposed rezoning is in the public interest.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'First when we're looking at this, the the application references that the rezoning would allow the property owner to redevelop an underutilized property and place modest rental homes that provides for families, families with children and multi-generational living opportunities. But however, the existing zoning entitlement, as I stated before, allows for the property to respond to the changing conditions and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to be redeveloped to better utilize the land. Again, as I stated, there could be a new four unit structure or three houses and accessory detached accessory dwelling units that could be built with additional amenities that better serve a wider range of potential residents.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we have found that the application is inconsistent, at least with this justifying circumstance. In addition to that, the application also references other properties in the neighborhood with row houses or that have the row house building building form.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But most of those properties that were called out also have the same zoning of USC, where one and a lot of them are also structures that have existed for quite some time. So it is our perception that there has not been a changed condition in the area.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Next in terms of looking at city adopted plans for justifying circumstance, the application references the adoption of Blueprint Denver. But as I as I talk through Blueprint, Denver does not call for a different context, place type or street type than what already exists.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And what we really want to know or what we really look into is we want to make sure that if a city adopted is a for a city adopted plan to be used as a justifying circumstance, that it actually specifically calls for the change in the area that would then justify the new zone district or it would'",
        "'speaker_3': 'justify the rezoning request. But in this case, the current zoned district is consistent with the city adopted plans. And lastly. This application is consistent with the neighborhood context. So the urban neighborhood context as well as of some district intents.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But we found it inconsistent with the zone district purpose because it does state that the regulations are intended to reinforce desired development patterns in existing neighborhoods while accommodating investment and blueprint. Denver is that plan that provides the guidance for the desired development pattern, and that pattern is for the residential low place type, which we found application to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'be inconsistent with. So it wouldn't necessarily be reinforcing that desired development pattern. And then lastly, for the staff recommendation, CBT recommends denial based on the finding that not all of the review criteria have been met. So I will be here for questions.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I believe the applicant should be on the questions as well. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Sarah, for staying with us and for the staff report tonight. Council has received 12 written comments on Council Bill 1215. There are no submitted comments in favor of the application and 12 submitted comments in opposition of the application.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All members of Council that are present have certified that they have read each of the submitted written comments. Do any members need more time in order to read the written testimony that was submitted? Seen none. Council Secretary let the record reflect that all written testimony, both in favor and in opposition of Council Bill 1215 has been read'",
        "'speaker_0': 'by each member of Council and all written testimony will be submitted to the official record of the hearing and to night. We are. This morning we have four individuals signed up to speak. And our first speaker is Jesse Paris.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'This morning, members of council and those are still watching. My name is Jesse Michelle Perez. I'm a little black star. It's a movie for self-defense, positive action, commercial social change, as well as the Unity Party of Colorado. In my notes and I will be in Denver in 2023.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I am against this resolution declared clear the criteria. I just had a question that would be the am I level for this rezoning for this property and I just looked it up in the average income for Denver is $68,000 plus a year.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So all these. Inside the mall area. Low income, 50%, 60%, 80% is not a field. No matter how you slice it. So. Please answer that question before I go to sleep. I appreciate it. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Jesse. Next up, we have David part of.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hello. This is David Pardo. I currently live in District ten in the Highland.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Neighborhood, but I've lived in District nine for the six.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Or seven years prior. Good morning to counsel. I want to first thank you all for doing this and putting in the time. We're 7 hours into this meeting and I have a lot of respect for you guys doing doing what you're doing right now.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I wanted to talk about this specific rezoning because I saw it come up in the Liberty and I thought it was a really interesting case. The existing zoning, as was mentioned, allows for three single family homes and 380 use and RH 2.5 zoning would allow per zoning code for ten dwelling units, which, whether it's consistent with the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'neighborhood or not, I'll be completely honest. I lived in District nine. I don't think other than maybe passing by on 36, I never paid any attention to that particular property. But I think it's an interesting thought experiment effectively.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And what does it mean to add density to a neighborhood? Does it make sense to say, hey, let's allow more houses that are all the same size, assuming row houses, six, eight and whatever get built on that property versus allowing three single family homes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That, given the lot size, could potentially be, you know, like 3000 square feet. And then the 80 used would be at most 640 square feet. I think one serves one purpose and.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Rho has to serve another purpose.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I just think it's worth talking about and I thought it was a really, really interesting rezoning. So that's why I wanted to get comment and now I'm going to shut up so that you guys can keep moving.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, David. Next up, we have Kimberly Brewer. Are you still with us, Kimberly? We've got muted. If you're still with us, Kimberly. Okay. We'll go ahead and move on to our next speaker test story.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I guess I'm just curious if the if the. If the complaints were traffic and parking is a concern, but it would create more housing for people. I you know, I think that that's something I don't know that that is you know.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Really? Did they weigh out? It seems like we've been talking. We talked to even the first zoning, you know, about how much housing is needed and affordable housing is needed. And this would be small rental, you know, a small rental area.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So it seems it seems like in the neighborhood association, you know, said that they wanted to approve it. I'm just curious to get more information about what this would actually look like in, you know, what the rezoning would, how like maybe the city planner woman could comment on what it would actually look like and how whether this'",
        "'speaker_5': 'would create more affordable housing or not. And and I think it's also important to note that, like, you know, when we talk about growth in one area, we're saying we need growth in this area. And then, you know, but growth in other places is bad because of parking and traffic.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I'm just curious about what kind of growth we're really where why it's good in some places and not in others. And who is really getting to where, who's affected by those decisions? Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you. We're going to go ahead and see if we can get Kimberly. Back on. All right. Last call, Kimberly. All right. That concludes our speakers questions from members of Council on Bill 1215. Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Madam President. Tess, can you help answer why the Planning Department allowed the application to even move forward if there was? Opposition and concern that it is totally inconsistent with the neighborhood plans and, you know, all the things that you elaborated on earlier.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Was that directed to me?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think, yeah. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sorry about that. Okay. I think you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Know my name. Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah, that's fine. So that that is a great question, and I can answer that appropriately for you. So it is not in my right to deny an application for moving forward. It is my my role to essentially evaluate it, to do my staff, you know, staff review, staff report, which you guys all got to gather the information'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to lay it out for you and for the planning board to then make decisions. And, you know, keeping all that in mind, we're all looking at what the review criteria are and what we have today to judge it on.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I know we have different opinions on what it could be in the future, but what I have, you know, it's going to be different from other projects. And so I think maybe part of the downfall is this project or this side of this property, or we had the city wide plans to go from and there wasn't specific'",
        "'speaker_3': 'neighborhood guidance. So, you know, maybe if there was other guidance there, it could have met certain criteria. But I do in my analysis that it really wasn't hitting the mark on almost most of the criteria. And so we will communicate that with the applicant, ensure they know kind of what CBD stance is.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And obviously they were at Planning Board and heard Planning Board's recommendation and then after that it still has to move forward to city council. And so that is kind of the process that they're allowed to do.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So in your conversations with the applicant, did you present other options for recommendations versus the what we have in front of us?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah. So there's discussions on maybe what some of the other options could be, but the applicant seemed very interested in getting into a zone district that would allow row houses. So this zone district more specifically.'"
