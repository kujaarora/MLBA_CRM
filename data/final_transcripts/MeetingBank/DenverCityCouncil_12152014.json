Whereas, born Nettie Persichetti on December 22nd, 1924 to self-described good Italian stuck. Nettie is a northwest Denver notable notable and has been recognized over the years by an endless list of city, state and regional'",
        "'speaker_7': 'agencies for her diligent work to improve her community, including Denver Parks and Recreation, the Regional Transportation District, Denver Regional Council of Governments, Denver Police Department, city of Lakewood, Colorado, General Assembly, State House of Representatives and multiple registered neighborhood organizations.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And. WHEREAS, Nettie and her husband of over five decades remembered fondly the old Denver streetcars that they rode and Nettie helped to bring them back, working to plan the recently opened West Light Rail Line. And. Whereas, a North Denver legacy herself, she is most noted as a neighborhood tour de force for curbs and lighting, coordinating cleanup efforts'",
        "'speaker_7': ', securing grants to replace refuse with recreation facilities and playground equipment for children, and generally placemaking her neighborhood long before it became a catchword. And. Whereas, networked 28 years as a Denver Public Schools lunchroom manager, was the driving force behind getting 18 lights installed in her neighborhood and at 90 continues to serve ably as vice president of the'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Sloan's Lake Citizens Group. And. Whereas, in 1992, the Nettie More playground was dedicated by the city of Denver in the Lakewood Dry Gulch Park. And to this day, Nettie keeps an. Eye on her playground to make sure that it is up to par, just like its namesake.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And. WHEREAS, Netty, who also has community apartments named after her, is the epitome of a community activist serving as a role model for wannabe neighborhood activists of all ages in Denver.

        "'speaker_4': 'It has been moved second and third by the audience. Comments from members of Council Councilwoman Shepherd.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'With great pleasure. This is really a special moment this evening. And oh, Nettie, I wish I could I can just barely see your eyes over the podium. You know, there's many folks that get active on a particular issue and get really involved because they're motivated about something bringing change or they're not wanting change to come to some'",
        "'speaker_7': 'part of their community. And they get really intensely involved, maybe for two, three, four months, six months, and then the issue blows over and fades away. And then a lot of these folks we never see from again. That's what we call a hit and run activist.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I borrowed that term from Councilwoman Monteiro, but let me tell you that Nettie Moore is anything but a hit and run activist. I believe that it is probably well over half a century that she has dedicated to improving her neighborhood for the better.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I listed, you know, in the proclamation many, many, many of her accomplishments. I've only been in office for three years, but there has been a lot that has transpired and changed for the better, even in those three years that I've been in office in the West Colfax corridor.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And Nettie has been at every single table, every single meeting, every single event along that way. As we mentioned about the West Corridor, light rail, about the redevelopment of St Anthony's and all of the various steps that that process has gone through, she has been, I think, at every single Sloan's Lake Citizens Group meeting that I have'",
        "'speaker_7': 'attended. One of my favorite little stories about Nettie was at the groundbreaking for the St Anthony's redevelopment project. You know, the ground was very broken up and uneven, and she had been invited to speak. And I jumped up thinking that she might need my help to get over the uneven ground and get to that dais and get'",
        "'speaker_7': 'up on the dais. But she kind of swatted my hand away and made it very clear that she was fine to get to that dais on her own without any help from me. So, I mean, I think to me, Nettie is just an amazing inspiration to everyone about, you know, what truly authentic, engaged neighborhood activism is that'",
        "'speaker_7': 'really focuses on, you know, what can. Looking around our neighborhood and saying, what can I change for the better? How can I improve my community? And how can I be a positive force for good to bring about changes that will serve not only myself, but everyone in my community?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And she has done that passionately and tirelessly over and over and over again for well over 50 years. So hats off to you, Ms.. Nettie. You have probably written the book on successful neighborhood activism. And, you know, I thank you for this for being such an inspiration and a role model for not only myself, but for many'",
        "'speaker_7': 'others across the community. And I know that several other of my colleagues know you well and probably have equally wonderful things to say.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Shephard. Councilman Lopez.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Hi, Nettie. How are you, Nettie? I am so glad she's been in these chambers many times on various different issues that have come in front of city council. And it is so nice to be in these chambers to see you in these chambers so you can receive a proclamation in your honor.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This city owes a debt of gratitude to you. When I think of the word respect and what it means, I think of you. And a lot of us in the West Side owe a great debt of gratitude to you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we respect you for it. We absolutely respect you. And what does that look like when Nettie Moore is in the room? She's the biggest, strongest and only person you see. She's the first person you go in whose hand you shake her, whose hug you feel.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'She's the one voice out of everybody in a room of screaming and obnoxious people. She is the one voice. That pacifies you, it brings you peace, that you see it great. And, you know, we go to a lot of meetings.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You do have a lot of contentious issues in this city. And Nettie Moore is the referee. She is the ref of this city. She brings people together. People who don't really like each other have one thing in common they love nothing more.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'West Colfax, a West Side legendary neighborhood, is legendary because of you and legendary because of your work. And you're the reason why. And I am so glad that you have a park named after you and that you are alive and well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Netty, to see and enjoy that part. Because for me, if it was up to me, we'd need a neighborhood after you. There is so much that we can be saying on this dais that would take us here all night praising you, Nettie.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But there's one thing that I dislike to leave with, and there's many people in the West Side that want to leave that same message. There's one message that we can say is, thank you. Thank you, Nettie Moore.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Councilman Lopez. Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Many of my comments have been made already, but when I walked in the dais tonight and saw Netty sitting there with that big smile on her face, that's the one thing you always you always notice about Nettie is that that that warm glow that she has.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I just want to say happy birthday and thank you thank you for all of your years of service to your community and to the Denver community. Because as we all play a role in making our neighborhood better, we make this city better for for everybody.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And you have been a true role model for neighborhood activists and advocates all across the city and a role model for our young people as well. And you will leave just a great legacy to this city. So, again, I want to say thank you for all of what you have done.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And God bless you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilwoman Canete.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Nettie You do always have a smile, but sometimes the finger comes out. And I appreciate that as well, because it's always something really important. And, you know, the proclamation tonight mentions that the park playground was dedicated in 1982, but you are a detail oriented woman.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so you were also keeping track of whether that underlying Parkland had ever been dedicated as official Parkland. And that was when I got the that we need to talk finger to make sure that that park was forever protected by the charter.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And in fact, I was so excited to be able to tell you the good news that we did dedicate that underlying parkland in the second round of dedications just a few months ago. And so it was great to hear the Oh good.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I love that detail oriented ness about you because other than your smile, the other thing you always have with you is your binder and your your scrapbooks. And you keep a great, meticulous history of Denver, not just of your own story, but of what you've seen evolve around you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I'm so appreciative of that. And I wish you a happy birthday as well.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. Mr. President, I would like to add my name to this proclamation and also wish you all the best and what a wonderful way to celebrate your birthday. You have lots of people here that love and care about you and that is so special.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I want to thank you very, very much for your friendship. And I remember the day that we met was at the Decatur Federal Station, and you came up and talked to me as if you'd always known me.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I thought, oh, my goodness, she watches Channel eight and she knows what everybody's talking about. So thank you so much and all the best. And I wish you many, many, many more wonderful years of good health and love and care.'",

    "A bill for an ordinance establishing a \"Social Impact Bond\" fund in the General Government Special Revenue Fund and the means for authorizing expenditures from such fund.\n (FINANCE & SERVICES) Approves the creation of a new fund in the General Government Special Revenue Fund for Social Impact Bonds to provide a multi-year reserve to make performance-based payments to contractors providing housing and case management for chronically homeless individuals. This is a companion ordinance to the Long Bill. The Committee approved filing this bill by consent on 12-4-14.": [
        "'speaker_4': 'It has been moved and seconded. Comments from members of Council Councilwoman Fox.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Mr. President. This ordinance establishes a social impact bond fund, essentially a counting place hold to put money that we will use for this mechanism. Now, I don't recall City Council formally approving this mechanism, which ironically does not involve actual bonds.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It has an intriguing spin and one I really thought long and hard about. The sales pitch is that we contract with investors to start a program and we pay only for success with all the money taxpayers will save.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'However, put another way, it's a mechanism to debt finance social programs. Let me say it again. I believe it's a mechanism to finance social programs. Now, it's justification is the same logic I heard when Mayor Hickenlooper promoted Denver's road home for the homeless will save millions because will howls and treat the high expense individuals really costing taxpayers'",
        "'speaker_8': '. That was what we were told and council voted to assert that program. Ironically, the plan first use I was told about for Denver using social impact bonds was to establish a program for high expense homeless individuals. And we'll save enormous amounts of money so we can fund the program and repay investors with interest, of course.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Why not just serve those individuals with the program already promoted to serve them or just the program? Well, undoubtedly have specific contracts coming up where we can talk about the problems unique to each purpose that the city wants to use social impact bonds for.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And if you I feel certain if this fund is established. The causes will grow and grow and grow. One teaser, though, is the difficulty. During the pilot program of correcting course midstream if that's warranted, you already have research criteria out there that's been established to prove a specific program caused an outcome and thus should generate payments to'",
        "'speaker_8': 'the investors. I mean, there'll be a whole lot of other issues I believe, that people will be raising as this goes forth. But right now, I'm being asked to create a fund to put money in for this purpose.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'At this time, I'm not ready to create an investment market for social programs. Let me say again, it's basically a new concept for expanding and debt financing. Social programs.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Councilman Fox. Councilman Brooks.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah, thank you, Mr. President. And I want to make sure that the public here's another version of Social Impact Bonds, which is one of the most innovative social funding mechanisms that cities are beginning to do nationwide. And I just want to make sure that there's someone here from Department of Finance that can is Tyler here at all'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to speak to that?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Councilman Brooks. Guys start for the mayor's office. Tyler is not here tonight, but we have a briefing scheduled on the entire social impact bond program and what's being proposed in Safety and Well-Being Committee, I believe, on January 13th.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So there will be more information provided at that time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. You know, thank you. I appreciate this guy. I really would have liked Tyler to be here because this has been a program that the city has been working on in conjunction with a lot of private partners in the city of Denver for the last year.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we are kind of voting on the fund tonight. So our hope that he can be here. But I would ask that for those who are tuning in, we're going to ask a ton of questions. We're going to try to specify some specific projects in which the city will go after.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But this is an incredible opportunity for the city and county of Denver to fund programs not from our general fund, but some innovative ways outside of that. And so I hope that we'll get that opportunity to to have a robust conversation there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Reading.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Councilmember. Councilwoman Robb.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I have also given a lot of thought to this, and some of my thoughts have gone along the way. Councilwoman thoughts went like, How does it really work? How do people really get paid back?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Why would they invest? I hadn't thought of it in terms of of course we'll pay them back. But I did attend a couple of the I don't know whether they were interest sessions or seminars outside of the city and county building that were hosted through, I think, the Strategic Partnership Office.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And it's very technical. I feel like there are a lot of measurements. I'm not saying that I could do the measurements myself. I don't understand them quite that well. But there are there is an independent advisor. We could legitimately ask, well, how does that person get paid?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But. All of that, said Skye. My question is, you know, I'm still very open to this because of the size of the problem. But my question is, why are we setting up the fund before we're briefed on the exact program?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The fund is just a mechanism.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I get it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right. It should have.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Been established in the long bill and it was an oversight. It should have been established for the 2015 budget as part of the long bill.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And why, if we haven't decided on the program, should it have been established.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That the way the program works, you have to hold a reserve to pay back those funds if we.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Do see a savings.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so we need to create a mechanism to do that. If we move them forward, if there are individual actions, they will still come to council for approval. This is just to establish that fund within the but the budget process.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Robb. Councilwoman Cannick.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I just wanted to, as chair of finance, I did allow this to go through. I'm concerned with the condition that we get the full briefing. And so so that was a condition of this going through.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And on the substance, I will say, these may not be the same kind of investors you're thinking of from Wall Street who put in $100 and want to get 110 or 100 and whatever back. The most frequent investors in social impact bonds are foundations who generally invest $100 and they get zero back.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So if they invest 100 and they get ten back, 15, $20 back, those are funds they can then reinvest in growing outcomes. So I think that's a really important distinction for folks to have even just tonight, even just for the generic mechanism with no program to go with it, which is that this opportunity does bring and grow'",
        "'speaker_0': 'resources to the city that we would not otherwise have, i.e. outside investment from foundations. And in none of these models do you really pay back more than what you received. You're just paying back something to an investor that's typically trying to do good without getting a single dollar in return.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So that may help to shift folks thinking a little bit about why this is an opportunity to city should pursue. And in terms of the return, I mean, I think that this is one of those things where it doesn't mean that you're not going to have other people who need similar services but jail nights and hospital nights'",
        "'speaker_0': ', for example. And, you know, if we're dealing with someone who is homeless, are more costly than the housing that has been well-established in many cities throughout the United States, Seattle in particular. And so I do believe that even though it doesn't mean you don't have to continue providing other homeless services, those however many folks you have, you'",
        "'speaker_0': 'are saving dollars. So we'll learn more about that. I apologize for the timing of this going through, but it was conditioned on the committee hearing on the substance. So I do encourage folks to vote yes for tonight for a fund structure so that the financing pieces is done.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But we then can can debate the program. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Councilman Canady, councilman rep.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Yeah, I'm still stuck. I want to be clear, we're establishing the fund, but we're not putting any money on it. So why do we have to have a reserve? Because we won't have a reserve. We'll have a fun number.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I'm sorry. I don't know the details of why exactly it had to be done at this specific moment in time. I can have Brendan reach out to you. This is first reading tonight. Okay. I can have Brendan and Tyler.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I think we really have to explore this. I'm very serious about the proposal, but I'm perplexed about how it came forward.'",

I've seen folks blow through red lights doing this. Not even paying attention to what's ahead of them, but instead liking something on Facebook and for that instant.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Imagine what can happen. On Sixth and Callum, all you got to do is sit there and you watch his cars go right through. Coming to a point. I was one of those folks that blew through that red light one time.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I had a big fine waiting for me at home. And guess what? I. I slowed down, like, 30 feet before that. I don't want that. I don't want that. Fine. And I honestly don't want to be responsible for somebody losing their mother, their father, or their son and daughter.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'On the count of me running a red light. In other states, you fined up to 400 or $500. For one of these violations. And I absolutely disagree with the notion that just because you're you're crossing the line, your front end of the cars in the passing, that line in the intersection is not hazardous.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We've been told time and time again by our own People with Disabilities Commission on how they like the idea of the photo radar. And you should be able to be a fine if you're in the cross out because unlike me, thank God.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I'm blessed to have the use of both of my legs unable to cross that sidewalk or cross that crosswalk and good speed to hustle on over. There are folks in this city who cannot. They are on a wheelchair.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They're in a cane or crutches. They're blind with a walking stick. And they depend on any mechanism they can to help them cross safely. And if there's too much of an inconvenience for us to get us, what is it, 70 something dollars, $40, $40 to cross 40 bucks.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's the inconvenience that I have to pay. That's bigger inconvenience and somebody who's trying to get across the street in a wheelchair. I'm sorry, but. The Battle of the inconveniences. It's pretty, pretty obvious. I don't mind having to pay that $40 fine.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'As opposed to watching somebody in a wheelchair have to go around the front end of your car in traffic. Just to get to the other side. Well, your car. And I agree. Councilman Fox, I would love to have an officer sit there and watch cars go through and ticket them.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I like that idea. I wish I was an officer. Every intersection I do that. But guess what? The same time, we got to be frugal with our budget, and we don't have enough officers. And Councilwoman in the budget.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I was with you in making sure that we had more officers. I want to do this every single year. Until we're cool. But until then, every tool that we have in the toolbox to protect people's safety as they walk in this city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'As a cross in the city should be utilized. And it gets the best of us. And it's inconvenient. But imagine if that were your kid in the coffin, in a hospital bed. Because it didn't cross a line or because they crossed the red line.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Councilman Lopez. Councilwoman Sussman.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I think it's easy for all of us to be.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Real clear about the fact that running a red light is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Dangerous and against the law. But many of us have forgotten, probably from long, long ago, taking our driver's ed, that it is also against the law to stop in a crosswalk for safety reasons. It might be more evident to us that how dangerous it is to run a stoplight than how dangerous it is to cross into a'",
        "'speaker_0': 'crosswalk. And just because the after picture of not seeing anybody in the crosswalk doesn't matter. Because when you are coming up on a light, you can't always tell whether there's somebody in that crosswalk or not. There is a reason why it is against the law.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we have seen some terrifying photos from the police department of Mothers and strollers being barely missed of people in wheelchairs being barely missed because they are in the crosswalk. And the driver who is not paying attention has is almost not stopped in time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If we would want to not give a ticket for those who are breaking the law about crossing a crosswalk, then we need to change the law. But we can't just say, let's not give a ticket. Let's give a ticket for this lawbreaking, but not for that lawbreaking.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What sense does that make? And we have seen the danger that it produces for the disabled, for people in bicycles, for people in wheelchairs. It is dangerous to stop at a crosswalk. A person has an opportunity to drive more carefully.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Often the lights have countdowns. And if you remember that it is illegal to stop at a crosswalk. You can be more careful about making sure that you do it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilwoman.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mr. President. A lot of the things I was planning on saying have been really pointed out by Council Bin Lopez and also Councilman Sussman. I got a I got one of these ones. And it was about ten years ago.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I have never gotten one since. They are about changing behavior and there is no better way of changing behavior than getting one of these types of tickets at a red light. I am. I would say one of the top five complaints I get from constituents on a regular basis is about crosswalk and intersection safety on a regular'",
        "'speaker_7': 'basis. I'm a mom with a seven year old kid and I am hyper hypersensitive to these issues because I regularly am crossing the street with my son. I can't tell you how often I tell him to look both ways before he steps in the street.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But my son did a little bit in the clouds, and I can't tell you how often he steps out into the street without doing exactly what I'm telling him. And I, you know, because I walk him to school every day, I see horrible behavior on the parts of drivers as they go through intersections.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I notice this particularly around my son's school, but I've seen it countless other places in my district. My district is full of a lot of seniors. It is full of a lot of boomers who are eventually going to find themselves perhaps with a walker or a cane or also, you know, just wheelchairs as well.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'A lot of the folks that live in my West Colfax corridor are also disabled. And I cannot stress enough how important I think it is to, as Councilman Lopez said, to ensure that we use every tool in our toolbox to ensure safety for all users of our of our roads.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'One thing that's important to note that if a car hits a pedestrian going ten miles an hour, nine out of ten pedestrians will survive that accident. If a car hits a pedestrian at 40 miles an hour, nine out of ten pedestrians will not survive that accident.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I know most of us in this room are drivers. 40 doesn't feel like very fast to a driver, but it is the difference between life and death for a pedestrian in a crosswalk. So just because a ticket met the photo generated when a ticket is issued may or may not show.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Someone in the crosswalk or about to enter the crosswalk. As Councilman Sussman said, that's irrelevant because once someone is killed, they're killed.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Sheppard. Councilwoman Monteiro.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I received an email regarding this issue from an individual that lives in West Denver, and he asked some very, very good questions. And so I'm just going to put it out there so that I can get some answers to his questions before second reading.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But there are people that feel that while this is a safety issue, they also feel that it's probably an illicit tax, that the city of Denver hasn't been very good at explaining what we're doing with with the money and where the proceeds from the from the tickets go.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So that's one question that I have. And also and I think I think it's good to have this conversation about about this particular program, because every time we're supposed to vote on it, it does raise some controversy. And so the other thing that I would like to ask is.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'How how this revenue is really used so that it's helpful towards the safety of drivers and pedestrians. So if I could have that information to be able to send back to my constituent that lives in West Denver, I would really appreciate it.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Sure. Councilman Monteiro The simple answer is, like all other fines that goes into the general fund and those dollars are allocated as part of the budget process every year for all sorts of things within the city, including safety.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But there is no specific breakdown because it does all just run into the general fund.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So so I think that that's probably I think that's probably the issue with this gentleman is that, you know, he lives near one of the intersections and sees people not taking it very serious at all. And it may be people that are so used to it from the neighborhood or I'm not sure, you know, chronic folks that'",
        "'speaker_8': 'just go through there. But I think that's part of the issue. Is that something that impacts people that we're not very good at seeing where those revenues go and for them to go into the general fund kind of diminishes the importance.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I just wanted to share that. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Happy to pass that on.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Councilman Monteiro. Councilman Fattah, I know you just ring back in, but I was going to go to some of our councilmembers having spoken. Is that okay, Councilman Nevitt?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I'll be real brief. I agree with Councilwoman Monteiro that we've probably done a poor job of explaining the rationale for this. Educating people and education is definitely a critical, critical component of having this program be successful.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I also agree with my colleagues who talked about the importance of protecting the crosswalk for children, for the disabled. But I want to make a pitch here, but I want to stake a claim that this is for the benefit of all of us.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We are all pedestrians first before we get into a car. And we have made a deep commitment as a city to transform Denver into a true, multi-modal city. Where all forms of transportation and all forms of locomotion are honored and facilitated.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And that means that we need to do a better job of mediating between the different forms of transportation. So, yes, cars belong on the road, but the roads also belong to pedestrians. When the light is red, the crosswalk belongs to the pedestrian.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And that is worth reinforcing to all drivers so that all of us as pedestrians know that the street is safe. Because if we don't enforce it, then when the light is red, take your chances. But that's not what we want to say when the light is red.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The crosswalk belongs to pedestrians. And if we can live with that and as people begin to get the message, and if we do a better job of communicating that message, we will make a big step forward to making a multi-modal city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If we abandon the crosswalk to haphazard approach of you can invaded if you want, or if there's a policeman there, you might get a ticket. I think we won't make very much progress. So thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Councilman. Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I just want to ask a couple of specifics, and I'm not sure who is here from Public Works that can address my question. So let me just start out by saying, first of all, what we're doing here is adding $81,000 to an existing contract and extending it by six months.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So, Sky, I guess you're the point person here to answer my question.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It's actually safety's bill, but I'm happy to take the question. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That's right. I forgot it was safety net. Public works. Do we get any additional interchanges? Because right now we only have four intersections that are photo redlining. Correct. So this doesn't do anything more than extend the contract and add those dollars.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes, that's absolutely correct. We are in the process of developing an RFP. It's been a number of years since these two contracts were instituted, and so it's time to go back out for RFP and they intend to do that in the early part of next year.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So this is an extension to get us through the first six months of the year while that RFP process takes place, and it does only include the four intersections. There will be a component of the new RFP that might consider future intersections, but that's a policy conversation to have in the future.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And at.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That time, we'll have another robust conversation about this, and we.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Are very sure we will.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Ortega. Councilwoman Fox.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I want to be sure you understand that. I really do want safety measures, those things that I think are really pertinent to safety. One, as I said, was the longer yellow caution light. I think that really did help drivers be able to stop.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Secondly, it was referenced a countdown mechanism that is very important to and we really should be having the larger countdown signs so that people can see how many seconds left there are. I get worried, though, when you have something that is such a generator of revenue that sometimes the safety part may take second steer, maybe not to'",
        "'speaker_8': 'these council members, but it may and I'm going to use a deer for an example. It was just told to me from a different city and adjacent city that uses photo red light and the citizen contacted them trying to get the larger count down measures.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And the city purposely didn't want to put them in because it would cut into the revenue. And so just understand, unless you see these other safety measures in connection with this, somebody is talking out of half of their mouth, not the full story.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I also had staff do some research and some cities do not ticket for white line violation. They ticket blowing through the red light. They do not ticket the white line. Other cities have found the program to be so ineffective they have discontinued it altogether.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Councilman Fox. Councilman Lopez.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Good for those other cities. But in Denver, we take it for the white line, because those as my colleagues said, the crosswalk belongs to pedestrians and not just the ones that walk, but the ones that roll and the ones that can't see.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's why it's important. If they have that problem, the other city that that city council deal with it. What I see here is a solution. It is a tool that we can use to help change behavior. You know, I wouldn't mind seeing those revenues down to zero, which means not very many people at all would be crossing'",
        "'speaker_3': 'those crosswalks or running those red lights out. I think that's the goal. I would like to go on record saying I want that goal to see that come down to zero. That means there are less accidents, more folks that are obeying that red line.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And if I can go on record, I know we're not expanding, but I have some recommendations. Alameda and federal I would say Alameda. Knox I would say 10th in federal federal next position. Man I'll have one at the end of the block.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think these work, it's not about revenue. And you're talking to somebody whose family member can no longer work because they were struck by a vehicle running a red light. It is a very hard thing to deal with.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We'll still be we will still be running red lights. Absolutely. Will people still be spitting? Absolutely. But hopefully. The number of people running red lines and the number of people speeding drops dramatically. And I think that's the purpose of this program.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I would like to see that zero barrel balanced one time. That would be a great day in the city. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Councilman Lopez. Councilwoman Robb.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Oh, just for people listening to this debate that we seem to have every other year or so, about three or four years ago when we had the debate, we did cut the fine for the white line violation in half.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So it's half the cost of that going through the whole intersections. It's $40 and that's $10 less than a gosh darned street sweeping ticket. So I think it's as easy to stop at a white line as it is to read a street sweeping sign.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So I tend to agree with Mary Beth assessment. I just wanted people to realize that it's a relatively poor Denver low cost ticket.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Councilman Rob. Any other comments? 950. Scene on Madam Secretary. Roll call.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But no. Can each layman. I. Lopez. Montero. Nevitt. I. Ortega. I. Rob. Shepherd. Susman. Hi, Brooks Brown.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Since the waste to energy facility is viewed by the city and the state as a form of waste disposal, special reviews and approvals are needed, including issuing a certificate of designation which for the city means passing an ordinance.'",

When considering whether to approve a certificate of designation, the Council shall take into account one the effects of the facility on nearby surroundings to the convenience of the facility to potential users.'",

Denver Parks and Recreation determined that the waste to energy facility at the zoo serves a substantial purpose in supporting the operation of the zoo. Also, the facility is in line with the city, with the city's sustainability goals with respect to energy and waste reduction.'",

D.H. notes that throughout this evaluation, the zoo involved other city departments and the state regulators, and it engaged in a robust effort to involve external stakeholders'",

And I loved what you guys said earlier about Natty, about caring and collaboration and advocacy. And I'm here to reassure you, we've heard recent concerns from our neighbors regarding the south side of the zoo.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And we all definitely take a role in making our neighborhoods better. And we're taking the comments we receive to heart. I also wanted to make you aware that we've invested over $700,000 on exterior facing improvements in that area thus far, including Duck Lake improvements, sidewalk landscape amenities and the installation of the first phase of our architectural fence'",

The fact that DPR operates without oversight of elected officials has resulted in encroachment on the park by the zoo and museum to the tipping point. The issue before the council is a certificate of designation, but it's really an exemption.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The real exemption is the esthetics who was brought up. The zoo plans to beautify the South End, but that should have been presented when park land was given to the zoo. The system won't change the look of the fence line.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Or zoo footprint.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Footprint. But it was already changed for elephant passage. And as an environmental steward and good neighbor, Denver's, who commits to ensuring the system meets standards, they should run their system properly. But otherwise, how has the zoo been a good neighbor to City Park?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'How has the zoo been a good neighbor to the neighbors of City Park? I've lived there for 40 years. I can't list a lot of things as it stands. We've been told that Denver Parks and Rec runs autonomously and council does not control them.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I think that should change given the circumstances. Our group, City Park Friends and Neighbors, had a recent meeting with Mr. Brooks in which he endorsed the idea of gathering all interested parties to confer periodically about city park issues.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We'd like to go further and propose a neighborhood advisory committee for City Park. Such groups already exist, such as for Botanic Gardens and would include representation from the institutions as well as Orientals. I urge Council to delay approval of this proposal and endorse support of the formation of a neighborhood advisory committee.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'I'm Nancy Francis.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I live on Vine Street, two blocks west of City Park. I speak today to urge City Council to delay a second reading of the proposed bill to authorize the zoo to operate an industrial process in City Park. To be very clear, the issue is not a referendum on sustainability or the very laudable goal of waste to energy'",
        "'speaker_9': 'processing. Rather, the issue in front of council is one of oversight. You have visual evidence illustrating what failure of oversight has produced so far, and industrial facilities sits as a wart on the landscape, a permanent defacement of City Park planted in the very midst of its most historic and heavily used areas.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Another recent illustration of the zoo's lack of regard for city park occurred during boo at the zoo. The zoo and Denver Parks and Recreation work together with our citizens to treat City Park as the zoo's overflow parking lot.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Signs posted at 23rd Avenue Red Lots Full Trice City Park Motor Coaches patrolled city parks throughout the two day event, shuttling passengers from stops labeled with large animal banners. Parks and Recreation helpfully cleared Park City Park's event calendar for the weekend.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Citizens have asked for family weekends free of events in City Park. We don't even merit a hearing on that suggestion. It's viewed as controversial. And just last week, more turf was turned out along Fair Lake to be paved in concrete up to the bandstand to make it easier for equipment vans to drop off sound equipment.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The manager of Parks and Recreation has unilaterally declared that the zoo's waste process is a valid use of park land and did not even deign to notify the public of her decision. Do you believe that one political appointee who has no credentials in industrial, mechanical or manufacturing, manufacturing, engineering or in power generation should make this land use'",
        "'speaker_9': 'decision without public scrutiny. It may be legally authorized by current Denver ordinance, but is this appropriate? Is it good stewardship to place so much control in the hands of a single appointed official who is not even required to reside in the city and county of Denver?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You cannot rely solely on the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment to regulate the zoo's industrial process. The state's permit considers only emissions. In fact, they have told us that the division does not have the authority to deny a permit based on community awareness, land use and noise.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'These issues are addressed at the local and county level. Consider this very carefully, please. You are talking about an industrial process in a public park, city park, in the midst of residential neighborhoods with no oversight by the city and county of Denver.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Before you consider the proposed bill, I ask you to take two steps. First, establish an oversight body to provide a means to engage citizens in the process of decisions that impact City Park, modeled after the Neighborhood Advisory Committee in the Denver Botanic Gardens.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Intellectual property issues can easily be addressed for inside.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Descriptions as your 3 minutes is up. I'm sorry. You have to. And I want to make sure I get the rules right. If you want to defer your time to you, do it during the recess. Or can you do it during the.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'No, it's usually.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's during the recess.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. You say.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes. I era as well.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'This is the landmark.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so, my friends, I do I do apologize. Your time is up, so.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I can't you my time. That's alright. You can read the rest of it. There's no need to absent.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Absolutely. Mr. Text, you are making bad text.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We'll get it. And don't worry. This is just a fun time to use fad tax of 4535 Julian Street Denver, Colorado. As long as we're talking about waste, it seems to be a wasted opportunity not to take the red light, find money out of the general fund and earmarked for homeless services.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'After all, they're among the most vulnerable populations in our crosswalks. It seems only fitting that they ought to benefit from the hazardous behavior that endangers them. Also, given your general unwillingness to spend money on the homeless, nobody would ever think you're using the fines as a revenue raising device.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. Tex. Luis Pawlikowski. And I apologize if I mispronounced the.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening and thank you. My name is Louis Chelsea. I'm the president of City Park. Friends and Neighbors. We're an R.A. that includes the neighborhood surrounding City Park. We have over 300 members. I am also on the board of Greater Park Hill Community Association, and I'm a stakeholder with income agency, the Inter Neighborhood Cooperative.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I have attended discussions and read various documents about the zoo's waste treatment plan. There have been a number of issues that have been cast in a somewhat skewed and cloudy light by the percentage of the zoo plan. It has been stated that INC, Greater Park Hill and City Park Alliance have given their blessings to the zoo plan'",
        "'speaker_3': '. I'll read you a part of Hank's letter that was dated December 8th. Any perceived approval of this project was gleaned from the minutes of the INC park meetings, and the preliminary approval was only in respect to the concept of waste gasification and in no way should have been used by City Council to imply the main body of'",
        "'speaker_3': 'ink either knew about the set design, scale orientation or approval of the gasification plan. I'm sure you'll agree that this is a far cry from approval of the zoo's plan. I've also had discussions with both grade Park Hill board members and president of City Park Alliance, where they mirrored the sentiments of the ink letter.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We at City Park, friends and neighbors agree wholeheartedly. The response from these organizations is uniform. After the zoo's presentation, a request for more information was put to the presenters. Once the information is made available, then perhaps the plant could have agreement by all.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Unfortunately, that was not the case. The main points that need to be addressed are air quality, smell, noise, visual impact, risk management and location. Why wasn't the facility built with consideration to its appearance from the park? Why couldn't the facility been located offsite or at least further from the park boundary?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Why is the zoo, the park and a neighborhood being used as a laboratory for this new technology? We therefore request that approval be delayed and now see a neighborhood advisory committee be formed from the neighborhood R.A. And that the zoo includes said next in its deliberations so that the plan can be perhaps approved by all parties.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We look to you as our representatives to make certain that the crown jewel of our city city park remains as was always intended. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Bridgette. Walt.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm Bridget Walsh, and I live in Park Hill, and I'm also a board member of City Park Friends and Neighbors. I would like to read some observations about the risks of the gasification process. From Wikipedia on the subject of biomass gasification.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Environmental advocates have called gasification incineration in disguise and argued that the technology is still dangerous to air quality and public health. Since 2003, numerous proposals for raise for waste treatment facilities hoping to use gasification technologies, fail to receive final approval to operate when the claims of project proponents did not withstand public and government scrutiny of key claims'",
        "'speaker_8': '. According to the Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives, one facility, which operated from 2009 to 2011 and Ottawa, had 29 emission incidences, 13 spills, and over those three years, it was only able to operate roughly 25, 25% of the time.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The second observation is from the European Commission report guidelines for safe and eco friendly biomass gasification. The technology of biomass gasification differs from other energy conservation technologies based on renewable energy sources, because it inherently involves the production, treatment and utilization of flammable and toxic gas mixtures.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Plant, media and utilities. Therefore, an adequate risk assessment is strongly recommended, is often a legal requirement for placing the plant into the market and running it. A risk assessment is aimed at protecting the workers in the plant itself.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Manufacturers. Operators have to keep in mind that accidents and ill health can ruin lives and can affect the business too. If the output is lost, machinery is damaged, insurance cost increase. So there is a possibility of prosecution. A risk assessment consists of a careful examination of what could harm, what causes harm to the people and environment in'",
        "'speaker_8': 'the plant. Some considerations are human and animal health hazards, such as dangers from toxic gases, safety issues such as explosion hazards and fire hazards and environment hazards from plant emissions, and loss of containment relating to toxic substances. While Denver voters may never have the opportunity to judge the risk assessment plant at the zoo's industrial waste plant, because'",
        "'speaker_8': 'much like oil and gas companies refuse to give first responders information about the trade secrets, content of the fracking solutions they are injecting into the earth. The zoo has wrapped up much of the they are needed to for a robust citizen and government agency review of their proposals.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'As trade secrets are confidential business information, I suggest that citizen health and safety is much more important than the future profits of the Denver Zoological Foundation, who, along with DPR, run the zoo with an iron hand that is symbolized by the Gulag style gate 15, the back door to the zoo, but an ugly, deep wound on historic'",
        "'speaker_8': 'city park. I implore you to put this project on hold until there is a legitimate neighborhood advisory committee set up to evaluate for the first time the zoo's gasification proposal and the light of day, the risks seem very serious and potentially deadly for park users and neighborhood residents.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Miss Walsh. Mr.. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'My name is Chairman Sekou. Founder of the Black Star Action Movement for Self-defense. Advocacy group for poor, working, poor and homeless people. First of all, I would like to thank Miss Nancy Francis for giving me the honor of reading what she didn't have time to read.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That is thoroughly reasonable. In the States. Before you consider the proposed bill, we ask that you take two, two steps. One, establish an oversight body. To provide a means to engage citizens in the process of decisions that impact City Park.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Modeled that after a neighborhood advisory committee in Denver's Botanic Gardens, reason to take it tour. I mean, I went down there to see this before you vote on this. Right. And take a tour by a guided neighborhood resident who lives there so they can give you its perspective about what they're talking about.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'See a picture and say, beats a whole bunch of words, man. You can see what they're talking about. All right. Nodding. So don't rubberstamp this, please, she said. Operation of an industrial process in City Park, which we call the crown jewel queen city of Denver.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Wait. Until oversight and control mechanisms are in place that will ensure the success of the zoo while protecting our city park, its users and neighborhoods. Everybody coming up here opposed to it. What does that tell you? Do you hear him now?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Oh, City City Council. I mean, the city attorney, we was an operations meeting and there was this rule called 106 called Pay Attention, you act judicious like look like you're paying attention even when you ain't. Yeah, I remember that one.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah. And while they were speaking out, watch people do everything but listen to them. Except for a few people. He wasn't focused on what they were talking about. You couldn't repeat one word. They say it. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'See, they don't come every day. I do. I saw you paying attention. Don't lose your father too much. But you know who else was up here? Charlie picking his nose.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Mr. Sinclair. Looking at. Mr.. Mr.. Mr.. Mr.. Mr.. Sekou. Mr.. Speaker, I appreciate. I appreciate.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Your.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Honor. This is a coup. Thank you for your comments. Sit down if you can. And thank you, Mr. Speaker, please. Thank you, Mr. Sekou. All right, that concludes. That concludes the speakers. Council members. Are there any are there any questions?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Any questions from members of council?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yep.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'All right. Count Catwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I first want to ask, what is the existing process that is utilized to dispose of the waste at the zoo today? Shannon, would you mind coming forward and explaining the process and you know, how long does the waste sit there?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Some of those kinds of things?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Absolutely. Those are good questions. And Jorge is our expert, so I'm going to have him answer them. But any questions for me also? I'll be right here.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you. My name is George Parnham, the vice president for design and campus management at Denver Zoo. And I appreciate the question. We currently manage our solid waste in the south side of the zoo, and we have since the early 1970s, we have two disposal processes.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'One is a compactor that takes our waste compacts. It holds it for about a week and hauls it off to landfill. And we have a dumpster that takes manure and takes that on a weekly basis to a composting facility.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. My next question is to ask the person from Environmental Health spoke to elaborate a little bit about the certificate of designation. I remember we used this process when we had a medical waste incinerator that tried to open in the Swansea, a neighborhood many years ago.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I don't recall that it is solely limited to industrial zoning. So can you speak to where the certificate of designation is allowed to be applied under the zoning code?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I don't know about under the zoning code. I do know that it's on a case by case basis and it's based on well, it's a document that allows land use for waste treatment disposal.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. I have some other questions, but I know we have other members, so I'm happy to defer and come back.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Thank you. Councilwoman Ortega. Councilman Brooks?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah, thank you. Mr. President, I have a couple of questions and I think one of them on our Shannon's up here. But Andrew. Andrew, why don't you come up here? I want to talk about kind of the outreach process that you all did.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Did you do an outreach process? Please kind of elaborate on what you all do with the community.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Absolutely. Andrew Rowan, government affairs manager for Denver Zoo. We started telling the story of waste to energy in 2009 and are due at the zoo event. At that point we started sharing some of our ideas and processes with our main supporters just to get some of their feedback.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Beyond that, we took on a much more formal approach when it came to the neighborhood groups and also city council. Starting at the beginning of 2013, we met with every city council member and briefed them on the process and briefed them on the technology and the ideas we had.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Along with that, we also met with all registered neighborhood organizations, all registered neighborhood organizations. At the time, City Park Friends and Neighbors was not registered until early 2014, so they were not in the process that was outlined throughout the year of 2013.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But we did meet with every registered neighborhood organization and we received feedback. We shared the plans. The PowerPoint that we shared was very similar to the one that is on the city council website right now that was shared with the Infrastructure and Culture Committee.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Beyond that, we also made presentations to specific stakeholders. So we reached out to the specific RINO's and had them send representatives. We also made a presentation to the INC Park Committee as well, so we feel like we did a very thorough public outreach process.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We received overwhelming support at that time. Now there was a little gap in between when we did our outreach and becoming and coming in front of council. The last nine months are eat up or our engineering and design plans have been under review by city and state officials.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That is what that is what accounts for the gap between our outreach and coming in front of council about nine months later.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And you all had a change in leadership during that time as well. Did that affect any of the outreach or the communication?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yeah, we've had several changes at our CEO position and also our government affairs and external relations. Vice President, they are both no longer with Denver Zoo, so we are picking up where they left off and entering this process.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. Just just another question. And I believe maybe environmental health can can answer this question. That was one of the folks who was from the Sea Girt Curtis Park City Park Friends and Neighbors group talked about the kind of air pollution that gasification may cause.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Do you all know anything about that?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Or there is a specific permit that the zoo was required to have?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah. Come to the mike.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Which requires them to monitor for exhaust, and perhaps the zoo can tell a little bit more about their their permit.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah, that'd be great.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you. There's the permit that we're talking about tonight is the solid waste permit. There's a permit that also is specific to the air emissions. That permit is handled by the State Department of Public Health and Environment. On behalf of the EPA, we have been issued a construction air permit for the facility and it meets the most'",
        "'speaker_11': 'rigorous standards for for air emissions that exists at at the state and at the federal level. So that was a concurrent process of permitting and a very rigorous technical review. And it also is woven into the eat up or the engineer and design operations plan.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That's part of this certificate of designation, which really mandates how we fulfill and maintain our our permit requirements for the air emission as well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So how often when you all be testing the air emissions continuously? Okay. And and once it gets past a certain low level or dangerous level in which we heard a little bit, you what are you required to shut down?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'What's the.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Well, I'll provide this caveat. We don't expect that it will ever get to dangerous levels, but the permit levels are are far below dangerous levels. If we do ever get to those permit levels through our continuous monitoring, we would have to have a shutdown, take corrective actions and resume operations.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Councilmember Councilwoman Rob.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Some of my questions have been answered. First, I just want to establish a timeline here. So according to the question Councilwoman Ortega asked, the zoo's been handling waste at approximately this location since the seventies.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That is correct.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Yeah. These are probably for you, George. And when was the building approved or permitted?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'This the the main building, which is part of Toyota Elephant Passage, was approved by the Denver Building Department in fall of 2009.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And it was completed. Am I right in remembering 2011.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Or late summer 2011?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. And then some questions about the facility itself. Will you be handling commercial waste said is any waste generated by sources other than the Denver Zoo?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. And then in the packet of materials with all the appendices, you have an appendix, Jake. It's called Safety Material Assessment Assessment Reports on waste handling and safe operation. But when you go to that appendix, it's said it's to be completed later.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Can you just elaborate what's going to be in there? When is it going to be completed?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yes. A backup.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. My name is Jennifer Hale. I'm the director of safety and sustainability for Denver Zoo. In regards to the question of when Appendix J will be completed, it was on hold. We were waiting for our air permit to be issued, which we received this afternoon, the final air permit.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And there's very specific conditions that we have to meet with that plan. So once we got that permit signed by the state, we will be working on this final plan and me submitting it to DHS and CDP.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So that's not required before you get the certificate?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It is not. No, it is part of an addition as part of a requirement, as George had mentioned, the merging of both the air permit and the eat up conditions.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. And then my final question. What is the general timeline moving forward? When do you expect to be in operation?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you. So we'll after approval of a certificate of designation, then we would start to move equipment into the Waste Management Building over the course of early 2015, starting to put those pieces in place and starting operations sometime in the end of the first quarter of that year.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'As we move forward in installing the many pieces of equipment that that fill out the system and hopefully would come into operation towards the end of 2015.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Rob. Councilwoman, can each.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Question for the Department of Environmental Health. So I was cross-referencing things folks were talking about with the materials in the packet just in case folks wondered what we do on these computers. There's only one thing we do, which is look at materials.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I found the section referenced by someone who said, you know, trade secrets in terms of the gasification process. So I just want to be clear, aware of the exact chemicals and processes involved. And you review those exact processes and chemicals in making your recommendation regardless of what is or is not in the public documents.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have a list of chemicals that would be on site that's within the up. And so we have looked at that. We have looked at how their operations could be managed to be protective of human health and the environment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We do not know the exact process steps, but we don't believe we need to know the process steps in order to be protective of the material that they're going to be handling on the site. Okay. So I just want to say that back to you to make sure I understand it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we are thinking more about the site itself in terms of the safety of, you know, the chemical interactions if spills, things like that. When you listed the conditions that local government is responsible for reviewing, you did not specifically I don't think mentioned air quality analysis.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is that the state's responsibility legally to be focused on the exact emissions? I just want to clarify roles and responsibilities between the city and the state in that they will monitor the air to specific. Oh, I'm sorry. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Pardon for interrupting. I don't mean what the zoo's responsible for. I meant in reviewing and issuing permits. What is our responsibility as a city versus the state's responsibility in regard to saying, yes, this is a process or this is an air emission that would be acceptable?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This is not this is dangerous. This is not so what are our responsibilities? Okay. The city does not issue a permit. We will audit their their work to make sure that they're in compliance with the permit. Got it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. That is the state's responsibility. Yes. Okay. Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Councilwoman County Councilwoman Shepherd.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mr. President. My first question is for George George Pond. You mentioned that a. Part of the waste that is currently generated at the zoo is is being hauled to the landfill. How many tonnes is that annually?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It's 1.5 million annually goes to landfill.'",
        "'speaker_7': '1.5 million is going to our landfill. Okay. That's my question for you, Kate. A question for Shannon. I think I heard you say that 700,000 had already been spent on beautification. Was that specific to the what we're calling, I guess, the back end of the.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Zoo, south side of the zoo, right?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yeah. And I also heard you make say that you've already made a commitment to earmark funds for beautification in your next budget cycle. That's correct. And approximately how much?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Well, I have a board meeting tomorrow, so the Finance Committee approved it, but the board has to approve it, and I'm sure they will, but I don't want to get out of order. But it'll be a signal of significant funds.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I'm imagining a significant piece of that is for the South.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Side. Correct.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That's what I mean.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That was my question for you. My third question, I think might be for Councilman Brooks. Perhaps there's been a lot of talk about the neighborhood advisory committee. And am I understanding correctly that you have committed to this group?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah, you know, and I share about that in my comments. But City park friends and neighbors and Councilwoman Mira Sussman came on over. We had a conversation about this a couple of weeks ago, but it was more about the larger master plan of City Park and how we move forward and how we work together with all the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'facilities and how those facilities, the Museum of Nature and Science, the zoo, the park talked to neighbors about their plans. And, and and so anyway, I share about that. But in 1997, there was a task force that mayor, Mayor Webb, put together around kind of master planning the park.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And it had folks from the neighborhood have folks from the zoo, had folks from museum interested in science. And I think something like that needs to be created. And then Councilwoman Robb talked about Botanic Gardens and the oversight committee that works with them and how, you know, it's not always a seamless process, but it's effective, right?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Everyone feels informed. And so we need something like that to be established again here in City Park.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. So I'm hearing a pretty firm commitment there. And then I guess my final question is how how long has the zoo itself been in this location and operating?'",
        "'speaker_11': '118 years.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You know, I think it's really interesting to point. I mean, we've talked a lot about the historic nature of the park itself, but the zoo itself is also historic in this location. Thank you. Those are all my questions.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Shepard. Councilwoman Monteiro.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I had a question. There's a lot of conversation about what the state regulates and what the city doesn't regulate. I wanted to ask a question. Is there anywhere through the process where the Denver Fire Department was involved?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And did they what you know, what did they say? Because if there was ever any unfortunate incident, who would be the first responders? I think it would be the Denver Fire Department.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Well, certainly the Denver Fire Department would would respond to any any issues. But there's two ways they've interfaced with the designs. One is during 2009, when the plans were being reviewed, the Denver Fire Department, among the other buildings in the Toyota Urban Passage area, reviewed that and made comments.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And and we complied with all of those comments moving forward. The building department will be involved as specific pieces of equipment get get moved in. Some of which need permitting, building, permit type things. And they they would get involved as well.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But part of our eat up or our engineer design operating plan absolutely addresses risk management at multiple levels from an operations stand to health and human safety, but also for fire.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I just want to be clear. The last time the Denver Fire Department weighed in was in 2009.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We've been in communication to them since then. So I wouldn't say it's the last time that they weighed in necessarily, but their formal action of reviewing the building, its type and occupancy and fire rating was in 2009.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. Thank you. I'm still uncomfortable with your answer. What does that mean, that they weighed in?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Well, they actually they were part of the permit approval process at that time. So they so they approved the the the occupancy rating use, as well as the fire suppression system in 2009?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That's correct. Okay. So and then I just have one more question. So is there a response plan for the concerns that the neighborhood people have talked about?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Well, if I could, I'll broaden that. Yes, there is a response plan for safety. There's a response plan for noise, noise and order odor. If if that's what you're asking. So the EDA specifically calls out criteria for how to handle noise, odor and safety issues, as well as how complaints will be taken addressed.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'What's the timeframe in which those can be addressed and how we produce a corrective action plan? And who are the the reviewing agencies who will confirm that things have been handled?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I have one more question. So how will and maybe Councilman Brooks is going to answer this, but how will the neighborhood people know what the response plan is under any situation? Have they been briefed on what that would be?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Well, it is it is part of our plan. So there is a very specific flowchart of communication and in it. So it is part of the documents that are that are being considered here. And so it will be published.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But certainly we will continue our communication, among other things, to make sure that we're communicating how those how concerns and responses can be handled. So we will take responsibility for that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Councilman Montero, Councilwoman Fox.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I have a question for the gentleman who talked about talking with council and other community groups from the zoo. I do remember you're coming to talk to me. And I felt as if this really seemed to be an environmentally sustainable move.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I was very impressed by your presentation. You say you went to other groups too, and they were overwhelmingly enthusiastic. I guess I don't mean this as a rhetorical question. We have had a whole string of people who are not in support.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Where is the evidence of this overwhelming support so that we can know that that the some communities really are embracing this?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Sure. During that public outreach period, we did host a number of open houses and we did have a guest list sign in there. And we did receive comments via email and also written comments at that time. That was some of the overwhelming support that we had heard.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Also, in sharing this with some of the people that we consulted with, that would be the National Board in the Renewable Energy Laboratory. And some of our other scientists peers are very supportive of this technology and using this kind of process.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We did send out public notice to all the registered neighborhood organizations and as I said, held several information meetings, received comment, and some of the comments were related to where is this going to be? Is it going to smell?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'How are your operations going to minimize no noise and odor? And as my colleague George Pon stated, embedded within the EDA are the criteria that we must abide by. And those have been rigorously vetted by people who are professionals in this field.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We also have an action flow chart for if there is concerns. The reason why I stated overwhelming support is because we heard virtually and I will stand by this virtually zero negative comments during our exhaustive outreach that started in 2009 and was very, very exhaustive in 2013.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We heard literally zero negative comments about it. Also, as part of the review period for the heat up, there are public notices that are put out there as they pertain to the different permits that we received from the city and state.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Those public comment periods received virtually zero comments. I believe there was one comment made during the state air permit period and that was again from this new group, City Park Friends and neighbors who we've just been recently hearing from.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'If I may, Mr. President, I just want I know that you all are new, but sometimes it really helps when you know that there's some concern to have some balance in the presentation and then the people speaking.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank absolutely. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Fot Council Members Robin Monteiro Okay. If I go to Councilman Sussman, who had had the opportunity. Councilwoman Sussman.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I just want Andrew I just want to ask you, you also went to ANC Park Committee, which is a subcommittee of ANC. I just wanted to elaborate on Councilwoman Foster's question and how did they respond to the presentation?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yes, we were asked to present. Actually, we approached them during this period and we presented to the committee during that during that presentation, they were supportive. And they did move a month after that presentation to vote in support of the process.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I know you guys have received some emails saying that they were not duly informed up to that point. As I said, the presentation that was made during the Infrastructure and Culture Committee was very similar to what was made to Ing Park as well.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So we did feel pretty good about their support. Another part of the public process was presenting to the Parks and Rec Advisory Board. We did present the plans in a public forum there. There was a public comment period during one of those meetings.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Nobody spoke in opposition and they voted in unanimous support of moving forward with the waste energy process. Thank you. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Sussman. All right, Councilwoman Robb.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you, Mr. President. In still continuing during this meeting to go through the materials in front of me. I had to ask previously, without seeing this attachment about whether you are you expected to accept waste from any other source.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And all of a sudden I found a draft waste acceptance plan in the packet. I don't think it's actually labeled as a separate appendix or I got the appendix numbers mixed up, but it does very clearly say in the first sentence at this time the zoo is not approved to accept any waste streams, but it goes on'",
        "'speaker_10': 'other than from other sources. But it goes on to say at some time, or at least to imply at some time in the future, you might do that. My concern is I want to be very clear what I'm approving tonight.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'What would be the. Procedure if you decided in the future you wanted to do that, because until tonight, I didn't understand that that could possibly be part of the plan. And I think that's a very different thing than talking about the operation and maintenance of a zoo, which is definitely a park use.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Absolutely. And I and I'll make one clarification. Your earlier question was somewhat specific about commercial waste, but I'll answer so absolutely no. On commercial waste, we are we will take parkways. So tree branches and things like that. As a as a part of it, we do not have the discretion to add any outside waste into this.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So this is really the discretion of the Parks Department and I believe the Department of Environmental Health also, in order to to change that, we don't anticipate at this point it's not but it's not our discretion to do that.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. So I want to know from someone in the city, what is the process if indeed it's some of these things previously acceptable? You've got cardboard cloth landscape away. What's the process to to accept other materials?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If the zoo wanted to accept other materials, they would have to go to D.H. and also go to the CDP, Colorado Department of Environmental Health, and tell us what they're going to do, what they plan on accepting how that would fit into their program, the type of waste, subsequent waste that could be generated, whether it would just'",
        "'speaker_0': 'be a solid waste, what would it be a hazardous waste? We would we would ask a lot of questions to understand exactly what they would be bringing in, how it would be managed, and what the byproducts would be.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Would they have to come back to council?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'll leave that to legal. Good evening, Jessica Brody, Denver City Attorney's Office. The municipal code doesn't specifically speak to that question, but I will say that council does have discretion at any time to withdraw the approval of their certificate of designation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Robert. Councilman Monteiro.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Is there a representative from the Francis City Park that I could ask a question to? Can you please come up to the podium? So I have two questions. Number one is the Friends of City Park, a registered neighborhood group.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm sorry. I can hardly hear you.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Is Friends of City Park a registered neighborhood group?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Are you registered neighborhood organization?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes. So in 2009, did you or did you not receive this information?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We were not in existence in 2009.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. Okay. Thank you. And then the other thing that I wanted to ask is the request for. You were talking about a group similar to Botanic Gardens. I'm not sure what that is, but what is it that what is it that you want accomplished or discussed if such a group would be organized?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'll answer that if you haven't guessed. I'm from New York originally, and I'm here in Denver now in about four years. I've heard ever since I've come to Denver that we're trying to be a world class city. I would ask you, do you think in Central Park where they have a zoo, that if they put up a'",
        "'speaker_3': 'facility, as you had pictures of, that people would stand around and applaud it? Sure. It sounds great when you're going to turn waste into energy. I mean, who would be against that? The question is, what's involved? Where is it?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And it just doesn't seem right for Denver and for it's beautiful city park. Everybody that I know that comes to see me from wherever they are, I take them to the park with pride. I show them all the beautiful views and everything, and then they say, What's this thing over here?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If indeed the zoo was going to present this thing in a very favorable light, they probably should have built a structure that everybody could say, This is lovely. Yeah. I mean, it's great. And the technology sounds good, but what is the technology?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Somehow it's shrouded in certain secrets that we don't really know. We have a lot of people that that understand these things a lot better than I do. And they would certainly look into it and put their input towards it as well so that everybody could feel good about this and everybody could be proud of it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I can't tell you that I'm proud of it. And I don't know anybody that is, except maybe the people that are trying to make it happen.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I'll just be blunt. So the idea of establishing a committee to work with the zoo is to. To kill the project.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We would love to have communications with them on a regular basis. We are, you know, we're neighbors. We love the park. We love the zoo. We love everything about it. But we sometimes feel very excluded from the process.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And whenever there seems to be something that the zoo wants, they come here or wherever they go, and they seem to get it accomplished. And we never have a say about it.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So as a registered neighborhood group, you're not receiving information?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, we we are now, but we haven't received any of this. As I said, we're relatively new. And when this all got started, we were not in existence. We came about, if you recall, from City Loop, which was a project that was also tried to put upon us and we know what happened.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well, thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Anybody else?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'No, thank you, sir. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And thank all of you for listening. I appreciate.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It. Councilwoman Robb.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I think David Broadwell could expand further on my earlier question. And I would like to hear from David on on what it would, you know, whether we're approving future acceptance of waste from other customers.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you. Councilwoman David Broadwell, Assistant City Attorney. I thought I'd shed a little additional light on your very, very important questions. The and particularly calling up the language you were quoting a moment ago, a linchpin to the legality of this waste to energy facility in this location in a city park.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Is that it only be processing parkways. It's legal because it is an integral part of the zoo itself. And I think one of the speakers alluded to it a minute ago. To the extent there's been talk of anything else going through this waste to energy facility, it may be other parkways.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So it still passes muster as a legitimate park use in a park, but it can't be processing third party waste from other locations unrelated to the parks. And I think the conversation around this is is there's some interesting there's different layers of this here, certainly, and certainly the environmental health part of it.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And the process of the certificate, you're you're you're considering here tonight, we always know with all things in parks, there's an underlying principle about how parks can only contain park uses under the charter. And this certainly passes muster legally because it is integral to the operation of the zoo.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And the zoo is certainly a legitimate park use. But we attorneys will advise down the road if we have to, that it can't become a third party receptacle receptacle for third party waste from from other completely other locations and other purposes as a matter of our charter.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. That's very helpful.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Robb. All right. Any other questions? Are they? The public hearing is now closed. Time for comments, Councilman Brooks.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. President. This is this has been a rather robust conversation. And for me, this conversation has been going on for about a year and a half off and on. I first want to address city park friends and neighbors.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We we had a really good meeting a couple of weeks ago. And Mary Beth Sussman does not serve as the councilperson person over the park, but she was there. She came to be a part of this meeting. And so I really appreciate you being there as well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And you don't hear council people saying this a lot, but I learned a lot. I learned a lot from my neighbors. And I heard a lot of their concerns. And it was a first meeting. And I think you heard a little bit.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We the first time this group came together was to fight the city park loop kind of conversation, which is now in Councilman Lopez's district. Congratulations. And and so it started with it started with a bit of friction. But I have to say, you know, these neighbors are incredibly passionate and incredibly intelligent about the things going on in'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the park. And so I learned a ton. I think, you know, unfortunately, this conversation is getting turned just a little bit because the vision and the skill of our conversation was about the entire park. And how do we stop thinking in silos in City Park, at the Museum of Nature and Science has their projects and the zoo'",
        "'speaker_2': 'has their projects and parks and Rex thinks about their projects and City Park. But how do we think about it? Holistically is what we were coming to. And and they have this group and many neighbors have felt kind of pushed to the side out of conversations.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I certainly can appreciate that. And so that's when we talked about this advisory group and this task force that would have representatives from every party, not just one group in a silo, but every group, the zoo, the museum and nature and science, parks and rec, and members of the community to talk about and vet issues like'",
        "'speaker_2': 'we're talking about today. I don't think or at least that night, the issue was not about gasification. The issue was about all of the decisions that led up to neighbors being pushed to the side and not being considered.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In this conversation, I got to say, I agree on every development that that I'm a part of downtown. And we talk about a building or a facility having a back. Right. Like the facility has to worry about not having a back side either.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We're just talking about this with the St Joseph's Hospital, that they don't put their backside in the neighborhood and the zoo. The neighbors feel like the zoo kind of has their backside in the park. And if you go into the park, you you kind of see that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And and that's that's a design element that we should have talked about we should have considered when designing that. So I am proposing that we put together this neighborhood advisory group or this task force mirrored similarly to Botanic Gardens and what they have.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And Councilman Robb brought that up and also Lord Dennis Miller, executive director of Parks and Rec. And and it will be you know, we will work with the neighbors, will work with all the the major stakeholders to kind of put this together.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But but I have to say that I feel like this gasification process is sort of a separate issue. And, you know, I have received calls to delay this this issue and so that this organization and this group can convene first and then make a decision on the gasification process.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But my questions were answered in this and I think David Braswell and we talked today, talked about these are just park issues, right? This is not going to be a commercial facility. I think a lot of phone calls and emails that I received today is was worried about this being this this kind of solid waste facility in'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the middle of of the park. And that's not what we're looking at at all. I want to I want to put people's attention to 1.5 million of waste that gets trucked out of City Park into a wasteland that, you know, we don't really see a lot in Denver, but a lot of folks who live close to it'",
        "'speaker_2': ', this this feels like an opportunity for the city. It feels like an opportunity for many of the organizations in our city to start thinking about zero waste. And so I will be supporting this. I will be supporting this with an astronaut.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And the asterisk is that we as a community kind of come together and begin figuring out what this what do developments, what do initiatives in the future look like? Do we have a process for it? Because we don't have a process currently and we need to develop one.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And my encouragement to the zoo is you do have neighbors. We do have neighbors, and we have to engage them. And there needs to be regular check ins with the neighborhood on how this process is going, even if it's quarterly of Hey Here, the here are the readings that we have from our facility.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This is how much we have been using that. What do you guys think about this and getting folks, engaging folks into that? So I'll be supporting this, but I will also be supporting much more community engagement in a task force going forward.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Councilman Brooks. Councilwoman Shepherd.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. Council President Herndon, I will not be here next week for second reading. So I really wanted to make my comments tonight and I really want to thank my I think my colleague, Councilman Brooks, really touched on a lot of the key issues and did a great job.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But I think we've all learned a lot through this process in especially on on what Councilman Brooks talked about is like the back of things and how often that topic comes up in conversation. I mean, sort of rhetorically, there's a rhetorical question.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I mean, everything has a back, doesn't it? Or does it or should it or what should it look like or, you know, where should it face? I think that's a really big question that we should talk about a whole lot more comprehensively as we launch into the to the redo of our blueprint, Denver, which is our land'",
        "'speaker_7': 'use and transportation plan, which process will start in 2015. So there's an opportunity to address this question in a in a more holistic and comprehensive way. Secondly, I know that the zoo has learned a lot from this process.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You know, and I know these are good people I'm looking at. You know, I'm looking at them. I've known George Pond for quite a while now. I know that they have heard you. And that they are committed to working with you, to really finding ways to help beautify that back side of the park, to make it a'",
        "'speaker_7': 'better transition or boundary between the two. I, you know, I believe them. I can see them nodding vigorously. And I know that they're going to work together with you in this coming year. And I think there'll be a lot of opportunity for public input about what that looks like.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I believe you have the support of everyone on council as well around that. Thirdly, I mean, you know, I've heard great commitment on the part of Councilman Brooks to forming that neighborhood advisory committee. He just outlined, you know, all of the issues that they want to tackle, not just in relation to the zoo, but at the'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Museum of Nature and Science. And I trust that that process is going to move forward and move forward in a good way. Fourth, I just also want to touch on the issue of waste. There's a lot of goals that we are trying to accomplish here.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I sit on the Sustainability Advisory Council, as does my colleague, Councilwoman Peggy Lehman, and we just completed our 2020. And by the way, so does George Pond. And there's I commend him for serving on that committee, because it's mostly partners that are directly here in the city from the city departments that are on that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So he sits on that as a as a partner who isn't actually from the city. The 2020 goals in the waste category are this specifically to reduce waste disposed of by the city through its operations, through delivery to a landfill by 30% in 22 in 2020 over the 2012 baseline.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Secondly, the community goal, the broader community goal is to reduce waste disposed of by delivery to a landfill by 20% over our 2012 baseline. So the reduction of 1.5 million not going to that landfill is very significant. Not only that, this is a cutting edge, proprietary process that not only the zoo is going to use and in'",
        "'speaker_7': ', you know, continue its goal of being net zero eventually and the greenest zoo of America. But that can be replicated in many institutions across this whole country and hopefully our own city here shortly as well. So I think, you know, it's going to be an exemplary, amazing experience that we're about to experiment, that we're about to go'",
        "'speaker_7': 'on, that we can all think, you know, deeply about about how we're going to reduce our waste and filling up our landfills very quickly. I just want to say, lest anyone is misled, Miss Lori Dana miller, our director of Parks and Recreation, is a city and county of Denver.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'RESIDENT. She is my constituent. She lives across the street from an equally historic park in the city and county of Denver. So she is deeply committed to how the public interfaces with our parks and what that experience is like.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And she's been active on those issues, not just as the director, but also as a citizen. So I just want to put that out there, lest anyone might think otherwise. But finally, I asked this question because I wanted to make sure the zoo has been there for 118 years.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's not just a historic park. It's a historic zoo that receives millions of visitors every year who treasure it. And it teaches us and educates us all, you know, from cradle to grave, about our world, about all the species who inhabit this world and how we have to care not only for them, but for their habitat, not'",
        "'speaker_7': 'just for our own survival, but for theirs as well. So in my mind, they're kind of married at this point, right? So, you know, just like any long term marriage, it's not always perfect. There are a lot of strengths.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And then there's always opportunities for growth, always opportunities to grow and improve. I you know, I just want to make sure that this discourse doesn't devalue the important, significant contribution that the zoo has made in conservation and education to the city and county of Denver and into the region.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I really hope, you know that we're not having a conversation about two different entities because they share and cohabit the same space and they have for over 100 years. We can do things better. I hear commitment from Councilman Brooks, and I know you're going to hear commitment from many other members of this council that we can'",
        "'speaker_7': 'always do it better and we are all going to hold each other accountable in that process. So I am voting yes to move this forward tonight, and I do thank you because I have learned a lot from this conversation.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Shepherd. Councilwoman Lemon.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. I hardly can add anything to what my fellow council people say. So I just.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Want to say.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That this has been a long term thing that we have all been aware.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Of and.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Worked with. And it has come to this point, which is a pretty exciting point, and we will continue to work with and come to it. There have been many, many. We know that the zoo is committed to public outreach.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'They from 29 to 2013, they went they have done a lot of public outreach on this so that we all share the same values. Where I am glad that there is a new group that really wants to be involved and I welcome their involvement and I think I'm going to vote yes for this and just look forward'",
        "'speaker_8': 'to the next steps. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Lemon. Councilman Lopez.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I am going to I am going to vote for this. I did. I do see the benefit to this new technology. I do see the benefit for the conversion and the fact that it doesn't smell.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I mean, I know a lot of places whose. Well, never mind. But let's just say I know that smell and I wish we had an ordinance on that. But but I think this is going this is a very good idea.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think it's brilliant. And it makes me want elephants in my neighborhood so that we can go on, get off the grid. You know what I'm saying? No, it's not flying oak. Oh, you know, in all seriousness, I do understand the residents concerns.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I do see that when you look at the building, you look at the backside is not pretty and it doesn't match with the neighborhood. But, you know, when you when you see that, when you see that side, it begs to see art, our mural ism, something that ties the zoo to the park.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I could I can I can imagine so many. I actually have a guy who did our Barnum mural. His his name is feud it was Chris go by Knox in Alameda and look at the mural he did it is amazing and it ties in the circus because of Barnum and P.T. Barnum and all that history we have'",
        "'speaker_3': 'in the neighborhood. But could you imagine something like that on that facade? It ties right into city park. Could you imagine a mixed media? I mean, I'm not talking about my favorite horse at dinner. I love that guy, but I kind of am.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There's something that we can do to make that better. And I think there's something I mean, it's more than just that, how it looks and the facade. Right. It's it's looking at the zoo as a park as well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It is. It's timeless. It's 118 years old. It's that 57 Chevy that just a little bit of a little bit of turtle wax. I'm sorry, folks. Amphibian folks. Are they here? No. Reptile, reptile with a little bit of it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You make it shine. And it's a classic and it's an instant classic. And that's what the zoo is. That's what city park is. And one wouldn't be without the other. City park wouldn't be what it is without the zoo, to be quite honest.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It wouldn't the zoo wouldn't be what it is without City Park. And I think it's I think it's imperative that there is communication, there is some ongoing communication, that there is some coordination. Denver is a growing metropolitan city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We should act like it. And these two uses meet perfectly. It's just a matter if. It's. If it's a. It's a visual thing. Let's get it done. There's a lot of walls in our district. I did not add to the property value in our neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We put art on them. Next thing you know, everybody wants to live next to the mural. There it is. So with that, I mean, I'm I'm supportive I'm supportive of these permit. I do hear you out City Park and I think the further communication and coordination is going to be super beneficial.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Councilman Lopez. Councilwoman Robb.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I want to thank the people who came to testify. And I want to thank the zoo. The zoo. You did do a lot of outreach. I know you care about the community, people who are opposing this.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'You did a very good job of making yourself heard in being sure that we did our homework, really knew what we were approving, because I believe this is a very serious consideration. And I looked at the criteria that we have to approve by, and I think they have been satisfied.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The effect on the surrounding area was probably the greatest one to think about. But I have to say, going through this process, it's listening process. I'm puzzled on two counts. The first thing that puzzles me is that last September 2013, the zoo mailed to 65,000 people on their mailing list.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So granted, probably zoo members, some in the neighborhood, some outside notified the R.A. had 65 people, which is pretty good attendance for a public meeting at a public meeting. And then in October, Prep had an informational item. Their agendas are public.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Especially the park advocates in this city. Watch that. On November 14th, there was a public hearing. No one spoke. The building then was completed in 2011. And although I don't represent the area, I did chair what was known as Ludy and Parks came under that I never since 2011 heard anything that drew my attention to the south'",
        "'speaker_10': 'side of the zoo where my attention should have been drawn. I will say, and I understand that friends and neighbors of city parks, the new group, and I think they have legitimate concerns about the south side of the zoo.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And that brings me to the second puzzling item of this. We have a 4700 square foot building there that was built in there, was planned in 2009, built in 2011. And yet the back of the south side of the zoo really looks incomplete in its cheek two and a half years later.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So the frustration mounts. Now, let me just say this. One thing I've learned in public office is you never get an A in process. I'm not sure neighborhoods get a day at council, certainly doesn't get an A. It's a very hard thing to do well.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So that brings me to I really applaud Councilman Burke's approach. I was fascinated to compare the cooperative agreement between the zoo and the city with the cooperative agreement of the Botanic Gardens in the city. Since I represent the area where the Botanic Gardens is and that agreement with the Botanic Gardens was done before I was in office'",
        "'speaker_10': '. But we've had our share of controversy at the Botanic Gardens, too, about buildings, but it requires it has teeth, it requires a neighborhood advisory group, requires neighborhood trustees, it requires notification of that group. The groups are official. So if you don't get the message, you you follow down.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'If you don't speak when it's time to speak, you've fallen down. So I really do hope there may be a better approach in City Park. It's not one size fits all, but I really do hope that the process goes quickly.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I considered the delay and was still considering it during this meeting, but I will say I think it took four years to do this amendment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To the.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Botanic Gardens Agreement and you guys really just need to get to work on this stakeholders group or whatever is set up. It's going to be a long discussion, but it'll be a discussion for the good. So thank you, everyone.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Robb. Councilwoman Monteiro.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I want to thank everybody who came out tonight, and I want you to know that through the conversation, I was very uncomfortable with some of the things that were being presented on part of the Denver Zoo, because I kept thinking if if this was in my council district, what would I do?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And in retrospect, I would have I would have really and not that nobody I don't want to cast aspersions on anybody, but I just feel that somewhere along the line, the communication sort of did fall by the wayside.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And for that I feel uncomfortable and that I was a little bit confused too, about the neighborhood concerns. People have been talking about the backside and, you know, and and to me, that's a I mean, that's an easy remedy if people come together and they want to make for a better design.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I didn't hear too much in terms of fears around if the unforeseen should happen. That's why I was asking the questions about the Denver Fire Department and what a response plan was for neighbors and even people utilizing the zoo.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So that I didn't feel 100% confident about that. But I do feel 100% confident about confident about is that Councilman Brooks has. Has made the commitment and so has the zoo. And so has. Right now the Friends of City Park to come back to the table and start addressing some of the concerns and fears that people and'",
        "'speaker_8': 'and maybe even participants will have. Those didn't come through very, very clearly. It was mostly about what we don't want. And being able to have a group come together and talk with one another, hopefully will move the needle on what we do want and how we want to communicate with the zoo.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I have a tendency I love the zoo, but I also have a tendency to understand that the zoo is. A neighbor. And there's always that constant. Tension. About how can we become better neighbors? And so my hope is, is this moves forward that it is an opportunity to bring people together and to have had substantial conversations about'",
        "'speaker_8': 'opening up the lines of communication. So I will be supporting it. I trust Councilman Brooks 100% in this particular situation and the zoo and well in any. He laughed. I was talking about this. This, this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Only on this one. Only.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'No, no, I wasn't. I was we're talking about this. But and also the neighborhood that everyone will come back to the people and and work this out. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Monteiro. Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I'll try to be brief, because I think many of my comments have been made already. First of all, I want to thank all of the people who have written to my office and express their views on all sides on this issue.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Appreciate the time. I had to sit down with the folks from the zoo to learn about this process. I think some of the concerns about air quality are real that people will need to be engaged in to monitor that because of some of the various types of chemicals that are used in the process.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But I think by creating this community advisory committee to not only be engaged in the park as a whole, but with the work that will go on with this waste to energy process, I think is important. As a city, we have a new climate adaptation plan that the mayor rolled out this year that calls for trying to'",
        "'speaker_8': 'reduce our overall emissions. And this is one step in that direction. There are many things the city is working on and talking about to try to move us in that direction. You've got states like California that are zero emission, states that are doing incredible things with, you know, hydrogen fueling stations all up and down the coast and'",
        "'speaker_8': 'lots of other things. And we're all being asked to do our part so that we can realize that climate change is real and the impact it's having on our environment is real. The fact that we've got less water, it's going to impact our our food supply.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So we're all going to have to be doing our part to address this issue. And so for that, I commend the work that you all are doing to move in that direction. I think this is this is going to be good for the city in terms of being, you know, one of those projects out of the chute'",
        "'speaker_8': ', as you indicated. You know, Denver Zoo is the only zero waste facility and others will be coming in looking at Denver Zoo to see how how we did it. You know, are there other areas in the Denver metro community that can learn from this?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I know from work that I did with Enroll participating in their energy executive program, this is something that they have been working on with private sector folks for quite some time. They actually, you know, do this process on their site out in Golden to fuel part of their operations.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so I think this is going to be good for the city. I think the issues with the neighborhood can be addressed through this process. And I just have to say that. The community process you went through. Have you not done that?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'This room would be full tonight and people would be screaming and hollering at us to not let this go forward, to demand that we we, you know, take additional steps. And I think the fact that and it's not to discount the input that we've had from those of you who are here that did testify.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But I think that says a lot to the process that you were engaged in because this is an active community and had homework not been done. We would be here for another few more hours. So, again, I'll be supporting this tonight.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Ortega. Councilman Brown.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I see this as a win win tonight. It's a win for the neighbors because they will get a in the hand. They have tonight got a commitment from their councilman that they're going to establish a neighborhood advisory committee and the zoo is going to work with that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I know councilman will ride herd on this project. And secondly, the zoo gets an innovative project. One in which we should all be proud, and we'll put Denver on the map. And that's why I'm supporting it this evening.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Councilman Brown. Councilman Brooks.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah, thank you. You know, I want to thank Scott. I want to just mention this record. Thank Scott Gilmore for for getting me these final recommendations for the City Park Partnership Task Force that was created in 1997, which the City Park friends and neighbors came up with.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And, you know, all things always come around because the person who's on here who who really helped drive this was Hiawatha Davis, who we talked about earlier tonight. And so we will we will attempt to work hard to recreate what he did in the city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we know that he was a driver. So I'm excited to put on it. And by the way, in 1987, I was graduating from high school. But just to start out, throw that out there. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Councilman Brooks. All right. Any other comments on 941 C? None, Madam Secretary. Roll call.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Brooks I brown fats. I can eat lemon. LOPEZ All right. MONTEIRO Hi.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Has been moved in second it. Now we need a motion to postpone. Councilman Brown.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Has been moved in. Second. Do you have any additional comments? Councilman Brown. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Once again, I'm requesting that this postponement be voted on available in a favorable manner tonight in order to allow the applicant in the neighborhood to resolve still outstanding issues.'",
