        "'speaker_6': 'I would be happy to. Proclamation number 181511 is recognizing Donna Altieri, founder of Altri Instrument Days in the City and County of Denver.

        "'speaker_6': 'straps. And we're as she expanded her product line, two bags for French horns, flutes and nearly all symphony instruments and developed a customer base around the world. And. Whereas, she designed bags for traditional Japanese instruments for musicians in Denver's sister city of Takayama, Japan.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And. Whereas, Altieri, instrument bags have always been manufactured in Denver using American components first in the Baker neighborhood, then in Curtis Park for the last 15 years, and again in Baker. And. Whereas, Altieri bakes, instrument bags have employed a workforce made up mostly of women, including people working from home grazing families, those struggling to find employment parolees'",
        "'speaker_6': 'and at least one relocated refugee, all making high wages for for the sewing trade. And. Whereas, ultra instrument bags ultimately grew to export half of its instrument bags internationally. And. Whereas, Altieri adds, Fruit Bags was recently acquired by JL Smith of Charlotte, North Carolina, in a transaction intended to keep up with the growing demand, expanding the workforce'",
        "'speaker_6': 'and committing to keep the business. This in Denver. Now, therefore, be it proclaimed by the Council of City and County of Denver, Section one, that Donna Rael Terry be honored for producing the first backpack for professional musician for developing the industry standard known around the world.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'For instrument bags. For her business acumen in professional music. For her insistence on making the instrument bags locally using American components. And an underserved labor force for exporting these Denver products around the world. And for working to keep all Terry bags in Denver and section two that the seal of the city and county of Denver be affixed'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. President. As you know, this is a business in your district of the Baker neighborhood. And I had an opportunity to go to this site and see where these bags were actually produced. And at least one of the women who was one of the employees that helped make these bags also got to see some of'",
        "'speaker_6': 'the personal bags that Donna had made for herself, that I was encouraging her to make these and put them on the market because they're they're unique in in not only in their design, but they are so efficient in terms of the kind of bags that women normally want to carry where you're having to, you know, take a'",
        "'speaker_6': 'an iPad or a laptop. And most of them, you know, have the straps. You carry it like a backpack. But just the commitment that Donna had to keeping this business in Denver, working with local workforce and just seeing how this.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'What started out really is just providing a bag for somebody that that needed to figure out how to carry their instrument around and seeing how it grew to becoming an international business where people were reaching out to her from around the globe, saying, where can I get one of these bags for my instrument and where they didn't'",
        "'speaker_6': 'exist for certain instruments? She created a new bag for the different instruments that people were needing them for. And so when I was contacted asking if this was something I would be willing to do. Obviously the Baker neighborhood was part of my old district, and Donna's got long presence in that neighborhood, and I was just honored to'",
        "'speaker_6': 'be asked to do this. And so I just want to encourage my colleagues to support this tonight and just join me in congratulating Donna for her commitment to working with our local community in this way. That hopefully sets an example for many of our other businesses in the city of Denver.'",

You know, when I was in committee, I asked the same questions that I asked in mayor council, and that is regarding the intersection at 14th and Federal Boulevard.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's still very unclear and I haven't got any kind of answer yet whether we whether CDOT indeed studied that intersection or not, and that they studied 14th and federal and said no formally. And the other question I have is whether the city even asked whether they to study the intersection.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We still haven't I still haven't received adequate information or any kind of response as to whether that indeed took place. It is a very dangerous intersection. It's an intersection, I think, that would benefit from a tool like like our photo radar, especially when it comes to pedestrian and auto accidents.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I know that typically photo radar is intended for folks that are running red lights and auto and reducing auto auto accidents. We all can agree that a lot of you know what would remedy the situation would be more officers.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But since we do not have the budget and we've actually came down in the number of folks on patrol, these questions are important. And it's important to know, especially when as a city, we've signed on to a Vision Zero philosophy and goals.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilman Lopez, Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Generally, I am supportive of photo radar in our community. Photo red light that helps us look at keeping our intersections safe. The one thing that I was surprised and if this was already mentioned, I apologize because I was out in the hall.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But when we had the presentation to our committee and learned that the data that is collected on accidents does not include pedestrians that are struck by a vehicle or fatalities that involve pedestrians, that is not part of the data that Vision Zero looks at.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's only car accidents, cars against each other. And I think we need to be collecting that data because we already know, for example, Federal Boulevard is one of the most unsafe pedestrian corridors. We've had a number of fatalities in Councilman Flint's district by Loretta Heights.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We've seen a number of serious injuries. I'm not sure the stats on fatalities at 14th and federal where we have a rail stop, but people cross that to catch a bus and they'll dart across traffic. I've seen that multiple times because I'm in that area on a regular basis.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And it's not to say this is the only corridor and the only intersection in the city. But I think it is important that we begin to collect the data that helps us to be more accurate in targeting the resources where we need to address them.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And we know that 14 in federal is, in fact, one of those intersections that has had a lot of challenges and problems. So I support the postponement so that we can have more discussion about this and be able to bring it back.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And hopefully, I don't know what the the lever is to get us to start collecting the pedestrian data, but I think around the city that is really critical. I don't even know if it includes bikes, but if bikes are not included as well, that that should be in terms of the accidents and potential fatalities as well.'",

        "'speaker_13': 'It all goes back to the Denver Comprehensive Plan 2000. That speaks to the Central Plan Valley as an area that is poised to become an example of both urban environmental protection and sustainable economic development. Blueprint Denver, that's in place, currently speaks to downtown more broadly in terms of the centerpiece of the city and truly of the region'",
        "'speaker_13': 'with the highest intensity of uses. And then the downtown area plan from 2007 spoke to the Central Platte Valley. Again, and specific to this area about opportunities that are beginning to emerge to densify these areas as parking is becoming less important and there is mode shift towards transit resources and the downtown plan amendment and the area plan'",
        "'speaker_13': 'amendment that was passed earlier this year and sorry, in June of 2018 really dove into a lot of detail about this area specifically. And then the future blueprint Denver, a draft of which the next draft will be coming out here later in the early part of 2019, continues on this discussion about downtown being our area of the'",
        "'speaker_13': 'most intensity and greatest height. So the downtown area plan amendment, as I mentioned, focused in specifically on Central Plat Valley or area. This is the district that's bound by I-25, Speer Boulevard on the north in an area parkway to the south and east.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'It builds upon that 27 downtown area plan and provides very specific recommendations in the same framework as the original downtown area plan to create and support a prosperous, distinctive, walkable, diverse and green city. And specifically, it addresses and establishes a vision about this area to become a neighborhood that is more integrated with the adjacent downtown and residential'",
        "'speaker_13': 'areas and matures into its own diverse and dense and distinctive neighborhood that connects the city to the river and really brings enhanced amenities to the existing and future residents. One of the most important things about the plan amendment is there is a very specific implementation section towards the end of the document that speaks directly to how do'",
        "'speaker_13': 'we move from vision to reality through a series in a system of regulatory tools, particularly, how do we calibrate the intensity of this area appropriately to be higher near the rail stations, the existing transit stations that are there, and then lower intensities near the river and adjacent existing buildings and neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'How do we promote a variety of building height and density to create some energy and excitement? How do we support diverse and desired architectural form and streetscapes? How do we start to break down a downtown environment to something that feels more comfortable at the human scale?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'How do we encourage those vibrant, mixed use streets in a neighborhood that's truly mixed use? And really, most importantly, how do we promote a diverse community with incentives for affordable housing? So how do we create a mechanism in a system that rewards higher development intensity with greater affordable housing?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And then finally, to get to some of the more qualitative aspects that are really challenging to address through zoning. How do we use a system of design review and design standards and guidelines to really get to that rich architectural quality that people are interested in?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So the regulatory framework that we're going to cover is fairly complex. There's a number of different mechanisms that we are using, four of which we are going to be talking about this evening. So the first is the text amendment to the Denver zoning code.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'That's what establishes these new zone districts to apply to the CPA area location. Part and parcel with that directly related is the amendment to the Denver Revised Municipal Code, which is before you as 18 dash 1407 that was just discussed earlier.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'This is what creates the actual affordable housing mechanism that's directly tied to the zoning. There's also design standards, the guidelines that I mentioned that will eventually be adopted as rules and regulations through our department, and then on a project by project basis, individual properties would come forward and request a rezoning, the first of which we're going to'",
        "'speaker_13': 'talk about this evening. And then there's a development agreement that is associated with that rezoning that will also be discussing that puts in place a process to develop. This other item is on the screen called the Infrastructure Master Plan that gets into much, much more detail related to the actual utilities and infrastructure, roads, connectivity, those kinds of'",
        "'speaker_13': 'things that Councilwoman Ortega was talking about in terms of how do we address some of the capacity issues when we're talking about a large development? So we're not at that point yet, but that is part of the development agreement that that will talk about in a little bit more detail this evening.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So the sponsors of this text amendment to the Denver zoning code are Councilman Brooks and Espinoza. Portions of the Central Platte Valley Area District fall both within portions of District one and District nine. The Denver Zoning Code Text Amendment itself, as I mentioned, establishes new zone districts for this particular area, implements the objectives of the plan amendments'",
        "'speaker_13': ', and the individual property owners need to come forward and request that rezoning. So the text amendment itself establishes a zone district, but they are not being legislatively applied. That is the individual property owners that are approaching us to request the rezoning.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And then as I mentioned before, there is the related Denver Revised Municipal Code Amendment to Chapter 27 that's being sponsored by our Department Community Planning and Development and the Office of Economic Development to establish those affordable housing provisions that are related to the use of incentive height.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'That's all part of the zoning package. The public process for this regulatory implementation has been a robust one. We we really dovetailed right on the heels of the adoption of the plan amendment. We began right away in July with a series of planning board information items to talk about the zoning tools that we can use here.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'We had a series of community open houses as well, culminating then and on two months ago to the day here to our planning board public hearing where it was recommended to move forward by a vote of 9 to 1.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'We through the process with the ludie committee and then noticing of course in public hearing tonight just as a look forward, the design standards and guidelines are in process in our department currently. They're in draft form, they're under internal review and we're hoping that those will be completed in the early part of next year.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'We're targeting a March 6th hearing and planning board for that. Ideally, the public comment on the text amendment itself has been fairly limited outside of the the community open houses and discussions that we've had there. We've received seven emailed comments prior to the Planning Board public hearing.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'There were five speakers at that hearing, four directly in support and one in support that had a few other comments for us to consider. And then a letter of support as well has arrived into our offices. So I'm going to dove into a little bit more about what's actually in the zoning for these CPD or area districts'",
        "'speaker_13': '. And I'm going to try to relate the specific design standards and items in the zoning back to those plan amendment objectives that are described and particularly address the zoning and design standards and the quality of of this area.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So the first one is how do we calibrate development intensity? As we mentioned, this is a 120 to 150 acre site overall is the district. And so how do we calibrate that development intensity appropriately across that entire area?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So the text amendment this evening would establish three new downtown context zone districts. That would be the downtown Central Platte Valley area. So that creates the DCP prefix, and these would be the transition river and center districts. You can see by the by the diagram here that generally those three districts then relate to an overall intensity.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'The two on the left, the transition and the river district are somewhat lower in intensity. And then the center district, which would be the highest intensity district, is shown there on the right. And I'm going to talk a little bit more about each of these individually, because we've approached this notion of lower intensity in two slightly different'",
        "'speaker_13': 'ways, according to those transition in those river districts. So the first one in the transition district is really intended to be just that, a transition from this area to existing structures that would be within the overall area of Central Valley or area or existing buildings that perhaps are on the other side of Speer Boulevard or existing neighborhoods'",
        "'speaker_13': 'like the Jefferson Park neighborhood that's on the west side of I-25. So here, because there is some existing context for us to respond to. There's existing structures, existing buildings. We have taken the approach that intensity should be limited through a height limit so that we create an appropriate transition and contextual relationship to those existing buildings.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So here there is a building form that is allowed to go up to 12 stories, and that transition district is appropriately located within about a block of those established neighborhoods and buildings. You can see on the screen highlighted in yellow that generally the appropriate areas for that transition district would be near that intersection of Speer in an'",
        "'speaker_13': 'area and extending up each of those streets slightly. And then also on the western side, particularly along Water Street. The River district then is a little bit different in that it is also lower intensity. But we've addressed this through instead of a height limit, we have addressed it through restrictions on the bulk or the girth of the'",
        "'speaker_13': 'buildings. So basically what happens here is there's building forms that are allowed to have a much shorter street wall. So the as you're walking down the sidewalk, the building that you might experience is in that 3 to 5 story range, but then would allow for much taller buildings.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'But they must be very thin in relative profile and widely spaced. There was a lot of guidance from the public and from the community through the plant amendment process to preserve something like porosity or permeability, a kind of a connection to the river, both physically and visually.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So we did that appropriately through allowing these taller buildings, but much, much smaller footprints as you go taller. And then finally the center district, which is the most intense district. This is really intended to have the widest variety of not only uses, but also building forms.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'We've introduced a third building form that allows for a slightly larger building that would accommodate a larger commercial office tenant. Typically, they need a larger footprint in terms of their architectural building to meet their requirements. And so we've introduced that here.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So in the center district there, the height limits and the limitations are basically address through the various building forms. There's the general building form that has a height limit. There is what's called the standard tower, which has a little bit more flexibility, a little bit more size, but has a floor area ratio cap on it and limitation'",
        "'speaker_13': '. And then there is a point tower form that has the most restrictive design requirements as you go as you go taller. So the next item here in terms of objectives that we're trying to address through the zoning is how do we promote this variety of context sensitive buildings?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And I sort of alluded to that in terms of these various building forms. So these are used in combination where in different zoned districts there are different building forms that are allowed. And you can see as you move sort of from left to right on the screen, the height or the floor area that's allowed the overall intensity'",
        "'speaker_13': 'of those buildings increases as you move from left to right. The upper storey design requirements or the limitations on the overall size of the building also get stronger and stronger as you move from left to right. So there's a there's a connection there between the allowed floor area and the allowed intensity with the limitations and the restrictions'",
        "'speaker_13': 'on the architectural form. And one of the most important things I think, to note here is that all of the street level and the lower storey design requirements, the things that we as members of the public walking down the street would really experience things like street level activity, uses, transparency, those kinds of things.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Those are exactly the same across all of the building forms. So this is just another summary. The general is 12 stories allow is allowed in the transition or the center district it's much shorter it's only five story high limit in the river the standard tower, which is sort of that office, commercial office building type of building form'",
        "'speaker_13': 'that's only allowed in the central district, our highest intensity district. And then the point tower has the highest design restrictions as as you grow taller. So this is just sort of a visual summary of how these might be applied across these various zone districts.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Transition only allows the general, the river district includes that general form at a much shorter level and the point tower, but it has a much shorter street wall of five stories and then the center district allows all three of those.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So then how do we support this desired architectural forum? I've talked about these limitations, these upper storey limitations. As you get taller. We've developed a series of new rules of measurement for our development services and project review teams to use as they're evaluating future projects.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So really the tradeoff is as you grow taller, you must grow smaller. So we're we're really trying to shape taller buildings to make sure that we are protecting access to the sun sky, limiting the impacts of shadows and really trying to relate taller buildings to a more human scale at the street level.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So there's a tower floor plate area restriction on certain building forms as the overall square footage or size of a of a floor as you go taller, a linear dimension that speaks to the relative proportion of the building.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So we're trying to avoid very thin and very long blade like buildings that tend to cause really strong shadows and block views. And then also the floor separation. So if we're going to allow tall buildings, we want to make sure that there's enough space between all of those two to allow for views and sun and sky access'",
        "'speaker_13': '. This is just a summary of these things, and I don't necessarily expect you to go through each of these in great detail, but I think it's important to note that you can see the on the floor plate area, which is about halfway down here on the chart.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'The point our allowance, the maximum floor plate allowance on the point tower is half less than half of what the standard tower would allow. And the tower separation, particularly along the river, is upwards of 120 feet. And I think it's important to note that currently in our downtown core zoning there is no separation requirement other than what'",
        "'speaker_13': 'would be required for fire protection, which can be as little as 20 to 30 feet. So we're talking about a very significant increase in a required tower spacing to open open this area up. I should also mention before I move on very quickly, is the standard tower, which is the middle tower form that I've mentioned that relates'",
        "'speaker_13': 'to more commercial office type projects. We want that tower. We want that building form to only be used for those types of projects. And so we did actually also include a use limitation so that in that tower portion you must be less than 50% residential for those.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So that the so that the sort of the the largest of those buildings is used for those commercial tenants that really need it. So finally, how do we encourage active and engaging streets here? We've talked a lot about big, tall buildings.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'What's that going to feel like down on the on the ground floor, on the street level? So all of these lower story and street level standards apply to all the building forms and all the districts. They really attempt to create that richness and human scale that we've been talking about.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So how do we use things like setbacks and reduction of mass? How do we create an enhanced setback for residential units? So when there's a residential unit that comes all the way down to the street, how do we give them a little bit of extra room so that they can there there can be a more appropriate transition'",
        "'speaker_13': 'between that private and public realm. There is an open space requirement on larger lots. And then how do we activate that street? So again, this mixture and these requirements for build to transparency, requiring street level active uses and also on a few key streets, we've included some standards related to requiring nonresidential uses so that we can ensure'",
        "'speaker_13': 'that some of those key streets that were identified in the plan amendment actually have that higher intensity of commercial retail types of uses. It's also important to note that within each of these zoned districts, all of the streets that are going to be created will be classified as primary streets, and that includes the South Platte River frontage'",
        "'speaker_13': '. So if you're familiar with other areas of the zoning code, we typically have a primary street and a side street designation where the side street has lower requirements and lower standards for transparency and things like that. Here we wanted to make sure that every street was held to the highest level.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Parking. Parking is a big deal. And activity, the effect of parking and particularly parking structures on the activity on the street is really dramatic. And so one of the things that is also included here is that there is a requirement for an active use to be wrapped around that parking structure for the majority of the facade along'",
        "'speaker_13': 'the street. So the visibility of that structure is very, very limited. We're also implementing a parking maximum. So I think that that's a very important step for the city that has not been done yet in that there's a limitation on the amount of parking that is going to be allowed as part of a project here.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And so there's no minimum parking requirement that's consistent with other downtown zoning districts. But there is a parking maximum. And then just a subtle nuance here in terms of the way parking floor area is calculated that is incorporated now into the way the standard tower floor area is calculated.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So in the downtown core, parking doesn't count against you in terms of in terms of your overall floor area. But here in these districts, it will finally some other quick notes on permitted uses in the parking maximums. So the permitted uses in this district are what you would imagine for a downtown type of district, a very wide'",
        "'speaker_13': 'range of residential and commercial and entertainment types of uses. They generally follow the current allowed uses within Arapahoe Square. We did make the additions in the center district, the most intense district of a hospital use and also the arena stadium use.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'We wanted to make sure that those were both available to to future projects potentially in the Central District. And then in terms of the parking maximums, most of those are based on a total floor area calculation. But in terms of residential, we based that on the number of bedrooms, we we wanted to make sure that we were'",
        "'speaker_13': 'not somehow disincentivizing larger residential units if we were to set a parking maximum that was strictly set on the number of units. So we we are digging in a little bit deeper and basing that on the number of bedrooms.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And another key important aspect is that the bicycle parking requirements here, the minimum requirements are approximately double what we see elsewhere in the city. So we're really trying to move the needle in terms of focusing the development in this area and within the zone districts away away from the car and more towards bicycle and other active modes'",
        "'speaker_13': 'of transportation.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think that's excellent. Excellent.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Mr. Barge.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'All right. So I'll shift gears for just a moment. I'm a barge with the Department of Community Planning and Development. I apologize. I wasn't able to identify myself on the earlier question. As Christopher mentioned, this is a really important aspect of the system to implement the plan for this area that the the plan amendment for CPV or'",
        "'speaker_11': 'area says more about affordable housing than other any other area plan that's that's been adopted, to our knowledge, in Denver. And one of the important concepts in the plan is that this this great higher density active downtown neighborhood, that the value that's created by that development potential through the through the zoning be leveraged to obtain specific community'",
        "'speaker_11': 'benefits. Denver has a lot of needs. The primary one, you know, that we're all talking about now is affordable housing. And so we've proposed a system that's linked to the zoning that would share the value of that increased development potential by requiring additional affordable housing for the projects that that use that use that and that they meet'",
        "'speaker_11': 'the plan objectives for affordable housing at low and moderate income levels and to ensure a variety of unit types and sizes and that there be affordable housing that's for sale and for rent, so that the zoning sets a five storey height threshold beyond which these special requirements would apply.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And so there's no special requirements for development up to five storeys. But in at least two of the districts, there's a lot of development potential beyond five storeys. And the special requirements would would then apply. The way that it's set up is that that five storey threshold is in the in the zoning text amendment and that allows'",
        "'speaker_11': 'from seven stories of additional height in the transition district, which has a 12 storey height limit to potentially unlimited additional height with with a lot of design requirements in the other two districts. And then the Municipal Code Amendment, which will be before you as a separate vote, then provides the specific housing requirements that would apply when using'",
        "'speaker_11': 'the incentive height beyond five storeys. And the way that it's set up, the basic structure is similar to that of the thirty-eighths and Blake incentive overlay that city council approved earlier this year that ties back into the citywide linkage fee system and sets requirements a little differently depending on project type.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So for residential or residential mixed use projects that are that are primarily residential, it would actually require the provision of on site affordable units, whereas the citywide system says that's just an option or you can pay a fee in this system, residential projects would actually have to provide units and then provides a higher level of unit requirement'",
        "'speaker_11': 'for the square footage that's in the incentive high area for primarily commercial projects. There would still be multiple options available, including the option to pay a fee or to build units. But either way, the requirement based on the square footage of height or the square footage that's above the five storey threshold would be much higher than the'",
        "'speaker_11': 'citywide requirements. And we'll run through some examples and then a requirement that all large phased projects that will define in just a moment that are using incentive height, height above five stories, that they actually meet those incentive requirements by preparing an affordable housing plan that would be approved.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And I'll give you some details on that in just a moment. But first, some examples of how the basic incentive system would operate. So this is a really simple example. It's a it's a building that doesn't use incentive height, just a five storey building.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So on the left, that building built anywhere in the city would have the option to pay a linkage fee based on the 75,000 square foot residential total. The fee would be about $116,000, or it would have the option to build units instead.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'In this case, the requirement would be just one unit. And so just for example, in if approved and one of the new central Flat Valley area districts, the requirement would be exactly the same because this building isn't using incentive.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Fine. However, in this example, we now have a 12 storey building that is using incentive height. So if this building on the left were somewhere else in the city, let's say. See our Max 12 zone district where it was just operating under the citywide linkage fee system, would have the option to pay a linkage fee of about'",
        "'speaker_11': '$280,000, or if it exercised the option to build units, that would be three units. However, in the one of the new Central Valley area districts, the special requirements would apply. Number one, it's a it's a primarily residential building.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And this example, 100% residential. So the fee option doesn't exist. There would only be a unit option. And then the way the number of required units is calculated is to first take the the citywide requirement on all of the square footage in the building.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So that's the three units, same as the example on the left. And then the special incentive requirements based on the square footage above the fifth floor are a multiple of six times of the citywide unit requirement that generates 11 affordable units.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So that gets added to the three units for a total unit requirement of 14 units. So just to summarize on the left, if that 12 storey building were built somewhere else in the city, $280,000 or three units on the right, if it were built in a CPV zone district, there would be a requirement for units and it'",
        "'speaker_11': 'would be 14 units in this example. And then one more example is a big mixed use project that is in this example, primarily residential, although there's also a hotel component. So if built elsewhere in the city, this this large project would have the option to pay a linkage fee of over $1.2 million or build 15 affordable units'",
        "'speaker_11': '. And in one of the DC PV zoned districts, it's primarily residential. So again, it would have to provide the affordable housing units on site or in the immediate district, and that would be calculated by taking those 15 units, the citywide requirement.'"

        "'speaker_13': 'So we've started talking about this a little bit already. But one of the most important things that runs with this proposed rezoning is that because of the scale and the complexity of this project, there is an associated development agreement.'",

So in the development agreement, which is in the staff report, it includes a requirement for a process to complete this infrastructure master plan.'",

        "'speaker_13': ', but also our public works department and the Parks and Recreation Department and others within within our city agencies. So another aspect is for the the developer to develop a comprehensive transportation demand management program. So this is really over and above any parking maximum requirements that are already built into the zoning.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'This is a system of more programmatic elements that can be used to to limit the amount of of vehicular traffic and try to shift people towards other modes of transportation. Much further study on the vehicular and the pedestrian bicycle and transit connections here.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'As you're probably aware, this particular parcel is fairly isolated in terms of its connectivity to the greater street grid and and part of what would be required to allow the level of development that we're talking about here and that we've mentioned there's going to need to be a number of additional new connections, and those could be vehicular'",
        "'speaker_13': 'connections. They could be multi-modal transit connections, pedestrian bridges, other things like that. And so we don't know exactly how many or where those need to be. There's ideas and a vision for those things that are that are described in the plan amendment.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'But these future studies are going to help the developer and the city come to a more resolution about exactly what's required. There's a very specific requirement for the amount of open space within this project, a minimum of 12% of the net developable area.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So after all, public right of way and other items are subtracted out of that overall 58 acres, then 12% of that must be identified and specifically set aside as a public park and open space. There's been a negotiation with our Parks Department as to the the size and the character and the amenities that are provided in each'",
        "'speaker_13': 'of those different parks. So that's all, again, included in the development agreement that a minimum number of specific park types and amenities would need to be provided and including a few other community benefits, including a corn shell, actually the developer paying to build the core corn shell, improvements for a recreation center and also a new Parks Rec'",
        "'speaker_13': 'maintenance facility that is desperately needed in that area. One of the most critical items that's going to be really first on the docket for the developer as they move forward is there are significant floodplain issues with the current property.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And so the first thing is going to be how to address the floodplain and the river improvements that are associated with that. So that's really the first step towards actually in conjunction with the course development of an infrastructure master plan working through and determining what all of those mitigation needs are going to be and then actually executing'",
        "'speaker_13': 'those before moving forward with the project. Same thing with environmental remediation, as you're well aware of. The history of this site is very industrial, very linked to the to the rail history there. And so there's there's a significant amount of remediation to be addressed.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And so the development agreement sets forward a requirement to enter into a process to determine how that's going to be dealt with. And then also in the development agreement and the reason why it's being presented to you tonight is that there is a vesting of certain zoning requirements, particularly including some of the height and the.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'They are allowances and standards that are in the zoning. So the piece that everybody wants to talk about that's also part of the development agreement is this affordable housing plan. So as as Abe has described, the amendment that was just made and and approved to the revised municipal code establishes this requirement for any buildings that are above'",
        "'speaker_13': 'five stories that that actually execute on that incentive height. One of the ways to address that and one of the ways to qualify for that incentive height for a large or phased project is to develop this affordable housing plan.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So the the specific affordable housing plan that is that is tied to the river mill development and to this rezoning here tonight, as Melissa has mentioned, requires 15% of the overall number of housing units to be provided as affordable.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'There's minimum dedication of units as being affordable for the number of years. Minimum here is is 40 years. If there are any city subsidized, then that would trigger the six year duration that was just recently discussed and passed here by council.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'As Melissa also described, the requirements for a dedication of a number of those units or a certain percentage of those units to meet various levels of of ami portion of those units being affordable up to 100% if they are for sale minimum percentages to be a certain size so that we can encourage larger units, family, affordable units'",
        "'speaker_13': ', minimum percentage for for sale, for rent differences. And also this includes a mechanism for nonresidential uses to also contribute to the affordable housing requirements. So the revised municipal code amendment that was just passed that has a requirement for both residential and nonresidential types of projects, both of them have to meet a certain increased affordable housing standard.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'This does the same thing. So any kind of commercial development or nonresidential development also has a requirement to contribute funding towards additional units or to community serving uses. And the last note here is that there are compliance milestones that are built into that affordable housing plan.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So hopefully we can avoid the situation that happened at Stapleton, where a lot of that affordable housing was put off to the end. Here, there are compliance milestones that as the project is developed phase by phase, time by time, that there will be certain compliance requirements to be met as the project moves forward over a 20 to'",
        "'speaker_13': '25 year time frame. So the standard map amendment rezoning process has has carried forward. The property has been posted. Similarly, as as we did tonight, we went to a planning board with a combination text and map amendment and also this was recommended for approval by the planning board by the vote of 91, went to the land use'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Transportation Infrastructure Committee and then posted the property again for a city council hearing. And we are here this evening. And the the only public comment letter that we received specific to the rezoning was the same letter that was submitted by by Tim Bors related to both the text and the map amendment.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And that was in support. So the review criteria for rezonings is very similar to what we just discussed for the text amendment. There's a few additional at the at the end that I'll refer to, but making sure that the rezoning is consistent with adopted plans and as we described, the text amendment itself has taken care of a'",
        "'speaker_13': 'lot of these things. And so it's it's very clear that now the rezoning or the request by the property owner to rezone to those districts will be similarly consistent with those adopted plans. I talked through the comp plan 2000 strategies and some of the vision statements that are in in that comp plan.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'It's summarized in your staff report. One of the other items that is noted here was a legacy strategy here to identify areas within the city where increased density and new uses are desirable and can be accommodated. Blueprint Denver 2002.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Same thing here. It's in the downtown context. It's part of an area of change. All of this is consistent with the text amendment and the zone districts that were just adopted into rezone to this would would follow that pattern.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Blueprint Denver also talks about future street classification. There's very little road infrastructure at all that's internal to the site. Speer Boulevard and Area Parkway, way down at the very southern end is adjacent to the property. Those are identified as mixed use arterials.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And then the only other street is Ilitch Circle, which is identified in Blueprint as a non designated local. So again, the need for that infrastructure master plan as we move forward with this to define new streets and the street grid and the connectivity to the rest of the city is is going to be very important downtown area'",
        "'speaker_13': 'plan identified this this particular location is as an area for a future opportunities to densify and then same thing with the downtown area plan amendment which dove into again much more detail and spoke about how the regulatory tools could apply to to implement the plan objectives and move this forward.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So those those were all speaking to the consistency with the adopted plans. The the rezoning would also result in uniformity of district regulations. And between both the DCP River and center districts, it would further the public health, safety and welfare by implementing adopted plans and enabling this walkable urban neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And then the two additional items for rezonings. One of them is that there needs to be a justifying circumstance to help trigger and justify the change. And one of those justifying circumstances that would qualify is that the city has adopted plans and policies or changed the direction since 2010, which obviously this has happened.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So this has been met through the adoption of that downtown area plan amendment earlier this year. And then also another justifying circumstances is the changed or changing conditions. And I think we're all very aware of how much significant development has really happened in this particular location adjacent in the Union Station areas, Riverfront Park in the Commons area'",
        "'speaker_13': 'and even up into the into the Lower Highlands neighborhood, and then finally making sure that the rezoning and the request is consistent with the context and the zone district's purpose and intent. So in the text amendment that was adopted, there is clear language about the intent of these zoned districts and where they should be applied.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'The downtown neighborhood context itself consists of a mix of multi-unit and residential, commercial office, institutional etc. uses in large buildings containing one or more uses. That's the description of the downtown context that's in the Denver zoning code. We're obviously consistent with that.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And then the the river district as described in the new text amendment as appropriate, located within approximately one, two, one and a half blocks of the river and in the map. That is what's being proposed here. And then the Central District being located within approximately 2 to 3 blocks of those existing transit facilities, the consolidated, my main'",

        "'speaker_14': 'It's at moments like this when as the 38 year director of the Greenway Foundation, I get to witness a true and full realization of the Greenway Foundation's 45 year goal to allow the South Platte River to one day become the best place to work, live and play in Denver.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'This was if there can be anything such as the worst of the worst of the worst of what this river and the adjoining area used to be. This is it. The best thing we've found in this area is coal tar, and it goes downhill from there.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'And look what this is going to become. Look what this is going to become. And it is an opportunity to maximize the very birthplace of Denver. I'll conclude with this. I have engaged with numerous land owners, numerous developers, numerous visionaries.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'And I have not come upon an organization or group of partners that has engaged to maximize this river any stronger than this group has. Two examples. They are exceeding the minimum amount significantly of affordable housing within their site and they are exceeding the required amount of park space, open space and river space.'",

        "'speaker_14': 'Yeah. You're planning for five, ten, 20 years from now. This city is already being frantically, rampantly gentrified, so it's no telling what it's going to look like in five, ten, 20 years.

        "'speaker_14': 'Period. It's already are already currently seeing this already in these rebel mile districts and all these other zone districts is not going to solve that problem. Like was already stated, there is nobody here from the coalition. There is nobody here from DSA.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'There are children who are looking at this on TV and that's not a good thing to do. So. That's one, too. To get to the subject matter. I. Stand firm with the words in which I expressed, not necessarily in terms of exactly those particular words, but exactly those meanings.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I do not apologize for the meaning of what I said. I apologize for the manner in which I expressed that. This again required me to go to Google and look up some words that may be appropriate for kids looking.'",

Principles of this project would be giving input all the way along on how to make the river better, more effective, and a good place for all the creatures and the fish to live this point, I wish I had another 25'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. Present your closest to the microphone. I just want to ask the question about discussions you've had with the city, about the interface with the adjacent railroad line.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. As I think you referenced, nothing we've talked about preliminarily at least about raising the grade about 20 feet along what we call the back of the site. But the site that borders the CML rail line where the meat of that is going to come in is through our E&P discussions with staff as we further refine and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'refine the engineering for the site. But that's our intention right now and I think it does a couple of things for us as it relates to the railroad. I think it gives us that extra 20 feet of separation and safety as we think about raising the grade and then thinking about another two or three or four layer'",
        "'speaker_2': 'layers of parking above that. And so you kind of get to 50, 60 feet of grade separation from the rail. We also have some horizontal separation on our site plan. We have a service line in the back that further sets the buildings back.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I feel like we're doing the best we can there.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. I appreciate the attention to that as well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thanks. I have no further questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Ortega. Councilman Espinosa.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The one real trivial question, is it? Am I seeing this correctly? Is the fish logo play off of the map area?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Previously someone did a drawing depicting the site as a whale. But we didn't. We didn't steal the urban trout from the site. Plan to close it. It's a whale.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I don't know why I didn't think of this before, but it was it was actually driving around this week in this the Jefferson Park neighborhood plan contemplates a view plane. Jefferson Park is is unique, sort of like Zuni Park in that it has at least seasonally it has some amazing views of downtown.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And part of my history was sort of battling developers to sort of maintain little vignettes of our views from Jefferson Park to downtown. Do you guys has anyone in there? There are views that were preserved with development along that along Crescent Drive and River Drive.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Have you guys contemplated those vignettes when you when you've laid these things out? Because there are there are some buildings that actually would would be framed. I mean, potential plot layouts that would be framed by those views.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The short answer is we haven't gotten that granular on our site, plenty of the individual sites. It's interesting because when we started this process, I thought height and encroaching in to that neighborhood specifically might be an issue. And I don't want to put words in Michael Gates's mouth or Japan's mouth, but it really didn't come up in'",
        "'speaker_2': 'conversations. I think what the conversation was about was creating a new downtown view for Jefferson Park, one that might have some more interesting architecture attached to it. And I think going all the way back to the area plan amendment process, there was a really conscious conversation and and a decision about trading height for amenities.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think the neighbors got that and it was a very conscious decision for them.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah. Yeah. Our biggest issue is, you know, we didn't in the area plan, we didn't incorporate parts of Jefferson Park in the boundary for even the ability to sort of consider this porosity. But I think it would actually be welcome.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's a welcome tool and at least we just codified it. So it's something we can now explore. So could you you know, if this zoning is if this map amendment goes through, could you at least, you know, maybe charge your design team to at least go back to through Jefferson Park, look at those vignettes, sort of one'",
        "'speaker_4': 'more sort of, you know, relationship to other parts of the city to consider. Sure.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sure. We're happy to do that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'All right. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilman Espinosa, Councilman Brooks.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yup. I'm going to call a breeze. But first, let me let me ask Abe a quick question. Or Chris, it doesn't matter. You guys are like brothers. Quick question, just on overview real quick. Planning board, do we have any anybody in our position.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'At Planning Board? I think Mr. Elliott also voted no on the map amendment just for consistency with the fact that he thought the zone district shouldn't exist in the first place.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. I was about to say make sense, but to him make sense. Good consistency. And then real quick, again, letters of support from community folks saying we didn't have any letters of opposition at all. Okay, great. And this question is for Reese.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Reese, in the community, we had a lot of conversation on mobility issues. And one of the things that hasn't come out, but I know you have in the plan and I want you to talk about a little bit, is you have some autonomous opportunities.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So can you kind of talk about that a little bit and maybe some implementation around that?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah, I think as a general comment, we're going to be back in front of you with our MP and there's going to be a lot of conversation around parking and single occupant vehicles and ways to get people out of their single occupant vehicles.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And hopefully we'll have a bunch of good ideas for that. But specifically to your question, yeah, that's been my. As we look 25 years down the road, it's hard to plan a new downtown neighborhood, of course. But one of the things that I love the idea of as autonomous technology starts to get credible and starts to get'",
        "'speaker_2': 'real, how do we implement that here as a way to solve that first mile, last mile connection between this site, for example, and Mile High Stadium and Union Station on the other side? You know, can we can we put together a system of autonomous shuttles that connect us all as a more expedient way to solve that first'",
        "'speaker_2': 'mile? Last mile, but lots more lots more ideas where that came from, I hope.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay, great. So is it is it more aspirational or as.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm sure most of if you've been out to Panasonic, out in Panasonic is the head office of a company called E-Z Mile, which is a European company who decided to bring their own North American headquarters to Denver, Colorado, which is great.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that's what they're developing. If you go out there, you can take a ride on one. For those of you who haven't been on it, it's it's real. It's happening. And I think one of the things that we have to wrestle with in this building, in the building across the street, is how do we have how do'",
        "'speaker_2': 'we have the regulatory environment? Keep up with that because it's coming and we need some changes to accommodate it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But then the last question, you know, typically maybe 15 years ago, we built cities and we didn't really think about families. Right? We thought about young professionals. It's the Richard Florida model rise of the creative class. Let's get all the creatives now.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We're in a downtown. We're talking about there's there's no schools. There's no, you know, child care. There's no things like that. Have you contemplated that in this kind of development?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah. Those of you have heard me talk about this project. You've probably heard me talk about what a great place Denver, Colorado is for a certain demographic that we built it for. I moved here 20 years ago when I was 30 years old, and it was a great time to be a 30 year old in Denver, Colorado'",
        "'speaker_2': '. I think it's a great time right now to be a 30 year old in Denver, Colorado. I think what we haven't focused enough on is exactly your point is how do we start to accommodate families downtown? I grew up and watched Vancouver grow up as a city, and one thing I really noticed is that the downtown didn't'",
        "'speaker_2': 'start to thrive until I would wake up downtown and I'd see families pushing a stroller downtown on a Saturday or Sunday morning. So how do we do that? Families aren't going to come downtown and live in a studio apartment.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They're just not. So our plan is to build a diversity of housing product that can accommodate families that's at a market rate. And also, as we heard earlier tonight, on an affordable level as well with larger unit sizes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I think as importantly is the infrastructure that you need to build a school. And we've been in conversations with DPS. I'd like to do a a grade school in this area, which they say will be required. They say we're good on a high school with north and West servicing this site, but a grade school for sure'",
        "'speaker_2': '. We have committed to build a community center, a rec center for the citizens of the city and exploring opportunities for daycare and the like, amenities that families really need.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thanks. Appreciate it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilman Brooks, Councilman New Reese.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thanks again for all you're doing. There's going to be a credible project for downtown and you're bringing the river to downtown. It's just going to be wonderful. I can't think more highly of what you're what you're doing with the project, especially innovative ideas.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You have a transportation and it's very impressive. One real quick question I note after this, we're going to be improving the development agreement and just that's all been finalized and agreed by all parties, right?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah. Yeah. Yes, it has. I know there was a lot of conversation about Section 27 that I think was the last related issue. But yeah, it was it was definitely a hard negotiation with the city, but I think we got to a good place in the end.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Great. Congratulations. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you, Councilman. New Councilman Lopez.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah, thank you. Some we've had this conversation before and you know, to understand the future use and the need that's out there is definitely there. I hear a lot. From folks in the community that are. Villages will have to move again or.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is this the end? So my question is, what is the future plan for the current use? And I want to preface that by saying, as we grow and as we expand as a city and as it's great for 30 year olds, we need to make sure that it's also great for our young people who need a safe'",
        "'speaker_1': 'place and affordable place for them and their families to be able to enjoy this city. What happens to the current use? What happens to those cards?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thanks for reminding me. I can't give a presentation without reassuring people that dealerships is not closing anytime soon. So come to the park. Come to the park. We have a phased plan for development that sees the park stay in place and we make better use of the 17 acres of surface parking that we have.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we do that by building a centralized parking garage on a portion of that 17 acres for the Ilitch patrons. And that allows the park to operate as we build out phase one. So the carefully chosen phrase that I use is the park will be there for the foreseeable future.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So if you're not, it's going to be there for a long time to come. Your comment about giving kids a place to go. I understand that. And, you know, changes change is hard for people right to let go of something and they let go of villages once already at 38th and Tennyson.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I'm not sure if that makes it easier or harder to let go of this. But I can tell you two things. The ownership group is committed and actively looking at feasibility on a relocation, as we've talked about in the past.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They won't be for years to come, but it's definitely in the forefront of our minds. And number two, I hope we can replace the glitches when that time does come with this 15% parks and open space that we have planned along the river.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that takes a bunch of different forms. That's passive space walking that separated bike and pedestrian paths. That's active sport court type uses and then a lot of active river use as we've talked a lot about fishing. We haven't talked a lot about the river work that needs to go on on the floodplain.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But what that can result in is a bunch of recreational opportunities in the river, aside from fishing, such as stand up paddle board and perhaps a standing surf wave, things like that. So trying to be inclusive and also by bringing what I call the new model of entertainment for young people, Meow Wolf to the site.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Which is in what council district began.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And the a really good one.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Then the third council district. Mr. President, I'm if I may continue, I'm flirting with with commentary here, but I just wanted to ask that question because I want it to be on record and I want it to be clear.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think it's it's what we're doing in creating the open space and providing this opportunity and maximizing what could be on this site is a good thing. My concern is that we make sure that it's still available for folks that don't have to pay too much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I'm not talking about freebies and free tickets and handouts. Working people can pay. However, it's some of those amenities that make Denver what it is. And I keep thinking, Mr. President, of the Ferris wheel and saying not to see this is not.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'To see Denver.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And it just keeps ringing in my head. Any uses for the old carousel or the Ferris wheel, perhaps?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You may have a book in front of you that may have a rendering in it of our central square. One idea that we've toyed around with that is depicted in the rendering of relocating our carousel into the central square that may have, may or may not have been a direct result of one certain councilman's suggestion.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much for that answer.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Are you all done with your leading questions, Councilman?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I rest my case.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Lopez. Seeing no other questions. The public hearing four counts. Bill 1 to 25 is closed. Comments by members of council. Councilman Espinosa and then Councilman Brooks again this time around.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Or we know this is unfortunately all in the side of my district.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Brooks.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah, just off. Thank you, Mr. President. I will be supporting this rezoning enthusiastically for a number of reasons. But, you know, I believe this is consistent with all adopted plans. It's uniformity of district regulations. It furthers the public health and safety and welfare, and it meets all the justified circumstances listed below.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And it also is. Consistency with neighborhood context, zone, district and purpose and intent. And for the major reason, reason is I've been a part of the entire process from the beginning and there, you know, in a time when Denver is going through the most growth and there's so many questions about that growth and there's so much perception'",
        "'speaker_5': 'and you heard it tonight, we come up with this plan. Reese comes to us with his partner, with this plan to blow it out of the water, to say that there's going to be no zoning requirements and we're actually going to go further into this urbanist ideology.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And the neighbors in District one, you know, put District one on the spot here who probably came in a little tidbit and I was a little timid, actually fell in love with the project and because the process was right.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so I'm so excited about this and it was not easy. I think both the city I think the council folks that were at the table, Councilman Espinosa, Councilwoman Quinn, each Reece's team, there were some long meetings that we had.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But we're here. And this is how you build a city. It's it's it's being inclusive of all ideas. It's it's, you know, really embracing multiple values. And that's what inclusivity is all about. And I really believe that we got to that place here.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We embraced everything and we fought a little bit and we came out with a beautiful project and so much props goes out to Reese for staying in the foxhole. Much love to to Abe and Chris, who were also in the foxhole as well.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'All the OED staff, Melissa and Laura was working really hard on this as well. And I'm really excited to see what we become. And I think this just goes out to, you know, people talk about developments and I think this is really smart, thoughtful, considerate development.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I hope that we have more of this in the city and county of Denver. And I think this is this is more putting a stake in the ground of saying this is what we want to be about.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We want to be about environmental responsibility. We want to be about inclusivity and affordability of all income ranges. We want to be about mobility options that single occupancy vehicles in a downtown neighborhood is not the right idea. We've got to have multiple options and that's not a bad thing and shouldn't be.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I shouldn't be feel bad for saying that. Right. And matter of fact, we're going to do it boldly. And so in the the last thing families you are welcome in downtown Denver. We want you downtown because it's going to make us an incredible city and a sustainable city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So with that, Mr. President, I'll be supporting this. And I just want to thank everyone who put in all your hard work to make this a reality. Thank you. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilman Brooks, Councilman Espinosa.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Council said council president. I thank you for every council present. Thank you, Councilman Brooks, because in your comments, you sort of put me back into a place that was so long. One of the weird things, if you want to if you want to see four years of your life go by an instant, get elected to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'District one and I'm sure District nine sort of the same way. I can't. But it puts me back to when we first got here. And I remember I remember when I when you sort of introduced me to to the property, to Reese and how timid and reluctant you were to even have me engage with developers that you're'",
        "'speaker_4': 'familiar with. And I, I wasn't, you know, because I yeah, it's a lot of fear. That was what kind of what kind of ideas that I was generating at that time. And, and. And what came from that discussion is it turns out Reece is a constituent of mine.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Right. And he's it's it's it's it's there's there's been relationships that have sort of flourished. I mean, not not relationships among us, necessarily, but things that are precursors to what has now occurred here. Great partnerships in the community, putting people together, putting ourselves together.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So thank you for you didn't have to include me in the Central Valley rezoning. I mean, master plan update. But you you committed to it and you made it happen. And that was a forum where, again, that was largely your constituents sort of interjecting with my ideas and things like that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And and what what came of that. You know, we talked about previously and it was really a great thing when we had Central Park there and you made that happen. So thank you for for for sort of including me in this whole process because back to my previous comments, I do think this city benefited from that collaboration'",
        "'speaker_4': '. And I in a sort of goes back to day one, that is I think you were reticent that I was willing to go there, but I always was, still am and look forward to doing that continuously in the future.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This is what implementation looks like when the text amendment hits the ground. So we talked about that sort of before this rezoning seeks and commits to the regulatory tools. Long wanted to be I wanted to use I don't mean I can't write tools long wanted not just to generate revenue but to create vital, inclusive and sustainable city'",
        "'speaker_4': 'focused on the well-being of our citizens. What is being considered is adoption of the biggest. Ask this we as a city have made on our in our based zoning code. Thank you, Reese, for your willingness to both engage with us and to compromise to do what was right for all of us together.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You and the city have managed to incorporate so much of what the citizens were asking for and affordable to citizens and affordable housing champions we're asking for. I won't rehash everything you just said in response to Councilman Lopez, but it's all there on tape, in the recording and in the attachments that we have online.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'How sort of far reaching everything is the tools that we created, the agreements and and the adoption of this rezoning. Thank you again for your commitment to introduce housing for all income levels in Denver living together. There is data about co-location of different income levels and the creation of truly vital, thriving communities.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There are social benefits for all. Mixed income development has long been seen as an important tactic to strengthen neighborhoods. At the same time, it improves prospects for low income families. Mixed income facilities often soften the negative perceptions of concentrated, subsidized housing by removing obvious geographic and visual indicators of class.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This is what we this is the way we want and need the city to be heading. So thank you. It's it's it's a great for to a mind to be able to to to what Jeff Shoemaker just said, to be on this side of the dais and to be able to vote.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We'll work on getting this done and to vote for it being adopted. Thank you. With that, I'll be voting in favor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Espinosa. Councilman Lopez.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. President. And thank you, folks, for for working on this and keeping us abreast of what's what's going on. Council District three borders the southwest corner of this site and Mile High Stadium, and that property just to the west, the other side of the river.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I hope and I have a lot of faith, but I hope that the future council and future councils make sure that this doesn't just happen in a vacuum, that it's more than just design. But and and it's more than the commitment to affordable housing here.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There is such a thing as a community benefits agreement on the vertical development and on future development agreements. And I think it's it's important and it's critical that we continue to keep our eyes on the ball to make sure that that diversity is not just reflected here spiritually, but economically.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If you want diversity in neighborhoods, there has to be economic opportunities. You want diversity in the city. There has to be economic opportunities for that to take place. This is one of those engines that's I mean, it's one of those economic engines.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's a very powerful one. And this idea of overdevelopment or gentrification and in this case, you're basically pushing out parking lots. You want to you want to utilize those kind of tools. It's a process that can be interrupted and it's a process that can be diverted.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think it's something that we as a city have to be mindful of and intent for when we implement the recommendations of this plan, when this council continues to do that years in advance. Having said that, I think it's you know, I meant what I said, but some of the leading questions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think it's important that we think of Denver in terms of an opportunity for all and making sure that we still have those places that are affordable. You ask our young people now without having to be charged an arm and a leg, there's really nothing for them for folks to do.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have one skate park in the whole city. Not much space. Anywhere you go where there's public space available, it's like skateboarding is a crime. It's illegal, you know, you really can't do it. And on some of these structures and it's not you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm not just speaking up for the skaters, but I'm speaking up for our young people and making sure that they have those opportunities. There's also work opportunities as well to those are also jobs and it's some people's first job and it's some adults only jobs or secondary jobs.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think it's important as well as we do what we think, we think in those terms. Just to the West, this council will see and consider a plan a masterplan for Mile High Stadium and the future development of Mile High Stadium and the properties that surround it on the Metropolitan Football Stadium, Stadium, Football District.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think it's something that we are in negotiation with and talking to. We have folks in Sun Valley on across the West Side that are looking at this and taking some cues and filling in gaps. It's not necessarily.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'An ideology, but it is a necessity in a city, and I think it's a necessity for folks to be at the table and continue to be able to call the city home and not have to break the bank to do it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I look forward to seeing this pass. I'm not a neighbor that's far away to this side. There's a lot of history associated with these with these neighborhoods. And I hope that's reflected as it moves forward in future votes of this council to be able to consider those kind of opportunities, those kind of benefits for the community'",
        "'speaker_1': '. So with that, I definitely will support this moving forward. So thank you and thank you for your hard work. And if I may add one more plug. Yes, to the carousel. Keep that Ferris wheel there. It's the skyline.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's the skyline. It's those things that make Denver recognizable. All right. Keep it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There. Thank you. Councilman Lopez, Councilwoman Black.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, everyone, for being here so late. We appreciate your passion for Denver and your willingness to sit in those hard pews bleachers. I don't know what they're called in 60 seconds or less. I'm going to tell you two personal stories and tell you why I'm voting for this.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'My dad, along with Joe Shoemaker, was very much involved in the great Wayne Foundation 40 years ago. I was at the dedication of the first park there when I was a little kid. I have a painting of it in my office.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And wouldn't my dad and old Joe Shoemaker have their minds blown by this? This is amazing to imagine that we're going to have a mile long park on the river where there are trout swimming instead of it being a dump.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I just think it's incredible. The other thing I have to share about Ilitch is when I was seven years old that the old elegies, I knocked out my front tooth on the Wildcat. Today I have, like I called it, $1 million tooth.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I've had so much done to preserve it. I will be supporting this. It meets the criteria, but it's also an incredible opportunity for our city to have a master planned urban center, to incorporate all those things that we like about great cities, and to think about it ahead of time and make sure we have all of those'",
        "'speaker_8': 'things. There is no gentrification there. There's nobody living there. There's a bunch of parking lots. We're creating housing. We're creating affordable housing, one that we do affordable housing with a partnership instead of using a stick. I appreciate that you're putting green space there.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We very much need more green space in Denver. Thank you for that. I already mentioned the mile long river. Over by the mile long park by the river. You're putting in the infrastructure that we need. This is density where density should be.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And you're providing all those connections. So when there people are living there, they can get out and not have to be in a car. I also really appreciate the architectural standards. There is so much ugly new architecture in Denver.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The whole Denver process that was one of the big themes that came out of there is yuck, ugly. These are not going to be ugly. And the fact that it's all planned out, we also have a lot of mishmash in our city.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Some of it is in my district. I know a lot of it is in Councilman Espinosa's district. So really happy that you guys are doing that. And thank you. I will be supporting it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Black. Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I can remember when the Downtown Denver Partnership took a trip to Vancouver and everybody came back really excited talking about density in the city of Denver. This goes back, I don't remember like maybe 20, 25 years.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And that became part of the discussion of looking at building out the core of our city with higher density, attracting more people to our downtown, making sure that we had a thriving downtown. And fast forward to today, we have a Vancouver former resident assisting us in looking at how we continue to build in our city.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I want to personally thank Reese for coming and meeting with me in my office on several occasions, but really more so for the work that you've done with the adjacent communities. I used to represent Jefferson Park Highlands, lower downtown, Central Platte Valley, and these are active communities.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And if there was concern, the opposition would fill this room and the fact that. There were no letters of opposition. The fact that you had two folks from Jefferson Park and Highland speaking in support of the project really is a testament to the work that you've done and your entire team of people that worked with you, including'",
        "'speaker_6': 'our city team, to bring forward something that exceeds city goals both on housing and open space. And not not only is looking to address parking maximums, but also has a commitment to a team. The 44 neighborhood meetings, not including all the ones with city and the rest of us, really.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I mean, just highlight your commitment to want to do this right and to do it in a way that not only you would be proud, but I think the rest of the Denver community would be proud. Denver doesn't have an ocean, but we will have riverfront property that will serve the entire community.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It won't just be for the residents that will live within this development, but it will serve adjacent neighborhoods and beyond. And that's exciting just to know the kind of improvements that will happen on the river, taking that area out of the floodplain as well.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The infrastructure masterplan for this site is critical and it's important for it to work. I would really like to see our city get to a place where we're connecting your project to Mile-High Stadiums, project to Sun Valley and to all the others along this river corridor, because I think it's something that we have to collectively do to'",
        "'speaker_6': 'make sure that we're doing it right for our entire city. So with that, I will be supporting this tonight. And I want to thank my colleagues. Councilman Burks, Councilman Espinosa, who were very engaged in this process, and Councilwoman Kenney to plugged into the affordable housing part of this as well.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilwoman Ortega, Councilman Cashman.'",
        "'speaker_15': 'Thank you, Mr. President. As Denver continues with the mantra of density, density, density, I can't think of a more appropriate place anywhere in the city than to drop this density with to add a couple of light rail stations on the property, a couple of more in spitting distance.'",
        "'speaker_15': 'So that's extremely extreme. Is it wrong to use that word, Councilman? I didn't mean to offend you. I didn't say bags. I don't.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Feel easily entertained.'",
        "'speaker_15': 'By that. I also like the the CPV districts that were pros approved before that seemed to promise the ability to build this density without overwhelming the skyline. I like the river work. I mean the possibility of what's being talked about.'",
        "'speaker_15': 'I love the fact, Mr. Dugan, that you're talking about 15% open space rather than the 12 the city is talking about. I don't know that 15% is enough considering where the city is now. But I appreciate that the 1200 units, if that's what it turns out to be of affordable housing, is somewhat heartening.'",
        "'speaker_15': 'I just wonder if we have our numbers right on what we need to be building. I think the under 60% might be a little bit light for that much acreage. I don't know how we get our under 30 taking care of at 120 units on that bigger property.'",
        "'speaker_15': 'It's going to be interesting to see what actually gets built there. As Councilwoman Kennedy alluded earlier, what's being planned to be built now on the Gates site is fairly dramatically different than what was planned for that site ten years ago.'",
        "'speaker_15': 'So we'll see where the economy goes and how Denver fares and how your plans actually are manifest. I the one thing I hate about this is I hate to hear about 20 to 25 years. I would love those 8000 units tomorrow.'",
        "'speaker_15': 'It would take an enormous amount of pressure off the rest of the city because I do see some density in other parts of the city that I think is inappropriate. And so I'd love to see the Central Platte Valley buildout more quickly, but as I said, we'll see how fast this actually actually happens.'",
        "'speaker_15': 'And the other thing I didn't mention. I very much like as far as the affordable component, that there are benchmarks, that it doesn't wait till the end of the project is if I understand that as this evolves, the elements of affordable will come along with it.'",
        "'speaker_15': 'So I wish you the best and I wish all of us the best. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Cashman. Councilman Neal, because.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I look forward to voting for this. And thank you again, Reese and the cranky family for making this major investment. Our cities is incredible. What you're going to be doing and and especially the dedication and I can remember the early discussions about this, about affordable housing and how you were dedicated then as well as you are as'",
        "'speaker_9': 'much as you are now. So thank you. Thank you for that. Really appreciate that, Councilman. Espinosa and Brooks really led the effort with you. And I'm proud that it came out to be a such an agreeable proposition and development for you.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I'd also like to thank you. Probably all the council people would like to thank you for addressing the Council Councilwoman Ortega's railroad issue. We really appreciate that. So the the buffer, this makes us really pleased, especially for her.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So thank you again and look forward to a great project. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Kels. Menu. Councilwoman Gilmore.'",
        "'speaker_16': 'Thank you, President Clark. I want to definitely think Councilman Brooks and Councilman Espinosa for working together on this. And, Reese, your entire team, I mean, you guys worked really hard on this. And, you know, I know folks will miss Elegies someday, but before we had Elegies, we had nature in the outdoors.'",
        "'speaker_16': 'And so that one mile of river that you're going to reactivate and create a wonderful riparian habitat is so important because that connects young people and their families to actual careers. There's careers in science, technology, engineering, art, math.'",
        "'speaker_16': 'And so all of those steam components are so important. And on top of it, we've got the affordable housing, we've got additional park space. And this project I can really see as a model project and when you talk about adding density, but then also adding nature and greenspace to it, that's the way that we've got to go'",
        "'speaker_16': '. And so I share my desire that that Councilman Cashman has I hate to have to wait too long to get something like this because it's going to be so important and transformational to the families and residents who are going to live in this area.'",
        "'speaker_16': 'And so I'm happy to support this. I see that it meets all of the review criteria and great job and look forward to see what comes next. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Gilmore. Seeing no other comments, I just want to thank everyone for coming tonight, for sticking so late in those chairs for all of your engagement in this. And, you know, I will echo a lot of what everyone else said without saying it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I just I'll just add that I think the first time you and I met, I said, you've got the best piece of riverfront real estate in the city. And it has been really cool to watch that process of the vision emerge for that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And, you know, to, to, to have the history that we have with our.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'River.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And to see and hear tonight, I wrote down that the river is a main street. We are literally treating the river as a main street, the river as our front door. And that is not the history that the city has with that river.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And really, this project is, you know, that that we're really living that vision up to to as far. So I'm excited to support this tonight. And with that, Madam Secretary, roll call.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Black eye.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Brooks Espinosa. Hi, Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hi.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Gilmore. Hi, Cashman. Hi, Mitch Lopez.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'All right.'",
