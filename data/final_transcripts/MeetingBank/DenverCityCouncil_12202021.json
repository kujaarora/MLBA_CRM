My problem with this bill is, though, that it will trigger spending. $1.5 million from our Vision Zero budget on new 20 mile per hour signs.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I know this bill itself doesn't allocate any funding, but we've learned from Dottie that if we pass this, that they will then have to replace signs and put new signs in. According to his own data, our most dangerous streets by far for pedestrians and cyclists are arterial streets, which make up only about 16% of our streets, but'",
        "'speaker_5': 'account for 80% of pedestrian fatalities, 69% of bike fatalities and 75% of head injuries and 71% of bike injuries. In contrast, our local streets, which make up two thirds of our streets, only account for 10% of bike impaired incidents.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So with finite resources, funds, I believe, should be prioritized to address the issues on our arterials, on our high injury network streets like Federal Colorado Boulevard in Hampton. In my district, I've advocated for safety improvements for many years on arterials where we have serious safety issues.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'The not is warranted, but for years we've been told there's no funding. South Colorado Boulevard is very unsafe. In the past two months, two pedestrians were hit while crossing at Amherst. I've been advocating to make Colorado Boulevard safer for years.'",

I've heard from many of my constituent constituents asking me to prioritize funds for these various crossings. Also, we really want people to bike and walk to our rec centers, to our parks, to schools, to shopping and transit.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We want to get them out of their cars. But it's really dangerous to cross our arterials. I just believe that our vision $0 should be directed to our most dangerous streets.

        "'speaker_0': 'But when you get in your car, life gets difficult. People get impatient and cut through our neighborhoods because the collectors and arterials are not moving fast enough for them. Since Mayor Hancock has declared his commitment to Vision Zero in 2016 to bring deaths and serious injuries close to that zero number, 380 people have died on Denver streets'",
        "'speaker_0': ', some 7% of those on local streets. Almost 80 people have died this year, the most in recent memory. What we're doing isn't working. Denver Drivers need to take a deep breath, leave earlier and slow down. We need that message to go out loud and clear.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We need to slow down. That's not someone else. We need to slow down. The severity of injuries, the frequency of injuries, the frequency of fatalities increase speed increases. The severity of injuries increases most dramatically for children and older adults.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Posting slower speeds on online locals is only a part of a comprehensive program of changes that Daddy has in mind to send that needle a vision zero in the proper direction. This bill is presented because the default speed, now 25 miles per hour on postage streets, is in ordinance and needs to be changed by amendment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Speeds on our collectors and arterials can be changed by Dottie as policy. As a result of the speed limit reduction feasibility study completed in August, that department will be looking at what additional changes to postage speeds need to be made and collectors and arterials in school zones and elsewhere.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'As Councilmember Black noted, the most intense focus is now and will remain on our high injury network, where the bulk of serious injuries and deaths take place. We need to lower postage speeds to encourage people to drive more slowly, and we need to re-engineer some of our roadways, roadways to cause them to drive more slowly.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In discussion with daddy leadership, I'm convinced of their plans to be more aggressive in doing just that. But that is not something that is done by ordinance or I would be doing just that here as well. And for those who say posted speed limits won't change a thing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I would simply say that it will if you observe them. Slower speeds do reduce injuries when collisions occur. Posted speeds have no effect on people who don't care. We can raise them or lower them, and those people won't care.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But for the vast majority of drivers, who do they serve as an important reminder to slow down? We need to slow down. This is not being done as a feel good measure. It's an important beginning to changing the culture that we need to slow down.'",

We built so many of our streets, especially in my district, in Councilwoman Blacks in the postwar years, when people were moving out to the edges of the city and the automobile was every family had an automobile, at least one or two, and they're way too wide.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And as a result, we get I don't know if every other council member has the same experience, but one of the most frequent complaints that we get from constituents is speeding on local streets. My office has purchased five solar powered driver feedback signs, the kind of tell you how fast you're going at up to a certain speed'",
        "'speaker_6': 'and then tell you to slow down if you're going five or ten miles faster than that. I am going to support this bill tonight, although I believe that it won't be very effective. I think if we're not enforcing the 25 mile an hour default speed limit, we might as well not be enforcing the 20 mile an hour'",
        "'speaker_6': 'speed limit. But as Councilman Cashman said, it sets the tone that we are looking for people to slow down no matter where they are. One of the problems I have with this vote is that I asked two months ago today I asked DPD and Dotty for data.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'On accidents crashes in the city and county of Denver for the last five years. I did not receive that data until Wednesday of last week. So I spent a lot of time looking, focusing mostly on my district because that's all I had the time to do.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There were 2238 accidents on a system wide on freeway, arterial collector and local streets. Of those, 126 were on local streets, 5.6% citywide. And those six, almost six years, there were 349 fatalities, 15 on local streets, 4.3% when I drilled down on the fatalities because there were 15 on local streets.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I examined those in particular. And a number of them, several of them, at least including one in my district, would not have been impacted at all by this change. The one the one I'm referring to in my district was a woman who was had not set the brake on her car properly in her driveway.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And when she got out, walked around the back of her car, it rolled over her and she died. The same thing happened in Council District one on Osage Street, I believe it was where a guy was working under his car.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'When it stalled and when it restarted, it ran over him and he died. But this this speed limit is not going to affect so many of our not just the fatalities, but the serious bodily injuries for pedestrian fatalities occurred on local streets.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'When I read the police reports which were forwarded to me again only on Wednesday, none of them would have been impacted by this change, given the circumstances under which they occurred. Many of them are unrelated to speeds at all.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'In my council district, of the 2238 crashes, there were 115 over those six years, and only one one of those fatalities was on a local street. It was a motorcyclist who, on his own volition, decided to go way too fast and hit a hit a tree.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Hit a neighbor's tree. Having said that. Madam President, I would I would suggest that Dottie and CPD begin to get serious about our street design and stop designing streets that tell drivers to go 35 while we put up a 20 mile an hour sign on them.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I had this experience with the recent Laredo Heights development, where we struggled, in some cases unsuccessfully, to narrow streets and to tighten curb radii in order to induce slower speeds. But the reviewers told us, Oh, no, that's not the current standard.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It has to be a certain radius or it has to be a certain with to accommodate the traffic and to let it go at speed. And so I hope that our practices catch up with our vision at some point and maybe by approving this ordinance that will happen.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilmember Flynn. Councilmember Hines.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, council president. And thank you, Councilmember Cashman, for this bill. I'm in support. I would say Councilmember Flynn has a good point. Urban design is the best way to ensure people go the speed they should go. Just as Councilmember Flynn said, I hope that Dottie considers that when we consider implementing shared streets and the 50 to'",
        "'speaker_0': '80 trail, both of which should prioritize people and cyclists and attenuate cars. So as we consider that, we should start thinking out of the box until we get good urban design in our streets, we should do whatever we can to achieve Vision Zero by 2030.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Our fatalities are going the wrong way, and the right answer isn't to move the 2030 goalpost. It is to do all the things we can at all times to achieve zero pedestrian and cyclist fatalities. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilmember Hines. Councilmember Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Madam President. I just wanted to weigh in on this issue as well. I'm not convinced this is going to solve the problem, particularly on our arterial corridors. Over two years ago, I had asked that we do an amendment to the budget which we were successful in doing to add money to take care of the intersection'",
        "'speaker_7': 'at 14th and federal. That is still one of the worst intersections in the city for accidents and fatalities. And I know that the West Colfax Group has been working on sort of a redo of Federal Boulevard in that general area, looking at what is referred to as the Cloverleaf.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'However, there could have been some additional. All measures put into place to mitigate the additional deaths that have happened from that time until now. And I think just given the data on the vast number of the accidents and fatalities that are occurring on are purely arterial corridors, is is not necessarily going to solve the problem where it'",
        "'speaker_7': 'is the greatest. By lowering the speed on what are known as residential streets. So I will be supporting this tonight. I do think slowing traffic down in our neighborhoods is important, but I also think it's important not just for drivers but for our bike riders as well.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In my neighborhood, I often see people on bikes that do not stop it, stop signs, and that is a contributing factor, whether they're on a bike or whether they're on a scooter. People think that they can just ignore the rules on the streets, and that is part of the problem.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so there's got to be some education that needs to happen as well. But we have to pay attention and prioritize the fatalities that are occurring on our arterial streets and at intersections where at 14th and federal you have traffic, foot traffic moving around, trying to get to Denver, Human Services, trying to get to the train.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And they're rushing to be able to catch their their bus or their train. And that is a huge contributing factor to the fatalities that we've seen at that intersection. And I will be following up with body to try to figure out what is going on and where are they on that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I do have to admit that I've been lax in not doing that follow up, because I thought that was being incorporated into some of the work that's being accelerated with the Colfax and federal intersection. But I will be supporting this tonight.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I just think we have to keep our eye on the ball with the arterial corridors. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilmember Ortega, Council President Pro-Tem Torres. Thank you, Madam President. I'll be supporting the bill tonight. I think one of the things that our office takes a lot of calls on our internal residential complaints about speeding. We see it on a regular basis.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Repeat crashes at first, next court 10th and Knox Court fifth and Perry 17th, and Julian on a regular basis. And I know that I agree with Councilman Flynn. We may not see this won't fix the problem. I think it's one of the many things that we have to employ to try to chip away at it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I hope to see some good outcomes, but I know our work is a long path. So thank you, Councilman Cashman, for sponsoring this this effort. Thank you, counsel pro Tem Torres. And I am happy to support this this evening.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We do need more tools in order to slow down traffic. And really the width of streets is an issue and education as well. And one of the things that we've also not talked about is the widespread drag racing that we have throughout our city as well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I know that the the you know, lowering the speed limits to 20 isn't going to necessarily address that. But I think those earlier comments that we need different tools to accomplish just keeping pedestrians and others safe on our streets and so happy to support this this evening, but would also like to see Dottie step up and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'implement more of those traffic calming traffic mitigating tools. But all along with that, educating the community as to why we may be taking a lane of traffic away, why we might be removing some things in the neighborhood to make it safer for residents and people who are biking, etc..'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Denver. The East Area Plan, which was adopted last year and then I listed together is housing and inclusive Denver. But it's actually the five year housing plan more recently adopted guiding our our city's housing policy blueprint. Denver identifies this area as being within the urban edge context, so that makes using the urban edge or EA zone districts'",
        "'speaker_0': 'appropriate for this site is identified as a low residential area of future development, meaning we would predominantly see single and two unit uses in these areas and per blueprint. Accessory dwelling units are also appropriate in areas designated as low residential and a variety of street types serve the East Colfax area, including, of course, Colfax itself, which is'",
        "'speaker_0': 'a main street arterial. Several residential arterials go east and west through the site, and then Yosemite, I just would highlight, is identified as a commercial arterial and main street collector for nearby segments adjacent to the to the area.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then in terms of the blueprint Denver growth areas, this area, like most single unit districts, is identified as part of the all other areas of the city where we expect to see about 20% of housing growth by 2040.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Story Blueprint. Denver also highlights several equity concepts that we analyze when considering rezonings as well. One of those is access to opportunity. This area generally has average access to opportunity. It does have high access to transit, of course, along Colfax and other parallel streets, and which gives good quality access into downtown and other areas of employment and'",
        "'speaker_0': 'day to day services. There are there is lower access to health care directly in the community, but it is accessible by transit. And this rezoning will increase housing opportunity and diversity of housing options in an area that has this existing great access to to transit.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The East Colfax neighborhood is does come up as more vulnerable to involuntary displacement. So that includes a lower median household income, a higher percentage of renters, as compared to the city as a whole, and a lower level of educational attainment as compared to the city as a whole.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This proposed rezoning will or could impact and improve the vulnerability to involuntary displacement by expanding housing options, providing some lower cost options to help keep residents in place and provide wealth building tools for existing property owners in East Colfax is Colfax has generally does have a diversity of housing types.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There is a variety of of apartments in kind of smaller building forms duplexes four plex is a variety of of house sizes and dwelling unit sizes. And then housing costs are generally low and there actually are slightly more designated affordable housing units in this area than we would see elsewhere in the city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This proposed rezoning will allow additional advances in the expansion of housing diversity in the area by allowing a typically smaller and lower cost housing type. Finally, with regard to the diversity of jobs, most of the jobs in this area immediately surrounding or impacted by this proposed rezoning are retail oriented, and it's not expected that this rezoning will'",
        "'speaker_0': 'have an impact on the diversity of jobs in East Colfax.

The East Area plan also has several policies that call for the expansion of of addus and other other housing options and ensuring that people have access to housing in areas that have good opportunities to access transit and day to day needs like like groceries and jobs and that sort of thing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'With regard to the second criterion, this proposed rezoning will result in the uniform application of the ESU D1 Access Zone District in this location, the same regulations that would apply in that zone district elsewhere in the city, and it would further the public health, safety and welfare of neighbors by primarily by advancing and implementing our adopted plans'",
        "'speaker_0': 'for the East Colfax area. So with that, based on a finding that these review criteria have been met, Stapp recommends that city council approve this application, and I'm happy to answer any questions.'",

        "'speaker_10': 'Even though my name is not represented for Black Stars, the Movement for Self-defense, Positive Action for Men for Social Change, as well as the Unity Party of Colorado and Frontline Black Males. And I will be the next November 2023.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I fight in District eight in Councilman Hardy's district. I'm in favor of this rezoning tonight. I support accessory dwelling units. When I ran for City Council At-Large in 2019, I still supported him, and in 2021 I still support them.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So I'm in favor of this tonight. I would love to see all three dwelling units all over the city. So this is just one step in getting that accomplished. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. That concludes our speakers questions from members of Council on Council Bill 1321. The moment, Councilmember Ortega. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Madam President. I'm not sure who this should be directed to, but I'm wanting to know if we are in any way as a city, looking at whether or not the affordability of creating more aid use is being addressed.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Are we are we seeing these becoming more affordable or less affordable to people who are looking for permanent housing? Because as people are allowed to build in the EU, they can also use them as short term rentals. Right.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Which kind of takes units off the market for people who are looking for permanent housing. So is there anything built in, whether it's at Host or CPD, to help us really kind of look at the big picture of what is happening in our city as we're allowing more and more and we've been doing these as one offs'",
        "'speaker_7': ', but, you know, we started doing them in different neighborhoods where we're doing them neighborhood wide. And I'm just curious, Andrew, if, you know, whether that's been part of any bigger city conversation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sure. Absolutely. I'm glad you asked that. And I may ask my colleague Abe to add to the discussion here, but especially as these these neighborhood wide legislative rezonings have come up, I know that that has been a question that has come up more frequently.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And and we've had opportunities to look at some of the existing models out there for building and standardizing use as an affordable housing tool. And I would just highlight that we actually have a project going on right now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The Adams in Denver project that may be aware of that is actually looking at the the regulations and other trends relating to use and may be a good venue to explore issues around affordability.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yeah, I think the biggest issue is access to capital. So if somebody doesn't have equity in their existing structure to be able to borrow to build another unit on their site, unless you are in an area where property values have appreciated more or you have the equity, you know, I mean, again, that's all about the equity in'",
        "'speaker_7': 'your property. But unless you have the capital to do that, certain folks in certain neighborhoods that may have been zoned will not have the same opportunities. So are we doing anything as a city to create opportunities for access to capital to assist this, especially for lower income home owners who would want to take advantage of some wealth'",
        "'speaker_7': 'building opportunities?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sure. Thank you, Councilwoman. There's a barge with community planning and development. I'll just jump in to help answer since I'm on the ADOS in Denver project team. The project that Andrew mentioned that will be having its first stakeholder committee meeting in about two months.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So it's just getting started. Those are all really good points. You know, Blueprint Denver recommends it to use as a housing choice throughout the city under the assumption that it's going to expand opportunities for housing, bringing in new types of housing for neighborhoods that, you know, may only accommodate, you know, one type of lifestyle.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But making it possible for there to be smaller and potentially more affordable market rate units in neighborhoods. But there's a lot of other questions that you bring up. There's the, you know, who really gets to take advantage of this question.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And, yes, they're expensive to build. And so naturally, folks with more money are going to be more ready to actually build a to use. However, you know, we're certainly told that bank financing is changing and modernizing in a way that should increase access to capital for some folks that maybe are a little lower on the income range'",
        "'speaker_0': '. But also there are programs like the West Denver Renaissance Collaborative, Single Family Plus program that's just operating in West Denver now. But that's a program that received some city support and they're looking to expand and we're in conversations with them.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And it's a program that basically helps homeowners build accessory dwelling units. Generally speaking, the homeowner has to be income qualified or it has to be a homeowner that will agree to deed restrict the actual accessory dwelling on the income qualified.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Residents. And so there really are a lot of things that we can talk about as part of the ideas in Denver program to increase access for people to actually live in accessory dwelling units, but also for existing homeowners to be able to take advantage of the wealth building opportunities that they have in their property.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So the issue of whether or not we're seeing the impact to affordability, can you address that piece of it?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I guess what would your question broadly be? Is it making neighborhoods more affordable to have more less filling units available or.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Less affordable.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Or less affordable? Yeah. Yeah. That's a very hard monitoring.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That is my question at all.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We are we are trying to figure out if we can. And we just had a conversations with. Member of the Department of Finance.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And access to the permits that they obtain. And then, you know, you would think by by seeing the address, somehow, we should be able to identify some of that data.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But yeah, we can see, for example, what a property's assessed value was from the assessor before they added an ADU. And then we can look at, you know, up to two years later when the property was reassessed, how the value might have changed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oftentimes even that is a little complicated because they many times would make a lot of other improvements to the property right at the same time. And as we know, property values in general have been going up a lot.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So it's hard to figure out where some of these increases in value.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yeah, in some cases they'll go through the process, but not yet build them right away either.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Now that we're pretty clear on from talking to the assessor and to real estate experts that we're not seeing property value increases just from rezoning to actually taking the action of improving the property with an idea, of course, does affect the property value.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'All right. So who is tracking that?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The accessory dwelling units in Denver, project team and CPD, of which I'm part. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Very.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Much for joining.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Us.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I did. Thank you, Madam President. Councilman Ortega, I just wanted to answer a couple of the questions that you had. Since Councilman Herndon and I are sponsoring this legislative rezoning. We did a number of conversations and calls with with West Denver Renaissance Collaborative, with organizations that are working to create affordable ADA use in places like San Francisco'",
        "'speaker_1': ', Austin, L.A., several other places, so and Portland. So we did go through that, those conversations and also had that conversation with the community. We have already seen from assessor data that the value of land in East Colfax is going up, which is an indication that gentrification is already happening.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So if we are so the purpose behind doing this is to help stop that gentrification in in one of many different ways. That is a tool in the toolbox to help support residents who already own properties in East Colfax to create wealth.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have talked to the West Denver Renaissance Collaborative and some other partners about, you know, potentially moving over to the east side to help support this rezoning. So there's a lot of conversation going on in the background. There's a section in the staff report that you can read about the conversations that we had during our research into'",
        "'speaker_1': 'this as we began this process in early 2021. So just wanted to to fill in what staff was saying with some of the things that we had done as well. And happy to talk more with you about that offline.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If you're if you're interested in me going on and on and on about it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think that's that's helpful to know that that was part of this process as well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. Great. Thank you, Councilmember Sawyer and Ortega. Next up, we've got Councilmember Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Madam President. Andrew Robb. I don't know who can best address this or perhaps council members from those two districts can address it. But I'm taken in the staff report by the very small number of letters directly to us or in support or opposition, just a handful from such an enormous area that's being risen.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I did see a list of comments supportive and in opposition, and there were quite a number of them that apparently came from a survey or a meeting or maybe you can explain that. But no R.A. letters, no registered neighborhood organization letters.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I've heard a lot about the outreach that was done, but why are we not having the feedback? Do you have an explanation for that?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you for that. And I'll I'll ask the sponsors to perhaps add to that as well. But I certainly I should have also noted that there were extensive responses received on those on those surveys. And so and, you know, I can only speculate, but it may be that, you know, some residents or neighbors thought, oh, I've already'",
        "'speaker_0': 'weighed in on this. And so we didn't receive further input directed toward us, our staff. But but yeah. So they did get hundreds of participants in and surveying.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Part of our interruption. Can you were these online surveys or were they collected at meetings or combination of that?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Do you want me to take that?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, if you would, Councilman.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah, absolutely. So, Councilman Herndon and I prepared a survey that actually Councilwoman Sandoval provided to us from her TV park rezoning, and we changed it and added to some of those questions based on the specific need to East Colfax.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We sent oh, gosh, we sent at least two mailers to every household. We knocked every household and delivered information to them about it. We had two online meetings where the assessor's office was there. The exercise license was there to talk about the issue of short term rentals.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Tina Axlerod was there to discuss some of the specifics around the footprint of ADA use. And, you know, there are a couple of places where there aren't alleys. So looking at those kinds of specifics, we had a gosh, I mean, I think we had something like 8% or a Renee Martinez Stone was a presenter as well and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the partnership was also present are so there's only one neighborhood organization in the east Colfax and then two sort of business support groups. The East Colfax Neighborhood Association chose not to take a position at all. One of the business groups chose not to take a position.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The other business group sent a letter of support. So and also just to clarify what you're looking at in there, we so it was an online survey, but we we worked with the neighborhood organizations and the business groups to get out into the community, to get them to get people to fill out those surveys.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, over 70% of the people who filled out the survey were in support of of this rezoning. And additionally, when you are doing a SurveyMonkey survey, you can, on the back end do some things to make sure that the data is accurate and people aren't responding over and over and over again and things like that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we moved everyone who responded, who was not a resident in the East Colfax neighborhood or did not identify as a resident in these Colfax neighborhood out of the survey and then looked at the survey results. So what you are seeing in the staff report is all of the comments that were positive and all of the comments'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that were negative and then the results of the report of the survey by people who are living in the East Colfax neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you very much. That's very good to hear. Do Andrew or Abe, do you have a count based on what the councilwoman said as to how many unique individuals did provide input? During this process.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I believe the information we got that was that they received 139 responses. And and of those, 106 said that they supported the proposed.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Rezoning, and that was the filtered list that Councilwoman Sawyer mentioned. I believe it was just residents filtering out those who identified as outside the neighborhood or who did not identify as within the neighborhood, I believe.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'FLYNN That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Thank you very much, Madam President. That's all I have.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. Great. Thank you. Up next, we've got Councilman Cashman.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, thank you, Madam President. Either one of you gentlemen can answer this. I would hope, and I don't think you're doing it yet, that the addresses of 80 youths that are approved and resound to the one X or whatever it happens to be would be cross-referenced with our list of short term rental licenses.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And when the rental registry program goes into full speed and I don't remember, Madam President, when that said to go the rental registry program.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We are it's going to kick off the beginning of 2022 for early registration. Great.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, and the same thing for that list. So we can really understand what what these properties are being used for. I'm generally a strong supporter of ADA use, but I do as I believe Councilwoman Ortega put forward, have a have a question.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I don't want to see them used only for a use or in large numbers. I think it would defeat the promises that were this important program is being put forth for. And I'm just amazed at the amount of outreach that Councilmember Sawyer and Herndon put forth on this, whereas with Councilman Flynn, one speaker, you know, at the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'public hearing and no real strong comments from neighborhood groups. Thank you. That's all.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilmember Cashman. We've got Councilmember Hines. You're up next.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Council president, thank you for your work. Councilmember Ortega asked about housing affordability. Areas can be used for short term rentals, but only when the home or 80 was occupant or occupied. As I write, the owner must live on site.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's correct. And what about an 80 you and a home? One of which is a 365 short term rental and the other is a short term rental for just shy of half a year. I was an article in Denver write about a woman is traveling in South America and she is you know, she lives in her home'",
        "'speaker_0': 'just over half a year. Can is that allowed? I know I'm kind of asking you a question that well, it's certainly relevant to this conversation because we've got 2000 potential ideas. Yeah, and that's a great question. Councilman Hines and I may ask Abe to add to this as well, but you can only have one firm license or'",
        "'speaker_0': 'a short term rental license per property. So there may be some challenges, you know, renting out both the primary dwelling unit and the and the accessory dwelling unit, even if somebody doesn't live in the primary dwelling unit all year round.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I, I don't believe it would be possible to have two separate short term rentals on one property. But that. Sure. Thank you. Councilman Hines. A barge with CBD again. So Andrew is correct that the pertinent regulations are that you could hold only one license for the property.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The rules state that you can have only one short term rental contract at any given time, meaning that you couldn't rent to multiple parties on the same night under the same license. However, I don't remember all the details.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I did read the article and was very jealous of the woman living in Peru. But she could, if she, for example, had a detached accessory dwelling unit and lived there as her primary residence. She had her voter registration there or other things, and she was there about half the year she could, while she was gone, rent out'",
        "'speaker_0': 'either the accessory dwelling unit or the primary house to a party of people on as a short term rental, but not both at the same time. Well, I think that's a good question and something that may require a little more clarification moving forward.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'My read of the regulations would say she could rent the whole property to two one group of people, including both the primary dwelling unit and the ADU. But it would be like one family, not, you know, one group of students in the ADU and a family in the primary or something like that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Well. This woman chose to put herself in the press. So I'm sure I'm sure we'll look into it. I want to ask one more thing. So to Councilmember, I take his point about affordability. We have seniors, right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Who have lived in their homes for 40 years, 50 years, and and the value of their home has gone way up. But they don't realize that value until it's sold. And so what they do realize is that their property taxes are way more than they were when they bought the home.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so as you're considering this analysis, I would also encourage I don't know how exactly to do it, but I'm giving you the problem. You figured out the solution. How many units are now made affordable where the owner could not afford the property taxes or the on going living in that in their dwelling, if not for the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'extra income that a native provides. Hmm. All right. Thank you. Thank you, Casper.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. Thank you, Councilmember Haines. Councilmember Sawyer. Thanks, Madam President. Just wanted to quickly respond to Councilmember Hines this question about the short term rentals. So Councilman Flynn and I sit on the short term rental advisory committee, and that is one of the things that we are discussing in one of the upcoming quarterly meetings.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I invite you to attend. But the issue of short term rentals and their effect on affordability to rent long term in the city is one of the things that we are looking at. So just wanted to let you know that that's one of the things that short term rental advisory committee is is undertaking next year.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thanks. All right. Thank you, Councilmember Steuer and thank you, Abe and Andrew for answering those questions. The public hearing is closed comments by members of Council on Council Bill 1321, and we'll go to Councilmember Sawyer first and then Councilmember Herndon and follow up with any other members in the queue.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thanks, Madam President. I got to put my reading glasses on here. First, I want to really say thank you so much to CPD staff. You guys were amazing over the course of this, I guess a year and almost a half since we started talking about this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So truly grateful for all of your guidance and support and assistance and all of those different things. And looking forward to seeing what comes from the EDU working group in the next couple of years. And also a huge thank you to Councilwoman Sandoval and to Naomi, because you just truly gave us all of the help of background'",
        "'speaker_1': 'in the world and support to allow us to be able to do this. So thank you so much for that. Councilman Herndon, also, I really want to say thank you. You are you've been a fantastic partner and I very much appreciate on that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I very much appreciate that. So I'm not going to rehash everything. We've kind of talked about it, but I do just want to quickly touch base on the broader picture. So Blueprint, as we heard, called for us to implement zoning tools to incentivize the preservation of smaller and more affordable housing units.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'With the median home price in Denver nearing $600,000 and an average rent of nearly 1900 dollars a month. Blueprint's plan to incentivize affordable housing options has become more than a mandate. It's more than optional at this point. It's something we have to do as legislators in any way we can to help preserve affordability in our city.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Rezoning these almost for, I guess, a little over 475 acres allows homeowners to construct, to use. And it's a small and crucial step in helping the greater city of Denver and keeping it a great place to live. So I hope the rest of my colleagues will support it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And thank you so much. Thank you, Councilmember Sawyer. Councilmember Herndon.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Madam President. And this is an exciting time. It's funny, I remember these first conversations and now we are here before this. And so I'm just thankful for everyone. And the one person that was not thanked, it was Councilwoman Sawyer for your partnership on this and for your work, the East Colfax community.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I think this is a testament to the outreach that we've done. Everyone was well aware of this and multiple opportunities to weigh in. And now we're here in front of council and we had one speaker who actually doesn't live in East Colfax, but we appreciate Jesse Parrish giving his comments anyway.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so this is a great opportunity to do multiple things, whether you want to read out the ADA or move into the ADA because you want to downsize because the house that you have is too large. And so I'm excited about this neighborhood to have this opportunity.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I hope that other council members will consider this as well. And again, Councilwoman Sandoval, thank you so much for your efforts in letting us know how to work this, because, as we say, plagiarism can be a form of flattery because we try to do almost everything that she did.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And lastly, I just want to thank Leah Hartman from my District eight office, because she was the point person in doing this, working with Council District five, working with CPD. And I really wanted you to publicly. Thank her for all of her work, and I hope my colleagues support this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilmember Herndon. Councilmember Sandoval.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Madam President. Just want to acknowledge the two council. It's not an easy task to get this kind of outreach done, especially during the time of COVID. And for the record, in Chaffee Park, we were here almost over a year ago, rezoning 1700 birds and Chaffey Park, and not one ADA permit has been pulled.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'People are working on them. But it doesn't mean that just because you have the entitlement, meaning you have the ability to build something, that you necessarily build it. And one of the things that I hope that comes forward when the ADA you project task force comes is that the cost of the accessory dwelling units do go down'",
        "'speaker_5': 'in Loveland. They just rezoning the entire city of Loveland of 78,000 people, which probably makes them more council districts. But what they did is they have everything being accessory. So you don't have to get a separate sewer tap.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You tap into your main tap because it's an accessory dwelling unit to the main dwelling unit. And so when Naomi from my staff and I met with Loveland, they gave us a lot of great ideas on how to make more of the accessory dwelling units affordable moving forward in Denver.'",

Approves a map amendment to rezone property from E-SU-D to U-SU-C1 (allows for an accessory dwelling unit), located at 4736 North Pennsylvania Street in Council District 9. The Committee approved filing this item at its meeting on 11-9-21.": [
        "'speaker_1': 'Madam President, i. Madam Secretary, please close the voting and announce the results. 12 Hours 12 IES Council Bill 21 Dash 1321 has passed. Councilmember Herndon, will you please put Council Bill 1325 on the floor for final passage?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes, Madam President. I closed my script because I was thinking about the years of my apology. I moved that Councilor Bill 21 to ask 1325 be placed upon final consideration and do pass.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. It has been moved and seconded. The required public hearing for Council Bill 1325 is opened. So we have staff report.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Awesome. Thank you, counselor. President I'm Libby Adams with Community Planning and Development, and I'll be presenting the MAP Amendment at 4736 North Pennsylvania Street. This application is located in Council District nine in the Globeville neighborhood, and the applicant is requesting to rezone from urban edge single unit D to Urban Edge Single Unit C one to allow for'",
        "'speaker_5': 'an accessory dwelling unit. As stated previously, this property is zoned Eastside which allows the Urban House building form on a minimum zone lot of 6000 square feet. The site is occupied by a single unit home with mostly single unit and park uses surrounding it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And this slide shows the existing building form and scale of the area. A postcard notifying property owners within 200 feet of the site was sent out on July 15th. And then this rezoning went to planning board on November 3rd, where it was unanimously recommended for approval on the consent agenda.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And to date, we have not received any public comment. The Denver zoning code has five review criteria that must be met in order for rezoning to be approved. The first is consistency with adopted plans, and there are three plans that are applicable to the site.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This rezoning meets several of the strategies and comprehensive plan 2040. It will create a greater mix of housing options in the Globeville neighborhood and promote infill development for infrastructures already in place. And then in Blueprint Denver, the future neighborhood context is urban.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'These areas are mostly single and two unit residential areas, with some multi-unit and mixed use. Embedded throughout the block. Patterns are regular with alley access. There's a high degree of walkability. Blueprint identifies the property as a low residential place type.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'These place types are mostly single unit residential uses and adus are appropriate. And then Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania Street is identified as a local street. These are mostly characterized by residential uses, which is consistent with the proposed request. And then blueprint provides further guidance when a rezoning request is made to a district with a smaller minimum zone size.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So the you yes, you see, one district has a minimum zone that size of 5500 square feet and the existing ESD has a minimum zone lot size of 6000 square feet. And the appropriateness of the request depends on the sizes of the lots and the surrounding blocks.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So as this map shows, there's a pattern of lots consistent with the U.S. You see one zone district. And then the growth area strategy and blueprint Denver as all other areas of the city. This is where we anticipate to see 10% of new jobs and 20% of new housing by 2040.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then there's also the blueprint policy in the land use and built form housing policy for strategy, which talks about but individual rezonings that allow use are appropriate and should be small, an area such as this one. And then this site is also within the Globeville Neighborhood Plan.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And the land use concept for this area is single family with ideas. And the plan also discusses updating the neighborhood context from urban edge to urban, and choosing a district that fits the existing lot sizes. And then also in the Globeville plan, it recommends a maximum building height of two and a half storeys, which is also the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'maximum building height in the proposed district. And staff also finds the requested zoning meets the next two criteria. The rezoning will result in uniformity of district regulations and will further the public health, safety and welfare by implementing both citywide and adopted plans and providing a new a new housing type in this area.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then staff also finds as a justifying circumstance and with the newly with the adopted guidance that's in both Blueprint Denver and the Globeville neighborhood plan for use in this area. And then lastly, the proposed request is consistent with the urban neighborhood context.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The purpose of the residential districts and then the specific intent of the U.S. you see one zoned district. And that concludes that presentation. So finding all of your criteria have been that staff does recommend approval.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. Thank you, Libby, for the staff report. We have two individuals signed up. Both are joining us online. And so we'll go ahead and start out with Kevin Jacoby. All right, Kevin. Kobe doesn't seem like we have him in the queue at all.'",

        "'speaker_10': 'I'm in favor of this, listening to my voice. I'm as I stated at a previous hearing. We need to use all over this city dwelling units. All over the city of. I'm glad that you guys asked the questions about the affordability and the short term rentals, because that's been a question that I've been having as well.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I remember this neighborhood quite vaguely actually knock doors in this neighborhood for NBC. The popular before she became councilwoman, came to see the market. So, yeah, I'm in full support of this to my good job, Candace, and have this.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. That concludes our speakers this evening. Questions for Members of Council on Council Bill 1325. Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Madam President. Libby, I need some clarification on the decision to, first of all, change the context for the single lot to urban rather than edge. Because there is a zone district in the urban edge as you the one that would fit this perfectly.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I'm trying to understand why, and I understand the Globeville neighborhood plan says that at some point the entire area would be had a context change from urban edge to urban. But with this single lot, when you have available ESU, D1, why was that not chosen?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Why are we spot zoning and urban context on this little block across from Argo Park?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah, so that's a great question. So it actually say that this would not be an example of spot. So sure. So sorry. I would say that this would not be an example of spot. So even though it is literally a spot on the map, that's different.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But what spot zoning actually is is approving a rezoning that's not consistent with adopted plans and with our justifying circumstance. And so this district is the most consistent with our current adopted plans, because both Blueprint and the Globeville plan talk about updating the context from urban edge to urban.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Why would we not just do as CSU de one? And then in some future year, when the context is changed and there's a wholesale map amendment change this one.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah. That's a great quote. I mean, you know, this is what was applied for by the applicant. And so that's what we reviewed and we found that it was okay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, I do know, though, that the applicants don't normally come in and say, this is what I want and you give it to them. Usually there's a lot of staff guidance that changes the two of you do. Do we know when the Globeville neighborhood context.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Would change from urban edge to urban. And I'm not totally familiar with the global neighborhood plan from 2016. So what is the reasoning for that change and when do we anticipate it would occur?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah, so my understanding is that the feedback received during that planning process was that the urban edge context is a better fit. You know, this is an area that has alleys. It's really more of a grid pattern versus urban edge.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's kind of our it's in between the suburban and urban contexts where sometimes there's alleys, sometimes there's not there can be some more organic streets. So I think that was my understanding because I was not working here, worked on that plan.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I don't know, I don't think we have any direct plans to actually rezone this entire area to the urban or the urban context. I think it's more of that was the guidance for when these individual rezonings do come in.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That could be our chance to update these parcels that do come in.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. I'm a little uncomfortable with doing these one off when there's a when there's an off the shelf zoned district within that context, within the existing context that fully addresses the program or the proposal, I don't know Abe or Andrew, is there a quick answer you can give as to when we might expect?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'An update to the context there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sure. Thank you for that. As Libby said, I don't I don't. And this is this is present in several area plans where the work of the area planning process is identified, that an existing context may not be the most appropriate for a particular neighborhood or several blocks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And it is typically the recommendation of the plan that the the context change be implemented by both applicant driven rezonings or by, you know, larger legislative rezonings that might take place for a not for some other reason. For example, rezoning an entire neighborhood to allow accessory dwelling units might be an opportunity for that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But it is clearly expressed, expressed in those plans that that the intent is to implement those as as the zoning of property changes so that those updated the new context zone districts would have a more applicable and appropriate fit to that that that specific context there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This isn't the only area plan that makes a recommendation like this.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. So when that occurs in the future, this particular lot, the single lot on on Pennsylvania Street would be swept up in that, but actually would already have the urban context.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's correct. So so if at some point in the future, this neighborhood, this whole neighborhood was rezone to allow accessory dwelling units, then at that time, the urban context would be recommended for all of those properties and this property would not be standing out on its own.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I would also highlight that there are several other single parcel rezonings that have occurred in that neighborhood and others that have also had that context change.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. All right. Thank you. Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Andrew, would you introduce yourself for the record, please?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, my apologies. Andrew Webb from Community Planning and Development. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. Great. Thank you. Thank you. Councilmember Flynn, we've got Councilmember Hines.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, counsel. President. So I think I'm trying to make sure I understand Councilmember Flynn's line of questioning. And so the the the what he's suggesting is that it should have been rezone to be, as you see, one instead of you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'As you see. One is that my getting that right? Okay.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Or maybe ESD one.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sorry. Yeah. Okay. So, um, and you mentioned there are two plans that both suggest urban, not urban edge. Which, which are those?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah. So Blueprint identifies this area as urban. And then the Globeville plan also specifically talks about updating the neighborhood context from urban edge to urban.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And it's clear in both of those plans that the idea is that Globeville, including this parcel, should be urban, not urban edge.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There's no discrepancy. So it would actually be out of context if we were to keep it urban edge, and we would have to vote against it because it would not be in conformity to plans if it remained urban edge.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It would definitely be more of a challenge, I think, especially with the you know, obviously we haven't done the full analysis, but with the language in the Globeville plan, it would be hard to find consistency with a plan that clearly says to update the context.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sure. And we are meant to look. Thank you. Thank you, Kaspersky.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. Wonderful. Thank you, Councilmember Hines and Libby, for answering those questions, not seeing any other folks in the queue. The public hearing is closed. Comments by members of Council on Council Bill 1325. And we're going to go to the virtual platform.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This is in Councilwoman Cedar Barker's district. And so wanted to allow her to make a comment, if she'd like first. No comments on this one. All right. Thank you, Councilmember. So you know, and the members in the queue, I'm happy to support this this evening.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It does meet the criteria. Madam Secretary, roll call on Council Bill 1325, please. CdeBaca. Clark.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Uh, but I would also point out that, uh, uh, the closest property from the subject property to a protected district is something like 230 feet, something like that. Keep that in mind. Existing land use on the side is industrial and we'll see more of that down to the south, to the north and northeast, you'll see some multi-unit'",

        "'speaker_0': 'So moving into the criteria will start with consistency with adaptive plans. These are the plans that are applicable to the site. We found that this rezoning meets numerous goals, objectives and policies of 2040, just a few of which are shown here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'More. More are included in discussing your Stafford work. In terms of blueprint Denver Future neighborhood context is urban center and that does call for high intensity residential and employment uses, which uh, this Cemex Cemex eight zone district would allow.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And therefore we found consistency with neighborhood context of the rezoning. Bear with me as I go through these next few slides. I just want to point out that this particular property actually has some dual designation on it as it relates to these aspects of Blueprint.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Denver So you can see, for example, in this one, the majority of the site, sort of the more internal portion of the site has one designation. And then the piece that is there along and fronting Navajo Street has a different designation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I'll have to I'll be speaking to both of those. So starting with future place type, the majority of the site again is community center and that calls for getting a mix of commercial and residential and office uses on the site.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It actually calls for heights. Uh, of up to 12 stories here. And so, uh, certainly for that portion of the site, we did find the C max eight zone district to be within the range of what would be supported by blueprint driver in terms of feature place type.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then for the portion out along Navajo, uh, it's identified as high medium residential. So that calls for also a mix of uses, including primarily multi-unit residential. Uh, and that area steps down in terms of what it calls for, uh, for height, eight storeys.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But again with the same six, eight, seven district we are, uh, the request is right in line with what's called Form Blueprint. Denver In terms of feature place type on that edge as well. Future Street type is local and designated, which footprint Denver provides for much flexibility in terms of what uses and what forms can happen adjacent'",
        "'speaker_0': 'to a local and designated street. So we did find this rezoning to be consistent with future street type. The growth strategy. Again, you have a dual designation here. The majority of the site is designated as community centers and corridors and says that blueprint says that properties designated as such around around the city are intended to accommodate 20%'",
        "'speaker_0': ', 25% of new housing and 20% of new employment through 2040. So certainly this Cemex eight zone district would support both of those uses. And so we did find it to be consistent with. That part of the growth strategy for that part of the site.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Next part out along Navajo Street, it's designated growth strategies high and high, medium residential areas and D and you see context. That calls for properties designated as such around the city to accommodate 15% of new housing and 5% of new employment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Around the city through 2040 and we did find the CM exchange rate zone district would would allow both of those things and therefore it would be consistent with the growth strategy. Oh. Sorry. There's a little bit nuance. So this is kind of a funky shaped parcel.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It is located at the western terminus of Ninth Avenue there. And so you have a street that dead ends, but you have a property that's sort of creeping over. If the street was to go through would be sort of taking up the area that that is the generally that width of the right of way there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'However, that little sliver there, which is about 50 feet and it's kind of a vertical dimension there in terms of depth, if you measure it that way, is part of what blueprint Denver classifies as a manufacturing preservation district.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Uh. This is this is kind of what happens when you do city. You drive boundaries on city wide plans. You know, you use the centerline as a guide. And in this particular case, with this property, it ends up with this slight mismatch between where the property line is and where the line for the Manufacturing Preservation District is'",
        "'speaker_0': '. However, Blueprint Denver anticipated that type of thing coming up and does provide for some flexibility with interpretation for this type of thing. And so even even though a bit of the site there is included in that area, we still did find it as a whole to be consistent with Blueprint and.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then to look at the area plan the long llama Lincoln Park neighborhood plan that plan we found this rezoning to be consistent with many of the high level policies of that plan. But I want to focus here on this slide on on the area specifically that this site is located with.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so that plan identifies what it calls character areas, where it identifies kind of vision and objectives for different areas around the plan area. And this area is in the character area called transit oriented development. So the policies generally center around sustainable higher intensity housing and employment uses and pushing for those, particularly as it is located immediately'",
        "'speaker_0': 'adjacent to that 10th and Osage station. In terms of high uh in this area calls out for heights between three and 12 stories as being appropriate including for this site. We did find this rezoning to be consistent with the MSA with guidance from this neighborhood plan.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We also did find that this rezoning would result in uniform district regulations and would further the public health, safety and welfare of the community by implementing those plans I just mentioned. And also given the fact that there's. The restriction I talked about on on the side would clearly result in people affordable and supportive.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Supportive housing. There's that that's worth mentioning here as well, I think. In terms of justifying circumstances. Again, the ADAPT plans call for a different kind of transformation of this of this property. The area itself has transformed significantly over the last decade, perhaps more particularly with the development that's occurred just to the north of the site and to'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the northeast. And then obviously this is in the public interest and that it would result in deeply affordable housing and or supportive housing on the site, which, of course. Everyone knows is badly needed. And then finally we found that this reasoning would result in consistency with neighborhood context, zoning, district purpose and intent.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so with that, based on the criteria for review and the Denver zoning code staff does recommend approval of application 2021 I that's 000 21. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. Thank you, Brian, for the staff report. We've got two individuals signed up to speak this evening. Our first speaker in chambers is Chris Pelkey. Introduce yourself for the record.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Of course. Thanks for having me. Chris Bilkey, the chief real estate investment officer, Denver Housing Authority. My dress is 2663 Dexter Street number. So thank you for allowing us to speak and talk about some of the history here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This site was identified back in fall 2020 following the historic partnership of the DOJ delivers for DMR Bond Program and really in an effort to accelerate affordable housing production in the city. That includes very low income and supportive housing to serve homeless individuals.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Part of this pipeline was to identify working with agency partners, strategic sites. So we're well located next to. Light rail bus services, as well as creating a mixed income community. And thus far we've acquired more than nine sites.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'of DH three and this particular future development. But it would require a reason why we're here today and indeed is intention post an approval tonight would be to work with the community and do additional studies that allows us to think about how to complete the overall South Lincoln Home's redevelopment hopes master plan and with adopted plans blueprint'",
        "'speaker_0': 'and with traffic studies to understand that the connection to nine and connection of the light rail. And then with that that developable parcel would be issued for a request for proposal to qualified development partners. And with selection of a development partner, we would further design.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And part of that design effort would be to engage the community and really understand concerns and address that the achievable become the long term owner of the land through ground restructure as we have with other three partnerships. So we can we will hold that development partner to all the obligations consistent with the intergovernmental agreement next year with'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the city as well as anything that comes through that pre-development effort. I'm happy to answer any questions as they may come up.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. Thank you, Chris. We're going to go ahead. Our second speaker for this hearing is Jessie Paris online.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Yes. Good evening. Members account for those watching at home. My name is Justice Blossom, Personal Representative for Black Star Movement for Self Defense, Positive Action, Social Change, as well as the Unity Party of Colorado and for a long black nose.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I'll be the next mayor in 2023. I'm in favor of this rezoning, as you know. And as we stated on numerous council hearings, we have probably portability crisis in the city. Any time that this council gets a rezoning of this type, I'm in favor of.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I just have a few questions. The first question is the presenter stated that 30% of excuse me, 40% of those are going to be at 30% are lower level. What is 60%? I think we're going to do a traffic study wondering if that have been done.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Is the study going to be done? Is there a parking study? It's pretty alarming that the opposition in regards to this report on what is this square feet of units going to be, how many units are going to be in the South Lincoln project and are there going to be one or two bedroom?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'If someone could answer those questions, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. That concludes our speakers questions from members of Council on Council Bill 1331. We have Councilmember Ortega first.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Madam President. So I would first like to ask Brad. If so, I'm looking at an aerial map on Google Earth, and it looks like this site abuts the old Burnham yards. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well separated by the rail line, but. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. And does RTD go along the edge of that corridor?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I mean, sorry if I can just look at my man. Yeah, I think the. The real line is kind of immediately abutting.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The site.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So. That's okay.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's the. Okay. So I know this has been abandoned in terms of railroad use, but the site has been purchased by C don. Right. Where they're in the middle of acquiring it with the intention of relocating part of the rail line so they can do the widening of I-25.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so I want to know how much. How much of a discussion there was around building a project adjacent to what might now have free and particularly freight that carries flammable liquids, hazardous materials. And what kind of mitigation, if you will, has been looked at as part of this project being within a close proximity to I don't'",
        "'speaker_7': 'know exactly where the rail line would be proposed to go. I mean, in in many cases across our city, our freight line parallels our commuter traffic. Right. So I don't know if that would be the case or not, because I think a lot of that's still in flux.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But one of the things that I routinely ask is if this ends up being built abutting the tracks, what discussions were there around ensuring that the safety of the people who will be in those structures is is being addressed?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's part of our responsibility as elected officials under homeland security to ensure that we are addressing these issues. It's also part of our hazard mitigation plan that we have to submit to FEMA every year. So I just wanted to ask how much that was part of the conversation with DHS around this particular project?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, yeah, and I appreciate that. I will probably defer most of that to the application. But I'll just say that we were certainly aware that we were aware we are aware of and routinely provide that study, the railroad safety study on two applications.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we did so in this case and I've had some preliminary discussions with the applicant in preparation for this that they could they could probably speak more to the actual concept for the actual site in terms of what's going to happen on that site.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I mean, I have no idea either what's going to end up or where the rail line might be relocated to. So I don't even want to try to. And probably nobody in this room knows all that. Yeah, I don't think so.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I won't even try to speak to that, really. But in terms of mitigations and things of that nature, I want to have a chance for the applicant to respond to that. That's right.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Is that Chris? Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. Housing authority. I appreciate the question again is this rezoning allows us to then figure out what that program looks like. Stories, bedroom mix and earlier question allows us to then do a lot of the additional studies to respond to this new CMCs eight zoning.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The other thing I did not mention as part of the D3 program, DOJ is committing 300 vouchers to this pipeline, so half of the very low income units or permanent supportive housing units that go in this development would have to go through a HUD environmental review process.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Part of the part 58 review. And in that, there is always a lot of consideration that actually, as the city does for us to look at noise mitigation, environmental, even health and safety issues, and then with that process provides mitigating measures that the applicant would have to follow to satisfy.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we actually went through this just north. Our first phase in Mariposa was 400 unit senior disabled project where we had public housing dollars among public housing subsidy. So that required us to do a lot of measures within the building, in the building design to respond to those mitigation factors.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Is that the senior building to the north?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Correct? Yes.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Into your admin building?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yep. Okay. That's the 1035 voltage.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Ah. Yeah. So I did want to mention that we were successful in securing some funding as part of the 2022 budget in our Department of Transportation and Infrastructure will be issuing an RFP to identify an engineering firm that will be hired to look at which approach to use that will then provide some guidance to our agencies so'",
        "'speaker_7': 'that as they are reviewing requests for permits, rezoning applications, etc., they will have some very clear guidance on how to ensure that life safety issues are being addressed as part of development activity. So I'm assuming this is not a project that is going to be shovel ready any time in the immediate future, given that you have to'",
        "'speaker_7': 'go through the HUD environmental process, correct? It's just acquiring it with part of the funding. I think that's part of the host the funding that was approved by city council to ensure that we've got sites to to be building and to secure those vouchers, etc..'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So accurate.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That is accurate. And then as we select the development partner and then they'll develop they'll propose a program that will work with them jointly and with the city and our state partners to make sure that all the requirements for the funding that's required is met prior to an application to likely get tax credits to develop this.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So just for your information, one of the things that will be happening is there will be some outreach to external partners or development interests to ensure that there is some back and forth conversation around the recommendations that will come out of that work done by an engineering firm.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So that's why I thank you. All right. Thank you, Madam President. And I hear Mike's not on.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But thank you, Councilmember Ortega, for your questions and the reminder about my mike. Megan Yankey, you had come up. Did you want to address some of the questions as well? Go ahead and introduce yourself and we can get it on the record.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Megan Young from Host just wanted to come here to speak on behalf of the supportive housing element of this building. And just wanted to reiterate what Chris Bulky had to say about the voucher component and how much goes into the environmental review.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We had a project at Walnut Street Lofts recently or within the last few years up in the Reno area that had to go through noise mitigation, different environmental things to just pass their environmental review. So I expect that we would have the same level of scrutiny in this particular case as it comes from vouchers, where we are'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the administrator of the Environmental Review as well as a funder and get financing eventually in this project. All right. Thank you, Megan. Next up, we've got Councilman Cashman.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, thank you, Madam President. And Chris, I think I might have heard in your answer to Councilmember Ortega, but are you far enough along to have any wish list guesstimate to how many units this property might be able to provide?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I know it depends on the bedroom, Max, etc.. You know, Paul, it's a little difficult to know based on, you know, some of the other studies that we need to do and even bringing in a private or even a public access, you know, bring in ninth and connected dosage.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But if you taking my developer brain, you might net, you know, develop castle at an acre and usually typical 9% tax credit projects affordable and has a mix of very low income or supportive housing not requiring as much parking on site, you could probably yield 90 to 100 units.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. That's all I need. Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilman Cashman, Councilor Pro Tem Torres. Thank you so much. Chris, my question is for you as well. Some of the actually, all of the letters of opposition came from across the street was that land formerly owned by DOJ and DOJ homes at one time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. And that was part of the Wing and Hope six redevelopment where there was a goal to have homeownership opportunities. And certainly at the time, as we saw of that back in 2012 looking at townhome. So we were working in the city and part of that plan was that was approved by HUD.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We elected not to develop the highest and best use on that site so that we can get homeownership opportunities within the neighborhood. Part of the stabilization and program goals for the Hope six grant. Great.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The you may have answered it, but I can't I can't remember if it was mentioned here in a previous meeting that we had, because I also had a question about the other 60% and what kind of affordability would be attached to that section of the project.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Certainly. And I can tell you from experience and I invite Haley Joel here, who's been a great project manager for us and working to develop our request for proposals. And as we launched the three partnership with the city, we did do a roundtable with a lot of permanent supportive housing developers to understand how to design this program'",
        "'speaker_0': ', all of which have a mission to do all affordable, usually doing a mixed and mixed affordable model. So likely, you know, up to 80% AMI or 60% AMI would be the remaining portion of that. Again, that all depends on, you know, what program, who we're trying to serve, larger bedroom types, you know, all going into that process'",
        "'speaker_0': '. And that's where this great partnership has allowed us to, you know, bring to the table a host the state, to really look at each one of these projects and evaluate what's the right thing for the site and in consideration what the community has asked for.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. And as a result of the D three project, this would remain a Denver Housing Authority asset permanently, right. It wouldn't be something that that could be sold in the future.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Correct. DHEA is part of this program, will do a ground is a long term premise and with it have the city's covenant that was included in the intergovernmental agreement.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. So will be perpetual affordability associate. Okay. Thank you so much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. Thank you, counsel pro tem Torres. The public hearing is closed. Comments by members of Council on Council Bill 1331, Council Pro Tem Torres. Thank you so much. And thanks to DOJ and to host all of you for being here and putting so much into this project, and particularly a development that at some level is going'",
        "'speaker_1': 'to be 100% affordable. And it's always, I think, that 30% and below that transitional housing that we're always reaching for and I always find really hard to acquire. So I appreciate the project that made that available and something that you've been building toward on on this one.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's come up even in our conversations about the safe outdoor space that's in LA and Lincoln Park, that that hasn't been an easy project to take to get off the ground, largely because people really wanted to say, but what's the long term plan?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That associates are not permanent, they are not a home. And and this is one of the projects that we point to, to say, but we are building them. We will be putting actual units of homes on the ground in Lincoln Park that provide that actual transition.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I really appreciate that this is one of those examples of where we're setting that forward. I did read every single one of the letters that was submitted, and just you want to say this doesn't affect the area that was designated as a historic cultural district that we designated recently for Lima, Lincoln Park.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And this is exactly what was envisioned by the development not just of the DOJ property in the long term vision for Mariposa, but of the D-3 effort citywide and really to identify these locations for supportive housing. So I just want to thank you all and thank you for, I think, this larger vision for that area that's coming'",
        "'speaker_1': 'together of every neighborhood should have multiple layers of affordability, should be a neighborhood that's easy to access transit. This is only one of the two grocery stores in my district and they are on the farthest ends. But, you know, grateful for allowing Lincoln Park to also have a grocery store that is walkable.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So a lot of different things. I think that that that make this a really suitable place for additional affordable, especially transitional housing. So I look forward to voting yes. And I appreciate the votes from my colleagues and support as well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So thank you. Thank you, Counsel Pro Tem Torres. And I'm also happy to support this this evening that meets all of the criteria and excited to see this get going. Madam Secretary, roll call on Council Bill 1331, please.'",

Amends the Denver Zoning Code to correct an error in the maximum building footprint for detached accessory dwelling units in E-SU- Zone Districts. The last regularly scheduled Council meeting within the 30-day review period is on 12-13-21. The Committee approved filing this item at its meeting on 11-9-21.": [
        "'speaker_1': 'Madam President, I. Madam Secretary, close the voting and announce the results. 12 US 12 Eyes Council Bill 21 Dash 1331 has passed. Thank you to the folks who presented this evening and the community members as well. Councilman Herndon, will you please put Council Bill 1332 on the floor for final passage?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes, Madam President, I move that council bill 21 desk 1330 to be placed upon final consideration and do pass.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. It has been moved and seconded. The required public hearing for Council Bill 1332 is open. May we have the staff report?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. Thank you. Members of City Council for hanging in there. Just one more public hearing of the night. And as Andrew had promised earlier, this is a very targeted text amendment proposed for the Denver zoning code.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And before you kick off, do you want to introduce yourself?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Apologies. I'm a barge with the Department of Community Planning and Development, and I'm here with a text amendment to the Denver Zoning Code to correct an error that was introduced into the zoning code with the 2021 bundle of Denver Zoning Code text amendments.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That bundle was adopted by City Council in the summer, and the error inadvertently reduced the maximum building footprint that was allowed for detached accessory dwelling units on zone lots greater than 6000 square feet in basically all of the single unit districts in the urban edge neighborhood context.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That includes the zone district that was justified earlier this evening to a couple of areas of East Colfax. We'd like to get this corrected. The proposed amendment would have no impact on any other zoned district or building form.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We're using a process allowed by the zoning code to begin the adoption process with Council Committee. So Planning Board has not considered or made a recommendation on this proposed text amendment. The next few slides just quickly walk you through what happened here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We're looking at a portion of the detached accessory dwelling unit building form table in Article four of the Denver Zoning Code. That's the urban edge neighborhood context, specifically at the maximum building footprint on a couple of lot sizes for single unit zone districts, the maximum building footprint being the portion of the lot area that an accessory dwelling'",
        "'speaker_0': 'unit building form can cover, like looking at a lot fewer dimensionally. It has historically been 864 square feet for detached views on lot 6000 to 7000 square feet and 2000 square feet on lots greater than 7000 square feet.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This is the public review draft for the bundle of text amendments and you see various proposed changes marked up there which circle those two maximum buildings. Footprints are not marked up as a change, and yet those numbers are different.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So just going back to that previous slide, we had 864 square feet and 1000 square feet. Now we're seeing 650 square feet in 864 square feet with essentially a kind of unfortunate cut and paste error. And because that page was filed for adoption with the text amendment, that became part of the official code when that bundle was'",
        "'speaker_0': 'adopted. So if you look at the code as it's on the website right now, it will have those two maximums of 650 and 860 square, 64 square feet in this form table, which is different than all the other detached accessory building form tables across the code.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So the proposed fix is quite simple. Change the numbers back to 864 and 1000 square feet to be consistent across the code. Looking at the review criteria, the comprehensive plan has a number of relevant goals. Probably the most relevant is the first one listed that proposed revisions should ensure that the zoning ordinance remains flexible and accommodating.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And you kind of see that as being a keep the code up to date and relevant recommendation, which is also mentioned in Blueprint Denver that the code should continue to respond to the needs of the city by remaining modern and flexible.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We'll also just note the blueprint recommendation that we've talked about more this evening that directs us to remove barriers to constructing accessory dwelling units while also creating context sensitive form standards. This is an inadvertent barrier we talked about that ideas in Denver project that we're kicking off now is really going to look at all of the other'",
        "'speaker_0': 'barriers. But this area is right now, there's actually plans and process in affected zone districts where the design was made thinking that the maximum building footprint was one thing accidentally changed. They can't get the approval until the zoning code is updated.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we're bringing this forward sooner. The looking at the blueprint equity concept staff believe that this text amendment will have a largely neutral impact on the three equity criteria that we look at. And that it'll further public safety, health and welfare by providing clarity and predictability in zoning regulations and by ensuring consistent application of adopted plans, and'",
        "'speaker_0': 'that it will result in uniformity of district regulations and restrictions. So staff based on a finding that these review criteria have been met. We recommend that City Council adopt this Denver Zoning Code Text Amendment.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. Thank you very much for the staff report, Abe. And we have one speaker online this evening, Jessie Paris.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Yesterday, the members of council, those watching at home the numbers just as we saw Paris Hilton represented for Blackstar a move to self defense positive as a command for social change as well as the Unity Party of Colorado and frontline black males.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I'll be the next member in 2023. And I live in just a councilman Herndon's district, and I'm in favor of the amendments in my 80 years or so so far of creating affordable affordability, affordable housing in the city, along with safe outdoor spaces and tiny home villages.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So this amendment is much needed. Please pass this mine so we can get this error corrected. And that's all I have to say. And then I have a Happy New Year. Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. Thank you very much, Jesse. And the same to you. That concludes our speakers questions from members of Council on Council Bill 1332. Councilmember Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I just wanted to ask you one question, Abe. So it looks like this does not apply to any of the mixed use districts, correct?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That is correct. So the way our accessory dwelling unit standards are set up now, they only apply in residential zone districts and only apply as accessory to a single dwelling unit use. So in a mixed use district, you might see things that look like an Adu or like a carriage house, but they were permitted in a different'",
        "'speaker_0': 'path because in a district like that you can there's a lot more flexibility. You could have two primary building forms, for example, and one just might just look like an idea.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So even though there are many of our mixed use, some districts that have residential structures, the lots are treated much differently than they are if they were residentially zoned. So the example that I've used before at 38th and Eliot and I think the last time I brought this up, somebody said those were two separate lots.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But the house behind the house in the front that was built is so close to the first structure, the initial structure that I it's hard for me to believe that they're separate lots and it's significantly bigger than the house and the front.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So if people wanted to do that all up and down 38th Avenue, where these residential structures are that may be zoned as mixed use, they could continue to do the domino effect that happened with that house on the corner.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, I am familiar with the project at 38th and Eliot. And so the house is facing 38. And then there was just that homeowner may have owned the other lot at one point, but it's.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Separated.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sold off separately and a project permitted by the mixed use zoning happened on it. That's much bigger than the house. Of course, they could have sold both the house and the other property and then a big, bigger project would have covered both.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So because it's.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's a mixed use or commercial, there is no setbacks that typically are required in residential zones.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's right. Although there are building code restrictions that would, you know, generally mean that buildings have to have at least some separation unless they have a really high fire rating.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. And I know we're not talking about mixed use zones in this particular application, but I just had to understand and wrap my brain around how we're allowing that to happen and could see that happen all up and down a commercial corridor where what maybe once was zoned as residential structures, maybe.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I don't know if this goes back to the 2010 zoning changes that happened that turn some of our commercial corners into mixed use, zoned districts, and now allow something that could not only impact, you know, the the corridor and potential parking for some of the businesses, but it then has an impact on the properties across the alley'",
        "'speaker_7': 'as well. So I don't know that that's something that we're looking at to do a fix on or if we think that that is just okay to happen. And I don't know how many commercial corridors we zoned or up zoned from residential structures to commercial that this would apply to.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But I think it'd be worth looking into to see, you know, where we would then create this domino effect that then has neighbors screaming at all of us for something that may be an unintended consequence. So I just wanted to raise that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Great.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. Thank you, Councilmember Ortega. Abe, did you have any response or.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, Councilwoman Ortega, I'll just mentioned that we we are looking at those kinds of concerns. We probably put it more in the bucket of the blueprint recommendations that talk about the design character of our commercial centers and corridors and how they transition to residential areas.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we actually have on our wish list a project to look at, look at those centers and corridors across the city and the zoning tools that apply there. We don't have it on the immediate schedule, so it's probably, you know, a couple of years away.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But that's, I think, an important conversation to have. I don't know the specific history of 38, but a lot of those corridors, even before 2010, did have some kind of commercial zoning, even though in many cases they have some single unit houses still on them.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. Thank you. Thank you, Abe. Councilmember Sawyer. Thanks, Madam President. Abe just wanted to say thank you. We discovered this story in the rezoning in East Colfax, which is in the Southern District. And it's a real simple, straightforward, quick change that was fixing a clerical error and just wanted to say thank you for that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thanks. All right. Thank you. Councilmember Sawyer, the public hearing this closed comments by members of Council on Council Bill 1332. It looks like we don't have any comments and so happy to support this correction this evening. Madam Secretary, I just want to make sure council members.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay, you're you're not in the queue for comment. I'm not. It's just deleting me out for some reason. Okay. All right. Very good. Just wanted to make sure, Madam Secretary, roll call on Council Bill 1332. Please see about the.'",
