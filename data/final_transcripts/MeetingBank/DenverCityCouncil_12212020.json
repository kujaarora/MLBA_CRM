        "'speaker_4': 'But I and I did talk to the district attorney McCann, and I believe she's actually in our audience as well. But I understand that this was amended from in committee, from what was originally submitted. And I want to understand how we got to this point where the raises are set out for a year one, two, three and'",

        "'speaker_3': 'And what was amended at the request of Councilwoman Sawyer and we all agreed was that in that fourth year, the raise would also be contingent on other city employees getting a raise. So we made that amendment. Yep. All right.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So is this consistent with the previous years? But as a reminder, there is no raise in 2021 at all.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Right.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'But it be the average of these career service wages. And I did have a discussion with District Attorney McCann about this. I know that there are some inequities in the level of pay between Denver and the first judicial district, which is Jeffco Gilpin, where they are paid the DA is paid more but handles fewer cases, I believe'",
        "'speaker_4': ', than than our in our district attorney's office. But I, I really would have preferred the. That the races in years three and four be pegged to the average raise for city employees rather than being its career service in 2023.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Got a 2% raise, then the district attorney gets 3%. So I'm a little troubled by that. Madam President, I listen to the rest of the discussion here. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Madam President. Well, as was said earlier today, just because we can doesn't necessarily mean that we should. And I appreciate Councilwoman Black giving that summary, because I was going to ask that that be done.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So there's no raise for 2021 in the future. Years are contingent upon what happens with our city employees. So I'm just questioning.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'What will come out of a public comment in regards to that. Maybe with the exception of just encouraging council members to lower the salaries.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I don't I don't know at all. But the idea of having time of we have to do this, this is and you can't just vote no, we are required to set the salaries. So it just my thought, Madam President, certainly your decision.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I that's just what I wanted to add to the comment. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you. Councilman Herndon. Councilman CdeBaca, we've got a couple other council members up. I'm going to go ahead and bounce to them. Councilman Kimmich.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Madam President. And to my colleagues who weren't there, Councilman Flynn, in particular, you raised a question about the amount. We did have a pretty extensive discussion that city employees don't actually get an across the board amounts.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So when, for example, the city says we are going to give merit raises at the average of 2.9%. City employees might get a raise as high as 4% or as low as two, depending on their performance, depending on which quadrant they're in and, you know, where they're at in their in their particular scale.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so I think for me, I raised the point that it's very difficult to say that it will be pegged to which city employee, to the city employee who gets the best merit score to the city employee who get you know, gets the average.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so so I think that, you know, for predictability of budgeting, frankly, you know, I don't see the second issue that I raised personally was just the question that that there is no other elected official whose salary is set to be variable based on that factor that council salaries do are based.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The council mayor and other elected salaries are based on a formula that looks backwards at city employee raises as part of the formula. But it's not that those but then we pick the amount and we distribute it as a certainty each year.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I think that this is already unique in saying that the salary increase may not happen at all if city employees don't get it. And I think to make it further contingent would just be a little bit inconsistent with how we treat the clerk and recorder and the auditor there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, the other thing that I thought was compelling is that the state of Colorado pays for more than $100,000 of this salary, which is it makes it unique as well. So just a few things that came up at committee that may or may not be important to folks, but just wanted to get them on the record'",
        "'speaker_3': 'since we're we're having a little version of that debate. So important questions about timing. But I also just wanted us to think about, you know, consistency between electeds who, you know, are also city wide electeds like our clerk and our auditor who are not subject to those conditions.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilman Canete. Councilman Hines.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Councilmember Flynn, I have the same question as Councilmember Orange said. We did we did talk about that. And and because of the timing, it just made it difficult to do a lot of the detailed discussion beyond what councilmember.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So the only other thing that that I mentioned that that I want to put on the record is it was alluded to by President Gilmore, and that was we I hope that we have a day of color or even better, a woman of color who is our district attorney at some point.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And if we if we start all races now, then that makes the position less competitive for for attorneys who can make way more money in the private practice and not have their houses physically protested or personally in person protested, or have all of their decisions open for scrutiny.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So, you know, I it's it's a lot of money. It's more money than I've ever made. But but I'm also not a well qualified attorney. And and so, again, hopefully someday we can have an idea of color or even better, a woman of color.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I wouldn't want there to to be a huge deficit between what the D.A. makes and what what private attorneys make. Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Well, thank you, Councilman Hines, and your backup, Councilwoman CdeBaca. We have this on the floor to vote on its publication. So after your comments, we're going to go ahead and vote on the publication of this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Awesome. Just a quick comment and a question. The comment is regarding having the public input session at committee ten 3130 in the day is often a major challenge for regular people to be able to tune in and participate because many of them are working all day long and don't have the ability that we have to set aside'",
        "'speaker_3': 'time and do some public testimony. And so I understand that it happened that finger and believe that the public should have an opportunity any time they like to address us, especially if the things that they're planning to address are going to be helpful for us in the future.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And my question for Kirsten is we know this has to the salaries need to be set, but because the salary needs to be set, does that mean it needs to also be increased? Kirsten Crawford Legislative Council. It's a good question.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'No, there's no requirement to increase. It could be frozen over the four year period. That is a decision that council needs to make prior to the term of office beginning. Got it. Thank you very much. That's it from my questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman Flynn, your backup.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Just quickly, Madam President. Thank you. I am going to vote yes to publish because we have to have this finalized by the next meeting. So there's no doubt about that. But I am uncertain on the amount of the raise as as is Councilwoman CdeBaca.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I want to I will talk more with colleagues and with the D.A. and with others over the holiday. And and. Kirsten, I suppose that we could amend this on final because we're not changing the title. Correct. Silence means consent.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm not sure about that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Just assume they're sending a child back in there.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'll just assume it does. And I do understand, as Councilwoman Kennedy said, that the the merits of the pay raises for career service are that they have an average and everybody gets something different depending on performance. But I would have much rather seen this pegged to the actual career service average overall raise rather than 3% no matter'",
        "'speaker_4': 'what career service gets. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Very good. Thank you, Councilman Flynn. And so the motion on the floor is to order Council Bill 20 Dash 1553 ordered published. Madam Secretary, roll call.'",

So per the landmark ordinance, in order for a property to be designated, the structure needs to maintain its integrity. It needs to be 30 years of age or older or of exceptional importance.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The structure must meet at least three out of the ten criteria, and the LPC needs to consider the structures historic context. This particular property is significant under three criteria, and we'll go through all three of these. So first, the property is associated with the development of the city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's directly tied to the development of Denver's West Side, which is one of Denver's oldest residential neighborhoods and has historically been a working class and immigrant.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In the 1870s. Alexander Cameron Hunt, which later on went on to become a territorial governor, was an early resident and developer of the area. He homesteaded the land that is the park within on the Lincoln Park and then subdivided the surrounding neighborhood and which was started the beginning of the early development of the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Followed by him was another notable Denver businessman who started developing the neighborhood. John W Smith. Smith had platted subdivisions in the Capitol Hill area. He developed some of the early water supply. Smith's ditch, of which there's still a remnant in.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Wash.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Park, is named after him. And so then following E.C. Hunt, Smith also began subdividing the area. He did land and provided money for the construction of the chapel at the corner of what was then ninth and Water Street.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In 1882, the chapel was constructed for the Church of the United Brethren, and it was situated on the outskirts of the city, as was moved by the Rocky Mountain News at the time of its construction. And so Smith used this likely as a form of advertisement for his subdivision in order to show that there was a viable'",
        "'speaker_3': 'community. He built the chapel to show that the community was strong enough in order to support a church. And so it is likely that the church was something that he did in order to help sell his subdivision. But it represents the growth of the area that the neighborhood was well-developed enough to support the church as well as'",
        "'speaker_3': 'from other commercial commercial area commercial buildings in the area. It was one of eight churches between 1882 and 1893 that were constructed in what we now know as the Lincoln Park neighborhood. As you take a look at this one, one map to the left, it shows where the church is located.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And this is reflective of an 1897 mapping overall. This is one of the oldest remaining churches in the Ormeau Park neighborhood and is significant as it represents the historical development of the city. The property is also distinct, is also significant for its distinctive, visible characteristics of the Gothic revival style.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The property is designated on the State Register of historic properties for its architectural style, as can be seen in the steeply pitched gable roof. The ash square masonry, which is really stone and actually means that it from rough edges on the front of the property, on the front of the brick, on the front of the stone.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It can also be seen in the engaged buttresses on the corner, as well as the Lancet doors and windows, which are the pointed windows, and then finally in the prominent steeple. And so this shows the characteristics of the Gothic revival style is significant for its architectural style.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And finally, the property is associated with social movements, institutions that contributed significantly to the culture of the neighborhoods, community and city. This was historically a working class immigrant community, and it changed from a primarily European to Latino residents in the 1930s, as started to see a change in the number of residents and the residents who resided there'",
        "'speaker_3': '. This is partially as it goes into the postwar era through the Presidio program, which invited guest workers to come to the area because Denver need additional workers. And there was a promise of free housing and there was already a Latino community in the war on the Lincoln Park neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's where a lot of residents resided. Also in the 1930s, you saw through the Homeowners Loan Corporation, the redlining map or the map that we know now is redlining. And in this area, which you can see here, this area was noted as redlining.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so there was a lot of disinvestment into the neighborhood. And so with this disinvestment into the neighborhood, discriminatory redlining and then postwar, you had white flight to the suburbs. The Church of the United Brethren dissolved. And so a Denver Area Council of Churches want to start an interdenominational organization in the downtown area.'",

The building served as a place of worship, a social agency, a food bank, a school and a meeting center in the Denver inner city parish lobby for welfare reform, student reform, and for farm workers rights.'",

It was one of the many mutual aid societies that were arising in the Lincoln Park neighborhood that were associated with the Chicano movement.

There were leaders forming within the community, some of which were serving as directors of Denver Inner City Parish. And so the West Side and Lincoln Park in particular became central to the Chicano movement within inner city, was an important component'",
        "'speaker_3': 'of both the neighborhood and the Chicano movement. And that can probably best be typified by the blow out of 1969, which was later called the central event in Denver for what was become what is called the Chicano Movement.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So in late 1968, there were walkouts in L.A. from their schools. And as we saw through the protest this past summer, as protests start to grow. Not long after, in 1969, we started seeing protest here in Denver, particularly at the West High School.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There was a history teacher who was very poorly treating these students and had ongoing insults about the Chicano culture. There was nothing. There was nothing was occurring. There was there was no ramifications for the teacher. So on March 20th, about 300 students and family members walked out and so it became known as the blowout.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Police arrived wearing gas masks, carrying billy clubs. And so protesters sought to avoid police brutality by fleeing from the area, some of which sought shelter within Denver inner city parish. And as you can see on the image here, this is a still from a documentary.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This shows the parish in the background. So if you're looking at the map, here is the high school and here is the Denver inner city parish. And so as students and protesters were fleeing from the police, some stopped at the parish as a place to seek seek respite.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Others continue on to a march to La alma Lincoln Park. And so the Denver inner city parish is really a significant part of the Chicano movement and is an institution that is central to the kind of movement here in Denver.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so it meets the criteria, Jake. For designation. So in order for a property to be designated, in addition to meeting the three criteria, it also needs to be related or still needs to demonstrate integrity, which is just basically the preservation way of saying just the building looks like what it used to look like.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And although there have been additions and changes over time, these changes were within the period of significance, which is basically the time period for which a property is important. So the large addition was that in 1923 there was a cross gable that was added.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Some of the windows had been changed, but overall the property looks like what it used to look like first when it was originally constructed in the initial and then with the addition of the 1923 additions, was still there when it was significant as part of the Chicano movement.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so the property retains integrity. The Landmark Preservation Commission also considers the historic context of a property in historic context should be ideally strongly related to the criteria for which a property is designated. So for this property, at the time it was constructed in 1882 and 1910, Del Picco was one of the first chapels or churches in'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the neighborhood. And so it really reflected the growth of the Lincoln Park neighborhood. It was designed in the Gothic revival style, which is a prevalent architectural style for churches at the time. And then in the 1960s, the chapel became the home of the Denver Intercity Parish, which was an organization that was directly associated with the important movements'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and leaders of the Chicano in Denver. So the OPC found that the historic context was reflected well in the persecution application. For this particular property. There were two public comments that we heard a receiver. One was a written comment in support of the designation application.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then there was one public comment in support of the Landmark Preservation Commission meeting. In summary, the designation meets the criteria. It's over 30 years of age. The application meets at least three out of the ten criteria. It retains its integrity and the LPC considered its historic context in its deliberation.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Landmark Preservation Commission unanimously motion to forward it to you for your review and CPD staff recommends approval of the application.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Well, thank you so much for the staff report tonight. Council has not received any written testimony on Council Bill 1399. And tonight we have five individuals signed up to speak. And our first speaker is Matt Slaby.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'We're particularly interested in the adaptive uses that are available under landmark designation. You know, as as you see right now, it's, it's only available to use under the RH three as as functionally as condos. And, you know, our intention is to use it as office space for a business that I own, but then also to use the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'remainder of the building to lease back to similarly situated organizations like Inner City Parish that sold the building. That was something that we represented to them at the time of sale. So with that, thank you to Kara and Jamie Taurus and the folks of historic Denver.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And if there's anything that I can do in the way of answering questions, I'm more than happy to be available to do that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Matt. We appreciate that. Next up, we have Annie Levinsky.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hi, everyone. I'm Annie Levinsky. I'm the executive director of Historic Denver, and we're located at 1420 Ogden Street in Denver. And for those of you who don't know us, we're a membership based nonprofit organization that supports historic preservation, advocacy and technical assistance.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so tonight, we're here on both accounts, and we've had the opportunity to work with Matt on this application to produce a landmark designation. But we actually have a deeper history with this particular building. So I just wanted to share a little bit of that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We first became involved with what is Smith Chapel or Denver Inner City Parish in the early 2000 when we helped the building get listed on the State Register of Historic Places. And that was done in order to make the building eligible for grants and incentive programs like the Colorado State Historical Fund.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So after that listing, we applied for a series of restoration grants on behalf of Denver Inner City Parish and worked with them to get work on things like window restoration and other improvements to the building that made it functional and useful for them that resulted in the parish donating a preservation facade is meant to historic Denver in'",
        "'speaker_3': '2015 and that provides some additional exterior protection to the building and runs with the building and the land. And so that easement continues in effect today, even though the parish did sell the building. So we find this to be a very special asset and are really excited to be here tonight to support Matt and to the next'",
        "'speaker_3': 'phase of life for the building. And I think there's a couple of reasons that this is particularly special. First, as you heard and Kara discussed at length, this building is really associated with Denver's Chicano movement, and particularly with the West high blowout, but but also the many leaders who, you know, cut their teeth in this neighborhood and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'went on to become important people in our city who who made significant change for our community. So we hope that it's the beginning of a series of designations that can use this cultural criteria to really acknowledge the our social movements of our past.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But the second reason I think tonight is particularly special is that this designation offers the owner an opportunity to take advantage of an incentive that comes with designation. That's something we've talked a lot about in Task Force work with some of you over the last few years.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And while the use overlay is not new, it's great to see somebody able to take advantage of that and to do so in a way that will allow the building to continue to be used and accessed by the community and used by organizations that are based in the community, and that will continue even if the building's ownership'",
        "'speaker_3': 'changes over time. So thank you so much for your consideration. Thank you to Matt for taking on this project. I know it can sometimes seem daunting and particularly thank you to Councilwoman Torres for her help and support to us and to Matt in getting it completed.'",

Galapagos St Care's presentation did a great job explaining why this chapel is significant for its association with the historical development of Denver's West Side, embodying the Gothic revival, architectural style, and being integral to the Chicano movement of the 1960s and seventies.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Over the last few years, we at Historic Denver have been working with the law in the Lincoln Park neighborhood on a project to research and inventory the long history of the neighborhood up to and including the Chicano movement.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This research has helped inform the designation process for this chapel and ensured that the chapel is not only recognized for the art for its architecture, which was the case when it was previously listed on the State Register of Historic Places, but is also recognized for its cultural association and for the years it was occupied by the Denver'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Madam President. I don't know if Councilwoman Torres would want to go first with any questions, if she had any. Because I want to respect. No. Okay. Thank you. I have a couple of questions, Kara, on the use overlay.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Are we also through this bill? Are we also rezoning or applying use overlay three or is that a later action?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's actually already been to have it. So. So there are few areas in the city that have the U.S. really like a lot of capital already has it. I see some areas over here in LA on the Lincoln Park, so it's already there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This is just allowing them to take advantage of it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. And I'm very interested in that 1923 addition. How does that function and maybe is it Mat? I could answer this as well as Kara maybe. But how does that 1923 addition interplay with the 1890 structure of the church?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Does it function as a single structure? Is it? I've not been inside of it, so I. I don't know.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It does. I mean, it is one single structure, but I have not been inside either. So I think Matt might be one who's better situated to answer that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay, Matt, would you be able to answer that?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah, of course. So when I was out of the parish, it was the classrooms that were adjoining the chapel portion. The chapel portion was used as a gymnasium for its latter years. So it's it's three levels. And then when it was designed, it was designed to match.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If you look at the. The architectural features on there, you'll see that it's designed to match the chapel itself. And so it's remained intact since 1923. And the best of my knowledge, it hasn't changed that look.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I can see where it imitates some of the aspects of the chapel, but of course it's stone versus red brick, so it's not quite a match up. So that leads me to my last question. Do we have other examples of Denver landmarks that incorporate adjoining structures of different eras and different construction styles?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Are there other. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes, we do. We do probably the one that that most comes to mind and one that you guys might have seen more recently was the Emily Griffith Opportunity School.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Oh, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Actually a series of multiple different buildings with different styles. And so it's significant for a couple of different architectural styles on that one. So there are there are some that's the most recent one that you guys have. We have.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'See.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You're right. Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you, Madam President. I'd just like to thank Matt for his commitment to not only purchasing this property, but to preserving it and and maintaining it as a as a landmark. Thank you, Matt.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilman Flynn. And see know their hands raised for questions. The public hearing for council bill 20 Dash 1399 is closed. Comments by members of Council. Councilwoman Torres.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you so much, Madam President. And thank you, Keira, Anna and Shannon at historic Denver and thinking about Slaby, the property owner, really being diligent and supportive of the designation of this property. I knew it only as academia, so the applications research even gave me more context and appreciation for the building and its role in our West'",

I'm very proud that this is our first application or seeing under the new landmark designation criteria, which includes culture and specifically this language abbreviated associated with social movements that contributed significantly to the culture of the neighborhood, community, city, state and nation.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Madam President. I would just like to also offer my support as I believe this meets all the criteria. I remember learning about the West Denver walkouts and the importance that that piece of land played in the history of the Chicano movement.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And when I was working for Councilwoman Monteiro, who represented not only the park neighborhood, oftentimes she and I would think about how we could proactively save structures that had importance. But as to Councilwoman Teresa's point, there was no criteria in the landmark ordinance that talked about cultural significance.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I just want to thank everyone in the West Side for getting this done. I think it's so important to have these structures to remind us of who came before us. And they will also and they'll be forever in history in Denver.'",

I've lived down the road from Columbus Park most of my life, and I'm opposed to changing the name of Columbus Park.

It also highlights the disparity of civic assets allocated slabs dedicated to Hispanic figures over two dozen compared with only two, one of which is under attack dedicated and allocated to the Italian community.'",

While some landmarks still remain, such as the martial arts Cerrone's Grocery and of course the small Carmel Church, all are privately owned.'",

Val Verde Park. Paul Sandoval High School. Castro School. Panga. Vale of Art, etc. etc.. Based on this comparison alone, Denver City Council cannot in good conscience move forward with this proposal.'",

It is also unethical to diminish and erase the historical significance of the park to the Italian-American community and the consequent acknowledgment of the contributions of the Italian-Americans to the community at large.'",

It should also be noted that there is a pyramid structure within Columbus Park that has a plaque affixed, dedicating it to La Raza that has been there many years.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If nothing else, why not leave everything the way it is? The Italian-American community keeps their park. The Hispanic American community keeps their La Raza structure, and both communities benefit by continuing to share a public resource they have shared for many years.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'That is what led us the park is to the Chicano, Latino and the Northside community. It is the land that holds our values to come together, to fight injustices and to celebrate our cultures. Thank you so much for allowing the time and I hope that everyone is in support of this renaming.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Everyone, thank you so much. So I'm actually a resident of District one. I lived directly on the park on Osage Street, but I don't want to speak to you as a resident today. I actually want to talk to you in a professional capacity.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'What I will not do, I promise. But I do just want to say that over the past year or two, I found myself answering the same question again and again as Confederate statues and monuments come down across the country.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that question is if we remove a statue, right? If we rename a school or a neighborhood. Doesn't that mean we're raising history? And my response is always the same. No. We're not. And I tell my students this all the time, history is a choice.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We choose to remember and celebrate certain things and not others. And those choices say a lot more about the values of the society that is making those choices than the things that are being remembered. So stuff like monuments, memorials, the names of schools or buildings or parks, these say a lot more about the society that builds them'",
        "'speaker_1': ', the society that names them than they say about the thing that's being commemorated. So I think the real question facing the city council right now is what kind of community do we want to be today in 2020? What kind of values do we want to celebrate today?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I don't envy any of you. You've had to make some extremely tough decisions over this extremely tough past year. But this one, this is not one of those tough decisions. I say this again in a professional capacity as a historian, changing the name of this park from Columbus Park to LA Rosa Park is actually pretty straightforward'",
        "'speaker_1': '. This change would go from celebrating. What I see is some of the absolute worst parts of this country's history to celebrating some of the very best parts of this country's history. So for those reasons, I am fully in support of this name change and just want to thank you for your willingness to consider taking this step.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'No, and I will be the next November 2023. I agree with everything that was said previous to me, minus the guy who didn't want to take the part of this. Is a fixture in the north side, is a community center on the city that the city is finally realizing that after all these years, that is a step'",
        "'speaker_1': 'in the right direction. We need to honor the cultural significance of this park and of this neighborhood that's dominantly brown and Chicano not. Now. I was known as the last the part. I am a native. I was born here in 1987.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And this part has always been known since I've been living as the life of the party. So to hear the pushback of just simply taking the name from Columbus, who is not somebody that we should be honoring, especially in the age that we're in now.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Post George Floyd protests and previous speakers for Confederate monuments coming down. Why in 2020, with the city of Denver still be honoring a criminal such as Chris of All Columbus? So I am very happy and pleased to hear the testimony of those that descend directly from the playmakers that started the Crusade for Justice in the 1960s and'",
        "'speaker_1': '1970s. Representative Selena Gutierrez. And Senator Julie Gonzalez. They understand the historical significance of this part and why it is so important that this world is also full of holes in the name of this park, like a famous estate.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's always been known as the Rosa Parks since I've been living with this 33 years. So with that being said, I'm glad to see that the city is actually taking the initiative to close and accept the cultural significance of our many diverse neighborhoods in the city and honoring the contribution that the level of community has given to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the city of Denver. So with that being said, good job. You've got this of.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Jesse. Our last speaker this evening is Emmanuel Martinez. We're going to need you to unmute, sir. There you go. We're going now. Mm hmm. Go ahead, please.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, I try to be brief, which is what I have to say about this, because nearly 50, 50 years ago, after founding Rome, a recreation center, and I was its first director, and at that time, Joe Johnson was director, Parks and Recreation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And he agreed to my request to be a full time muralist for the city of Denver Parks and Rec. And after painting murals at Lama they wanted the Plaza Park was that was already being renamed by the staff there and wanted me to paint murals there so I did when I helped, I didn't have time to do'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that mural. So so while Roberto Lucero pretty much designed in my help him paint it and get the materials to do that. And during that time. There was some controversy later because at that time, the city council, Linda Damiano, who was also Italian-American, urged Joe Johns, who after we had painted a mural that was acceptable by the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'community and by the staff. He wanted me to paint over the mural because I was in the city, the city murals, and I refused to do that. And as a result of that, I got fired from my job.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I have a little history with. But let us apart. Going way back to 1970. And, you know, I would just like to urge the city council members to please support the name change of Columbus Park. A lot of support the size of it, besides a small number of Italian residents who identify with Columbus.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Most of the residents of that area. I've been calling this park. But also park. And it just seems to me like this is is this a no brainer? I mean, is the vast majority of the community has been using that, not calling it that, you know, it's appropriate to do that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And anyway, it's important to realize that La Rosa Park was just the name. La. The site is a positive term. You know, it's you know, it it relates to people, you know, different cultures. It's not exclusively, you know, just for Chicanos or Latinos or Mexicans.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So it's I think I think we will soon be.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. So that's the time we have allocated to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We appreciate it. Thank you. That concludes our speakers questions from members of Council on Council Bill 1444, Councilwoman Canete.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Madam President, I wanted to see whether perhaps Professor Rodriguez, if he is still here, or maybe the councilwoman, the sponsor, might want to speak a little more, or even Mr. Martinez, since he was about to talk about this, but about the the term.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So so when I learn Spanish, I, I know the way that I learned this term, La Raza. And we have some folks who've kind of, you know, I think looked at this term and and their risk of translating to literally.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so I wanted to just give you a moment, either as the sponsor or maybe the professors to speak a little bit to this term and what it encompasses and how hard it is to to kind of get it out of a dictionary, if you will.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Councilman Sandoval Yeah, I'm happy to answer. Or if I did the Rodriguez, if he's still here, we can promote him and he would be able to answer.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's wonderful. We're going to see if we can get Mr. Rodriguez. Promoted back up. Yep. I see that we have him here and we'll ask him to unmute.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Ah. Theodore, are you still with us? Can you unmute?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. There you go, Mr. Rodriguez. And then I think Mr. Martinez would like to to speak as well. But Mr. Rodriguez, go ahead, please.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The term the word. The word La Raza means the people. During the Chicano movement and during the civil rights movement. We empowered ourself. We said Bieber, La Raza. We as a people encompass a world, a culture. We are predominantly native peoples.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'A group of people also will inevitably develop customs culture. And if you're asking about the definition of does it mean the race? No, it does not mean the race. That was a negative, negative experience, backlash, if you will, from the general public, because they didn't understand that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'When I teach Chicano studies, that's one of the first lessons, is the terminology and what it really means to be La Raza and what it means to be La Raza means to be the people. So when we selected that term in a public meeting in 1970 in the community when we were developing this protest, we looked at'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the name and we said, You know, what we really want to do here is develop a people's spark. We were actually inspired by the People's Park in San Francisco, you know, the hippies and the people that were developing this new world culture.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so we were inspired by the civil rights movement that they were involved in. And so with the Cesar Chavez movement and the other civil rights movement, it became a term to empower us, to educate people about who we are.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We are most of all. Good question.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you very. Did you want to add something?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes, I would like to. Can you hear.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Me? Go ahead, sir.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, you know, the the concept of La Raza actually created by the Save Our School Sailors, who was a philosopher in Mexico City and also the minister of culture. And during the third 1930s. And that as his minister of culture, he was probably, you know, the president, Diego Rivera and Siqueiros and Orozco, the great muralist.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'He was responsible for getting that work done. But the point I'm getting at is that as as a philosopher, he came up with that term, and it has been popular in Latin America and it is very inclusive in terms of all races.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And it's relative to our to our race because we are a mixture of race. We are citizens, which is Europe and and and indigenous people. So it's important to realize that this term is that negative. It's all encompassing of a mixture of races in people.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I think people should understand that this is not just a Chicano full term, you know, and it wasn't created by the father movement or what was goes wrong extensively on the concept of La Raza. And so you may you want to you may want to research and if you want more information on that concept.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Madam President, I just thought it was important. Languages are living, and any one of us could look up an English word in the Oxford Dictionary and know that that's not how we use the word today. And I think that I just wanted to really underscore the idea that you have to look to how the word'",
        "'speaker_3': 'is used, not to what you find in some Wikipedia site. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Wonderful. Thank you so much, Councilwoman Canete. Next up, we have Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Madam President. I don't know if maybe Director Haines or Hastings could respond to this question, but I just want to clarify for everybody listening that it is not unprecedented to change the name of a park that already has been named officially.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so a renaming is something that has been done before. So Director James raises Hazel. She want to answer that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So in the rules and regs for the naming policy of different parks and recreation, they do allow for renaming, right? Parks there have been parks that have been renamed or portions of parks have been remain renamed by by members of this council and previous groups that that have renamed parks that previously had a name.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Great. Thank you. I just want to let bring that out so that folks know that this is true. And to build upon what Councilwoman Kennedy said, history is also a living thing and it can be viewed from many perspectives through many generations and viewed differently.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Flynn. And I thought we had another hand raised, and so I'll wait for a second. All right. Seeing no others. The courtesy public hearing for Council Bill 20 Dash 1444 is closed. Comments by members of Council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilwoman Sandoval.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Madam President. I'd like to begin with a little time and a little history. In 1848, the treaty of his Hidalgo was signed into law, and this was when Mexico ceded 5050 5% of its land. And this is part of present day Arizona, California, New Mexico, Texas, Colorado, Nevada and Utah to the United States.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Growing up, I was taught an important thing. We didn't cross the border. The border crossed us. Christopher Columbus did not discover America. It was already inhabited by our indigenous brothers and sisters. What Christopher Columbus did was genocide. He raped and pillaged our native people.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And it is time we stop celebrating Columbus and recognize the people. Or, as we say in this part. Let us ask, as district one resident was quoted in the Northstar local newspaper, Judy Diaz from Acquisti in North Denver, resident who identifies as Latin Next and is married into an Italian family.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'She said she respects the role the name and park had for the early Italian residents. Many used Columbus as an icon to gain acceptance at a time when Italians were heavily discriminated against. Despite that, today, she supports the change to La Raza.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It needs to be a building to embrace community and humanity, said friend from Acquisti. People are going to find it controversial if they want to find something to controversy, if they want to find controversy. Growing up in the North Side, I had only known the park to be named.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Let us the park. I have celebrated many events there graduations, kids. And yet at the end of summer follows the summer solstice. And my community feels it is time for the park to be named not as a park.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I would like to thank those who came before me who fought in the crusade for justice. Art Do the bones. Rodriguez The Chicano movement and the many Latin, black, Latino, black and Latino elected leaders who came before me group to help them.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The Gonzalez Family. Senator Julie Gonzalez. Representative Sydnor Gonzalez Gutierrez. The Chicano Pride Rides Councilwoman Ortega, who brought this forward in her term in District nine and was shy one vote. And all those community members who came out during a pandemic to sign over 400 plus signatures to rename this park.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I will end with one of my favorite poems as I know it is relevant tonight. Joyce Johnson Rose. Said, I am standing on the shoulders of the ones who came before me. I am stronger for their courage. I am wiser for their words.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I am lifted by their longing for a fairer and brighter future. I am grateful for their vision, for their time on this earth. We are standing on the shoulders of the ones who came before us. They are giants and humans and angels.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They are friends. We can see beyond the struggles and the troubles and the challenges when we know that by their efforts things will be better. In the end, they lift me higher than I could ever fly. Carrying my burdens away.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I imagine our world. If they hadn't tried, we wouldn't be here celebrating today. I am standing on the shoulders of those who came before me. I am honored by their passion for our liberty. I will stand a little taller.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I will. I will work a little longer. And my shoulders will be there to hold the ones who follow me. They lift me higher than I could ever fly. Carrying my burdens away. I imagine our world. If they hadn't tried, we wouldn't be so very blessed today.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I am standing on the shoulders of those. The ones who come before me. I am humbled by their passion for our liberty. I stand a little taller. I work a little longer. And my shoulders will be there to hold the ones who follow me.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I humbly ask my fellow colleagues. To support this long overdue. Name change and Cuba us. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Sandoval, we appreciate your comments. And I want to pause for a second. Councilwoman Ortega, she had tried to carry forward a name change quite a few years ago. And so I would ask my colleagues if they wouldn't mind allowing Councilwoman Ortega to go next and share her thoughts on this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Madam President. I really appreciate it. And I just want to extend my apologies to my colleagues in the audience for not having here for the previous votes. I had to leave for an eye doctor appointment and just got back.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I want to thank Councilwoman Sandoval for bringing this forward and for putting all the legwork. It is not easy to do a park name change. Sorry, I'm getting. Oh, we just want. Yeah, there you go. My screen just.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I figured.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You'd want.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Your video on. Go ahead, Councilwoman. But it was on and then it turned off. That was kind of weird. But anyway. As I was saying, it's a lot of work to do a park name change. It requires, you know, the signature gathering, pulling together the historical information and and lining up the votes with your colleagues.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I just want to thank you, Councilwoman Sandoval, for all of your work to bring this forward. As as you know, I attempted to do this in my time as a district council person that had a lot of support within it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And everybody from the community has always called it led us apart. And what I was successful doing was getting the the it's not a gazebo. What do you call the. The structure in the park named as Plaza de la Raza.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But that was not that was only sort of in exchange for. You know, having let us name officially on the park. And, you know, there's a lot of history in this park that I believe you already covered. I just got back.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I didn't get a chance to hear that part of the presentation. But I did see the information that Councilwoman Sandoval had provided to all of us. And, you know, the demographics of many of our neighborhoods have have changed over time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And this is an example where at one time this was predominantly an Italian community. And, you know, and then at one point it was predominantly Latino. And now the demographics have changed even once again. There's still a lot of Latino families in the community.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But, you know, it's it's a gentrified neighborhood. And if you were a renter, most renters are gone that were Hispanic because a lot of those properties have been redeveloped. And so I think this is a great opportunity to reflect the culture and the history that has existed within the community.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I can remember growing up as a young high school student and in my, you know, early days as a young adult, spending time over at the park for some of the gatherings and opportunities for the Chicano community to come together and and just celebrate our culture.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so this is an opportunity to do that. I believe it does not take away from the contributions that the Italians in our community have made on the board of a nonprofit that has several of our buildings named after Italian leaders from the community.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And this is just another way to recognize the long standing indigenous peoples who, you know, originated in this city, when the confluence of both the South Platte and Cherry Creek came together, which was the the early beginnings of our city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So just ask for support of our colleagues. And again, thank Councilwoman Sandoval and all of the people who assisted in getting the signatures and helping to bring this forward. Thank you. Madam President. Thank you, Councilman Ortega, and happy that you were able to get back and join us for this important event tonight.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Cashman.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'll defer for a moment to Councilwoman Torres.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Sounds good. Councilwoman Torres.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Madam President. Thank you. Come to my house. Just a quick note of thanks. Just acknowledging and applauding Councilman Sandoval and everyone of the hundreds of people who came over two days during this year, which has been such a tough year to sign the petition and help make tonight happen.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There was immediate reaction and enthusiasm and to have the political will and leadership to be able to do this right now is incredibly affirming and a powerful move. And it did not come without risks of threat and names and just real ugliness over something that I think.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We have heard calls for four generations, Columbus statues around the country.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Coming down and.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'People really hitting a limit, a tolerance for revisionist history. And so I really just want to thank Councilman Sandoval, Councilman Ortega before her for hearing the words of community for whom this is really important. And I look forward to voting yes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Torres. Councilman Cashman?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah. Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I want to start.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'By congratulating my colleague, Councilman Sandoval. A great presentation, a great effort.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I am.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Pleased.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To wholeheartedly support this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Name, change and celebrate with you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And your staff and the Latin community on this just long overdue.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Name change. And I need to take a moment of personal reflection. When I was growing up in New Jersey, my my best friend's name was.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Don and his.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Brother was Andy and his parents, Randy and Kaye. And their last name was Prezioso. And they were proud Italian-Americans. And I'm picturing myself. At their dinner table where I was many, many times, trying to explain to Mr. Prez what's going on here.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And being a VA as he was, he would he'd have been difficult to convince. And so recognizing that, I just want to ask our Department of Parks and Recreation as they move forward with the. There are ongoing efforts.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To add Parkland to our.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'System to see if they can't.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Find a nice parcel and an appropriate parcel to consider a naming in honor of.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Denver's Italian community. I think there are numerous heroes more appropriately.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Suited to bear the moniker of a Denver park.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I appreciate the moment of perhaps inappropriate personal reflection. But in honor of Mr. and Mrs. President, I wanted to put that forward.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Cashman. Next up, we have Councilman Hines.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We as Council, we are here to guide Denver's present and its future based on the values we want to have in our city. And and certainly we should look back at our history and and revel in our history.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But, you know, once dinosaurs roamed the earth and now they just adorn sweaters. And so sometimes, you know, if we can just continue to to to only live in the past, just for the past sake. And. And so, Councilmember Sandoval, thank you so much for for bringing this forward.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And this is obviously a tough conversation. I in District ten, we had a Christopher Columbus statue, as in it was actually named Christopher Columbus. And we reached out to the Italian American community. We reached out to the Italian consulate here in Denver.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We reached out to people who identify as of Italian heritage in Denver and elsewhere. And and the the the conversations that I had were that the Italians in Denver want this. They want they want to celebrate the people and they want to celebrate the people's part.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So so thank you again, Councilmember Sandoval. Thank you for all of the the current and former elected officials that you've had here to present, including my state senators, Senator Consultants, thank you for thank you for making the trip on the other side of of of veterans park and and visiting us in the local yokel end of Denver'",
        "'speaker_1': 'City Council. I'm I'm really excited and and happy to to be part of the support that helps get this across the finish line. Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman. Councilwoman, can each.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Madam President. Kvitova is very exciting. I just wanted to share some perspective about the renaming commission that the mayor seeded about six months ago that Councilwoman Ortega and I serve on. And I was trying to pull out the criteria.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I couldn't quite find them fast enough, but. But it includes not just that the individual or term that's used has, you know, a historic harm associated with it. It's also about whether or not that harm is continuing into the future in terms of replicating or reinforcing messages or values that are contrary to the city's.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think that's really important because, you know, I just first want to say Naomi did an amazing job, really great presentation. But I think what I took from her presentation is the way that colonization right. Replicated itself.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think that's really important because the disparities that are still experienced by the Latino community and members of it. Right, is that replication of the harm. And so to honor the origins of that harm. Right, is a replication of it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so I can't predict for you what would have happened, but I think it's pretty likely we would have been ended up here. Even if Councilwoman Sandoval never picked this up. She picked this up because she's a leader, because she knew there was this long standing need in this community.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I didn't want anyone to think that she's speaking only for herself. Right. That I think that there is clearly a movement and we're looking at all kinds of names. And so that that report won't be ready till next year.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We're still we are so thoroughly debating it. Some of the most thoughtful, challenging conversation that I've been a part of in my time governing, thinking about the confluence right of history and the present, and inequities and harm and healing and all of that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I just but I wanted to give that perspective because I think that as we do reckon with wanting to better understand the history and that the harms associated with names or terms of things in our city, I think that you are going to see that this might be one of the easier cases, right, as communities will'",
        "'speaker_3': 'be the next one. So this committee that councilman are taking on will basically take recommendations and give them back to communities to debate. And only after they debate it will it come to this council. But it's this this is an easier case than some that you may see through those processes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It clearly meets the criteria for a renaming that the Parks folks just described. And I just want to say that to the community who waited so long for this, your perseverance and your commitment and the contributions that you made sometimes in spite of our city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Right, are not to be forgotten. And so congratulations to the to the community and to Councilwoman Sandoval for helping to lead them. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman. Next up, we have Councilwoman CdeBaca.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Madam President. Just wanted to send a quick congratulations to Councilman Sandoval and all of the North Siders, the West Siders, the East Siders who were a part of the Chicano movement, but also all of our professors, our cultural workers, our community workers who really dedicated lifetimes to teaching people about race as a social construct.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And how in order for us to get beyond a scenario where we use race to validate, to justify oppression, we have to start envisioning a world that doesn't exist with race. And I strongly encourage anyone who's curious about this renaming or who's frustrated by this renaming to really do a little bit of research on La Raza cosmic'",
        "'speaker_3': ', because what it is really about is acknowledging that there is no pure race. There is no such thing anymore. And the the this idea of La Raza is about a new race of people without the labels applied to us based on color.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I again, congratulations. I'm very happy to see this. I'm very happy to be able to vote yes on this in my term and proud to to say that this is a community home. And I hope that beyond this symbolic fight, this symbolic win, we make sure that the Latino people, that La Raza is able to stay'",
        "'speaker_3': 'in this community and enjoy this park with this new name. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. And I will go ahead and wrap up on comments. Congratulations, Councilwoman Sandoval. Councilwoman Ortega. And, you know, I loved it when Senator Gonzalez talked about the winter solstice and how significant this point in history today right now is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think of our grandmothers and our aunties and our mothers and all of the women in the community and and the men. But I like to concentrate on the women a little bit, because I know that there has been many grassroots efforts and and keeping that fight going over the years.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that I also would be very remiss if I didn't honor our elders, Mr. Rodriguez and Mr. Martinez, who joined us and the the many academics and teachers. I got my undergraduate at Regis at Metro and then my master's at Religious.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so that history is interwoven throughout the Denver metro area, but really within our state, because like my family came from the San Luis Valley and came to Denver for a better opportunity. And so I feel like our elders are smiling down on us and have been whispering for decades to make this change.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I just want to sincerely congratulate the community and Councilwoman Sandoval and Ortega and also Torres, because the preservation in your district as well continues on that strong Chicano Latin history of our city that is so important. And so, without further ado, Madam Secretary, roll call.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sandoval. I. Sawyer a. All right. I. Well, I. Peter Barca. I. Clark.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'When I.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Herndon.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hi.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Cashman.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'MH I. Ortega, I. Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I am secretary. Please close the voting and announce the results.'",
        "'speaker_3': '13 I.'",
        "'speaker_0': '13 Eyes Council Bill 20 Dash 1444 has passed our pre adjournment announcement on Tuesday, July 19th, 2021. Council will hold a required public hearing on Council Bill 1414, changing the zoning classification for 3397 South Geneva Street in Hampton.'"
