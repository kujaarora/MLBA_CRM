        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. All right. Well, I think that's pretty straightforward. And they're halfway through, as you said, they've had 11 meetings. They have nine more to go. And I think that's great that they're working so hard on this. And I also thank you for the background data on page 43 that it was quite interesting.'",

And as I understand it, they asked for an extension. And I was talking to the counselor, and I can't remember whether or not you talked about that yet.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. Yes, we can talk about. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Yeah. I favor giving them that. It's, you know, extension because I want them to have an opportunity to do the very best job they can and articulating and laying out what they think would be most helpful to the immigrant and refugee communities of Cancun.'",

    "A MOTION approving the Fourth Quarter 2015 Expenditures for Emergent Needs and Unanticipated Project Costs Summary Report prepared by the road services division in the department of transportation as required in the 2015/2016 Biennial Budget Ordinance, Ordinance 17941, Section 53, Proviso P2.": [
        "'speaker_0': 'Excused. Excellent. Thank you very much. And that takes us up now to item number six. And this is proposed motion 2016 0117, a motion approving the fourth quarter of the 2015 expenditures for emergent needs and anticipated projected costs.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Summary Report Prepared by the Road Service Division and the Department of Transportation. As is required, there will be an amendment. This is the fourth quarter report and the report says it's the third quarter report. So there will be a technical amendment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So with that, this. Okay, would you begin? Thank you, Madam Chair. I'm Lisa Kay for the central staff. For the record, my staff report begins on page 53 of your packet. As you mentioned, proposed motion 2016 0117 would approve the fourth quarterly report from the Road Services Division on emergent needs and unanticipated project costs.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Council approved a budget proviso requiring these reports in response to an operational shift in roads from planned investments. That is to say, programing projects through the CHP, individual projects to reactive system management, which pooled funding in a number of response oriented programs, including emergent needs and quick response.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This budgeting change was a response to the roads funding shortfall, the experience with emergency roadwork expenses, and a desire not to cancel capital projects if emergency repairs required additional revenue. This fourth quarterly report shows the transfer of $98,000 from the Quick Response Project for a slide repair project in Preston, and about $1.2 million in transfers from emergent'",
        "'speaker_0': 'needs to supplement three unanticipated grants for risk reduction from the flood control district as the fourth quarter report. This report also then shows the cumulative expenditures in these programs for the first year of the 20 1516 biennium. You'll see on table five of the staff report, which is on page 57 of your packet, that both programs have'",
        "'speaker_0': 'large balances. Halfway through the biennium there's approximately $11.11 million remaining in quick response and approximately five and a half million dollars in emerging needs. As you mentioned, Amendment one to this motion, which is on page 67 of your packet, would correct a typographical error.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That concludes my report. Road Services Director Bauer is in the audience. Okay. So both of these accounts have money left in them. But then I look on page 55 on the projects deleted is this was done as first and then 2000 1314 VIP.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So is this just to give us some background that these projects have been deleted in the past? What's the purpose of that chart here? Now, this this chart carries forward from the very first quarterly report, which basically shows the projects that were stricken from the CFP and in favor of shifting to this operational response in these pooled'",
        "'speaker_0': 'funds. So now that we have some money that we didn't expect to be in there, can some of these things go back on on the agenda? I would like to defer that to Director Bauer, please. Okay. And there's one on here, the Miller Bridge replacement, which the federal government.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This was destroyed in a flood. And the federal government has chosen not to replace this bridge. Which absolutely breaks my heart. And the 2.5 million is not the total cost to replace that bridge. But in my mind, FEMA should still be taking care of that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But we also see some other bridges that are in dire need. So there you are. Brenda, would you please go ahead and Mr. Bauer and talk to us about why there's money left? And can we go back and reimburse some of these accounts to do some of this work that needs to be done?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Brenda Bauer Road Services Director The challenge that we're facing is, is that we have unpredictable levels of failure and also want to take advantage of some opportunities like the grant opportunities we had, which allow us our money to go farther.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'A couple of years ago, we had at least $7 million worth of failure, destroying the winter season. So we can have a very high dollar's worth of failures. And we are increasingly seeing a greater level of failure in our system because we're not able to preserve and maintain it at an appropriate level.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So what we will be doing is in the development of our budget process, taking a look at whether there are carryover funds that we didn't need to use in this last biennium that would be reprogram for a different purpose.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And what that purpose would be, it might not be these specific projects. Okay. Although the some of the projects on this list are very serious. That's true. We have a lot of we have a transportation needs report update that's coming out through the comprehensive planning process that lists very significant needs.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think, you know, the average citizen may not realize how severe this is. Could you again and you did an excellent job a couple of weeks ago saying how many roads we should be overlaying for maintenance and then how many road maps we're planning to do this year?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We're planning very few road miles, really a lot of carryover work.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'From the prior.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'From the prior year that the contractor wasn't able to get to and a few others that we had some matching funds for. We should be overlaying. So there's an ideal amount and then there's amount associated with the fact that we have a failing road system.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Most of most of our Tier one and Tier two roads could use reconstruction and not just overlay. So we our problems are more extensive than a standard road system. So I think that's really important for citizens to know.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think if I remember correctly from the chart that if you maintain a square foot schedule of $2.97, a square foot reconstruction is 159. That was by a 19 for 2014 chart. Right. And there are a variety of estimates for different types of roadways for how much additional money you're spending.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But the reality is, is if you if you don't maintain your asset, then you're replacing it sooner and that results in the higher cost. And part of maintaining our asset is that seal that we put on the top of the road, which is the road.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Surface.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we are not able to have an adequate program to even resurface roads. However, a lot of our roads are aging and need to be rebuilt, which is a major capital investment for the county. Okay. And early news is always informative.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. All right. Are there any so. Yes. Councilmember Member Gosar.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Madam Chair. But are we do we have any specific strategies from the executive that are being utilized to identify the possibility of future funding to increase our commitment to our more critical road needs?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, we as I reported recently, we completed a Bridges and Roads Taskforce effort, which identified kind of a strategy for what kind of revenue would be equitable and appropriate to address the roads issue. And now the effort is to sit down with city partners and work with them to identify quite specifically what sort of revenue tool would'",
        "'speaker_0': 'be appropriate. The challenge is, is that we have a declining number of people living in the unincorporated area, and it's just really not enough people left in the unincorporated area to adequately fund a network that serves the entire region.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we need the cooperation of our city partners and their resources in order to address this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Problem and that effort. Is that underway? Right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That effort is underway. All right.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And away, but going at a glacier speed, according to my clock. But it's underway. So I'm I'm happy it's at least underway. It's a $40 billion asset that citizens should be very concerned is being destroyed day by day because we don't have because of the state formula that is broken and we don't have the capacity to take'",
        "'speaker_0': 'care of properly. So it doesn't look like a lot happened to help us in this last legislative session. So. Okay. Yes. Councilmember Dombroski.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you very much. Just think I'm going to keep bringing this up because I'm kind of curious about and I talked to Ms.. Bauer in the last presentation on roads that we had. But this notion of our franchise fees and really their modesty for folks are using our rights of way.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mm hmm. What? How can we if there was consensus on the council of an interest in exploring that issue, is there interest in the road services division and looking at whether our franchise fees are set at the right amount and what mechanisms we might have to adjust that?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean, what's the process there? Would it be on a budget proviso? Would you like a motion? Can we just do it with you?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So franchises have been negotiated not directly with.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'By the road.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Services division. This is something.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That is undertaken by the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Executive and facilities management. So we're not involved in the process.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Of.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Negotiating those agreements. I know that the executive has been taking, you know, paying close attention to our franchise agreements. And they they're probably it it's probably good to have a conversation with them about the approach that they're taking on that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's helpful. So it's not your department.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It is not our department. Who does the franchise agreements, although we might benefit from them.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah. Thank you, Madam Chair.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It is a very good question and I'm glad you keep asking it. And so it's a good thing to keep in front of us because we're going to I was going to say we were going to get desperate.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We were desperate four years ago. So we're desperate. We get that. We're we're going to have to start looking for things like that. Okay. So with that, I could use a motion to put this before us. Councilmember Taberski.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay, Madam Chair. Happy to oblige with a motion to approve proposed motion 2016 01171 to do. Recommendation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. Thank you very much. When you put amendment number one on page 60, 74.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I offer Amendment one.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Great. And this is the one we talked about. This is a type of graphical error and moving it from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. All those in favor of amendment number one, they say I those oppose any number one is passed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So that takes us to the underlying as amended. There are no questions. Please clear call for the vote.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Madam Chair.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Council Member Banducci Council Member Dombrowski Council Member Done.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Boro, for being with us today. Thank you, Mr. Chair.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Is that do pass or consent.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Honey? Was that do pass or do you pass consent? I miss that, yes. And let's do it for both number five and number six. I think both number five and six could be put on their consent agenda. They're pretty straightforward and let's expedite both of them.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Okay. Thank you. All right. That takes us up to number seven. And number seven is going to hold its place for a future meeting either at this body or at the full council due to some amendments.'"
