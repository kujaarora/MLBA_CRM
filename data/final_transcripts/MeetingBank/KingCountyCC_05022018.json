Dillon, are you going to present or. Mathias Okay. And we've got some his squad with him here summiteers from all the faculty on social justice and Chandler Feldt, our county demographer.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'The operational plan also speaks to focusing on four key innovation areas for the 2020 census design, some of which include optimizing self response by focusing on more online responses and assuring data protection and re-engineering field operations by relying heavily on automation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The Census Bureau states that these design changes have the potential to save the Bureau an estimated $2.5 billion. The adopted fiscal year 2018 federal budget appropriated $2.8 billion to the Census Bureau, which was a little more than $1,000,000,000 more than the Department of Commerce's request for 2018.'",

Of the 396 census tracts in King County, 49 census tracts listed here across 13 cities have been identified as hard to count communities.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Out of 396, I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Said, and who did this ID again?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So the the identification is actually done by the Census Bureau, but the data that was put together was actually done by the City University of New York Mapping Service, the Center for Urban Research at the City University of New York.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I see. And the criteria, again, was it based on the last census and the response rate?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's correct. The last census response rate was around 73%. So the Census Bureau used that as the threshold for anyone below that to be hard to count mostly.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And if we wanted to localize this, we heard Gerry say that our King County response rate was 80%. I mean, is there if we were developing and were the motion, ask the executive develop a plan under any circumstances?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Would it make sense to look at our own metrics, if you will, for identifying hard to count sounds tracks?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes, that would be a good suggestion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And the motion allows for that flexibility in terms of its scope.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It does. We'd be there. Is that the motion states that the executive finds strategies to reach hard to count communities and in the findings statement of findings we do to find that 73%. But if you want to change that to 80% to accommodate the differing metrics for King County, we can do that as well.'",

The executive staff stated that the current staff work will work on the developing the implementation plan and therefore no additional costs will be incurred. And the executive staff also confirmed that transmitting the implementation plan to the Council by September 1st would be feasible.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Executive staff also indicate that a budget will be developed to include funds for a full time employee and for other costs that will support the implementation of the plan for the 2019 2020 biennium. And lastly, executive staff mentioned that the county has already begun the 2020 census activities.'",

And as you mentioned, we have a members of the executive staff here to answer any questions and also to provide a briefing.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Ah.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you very much for that overview of the legislation. Do members have questions from Andrew's presentation? Don't see any. I'd like to invite up Dillon or Daniels, Matthias Valenzuela and Schindler Feldt, who are in my brief slide presentation on the status of the county's work thus far and what they see going forward.'",

And now the addition of Councilmember McDermott and supporters for addressing such a critically important issue to our county, our state and our nation. This motion expresses many of the approaches we're taking into account in the development of our work.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And should the Council adopt this motion, which we hope you do, we will be in a position to meet the September 1st deadline to transmit the requested implementation plan starting in March 2020. Households across King County and across the country will begin receiving their forms to participate in the 2020 census.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This past April marks a two year countdown to census day April 1st, 2020. Simply put, the 2020 census matters as we've heard. An accurate count is essential for counties, other local governments and the people who live here. Census data is the foundation for much of our understanding of community conditions in King County and supports our planning, implementation'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and evaluation of our service delivery. Census data is also used for the planning and allocation of billions of dollars in federal and nonprofit funding. Additionally, census numbers are used to determine the apportionment of congressional representatives. We know that certain communities are likely to be undercounted, and many of these are historically underserved communities.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We share the goal of ensuring our I believe we're calling them, work hard to count communities now, hard to count communities are engaged and participate as it is imperative in our work to advance equity in King County. In terms of fairness, opportunity, and addressing the many issues faced by our region and the nation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'A complete and accurate census is paramount. That is why our goal, our vision, is to have an accurate 2020 census that counts all King County residents. In order to achieve that goal. I'd like to talk about some of the values that guide our work.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'First, we seek to have alignment with our mission of equity and social justice. Second, will meet communities where they're at to receive input, understand their concerns, and ensure that we work together on this important effort in order to reach hard to count communities, which is a priority of ours.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'A consistent priority. We're hearing from those representing hard to count communities, as well as organizations that serve hard to count communities and a goal of the motion before us. It is imperative that we partner with community, especially those that rarely, if ever, have had an opportunity to give input.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Third, we will strive to align resources, messaging and engagement with community and other stakeholders, where appropriate, to avoid duplicative work and maximize what everybody can bring to the table. King County is uniquely positioned to serve as a hub, a regional convener, as we did with health care enrollment for the many moving pieces and energy surrounding the 2020'",
        "'speaker_4': 'census. Fourth, we will leave no stone unturned when thinking of ways to organize, educate and make the most of opportunities to reach members of our community about the importance of the census. And now I will turn it over to Chandler Feldt to talk about some of the administrative work that's been done to date.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you. Before we do, do members have questions or comments on Dillon's portion? I just if I can want to make one comment to raise a concern. You mentioned our success with health care enrollment in King County was a nationwide leader, and we used a community based approach there under the Affordable Care Act.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But and I hear some discussion about replicating that model here, but I want to make sure that we're cognizant of the difference. And that is obviously with the census, we want to count everyone, regardless of citizenship status. And of course, the Affordable Care Act excluded a large portion of our community.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I think I just want to make sure that we're aware of that. And I was thinking about that as we develop this plan that we don't just hit the pause button.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We know it will not be a carbon copy. It is a framework that has used in the past for us for that effort. And so we are exploring that as a starting point and understand that the framework that we are developing will not look exactly the same.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Got it. Thank you. All right, Chandler, are you up next?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. For the record, Chandler Feldt, King County demographer in performance, strategy and budget. We actually began several months ago with preparation for the 2020 census because we recognize how important it is. So we've begun scoping. Strategies and building partnerships to be able to conduct as effective a census as possible.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'One part of the 2020 census is already underway. It's called the Lucca program. Lucca is a Census Bureau program to improve the accuracy of street addresses. It stands for local update of census addresses. And what it consists of is that the Census Bureau has shared their address files, street address, residential files with King County.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We are in the process of correcting and updating them to account for the development that has happened since 2010 and since the Census Bureau's most recent sources. That's already underway at King County Geographic Information System Group. There's several GIS professionals engaged in that work, which will be completed about July 1st.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So chatter on that program, what information is that a purely address system or are there other names and ownership fields are tied to those address?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There are no names and no ownership information or no demographic information associated with that. It's simply a list of addresses by street and house number or in a few cases, in rural route advance numbers.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And do you see or any need to take steps, and if so, have we to protect the privacy and make sure there's no easy, if you will, linkage between, you know, for example, our assessor's records, which often have owners who will do have ownership information or taxpayer information and addresses, what are what are we doing in that'",
        "'speaker_0': 'regard?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The Census Bureau requires very rigorous security measures to protect their address list, and we are doing the same with regard to our address information. So the work that is being done is on a separate computer, not connected with our shared drives.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And at the end of this process of identifying differences between the Census Bureau's list and our lists, we will turn in a differences data set to the Census Bureau and then destroy all of the information that that they had sent.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So that process is underway in terms of communication with the Census Bureau. The bureau has really limited resources this time compared to ten years ago. Notwithstanding what Andrew mentioned about the fiscal year 18 infusion of funds that the Congress did, that's that's only for the year that ends this October.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we still don't know what the next fiscal year of census funding will be. So, in short, were more dependent on our own resources than we were ten years ago. And we have the additional difficulty that the Census Bureau moved their regional headquarters from Seattle to Los Angeles between the 2010 and 2020 census.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we're not as as in touch with them as we were ten years ago. Nevertheless, we've had a couple of meetings with U.S. Census Bureau staff, and those have been productive in terms of figuring out resources and partnerships.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And are you the lead on this?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Dillon is actually the lead for that coordination. I'm the technical lead for the time being.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'On on that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then that communication with the Census Bureau has also been done jointly with the city of Seattle, who has designated a couple of people as leads for Census 2020 Coordination two group. We've had a number of discussions with the Washington State Office of Financial Management Staff.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They are well engaged. They're organizing a statewide complete count committee. They're providing resources to counties and cities to to develop their own programs. And both the Census Bureau and OFM are helping us identify these work hard to. Out areas within our counties and cities.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's that concludes my comment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And members have questions for Chandler County demographer. All right. It's a couple more minutes here and I'm going to.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'll dove back in real quick and just discuss our organizations. So far, internally, it is our intention to have an organization wide inter branch team that can help inform our efforts, as well as bring in traditional and outside the box ideas and tools to help our broader outreach and education campaigns.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Cabinet has been informed of our census work and asked to begin developing ways to support. Additionally, we're in the process of reaching out to other separately electeds here at King County. As such, we are again thankful to have the opportunity today to share our census efforts with you and look forward to collaborating to achieve our shared goals'",
        "'speaker_4': '. Externally, we will be forming a complete count committee comprised of representatives from a variety of sectors, for example K through 12 labor, business, nonprofit, higher ed community and tribal governments, faith based organizations, etc. that will help develop and implement our regional efforts and bring resources to the table to raise awareness and encourage completion of the 2020 census'",
        "'speaker_4': '. As previously stated, there will be a strong focus on hard to count communities. It is our hope that we will have a complete count committee formed and operational by the end of 2018, if not sooner. To date, we have been working with partners from the aforementioned sectors to align efforts.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Additionally, executive Constantine has sent a letter to the 39 mayors flagging the importance of the 2020 census and inviting collaboration. And I'll turn it over to Mathias to quickly give us some feedback on what we're hearing from communities and much of which we've heard from this morning from those who testified.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Good morning, Chair and council members. I'll be quick because I think we have heard some really eloquent testimony from the community and those are exactly the types of comments that we've been hearing from then when we've been reaching out.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Traditionally, the hard to count populations include the elderly, low income communities, renters, frequent movers, people of color, immigrant refugees. We heard about a lot of them today. There's a national general fear and distrust towards government at this moment, too.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then some additional barriers, such as the new citizenship question was, which is being proposed for inclusion. Those are all new challenges for us and also the homeless population. We need to just remember the crises that we have right now in terms of homelessness and also how those populations are to count, but also the added number of'",
        "'speaker_1': 'people doubling up short term, you know, you know, renters or people in short term housing. We know that that's an area that's increasingly challenging for us. We've been also hearing and working with some of the other jurisdictions, institutional partners.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think they'll work especially around with philanthropy, is important. A lot of of our philanthropic partners are interested in supporting this work, such as were the organizations that I spoke earlier. We need to make sure that we are not working and cross-purposes that we're actually aligned with one overall umbrella.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think is King County as a convener, has a unique role to play in that particular area. And just finally, in terms of a lot I think has been said around being consistency of messaging. We've heard a lot around that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think there's a lot of things that still work out in terms of what our key messages are going to be around the particular challenges that we have in this next census. But also, I think the theme that we hear very strongly and we want to be consistent with in terms of how we've been most successful as'",
        "'speaker_1': 'a county, is how do we work with our community organizations. So they are the trusted local voice for our very diverse community that we need to be working with them, resourcing them. So they are the ones that are delivering the messages.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Yes. Any comments or questions? As vice chair of the committee, as Councilmember Cole Wells. I wonder if she would want to put the legislation before us for adoption.'",

And those are listed in a chart on the left with a description in the middle column and then ask, does the master labor agreement and its appendices comport with these policies'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. And then also in the first section, because there's a lot of paperwork here. Back on page 29, Article two, there's no change on this. But yesterday we found out that the way our contract cities are contracted with the sheriff, that they have specific duties, number of officers, response times.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, that's a violent unit, whatever units they want, as how they are handled in the city of the unincorporated area. It just number of officers we have left over. And one of the problems that we've had is that most of the cities do not have as long a military leave as what the county gives.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so when a person is assigned to a contract city, which is 56% of the county's sheriff's budget, they are moved into the unincorporated area budget, and that counts against the officers in the unincorporated area. So I am concerned that this is a cost that we are much well, I don't know that we are apparently over what'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the cities do, and that has an impact on the distribution of manpower in our sheriff's department. So I'd like to flag that and figure out how much over are we so that we can be more in line with our surrounding cities and not have that problem in the future.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mr. Chair, if I could jump in just a second. And to that point, Councilmember Lambert, where's that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Voice coming from? Oh, good. Okay. The body voice.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's The Wizard of Oz.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Really? The two things I would point out about that is there are there are some unique there are some unique leaves and types of absences available to employees within the sheriff's department. And there are also specific provisions in the services contract between the county and the cities that delineate some of the items you just brought brought up'",
        "'speaker_1': '. However, neither the sheriff's contract nor the contracts with the cities are a part of this ordinance that's in front of the council now. So we can certainly bookmark those items, but they're not impacted by this legislation.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I don't understand how that could be possible. So the very reason that they are moving is because our contract gives more benefits. So I understand that as long as they stay within their benefits, it makes no difference. But when they go over the benefits of City X, because I don't want any cities calling me and saying, don't'",
        "'speaker_3': ', don't use me as an example. So City X and then they end up coming into the unincorporated area budget. So that's this this provision is what causes that to happen?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'No, no, no, Councilmember. This provision applies just to the agreement between the county and the coalition of unions that are covered by this agreement.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Which is not the sheriff's department, because they have their own office.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Exactly. Which is not the sheriff's office and the items. I'm not saying that the items you're bringing up are not legitimate issues, but they're in two other places. They're in the sheriff's contract itself or in the contract between King County and the in the the cities that we contract with to provide.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we don't expect that the sheriff's office will ever sign onto this to a master agreement or because they are what's the word they are. Where you can go to court automatically.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Interest arbitration.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Trust arbitration because they're interest arbitration. They won't be signing a non interest arbitration contract.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. So as we look at those other contracts in the future, we need to take that into consideration because it is an issue that I didn't even realize until a couple of months ago.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. It's not an issue in this legislation or agreement. All right. Go ahead, Heidi. Okay. I think we were actually on page.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Page.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. Chair. I know that around about eight years ago, we had begun an effort to bring public defense of the parity with the prosecution attorneys office. And I'm surprised that we're just now getting to say investigators.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'What was the group of other investigators?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'An attorney.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah, but we had talked about investigators, secretaries and other support staff and public defense and were way behind prosecutors to get equity. And I hope this comes close to it. But I did have a question on an attorney.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We are establishing a step increase system. Does the prosecuting attorneys have steps down? Yes. That's as a.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Person. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Oh, they have.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Right. Yeah. And my colleague Mr. Railton did remind me that the 652,000 actually relates just to the investigators. So those are the increases related to the investigators pay. What we did with the with the actual attorneys is we opened a gateway to allow them to progress, but there is nobody actually waiting to that will be benefited by'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that in this contract cycle. So I guess to address your question, what about future contract?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I just want to know, is it parody with the prosecuting attorney? Do they have steps?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They do have steps.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then this will allow public defenders to have steps.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They already had steps they want.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'What did we do?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we allow the the attorneys who are kind of bumping up against the senior ranks to move into a senior into the senior status and to be eligible for additional pay. But this in this contract, there are no individuals or no incumbents who will actually enjoy that benefit.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So the 652,000 is just for the investigators.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. But what about the future? Will they be able to enjoy? Yes. That when they get high level. And do prosecutors already enjoy that opportunity? It's looking for here.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah. And there is I mean, this is a it's there's more to this issue. As you know, there are case limitations for the defenders, whereas the prosecutors at the senior level can, in theory, take on as much work as their upper management would like them to.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'All right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Lambert.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. I also have some concerns on that. And, you know, when you are in upper management, you get paid a salary and you just do whatever work you need to do. And so the idea that, you know, Saturday work or, you know, coming in on standby gets, you know, several hours of pay, even if you're just'",
        "'speaker_3': 'on standby, that's a little much as far as I'm concerned. And on Ethics 36, which was when back where they were talking about the fire investigators, it showed what happens in year two, three and four, what happens in year five and beyond.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm going to defer to Mr. Railton, who was actually the chief spokesperson on this contract for management. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Bob Helton, Office of Labor Relations, Labor Relations Manager. This is the same education incentive that the Police Officer Guild enjoys, as well as most of the other commission staff, the sheriff's office, deputies, sergeants, captains, majors and chiefs. And so it doesn't increase beyond.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In other words, there isn't additional increases, four more years of service. It caps out of four years of law enforcement service and whatever that percentage is for the particular degree that they have. And one of the reasons we looked at this for the fire investigators is because they are very specialized detectives, investigation investigating arson, and they work'",
        "'speaker_1': 'alongside the deputies and the CIA unit. So there is some commonality in terms of work, but they're under different collective bargaining agreements. So we felt that this was the right thing to do in terms of parity with their coworkers.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It seems to me that the job classification there, because of what you just said, it's very specialized. They should have at least a degree, but probably a B.A. degree. And yet for a B.A. degree, which should be their basic start, we're going to pay them 4% more per year.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I can get the master's degree paying more, maybe not 6% more, but I can get the master's degree and I can even well, not on them because that that in an investigation they don't speak lots of languages. But I just think that that by paying into a degree and a B.A. at those rates when it should be'",
        "'speaker_3': 'their base qualification is a little bit extravagant. So I don't feel comfortable with that. Just one minute. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Returning to the public defense addendum or appendix, Megan, you've now said twice that this was related to the workload and case requirements stipulated by the Supreme Court rules and the other rules. I have to confess to you, I am not understanding how I know what those rules are.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I don't understand how they're related to these wizardry pieces and and step provisions and establishment of a committee. It doesn't seem to me it is related.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's it's the RCC, not the court rules.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The rules of professional.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Conduct that there is a reference. So we can get get back to you on that. But I do want to one key point that I want to make is we recognize that we are paying senior attorneys and DPD.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, we're paying them more based on the fact that they're in a quasi management or lead role. And so one of the things we secured in these negotiations was a commitment to work with the union to better define what seniors do and to demarcate that seniors have additional duties.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Because here in the county, you know, according to our labor policies, which this council has passed, we don't pay people more just for doing the same thing right over and over. And so our interest was to say, okay, if you're a senior, you're mentoring your coaching the new attorneys in court, you're providing briefings to staff, you're maybe'",
        "'speaker_3': 'working on policy projects. So I don't I do want that point to be made because we recognize that in order for seniors to be paid more, they need to be doing more.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. But the compensation here is for investigators.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And the other pieces apply. The lawyers are the investigators.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah. Sorry. This is confusing the other pieces. When I was referencing parity and I'm happy to come back here to to get you information where where we look to in terms of authority for establishing parity. One of those sources is the our pieces.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I thought it was council action when we established the Department of Public.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's that as well. That would be the first thing that we look to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Let me tie in appendix 16, the prosecuting attorney's association, since parity is tied to them as I read this on page 60. The Master Labor Agreement acknowledges that this agency, meaning the POW, has the authority to negotiate those issues separate and apart.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right. I'll give you a chance to look at it. So my question is, since we have a principle of parity in the Department of Public Defense, are our compensation and working conditions to extent parity applies to working conditions driven really by Prosecutor Sderberg and what he does with the with the prosecutors.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So that was the position of the union in our negotiations with DPD. The county was taking the position that, yes, we consider that, but the jobs are different. So to some extent, it's an apples and oranges analogy. As I said, there are workload caseload limits for the public defenders that do not apply to the prosecutors.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So let's say that prosecutor Soderberg is a senior deputy prosecuting attorney, $120,000. And we have a senior Department of Public Defense defender who's making 120,000. And prosecutor Soderberg says, well, I'm going to get my folks raise it 125.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Are we then, under the principle of parity on the defense side, obligated to raise RS 225? That's what I'm trying to stand, is what we've set up here.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In terms of I would say when we're not obligated, we we will look at that and we we look at and and again, the Labor policies reference the market comparators. So one thing to keep in mind is that public defense in other jurisdictions is in a nonprofit model.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So it's a again, it's sort of an apples to oranges comparison because in the nonprofit world, the wages tend to be lower. So we will we will consider everything. We will consider the budget and what we're able to pay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But just as one of our labor policies.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Right. And just just because the prosecutor raises the pay doesn't mean that we're automatically going to be raising pay for the public defenders. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Lambert.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. Chair. I have sat on the other defense board for this state for, I think now like 16 years. So this is not a new topic to me. But with that hat on, different than his hat.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But with that hat on, I look at the cost in comparable caseloads between surrounding counties, including Spokane County. And it is much more expensive to do a felony in King County than it is in our surrounding counties and Spokane, as the comparables is way more than other counties because they're not on comparable kinds of schedules.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So when I have asked about why these numbers are disparate, I am told because our felonies are more complicated than other felonies. It would be fine if we were talking about Mars and Earth. But that's an odd comment that a felony in a neighboring county.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To our north or to our south is so different from a felony in our county. And then I get told other things, too, which I won't get into. But I think that there's work that needs to be done here.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I have great concerns that we, per case, are paying a lot more than than potentially we would need to be in looking at that. And as Councilmember Garcia said earlier, he's completely correct that we did try very hard to to make sure that the parity between the prosecutor and the defense bar was obvious.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And in so doing, I understand that we may have swung the other way where now that the prosecutor should be coming in and asking for parity with defense. The other one point that is really old. But we were told that we were not in parity because we were micromanaging the independent branches of the defense bar before we'",
        "'speaker_3': 'brought them in-house. And when they came in-house, they had more employees than we even knew they had. I submit that if I were micromanaging, if we were micromanaging, we would have known that there were more employees there and we were giving them money and parity all the time.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Monica that used to work for us, decided not work for us after that formula was done. She worked that all out. But what happened was that the four different agencies rearranged the money after we gave it to them, and then we went to court and lost because of that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So there's a lot of history here and I think it's time to delve down again. And I think that's a really good idea that we do.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So are you Councilmember Lambert? There's some issues around this provision. I think people would like more information. But in the interest of time today, let's move forward and work on that offline.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's great. Time to.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Read.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Appendix 49 on page 51. This email proposed appendix to the MLA represents 44 employees in the Department of Community Health Service, Human Services, and the appendix two would add a new shift premium for evening and nighttime shifts. The premium would be $0.75 per hour.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The executive estimates this cost to be to implement this about a $34,000. Moving on to appendix 50, this is for represents 263 workers and the wastewater treatment division bargaining unit and also the person in the Department of Natural Resources.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In part, the proposed appendix would. Offer professional license premiums for two four employees to receive $50 per month for each license. And it would also add two new license categories for specific classifications. So they would more employees would qualify for this premium since they have obtain those specific certifications and they anticipate it is going packed as about'",
        "'speaker_3': '$23,000. Appendix 51 The last appendix for briefing today is for Teamsters Local 174. It represents 231 employees and various divisions. If I may draw your attention to page 54, a significant amount of the cost proposed for this appendix stems from a the solid waste division.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, actually, there's been a memorandum of agreement that would allow for helper shifts to be added skill operators at the transfer stations. There will be eight hour helper shifts added and that would run from May 1st to Labor Day and except for.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'On peak season.'",
        "'speaker_3': '4th of July, Independence Day. And so the majority of the costs associated with this appendix will relate to that implementing that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. I see we have a representative from the Teamsters here. A number of council members, I guess it was late last year. I'm losing track of time, met with some of our scale operators about concerns surrounding perhaps some gender equity issues.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we provisoire, I think, some money in the budget asking for a plan for kind of employee development and advancement. Does this appendix do anything with respect to implementing that plan or addressing those issues? My.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you for being here, Michael.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you for asking me to be here. Yes. This memo, you does actually address a lot of the issues that we have brought up as far as especially the present context, some of the issues with them being able to take lunches and breaks, especially during the peak season.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Just so for some context, for the entire council, the school operators are a group of employees, mostly women, who are the ones at the very point of contact when ever a person of the public or a commercial driver comes in to the dump to, you know, get rid of garbage, wood, recycling, whatever it may be, they work'",
        "'speaker_1': 'normally either for eight or ten hour shifts. And when during peak season, if they don't have any help, they are working that shift by themselves and they are working not only the inbound when somebody comes in to pay, but the outbound when so when the personnel so I'm sorry, the inbound when they get their card and the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'outbound when they pay, which is probably about the length of the county. And if to give you context of this, on a week and day, they could go anywhere between depending upon the station, 4 to 800 customers and one day walking back and forth between the scale not being able to they take what's called intermediate breaks, but'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it's very hard to tell when those breaks are going to come. Usually they're at a customer with the mouth or food or, you know, they're hearing people honking while they're trying to take a bathroom break or something like that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So this was a I would say why they got to a point of contention, right? I mean, they felt that compared to the other work groups within the county, that they were not given the same amount of staffing to be able to have the same working conditions, working conditions and working with the opposite labor relations especially.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'd like to applaud Megan for helping us work through this issue. We were able to come up with a menu and a trial period to look and see if these issues can be addressed, especially during the peak season.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We think with some other things in the contract and the other ways we've done some bedding that during the non peak season will be able to work some things out. But during the peak season we like to take a look at this and think it think it will help the issues.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And have we commenced this pilot project now given that it's May 1st, third, second or third.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Correct. The solid waste division has taken taking this very seriously. And they are they when they had recruited and got people in as far as I know it has. Yes. Started it's going to be starting this week.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Don't thank.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You. Proud of them.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We appreciate it. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right, Heidi.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. Chair. That concludes my staff report. There is an amendment to the proposed ordinance, one of the two, since we're hearing two ordinances today, and that's before you propose ordinance 2018 0178, which would approve the MLA.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That amendment is on page 203 of your packet.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And it replaces an incorrectly transmitted appendix 51. Correct. That's the one we were just, I think review.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Correct. That's the one.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I want to get that one right.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then on the ordinance 0138, it looks like there is a striking amendment which would make technical changes. Correct. Those are all staff requested. Correct. All right. What is the will of the body? Are members comfortable having had briefings, an opportunity to review this, to move it forward?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Today, the full council in the ordinary schedule, I'm seeing nods and one shaking. No. So we will vote accordingly. I ask for a motion to put 2018 0178 before US Councilmember Gossett.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So move the chair.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'For the Vice Chair Councilor calls. Would you be willing to move the amendment.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'A.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Putting. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. Chair. Amendment number.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'One. All right. This is the putting in, correct? Appendix 51. All in favor Amendment one. Say I.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'll oppose Amendment One carries turning to the underlying ordinance as amended. Comments or questions. Councilmember Bell Duty.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. Chair. I've been holding off for the appropriate time and hopefully this is it. So the overall accomplishment here is, is pretty big deal for King County. We have a lot of bargaining units and. Many, many collective bargaining agreements and the accomplishment of starting to streamline in a real way the provisions, the language around a'",
        "'speaker_3': 'lot of these practices, I think, can only really help. It'll help the employees and the managers understand how to implement, implement more correctly, to have people feel they're being treated fairly and for us to be more accurate and actually incorrect in how we implement.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I think this is a major accomplishment and I want to thank everybody involved for that. I want to ask in the spirit of continuous improvement and lean, which you reference in your materials. The primary objectives here are efficiency, equity, engagement in recruitment and advancing coalition bargaining.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I would like to make sure that as we move forward into the next phase 20, 19, 2020 and onward into the future that we are checking back to make sure we're achieving those goals. I'm looking at the fiscal note.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It comes out to about a total of 5 million in addition between the previous fiscal year and 2018 with 60 bargaining agreements. If you had done them all separately and added them all up, it's probably ballpark where you would have been.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I'm just guessing. But it's going to be nice to sort of make sure that we're keeping track of how we are capturing efficiencies by doing things this way that we can then use to provide service for the public.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's, I think, a key goal of having a more efficient labor relations for all of us. So I don't know if you could talk to that just a little bit. I really appreciate that comment because it's something that we are very cognizant.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is our overarching North Star goal in bargaining in coalition for a master labor agreement. I see this as a very much iterative process and getting the first master contract was, you know, 99% of the battle. And now that that's in place, we are socializing it with our unions, with our employees.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We will continue to build on that success. One very real, very tangible efficiency and cost savings that the county has implemented in the last four years is bargaining and a total compensation methodology. So as opposed to the past, where benefits and wages were sort of siloed, we are making it very transparent with our workforce that we have'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to look at everything the county is paying for or the employee experience, and we have to cost that. So we're in that regard. We're better off now than we were even last year. You know, I think Denise and Michael could attest to that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'When we talk to total compensation, we never we no longer see balking and eir roles at negotiations from the members. It's like, yeah, we get it. That's what most employers in the country do.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember of the group.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Chair. I figure this is a big enough deal. Wanted to at least offer a few comments. I, I think what we have done, taking some of the credit for the good work you've done, I think is impressive, in part because we're working in a fiscal environment that's very challenging.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You know, we're given the limitations on local governments, the ability to remain a generous and fair employer and to actually make these positive steps towards I know what the executive has touted as being the employer of the future to have what you just called the whole workplace experience stay modern, stay make sure we're a place that people'",
        "'speaker_1': 'want to continue to work and to do that in such a fiscally constrained environment and do it in partnership with the employee groups, and to reach resolution in and of itself as an accomplishment and to do it in a way that appears to be consistent with the policies we've adopted.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's it's kind of a funny role. We play it, you know, the ability to vote up or down, you know, sometimes I think it would be great if we could each negotiate each of the nine of us the things we like or don't like.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But that would be utter chaos and I'm sure a violation of laws and processes. So recognizing that our responsibility is to vote it up or down, I, I think it's the obvious. The obvious course of action would be to approve it and not only prove it, but approve it with a sense of pride for the work that's'",
        "'speaker_1': 'been done.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'To reach the the agreement we have in such a difficult.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Fiscal environment. Speaking as the budget chair, I'm very thankful.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you so much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Lambert.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. I am really excited that we have a master labor agreement. When we first talked about this, was it five years ago? Everybody was like, oh, this is like walking into a bomb territory. This is dangerous. So I'm really pleased that that we did it because they think it's the right thing to do.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And like Councilmember LGT keeping track of how much easier it is to not be spending time all the time negotiating, but actually getting the work done and dealing with real problems. My concern is that there's going to be $5 million more, and I assume that's on top of steps that people will be getting.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we were just briefed last week that the county and the general fund will be $25 million deficit. And so now that number could go up to $30 million. And that concerns me. That's a huge number. And I see things popping up that I just don't like, like donning and doffing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'A couple years ago, I didn't even know what donning and doffing was, but we pay for it every day. And, you know, giving signing bonuses, I had no idea that I was working for a baseball team or football team.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, places where a B.A. or an AA degree should be the basics for getting hired. Now we're paying, you know, bonuses for. So I'm concerned by the scope creep of our pay scale in these categories. And so that is my one concern.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But my overall concern that how long are we able to afford this? But I really like the format and I'm hoping that when we do the next contract that there won't be so many amendments. I think it was probably part of the wish list of getting this together.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So thank you for your work. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Other questions, Councilmember Gossett, or comment?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes, thank you. It's just a comment and it follows along with the ones that you and councilwoman ideology and councilor of the Grove and Councilmember Lambert have made. And that is I'm really recognizing this as well. We have a human resources department, but I'm recognizing that it has special work that Labor Relations Office does because these are'",
        "'speaker_6': 'highly complex and challenging questions that we have and they impact dozens of a union. So to be able to sort it out, make some reasonable accommodations with our labor representatives and then be able to articulate what they mean is, you know, a monumental job and probably get a little more challenging even in the future.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I wanted to say to them that we definitely appreciate that the work that you do on behalf of our government and our residents of King County.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think, Mr. Gossett just returning to the economic issues, we have Labor policy on compensation, which directs the Executive to consider the following factors. Economic number one economic conditions include could. Inflation and deflation in the region. I think our inflation is ticking up in the region to revenue and cost forecast for the county customer.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Lambert mentioned that we had a briefing council member of the committee on it and while there were some concerns there, I assume that the cost forecasts were incorporated into that budget. That presentation by Mr. Diver. Third, comparable work compensation and for the status of accounting reserves.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The presentation indicated we were actually taking up our county reserves toward an 8% number, if I recall correctly, at least in the general fund. And this applies to not just the general fund, but also some of our utility funds, always division and and wastewater.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I don't think transients in here as transient tragedies as in the. Yes. Transit in there. Okay. So I guess my question is, in the staff analysis they indicated is unknown to council staff at this time, what are the executive considered the factors described in the compensation labor policy?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So my question to the executive is did you consider these factors when negotiating the wage provisions of the appendices, which are the applicable provisions before us?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Absolutely.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Very good. All right. Thank you. I want to give if there are no further comments from my colleagues, I also want to thank everyone who worked on particularly Megan, you and your shop, but Denise Cobbs and Dustin Frederick, who brings a lot of expertize and years of experience as well and is who else I want to give'",
        "'speaker_0': 'you all of.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Course, my quick comment. I'm sorry. I do not want the work of the ADR ADR office, especially with Polly Davis, to go unnoticed, especially within our caucus with 90 people on the bargaining unit, Denise and I, and with, you know, trying to get 90 people to decide whether the sky is blue sometimes can be a challenge.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And she really put in a lot of work in her office, putting a lot of work, also helping the practice and get it done. So at least.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Some alternative dispute resolution wasn't just between management and labor, but between labor and labor.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I think what they always saying was renegotiations both the negotiations happened between Labor's own members, but they were, they were incredible in helping us to reach that. And I just wanted to make sure that she and her office were recognized for that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Very good. So the 2018 0178 as amended is before us. Then the clerk will call the roll.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. Chair. Councilmember Banducci. Councilmember done by Councilmember Garcia. Councilmember Colwell. Councilmember Lambert and Councilmember McDermott. High Council Member of the Grove. Councilmember one right there. Mr. Chair. Hi, Mr. Chair. The vote is eight eyes, no noes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Councilmember one right there. Excuse. All right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Because of the compensation issues related here, I would request that we expedite this to Monday's council meeting. If folks have a questions that don't get answered, we can have a one week courtesy delay, which is our tradition. But let's move this along.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We'll turn now to ordinance 2018 0138, and I'd entertain a motion for to pass a recommendation on that one. If anybody wanted to move it. Councilmember up the grove was put up by Vegas.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think, Mr. Chairman, the proposed ordinance 2018 01784 giving a do pass recommendation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And Council member Cole Wells as our Vice Chair, would you be willing to move the striking amendment making technical changes?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. Chairman, that the striking amendments.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In favor of the striking amendment making technical changes recommended by the staff say I opposed that Carrie's turn to the underlying ordinance. And we all said what we wanted to say on this package of legislation. Looks like we have the critical.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Call the roll. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Councilmember Duty. Councilmember Dunn. Councilmember Gossett.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Councilmember Colwell, Councilmember Lambert and councilmember McDermott. High Council member of the Grove, Councilmember Yvonne Wright Bauer. Mr. Chair. Mr. Chair, the vote is seven eyes, no no's, councilmembers Balducci and Von. Right. They were excused.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To be given a do pass recommendation. We will expedite ordinance 2018 0178 as well to Monday's calendar. We will have those on the regular calendar because this is a big deal and folks may want to talk about it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I want to thank my colleagues and executive staff and our representatives from Labor for helping us get through a pretty dense set of materials, pretty complex. It's quite a long process. And especially I want to thank Heidi five, Chuck and Pat Hamacher and your colleagues on our central staff for their great work.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Anything further? Nothing. We're adjourned.'"
