And that is proposed ordinance 2021 184 I'm in our last meeting. Sam Porter provided a staff report on proposed on the proposed ordinance which would send to the November ballot a proposed'",
        "'speaker_0': 'proposal to make changes to the Turner's preamble. I miss Porter, can you please rewind and reorient us to the legislation and amendment?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Absolutely. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Can you hear me okay?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We can.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay, great. Sam Porter, Council Policy Staff. The documents for this item begin on page seven of your packet today. This charter amendment recommended by the Charter Review Commission would propose, including the context of equitable government, a strong urban and rural economy, and a superior quality of life among the counties.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Goals in the Preamble to the Charter. Along with making one grammatical correction. The preamble serves as the introduction to the King County Charter and provides a brief statement on the activities, goals and objectives of King County Government. The four changes to the preamble included in proposed ordinance 2020 10184 can be seen in context beginning on page eight'",
        "'speaker_1': 'of your packet. The first change would insert the words equitable and for all in reference to the operation of King County government. The second change would correct the grammatical error and the spelling of the word ensure. The third change would add, protect and enhance in reference to a healthy, rural and urban environment and economy.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And the fourth change would be to insert the goal to promote a superior quality of life. To place this on the November 2nd ballot. The last regular council meeting for adoption is July 28, and the deadline for elections to receive the effective ordinance is August 3rd.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There is an amendment to the proposed ordinance to correct grammatical mistake. This amendment is on page 13 of your packet. That concludes my remarks. I'm available to answer any questions and Louise Miller may be on the line. She was the co-chair of the Charter Review Commission.'",

And are there any questions, particularly about the proposed amendment? From his porter. See none. DOMBROWSKI Councilmember Dombrowski, thanks again.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thanks, Mr. Chair. And Sam, thanks very much for the report. Do you happen to know I assume we pay a cost like any other government to go on the ballot with a question? Maybe that assumption is wrong, but I'm wondering what the cost to put this forward is.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I don't have that information off the top of my head. It would be going on the general election ballot. I think that there's increased costs if it's going on a special election ballot. But I can find out and get back to you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. And we do so we've updated the charter a number of times. And I guess my related question is, I wonder if if there were other charter language updates that would, you know, that we would be doing, whether those could be integrated in that kind of a consolidated proposal to the voters?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This one is very specific in the in the preamble, or does it have to be kind of a single subject type rule?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I would need to get back to you on that. There may be a single subject issue.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Further questions. Council member Belushi.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Not a question so much as a comment. Just as a reminder, although it's been briefed before the we have a legal obligation to at least take up all of the recommendations that came from the Charter Review Commission, and they put in a lot of work over a long period of time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There's a short list of recommendations of theirs that we did not put on the ballot. I just want to say that I recommended this one and the next one, because it seemed this one in particular seemed like a is the first words that you read of our Constitution for our government.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I thought that the thought that was put into it was meaningful. And although it's more of a change in tone and direction, it does make the charter a more modern and relevant document to have these words. I think it's a really good question as to whether it's going to actually cost us cash out of pocket to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'put this on the ballot. I don't believe it does on a November ballot, but it's well worth considering and we have the time to consider it. I don't know if this was considered to be on for action today, but I'd be happy to move it if it is on for action.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then we could, you know, sort of decide what to do at full council based on what we hear about the the cost. But just looking for your guidance here about whether you want to move it or keep it in committee today.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'I have this and the next charter amendment both on the agenda for possible action today, and I would entertain a motion.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Belushi's moved adoption of Amendment One. Councilmember Bell Dutchie.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Amendment One has been briefed. It is that it is a fairly technical.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Bell. She.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah. I think I stated my, my rationale before making the motion, you know, with my usual deep respect for parliamentary procedure. But the I think this is a stronger preamble. I think it is accurate and states what this county is really all about in a better and more direct way.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And it brings the preamble to our governing document, our baseline governing document into into modern times, if you will. And I would urge your support.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'In one's regular course means it skips one regular meeting and ends up on the 22nd. Wendy can correct me if I am wrong or Jeff, but I believe my suggestion to the one that's one week. It has to be at least one week on regular action.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So with the meeting getting skipped, it will still go to that for that next council meeting that's occurring. My suggestion would be to expedite just in case if that is the intent to have it on the 15th. Just so we're really clear then.'"

        "'speaker_0': 'What was the genesis of all this? I missed that. How did this whole process to revise and update these rules relating to the referendum process come to pass was initiated by the Charter Review Commission or someone else? A Yes, that's correct.'",

You may recall, Councilmember Dunn, there was an attempt by a group of citizens to put a measure, an initiative on the ballot on a for an initiative seeking county on the ballot of 2 to 3 years ago.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And one of the things that came out during that process was that our rules were contradictory and hard to understand. And in fact, although those residents submitted the requisite number of signatures by the date, they were told they still were too late to make the ballot they were aiming for because our rules did not allow for all'",
        "'speaker_1': 'of the process steps that were required. And so after that happened, you know, regardless of the substance of that, our process was clearly not working. And so after that, my office and I took it upon ourselves to try to fix the rules which required a change to ordinance and charter.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We've already adopted changes to the ordinances, our ordinances to put them in line with state law and each other. This change to the charter would kind of complete the circle of process improvement here so that there is a clear, stepwise path to take to do either an initiative or a referendum in King County.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You know, by the way, not a huge fan of this way of legislating, but if we're going to have this is available to people, we should be upfront and honest with them about how long it really takes so that if they put the effort in, they're not told at the end of the day, oops, sorry, you can't'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Real quick questions. Why do we move from 45 days for it to become effective to 90 days?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'My understanding is that that was requested by the executive side or it was it was so that there was enough time on staff's part in order to do the processing. But the sponsor might have more information on that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Because it seems that when people are doing this, they want to do it as quickly as possible. And so that seems like an awfully long time. And then when we're talking about notifying the clerk and writing a we defined writing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I know we talked about this before, but I do writing to include by email.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I would have to follow up with you on that. I believe that they accept it by email, but I can confirm that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. And then my last question is on page seven. It's. Because he's 17. They find it where they were talking about it real quick again are. You have to go on. Only the general ballot. Yes. The last part under 30.50 on page 17.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The last bullet specified in Mississippi are only a general election unless the council specifies an earlier date. So. It seems a little redundant in some ways because it is a target, but we could pick any date we want.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So explain why that's called out so clearly. And do we have authority? Supposing a city says, I really want this done quickly and I want it on April ballot. And for some reason we don't like whatever that is.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We're sorry we had to wait till the November ballot. Is that a possibility that they could create?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I can say that the the existing rules say it goes on either the next special or the next general election ballot, whichever one comes first. So and this would go to just the next general election ballot, unless the council unless the council said, yes, it's going to go into a special election prior to that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So it would be up to the council to decide if it can go on an earlier date or if it defaults to the general election ballot. I think that was a recommendation that came out of the Charter Review Commission.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. Moving on to S1.'",

As I said earlier, this is really the end of a kind of a journey of legislative cleanup we've been on to make sure that these processes are clear and implementable so that if and when groups of residents go to the effort to either run a referendum or initiative in King County, our rules make sense and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'they can be understood. We created a Gantt chart, which I will gladly share with anybody that shows sort of when all the steps have to happen in order. The elections is very much on board with clarifying these processes, so it's really clear what they have to do and when.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sometimes in these processes, the council has a role. It's clear what we have to do and when it just makes it possible for residents to access their government in this way. In response to one of Councilmember Lambert's questions, what the the amended ordinance would do if adopted into the charter by the voters is it would extend the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'entire process to a total of 90 days instead of a total of 60 days. So it's long, but it's not really ridiculously long. And the reason is to allow election 40 days to verify signatures. That sounded like a lot to me too, when election proposed it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But when I thought about it and listening to what they were saying, often the need to verify very large stacks of many, many thousands of signatures hits around the same time as they're working on an election, and they don't have people hanging around just to sit down and do this work.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So to make sure that they were allowed ample time and could always meet their deadlines, this was what they thought was was required. And because the goal of this whole change is to make sure that we can meet our marks and that if we tell somebody who comes in with a petition, if you do everything you're supposed'",
        "'speaker_1': 'to in 90 days, you will be able to get on the November ballot. We want to be able to make that statement and make it true. And so this allows ample time so that we can always feel confident that we can do that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that's the entire purpose of the change. I really appreciate the charter commission taking this up and looking at it very closely and passing it on to us because it does complete a path that we were already on to really fix one of our one of our one of our operating processes that we have here at King'",
        "'speaker_1': 'County Government. And I urge everyone support.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'For the discussion. Just a quick.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Question, if I might, Mr..'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember, about.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This touches on an inquiry that Councilmember Lambert raised, and that is that kind of default to the next general election. And I wondered if there was kind of a pro and con assessment of that. I think of that initiative and referendum was kind of coming out of the populist movement.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If my memory if my history serves me correctly, it's kind of a Western states thing and it's kind of it's designed as the ultimate testing of power in the people when their elected representatives maybe get a little sidetracked from what the majority wants on on a key issue.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And, and, and I when I think about that, I it seems like that that a defaulting to the next general election could really lengthen the process for the people's voice to be heard on an issue of of major importance.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I understand that that there's a counter to that in this legislation where we could we could put it on a special ballot or a primary, for example. But that kind of seems to be counter to the general thrust of the initiative and referendum power.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I'm wondering what the discussion was in the Charter Review Commission about that issue of defaulting to the to the next general, which is different than what we do today, as I understand it goes on the next election ballot.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Unfortunately, Councilmember, I do not have that information in front of me. I'm sure if Miranda was here today, she would be able to give you a thorough background on that. But I'll be happy to follow up with you on that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay, Jeff, maybe it was chiming in there perhaps or wanting to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I was just going to say the exact same magnitude. All right.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I guess I would say I'd be supportive today, but I'm interested in that angle as we take it up at full council and make sure that we're comfortable with that. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Dombrowski. And not knowing the thinking of the charter review commission at all. It occurs to me that with the turnout in the general election, there's certainly more of the electorate, more of the public participating in that decision than in a primary and certainly than in a special election.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But that's my own thinking at this moment, not at all representing what the term review commission may have been thinking.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Fair point. Thank you, Joe.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mr. Chair.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Lambert.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm glad you're at least talking about this, because sometimes the November ballot can be very long, very complicated, and people are working on big ticket items and this might be a down ticket item and not get the scrutiny that it might get a smaller election and that the cost of elections, you know, people are pretty clear about'",
        "'speaker_1': ', well, I don't want to be the only thing like Councilmember DEMBOSKY asked earlier on, what does it cost? Because if you're going to go on, say, a primary election date, you have most likely other people just to share the costs with you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You don't have more people as a general, but you may have less scrutiny because there'll be more attention on other things. So it could be good and it could be bad. And so I think having the flexibility of the citizens being able to decide, is it better for me to be able to have more bandwidth or is'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that better for me? Not so. I think it's a good thing to at least think about.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Mel Duchin, anything to close?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I appreciate the discussion, and I think these are issues that we can take up on final passage. If that anyone has any amendments. I just urge them to really think ahead and make sure, because there's a number of hands that have to touch these processes, including elections, our own clerk's office, etc..'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So if we're going to make changes to this, I really encourage that people check with those folks in-depth as early as possible, because I find that with any like with any process, if you pull the string here, things might happen over here that you're not thinking about.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And as I said, the goal of this entire thing is to make the process manageable, clear and doable so that it is a reliable thing for anybody who undertakes this, which is a significant amount of effort. So, yeah, I appreciate the discussion and everyone support I urge yes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Vote here today. Thank you, Mr. Chair.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And quickly, please call the roll. Was there a vote on this breaking amendment? I may have missed that. Pardon me.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I have it documented that there was a vote on my amendment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Great. Would you please call the roll?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Chair. Councilmember Belushi, I. Councilmember Dombrowski. Councilmember Dunn.'",
