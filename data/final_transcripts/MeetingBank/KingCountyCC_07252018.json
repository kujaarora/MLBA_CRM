    "AN ORDINANCE concerning protecting conservation lands in King County; adopting financial policies to accelerate the protection of vital open spaces, including urban green spaces, natural areas, wildlife and salmon habitat, trails, river corridors, farmlands and forests in King County; to address equity and social justice issues by increasing the availability of open spaces in historically under-served areas; and to address generational equity by spreading costs of protecting vital open spaces over time; amending Ordinance 8867, Section 1 and K.C.C. 26.12.010, Ordinance 13717, Section 1 and K.C.C. 26.12.003, as amended, and Ordinance 13717, Section 4 and K.C.C. 26.12.025 and adding a new section to K.C.C. chapter 26.12.": [
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. So for the record, on Mary Bergen on from the council staff and the materials for this item began on page 39 of your packet, but I'm going to begin at page 40 and just give a little bit of background on what led to this ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Back in 2015, the council passed motion 14458 which declared that it is county policy to protect and conserve land and water resources and directed the executive to develop and transmit a work plan by March 30th of 2016. To do that, the executive came back with an initial work plan in early 2016 and then convened a land conservation'",
        "'speaker_1': 'advisory group which met throughout much of 2016 and 2017 and developed a first phase report in January of last year and then a final report in December of last year. That report set the goal of acquiring 65,000 acres of open space lands within the next 30 years, at a cost estimated over the 30 years of $1.9 billion'",
        "'speaker_1': '. The group came up with a number of ideas for how funding could be secured to do that, which included, among other things, resetting the conservation futures tax to its state maximum of 6.2 cents per $1,000. That would require voter approval.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so instead of that, at this point, the Executive has come forward with several of the other concepts from the Land Conservation Advisory Group, one of which includes an increasing the bonding level against the conservation futures tax. And then the other, which is also in this ordinance to establish equity areas in underserved areas of the county.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In the middle of page 41, you'll see a description of the conservation futures tax. This is a dedicated portion of the property tax that's authorized by state law to acquire property rights to conserve open space. It's been collected in King County since the early 1980s.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And as I mentioned, state law sets the maximum for this levy at 6.2 cents per $1,000 of assessed value. The CFT was at this maximum level when it was first imposed in the 1980s, but since then it has eroded and it is now under $0.04.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'King County currently allocates about 12 and a half million dollars in CFT proceeds each year, and those allocation processes are governed by sections of the King County Code, which establish an application process for local communities. A citizen's oversight committee from whom you heard this afternoon to review the applications, and then a process by which first the executive'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and then the council review those recommendations and allocate funding. Now I'm moving on to page 43 in terms of the proposed changes that are included in this ordinance. The first thing the ordinance would do, as I mentioned, is change the financial policies for the CFT to allow that 80% of the proceeds could be used for debt service'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so that the amount of money bonded against the CFT could be increased. Currently, there is not a set limit for bonding, but there's been an informal limit set by the council, an executive of about half the proceeds used for bonding.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And right now about 46% of annual CFT revenues are used to support debt service with the proposal going to 80%. That would provide an additional 6 to $8 million a year. That could potentially be set aside for debt service and could lead depending on the length of the bonds.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The interest rate, somewhere between 80 and $150 million in proceeds that could be used immediately to acquire property. The second thing the ordinance would do, and here I'm on the top of page 44, is to eliminate the match requirement for what are defined as equity areas.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I should note that right now any jurisdiction applying for funding through the CFT is required to provide local match equal to the amount they ask for from the CFT for equity areas. And I'll get to that definition in a minute.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There would be no local match which would allow for more jurisdictions and underserved areas to seek funding. You'll see a little bit farther down on page 44 the definition of equity areas, which would require three criteria to be met.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'First, areas located in a census tract in which the median household income is in the lowest third in the county. Second areas located in a census tract in which hospitalization rates for asthma, diabetes and heart disease are in the highest third in the county.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then finally, areas that do not have easy access to parks, either those within the urban growth growth boundary no park within a quarter mile or areas outside the urban growth boundary, no park within two miles. There is also language in the ordinance that would allow for some flexibility so that an applicant can demonstrate and the CFTC'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Citizen's Oversight Committee can determine that a project proposed for funding would be eligible to be considered an equity area. With that turning to the bottom of page 44 and staff's analysis. First, the definition of equity area. As I noted, there are three criteria as well as some language that allows for flexibility.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Those obviously are policy choices for the council, whether you wish to add this definition and then if you are satisfied with the combination of set criteria as well as flexibility that the Oversight Committee could apply. The next policy issue for the Council is the elimination of the match requirement for equity areas.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Again, this would allow for underserved communities to apply more easily for T funding, but would mean that because there is not a local match, more money would need to come from the CFT or other sources to acquire that open space.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Again, a policy choice for the Council. Next, the increased bonding. As I noted, setting the bond limit higher would allow for an immediate cash infusion to purchase property, but would mean that in future years more of the C of T revenues are being used to support debt service.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Again, there are pros and cons of that. It's a policy choice for the council. And then finally, the nexus between equity and open space. The proposed ordinance talks about this to some extent, but staff has identified a number of both adopted policies and regional plans that specifically call out this nexus, including King County's Determinants of Equity Report'",
        "'speaker_1': ', the King County Open Space Plan and the recently adopted Puget Sound Regional Council Regional Open Space Conservation Plan. The final issue I'll note is the ongoing erosion of the C of T. As I mentioned, the state maximum for that tax is 6.25.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Since it has eroded over time to under $0.04. And this proposal would not affect that erosion. So it will continue to erode over time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mary, you used the term erode, but can you explain what you mean?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'What I mean is that there are limits in state law by how much property taxes can increase each year. And because of those limits, the portion of any particular dedicated source of funding such as the CFA, go down in value year over year.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so again, over the 30 plus years that this tax has been enacted, it has gone down from 6.2 $0.05 to under $0.04 now. And that diminishment would continue unless there is some action and in this case, voter approval to reset that levy amount.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Finally, I'll note and as you had mentioned, Mr. Chair, this ordinance is a dual mandatory referral. It was heard by and approved by the Regional Policy Committee earlier this month. And that concludes my staff report. Bob Burns is here from the Department of Natural Resources and Parks, if you have questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much for the staff report and the presentation, Mary. Let's take a couple of questions and then we'll see. Councilmember Cole Wells is the co-sponsor of the legislation with me, if you might, when we're ready to be able to put it forward.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Start with Councilmember Lambert and then Councilmember Gossett.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. To look at instead of eliminating the match, look at a sliding scale. I think that's a great question for the executive. So I'll call bumpers up. So well he's coming up asking the second question. So, you know, we talked about the 6.2 going down to $0.04.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But during that time, the housing in this county pretty much doubled in value. So while that the amount to 4000 went down, the assessed values went way up. Right. Yes. That's so it didn't really erode the amount of money because the assessed values were so much higher.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The rate has been what eroded. That was what I was trying to impress and apologize if there is any confusion. But I wasn't. And I know you weren't, but I just want to make sure the citizens listening who don't do this everyday got that little twist.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then I know that in the catalog. And maybe there's another question for you, Bob, but there is a catalog of county planners, city planners that says that for every thousand people you have, you have to have so much open space.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Do you know what that formula is for?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So for the record, Paul Byrnes, King County Department of Natural Resources and Parks. So on that question, I think each jurisdiction has their own, you know, comprehensive plans and part plan. And so it varies by jurisdiction in terms of what those goals and targets are.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There's not a legal requirement. I don't think that's uniform across jurisdictions. But many jurisdictions set targets and goals for numbers of acres, numbers of ballfields, numbers of certain park amenities.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So that that's true. And thank you. What I was asking was, what is the guideline? There's a guideline formula. And so I think it would be interesting as we go forward to maybe have something in the bill that says that you need to you need to get closer to the guidelines so that you don't end up in'",
        "'speaker_1': 'these problems. Because I used to know that there's what the number was, but I don't remember off the top of my head. But there is a formula. So maybe we should find that out and then see other cities that in going forward you need to make decisions that don't put us in the situation in the past.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So did you ever look at a sliding scale as opposed to eliminating it?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So the advisory group recommendation was to eliminate the match, but what we did was assessed where are the areas of most acute need? And I think that the sense was that there weren't there's not a lot of gradation when it comes to acute need areas that are bottom third of income, bottom or top third of hospitalization, rates'",
        "'speaker_3': 'for heart disease, diabetes, asthma and a lack of proximity to greenspace. And the strong consensus coming out of the advisory group process was elimination of the match entirely is the thing that is going to allow those areas to catch back up and get some greenspace going.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If we if we take gradations and gets very complicated, it's hard to, you know, describe an area with an acute sort of need as just, you know, gradations of of of waiver. And so the strong consensus was to eliminate the match entirely.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Thanks very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Lambert, Councilmember Gossett.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. Chair. I was impacted by many of the people who testified because they reminded us that already the King County Council has preserved a lot of open space where our public funding. More so than most other places, at least proportionately speaking around the country.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think a lot of that has to do with the fact that Larry Phillips was our leader for so many years on a county council, and he was the father of the growth manager plan when he was in the state legislature.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I also like the fact that the CFP has that program that you and Council remember had been talking about where we could give priority consideration to low income communities getting a little bit of open space because I think communities like Harlem and North Philly that you can go from miles and have no open space.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You got some cement basketball courts, but no open space for a long time. Here's the challenge that I have. If we increase the bonding capacity for our county from 50 to 80% of all the money, yes, it's true that that means that right now we can bond that money and have an I think oh, I think you'",
        "'speaker_2': 'said about 100 3050 million available to spare. And two or three speakers said if we could spend money now better than we're waiting for later because the cost of land would be so much more. And that that's a consideration.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Here's what bothers me. The FBI guy in the Seattle Times, his name is Bork. Eugene Bork. Yeah. Okay. And he said The poor people in King County in Seattle are King County. I can't remember which pay way more taxes than anybody else in the state of Washington and perhaps in a lot of other places.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And they sound like we pay for 18% of their money for sales tax and most put it on their homes. But I'm sure it's even more than that if they if they do and have to pay taxes, because those are two primary taxing possibilities here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I don't know about this having more. And Mary, very clearly explain what it means. It means we have to have more capacity to pay off a larger debt in years in the future to pay off that empty debt.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That would be really high. And then the other point, she said, because each year something falls. And what was that?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It was the rate of the tax know.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So it's going to be much more difficult to get resources in the future. So I wanted to ask either one of you. The debt service payment being so high in your future, what are the redeeming values of having that kind of situation?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilman, for the question so that the action in front of you today would put the financial tool in the toolbox to allow bonding at a higher level, but it would not cause any increase in taxes. So what what would happen?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No, I mean, why not?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we would rely on an existing the existing conservation futures tax revenues, which is an existing, stable, predictable revenue stream. We would use those existing revenues to pay off any debt that would be council magically issued. And so it wouldn't require increasing the tax, it would just be binding against an existing stable funding source.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And the reason we think that's prudent is pulling that capital forward allows us to accelerate the pace and buy land before it disappears to other uses and wallets. While it's maybe more affordable in the future, we project the price of land to only go higher, and the longer we wait, we'll lose these opportunities to get green space'",
        "'speaker_3': 'in urban areas, to protect farmlands, connect trail corridors, etc.. So those are the rationale set.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Up by me. Mary, also a comment on Macron because if the because are using all of this, the money, the value of it is going to go down in the future. Well, understand what it means. It's easy to pay it off.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'What I mean, sir, is that essentially the county would be taking this existing revenue source, which Bob mentioned, and it's essentially putting more of it on the county credit card. We'd be saying we need the money upfront because land values are increasing so quickly, we're going to borrow to get more money.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So it's as if you said your salary is the same, but you're going to put more in your credit card because you need to buy a new car or you're going to take out a home loan to buy a new house.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that's essentially the proposal here. So it's not a new tax. It's not an increased tax. It's just saying we're going to borrow some money now to have more up front.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Somebody has to be paid back.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So the county would be paying it back out of its existing revenues from this tax. And it just means that in future years there would be less to spend on an ongoing basis because the county would be spending more to pay back the debt.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Definitely would be less to spend in the future.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you. If I might come at Mr.. And I think one of the reasons you got comfortable with the proposal in the Regional Policy Committee and were able to support it there is because this legislation authorizes us to go up to 80%.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But there are still two additional steps before we would actually do that. At least tier one you would be able to approve the specific proposed acquisitions of land with the money or recall that comes before us every year on recommendations of the CFP committee.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And two, you would have to vote to issue the debt and there may even be a budget vote in there somewhere as well. So I think there were those additional steps that would be required to where your concern, which I think is valid with respect to does the proposal comply with our financial policies?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Are we not overextending ourselves? All of those issues are certainly going to be able to be presented and addressed if we were able to move forward. This simply sets the framework to be able to do it. Did I messed that up, Bob?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That that was exactly right, Mr. Chair.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This just even a blind squirrel finds the knot once in a while, so. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No, he's always pretty good at explaining count.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Garcia, that's kind of you to say Councilmember Lambert had an additional comment before we put it before us.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah, well, I found it online line. So it was just what you said. But it was also that prior to from 1919 60 to 19 eighties, the National Recreation and Parks Association standard was ten acres per thousand. And then in the 1990s people were saying that there was too much parkland, surprisingly enough.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so then, then they said, but each city establish its own standard. And so some cities have like nine acres, a couple cities have 12 acres, Tampa has 9.9. So, you know, it's interesting that the cities, very few of them look like they've gone over the ten per acre, that it was actually a way of making it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'less, which was very interesting. But I think, you know, looking at some kind of standard, even though that was the old standard for 20 years, it gave a guideline so that if your city didn't have proper and we know that it's needed for health and all these other good reasons, including mental health.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So anyway, I threw that out because they thought it was something that we should at least know how our cities are doing. Are they getting close to a 10th acre just so we know, or are they doing it like one city has four acres per thousand, which is completely not acceptable as far as I'm concerned.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So know. I just want you to know that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember about duty and then Councilmember Caldwell's.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Looking left. I just wanted to repeat something that we said at the Regional Policy Committee, mainly because there are people in this discussion that weren't in that discussion. First of all, there was some discussion at our P.C. about whether pulling this money forward would limit our ability to fund things in the future, which is, of course, always'",
        "'speaker_1': 'true when you bond because then you then tied up your revenue streams. However, I'll repeat what I said there, which is for this kind of a project, it's a very sensible kind of strategy for funding because of the risk of losing the lands that we're trying to preserve.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If you don't preserve them now, the risk is that they go away. So pulling money forward to me makes a lot of sense in this kind of situation. I just thought I'd repeat that. And the other thing I wanted to repeat was this I am I'm very appreciative of and and excited by the work that's been done'",
        "'speaker_1': 'in the proposal that's coming forward. I am particularly excited about the equity investments. I think there's an incredibly strong case for that. And it's a it's a it's a nice way of making up for past inequities in access to open space and safe ways, places to play outside.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I do want to again, though, stressed that when we talk about conserving land outside the urban growth boundary or at the urban growth boundary, that sort of brings to my mind of the discussion around the whole balance of good, the Growth Management Act.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And the balance was we're going to grow inside that urban growth boundary, we're going to provide housing, we're going to provide density, smart growth, transportation, all everything that people need so that at the same time, we can conserve the land outside the urban growth boundary and not sprawl all the way to the Cascade Mountains.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right. We seem to do a pretty good job of the conservation part, but we're not doing the greatest job on the housing part and the density part. We're not keeping up with the demand for housing and the cost just keeps going up and up and up and up.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So maybe I'll frame it as a question this time. Was any thought or discussion giving to a way to tie these two things together because they are linked like a TDR program for housing or any kind of innovation?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'A better way to try to support that second really critical part of growth management while we're doing the conservation, that is also very critical.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah, thank you. Great question. That actually came up yet.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I do say.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That that came up through the advisory group process. We actually did an analysis based on questions from advisory group members and we looked at the buildable lands capacity in the urban area. It's about 417,000 units of capacity. And the Land Conservation Initiative that we estimate is about double what we need for that, I think the 30 year'",
        "'speaker_3': 'growth target. But but that's, you know, there's the next 30 years in the 30 years beyond that that land conservation initiative would impact that by about two and a half to 3%. So the advisory group, I think, got comfortable with the idea that that's a fairly de minimis impact, but it's an impact.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And the point you made is we're struggling with affordability and.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And can I jump in? Yeah. It's not about the impact of this. I'm not arguing that because we're taking land out of production, we should. Therefore, that's not what I'm saying at all. What I'm saying is this is regardless of what our targets are and what our buildable lands may look like, we are failing egregiously at providing'",
        "'speaker_1': 'enough housing so that people can afford it in this market. So there's something wrong with that analysis there. There's something not working there. And this provides an opportunity to potentially encourage more density in places where people will actually build it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Maybe just put it that way.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah. And so we've been working with the Development Committee on how do we grow the TR program, which you referenced.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I want to suggest that as part of this, we should try to do that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah. Yeah. That's actually was we as part of the Land Conservation Initiative, we assumed a higher level of revenue from TDR as part of the non CFT revenue that would help support land conservation. The more we can grow TDR, those proceeds can help cover some of the cost of land acquisition.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If we pass this as written, does it limit our ability to use TDR or some other incentive program in that way? In this package, it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Doesn't limit our ability to use TDR or any other private or public private partnership opportunity.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's very that's very comforting. And I want to work with you all on finding ways to do that. Thank you very much, Mr. Chair.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Customer Resolution. I want to remind colleagues that in our comprehensive plan update, we included a work plan item to explore adding flexibility and new types of TDRS with our program. And I think the department is working on that, which would include urban to urban TDR using I call supercharging TDRS to incentivize their use in underinvested'",
        "'speaker_0': 'communities and even some perhaps rural to rural, whether that should be TDR to be able to facilitate these things. So I think some work. Is underway on that, and I'm very interested in seeing the results. We're running low on time, and I'm going to turn to Councilmember Caldwell's to take up this item.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Chair. I proposed ordinance 2018 020268 that would make changes to the code to allow increased funding of conservation features, tax proceeds and establish policies for the purchase of equity areas in underserved census tracts.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right, that's before us. Comments on passage. We don't have amendments at this time right here. Effectively, Amanda, we got to go back to their pieces, hopefully do that. Councilmember One Right, Bart tells me, is a full agenda at the IPC Council Member Lambert Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'As we go forward in this, I think there's some things that we need to continue to think about. So I'm just going to listen quickly. First of all, our citizens are saying their property taxes are too high. So that's a problem.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And one of the reasons our property taxes is too high, it's because 61% of the land is not paying full taxes and much of it is not paying any taxes. So that's a problem with this. It would probably go up closer to 63% of the land not paying full taxes in this.'",
        "'speaker_1': '3% of it would be on buildable lands. And we also have a problem with affordable housing. And yet part of the properties that were on the list, I don't know if they're still on the list, but are buildable land properties.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The issue about having more open space land is that we still have many, many noxious weeds. We're not doing a good job and fire prevention in the unincorporated areas. We're not doing a good job of making sure people are not parking illegally and we are not doing a good job with the amount of garbage that is being'",
        "'speaker_1': 'taken into our rural areas that my citizens. One group spent $14,000 last year paying for that garbage to clean up after their property. That was not their garbage. $14,000 last year. So as we go forward and we have people out in open spaces, they need to not be bringing their garbage and leaving it for somebody else to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'clean up. The chance for development rights has impacts on the rural roads, and as we change that, we need to be aware that the rural roads are a huge problem. And every time we do a transfer of development rights, it makes the Rural Roads Fund worse.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It makes it better for the unincorporated area incorporated, it makes it worse for the unincorporated areas. So it has an impact. That is not. But I was here when we talked about the 50% rate for bonding and there was a lot of discussion that day because people were worried that it would ruin our discussion in the future'",
        "'speaker_1': '. And they were really worried that we'd get up to 50% right away and that wasn't going to happen. And so it was almost humorous. I laughed when I read 80%. I thought, Wow, we debated a long time on 50 and now we're talking about 80.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I have those concerns as we go forward. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Limmer, Councilmember Colo.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mr. Chair, who shared the comments made by Councilmember Lambert that I think there is something eminently, eminently compelling about this legislation.

    "AN ORDINANCE relating to the Building for Culture Program, amending the list of approved projects authorized by Ordinance 18181.": [
        "'speaker_0': 'We will turn now to item 38 Ordinance 2018 0257 Building for Culture Reallocations. Mary will have a staff report on this and then we'll move to take action.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Chair. Again, for the record, Mary Bergen on and the materials for this item begin on page 153 of your packet. I'll provide just a quick background back in 2015 and I'm now on page 154. Back in 2015, King County was able.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well to pay off the bonds for the long since demolished Kingdom Stadium about nine months earlier than anticipated. That meant that under state law, lodging taxes that had been set aside for the repayment of the kingdom bonds could be used for arts and culture purposes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'With those proceeds, the county worked with for culture and led a community based process to develop the Building for Culture program that awarded just over $28 million in grant funds through a bond supported by these lodging taxes to capital facilities, improvements at arts and culture programs.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That program was implemented through a number of ordinances, and you'll see those described at the bottom of page 155. And then moving on to page 156, an ordinance that made a supplemental appropriation of $28.5 million to allow funding for the program to go forward.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'An ordinance that authorized the issuance of bonds for the program. And then finally and you'll see this at the top of page 156, Ordinance 18181 that authorized the executive to enter into an agreement with for culture to implement the Building for Culture Program.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Under this agreement for culture was to contract with the agencies that had been awarded funding and then also was required to report back to the council at several points, one of which two years after the bonds were issued, to indicate whether there were any organizations that would not be able, in four cultures estimation, to expend or fully'",
        "'speaker_1': 'expend their bond funds. You'll see on table one in the middle of page 156 that four culture did indeed report back in March of this year, two years after the bonds were issued and reported, that in their estimation, four projects would be unable to fully expend their funds.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Those were the Seattle International Film Festival, which had been awarded 200,000 and would likely not expend $120,000 due to some zoning issues near their site. Pottery Northwest, which would not be able to expand its $11,300 award due to the renovation of key arena that is underway or as planned, good ground, also known as rumbling or farm that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'would not be able to expend $25,000 because the organization did not wish to pursue some landmarking issues. And then finally, the proposed studies center in Bellevue that had been awarded $1.2 million and in four cultures estimation would not be able to secure the needed funding to begin their construction on time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Now, if you'll see at the bottom of page 156, there is a quotation pulled out from the agreement that describes the options for any funds identified as potentially unexpended. And it notes that the projects in the agreement may be amended by the County Council to reallocate those funds to any other projects or tourism promotion activities, including arts'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and culture capital projects, as the County Council may determine. And it notes that if the Council chooses not to reallocate funds, any unexpended funds would be used to devise the bonds. That brings us to this ordinance that has before you today the proposed ordinance would reallocate a portion of the unexpended funds toward a number of projects.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I won't go on further in the staff report and describe the ordinance, because instead I'm going to turn to striking amendment as to which you should have at your place at the dais. And I'll pause here. We've got extra copies if anyone doesn't have one handy.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'S2 Striking Amendment S2 would reallocate the full $1.356 million identified by For Culture this March. It would also allocate an additional $300,000 based on information from the budget director that there is additional funding available due to interest earnings and potential additional under expenditures of bond proceeds.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The striking amendment would add a statement in the statement of facts to note that and then would also add a new section in the implementing portion of the ordinance to require that for any additional funds that are allocated that the Executive would provide appropriate appropriation authority legislation to the Council to sort of close the loop.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I had mentioned earlier that one of the ordinances implementing for culture was the appropriations ordinance, and so this would be an additional appropriation for those additional funds. You will then see attached to the striking amendment to exhibits, Exhibit A is the updated project list of approved projects.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then Exhibit B, which is at the very end of this little packet here, shows a red line version comparing what was in the original ordinance back in 2015 of the projects awarded funding and what the changes would be in this Stryker.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And you can see that in kind of red line format of the organizations that I had mentioned previously that would not be expanding either all or part of their funding. And then the organizations recommended for additional funding. And if you turn to attachment B, I'll just go through it's organized in alphabetical order.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'First, you'll see the city a federal way would increase. And Mary.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I don't want to rush it, but I think given our time, folks, can we.'",

And take a brief moment, Mary, accurately describe the reasons why this money has come back out of this earlier and much larger allocation and is before us for reallocation.

We heard about many of them today. Thank you all for coming down and telling us about your your visions and your and your projects that that will serve the public.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'These projects need to be like more than shovel ready. The building for culture projects had to be shovel ready. These have to be either underway or like getting underway in a minute because there's all you've got to go through there.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'After assuming this passes, we still have county bureaucracy that has to happen before the money can be, you know, issued, and then you have to be able to spend it. So I thank you all for your bravery in stepping up to this challenge.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There is some urgency, and I do appreciate this getting on the agenda today, even though it's a very tight agenda because and I'll just say one example, the Renton Civic Theater has got to go. I mean, they've got a time window.'",

We heard from the Renton Civic Theater, but there's also the Federal Way Performing Center Heritage, Renton, Shoreline, Sammamish and Highline are all in this package culture.

And I get mixed feelings about that because we have the executive and the judicial in the legislative branches. But this is a great example of how the executive and the County Council work together to figure out how to put together'",
        "'speaker_2': 'a satisfactory proposal. Because I did not think that we were going to get it were it appears to me that we are. And I just have one question here on the North African American Museum. What does it mean when it's 75,000 crossed out and then 127,000?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Does it simply mean they're going to get 52?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That is exactly what it means. They received $75,000 grant award in 2015. That award would be increased to 127,000.'",

I want to pick up on what Ferguson said, but I want to be specific about the appreciation to Councilman Baldacci, because I appreciate Councilmember or former Councilmember David Constantine's working with his former colleagues, but it took somebody to help the bridge.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah, and I'm.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sure.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That every card with our chair, the committee was very Dombrowski who had raised some good issues through this process. And so I think that we've all worked together and I want to commend Mike Cameron, my colleague, Councilmember Banducci, and the chair of this committee.'",

And this was not 1/1 presented, speaking for myself, a proposal that I could support because I didn't think it reflected our one King County values beginning. And that was just the beginning. And Councilman Baldacci, Doug, made clear that it was just the start.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And indeed in the last several weeks, there's been a lot of work to make sure that we heard from the needs around King County. And this package, as amended today with strong amendment to is much more broadly I think reflective than the starter proposal, which was our starter proposal.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We put on our best creative thinking house late, late yesterday and early today. I want to extend my personal appreciation to the executive staff, to Rachel Smith, his chief of staff, to Dwight Dybul, his chief, our chief financial officer, for their creativity in helping to be quite candid, secure some funding for the shoreline historical society which was'",
        "'speaker_0': ', I thought in a jam and and needed some help. My district in the first round got 284,000 out of 28 million. Less than 1% for one ninth of the county. And I was having trouble doubling down on on that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think we've at least headed in the better direction. And we have a four culture panel here today and our executive director nominee is before us. And these issues around equity throughout the county are one of the reasons we're going to have, I think, this task force to take a look at that stuff.'",

I'm very, very excited about Councilmember Gossett, successful advocacy for the Filipino Community Association and the African-American Heritage Museum, additions to reflect our cultural diversity and needs there.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'I just got a chart right here and I'd like to show you this is what we're dealing with. And I think it's really important that everybody knows this. So District one got 1% this year to 18%. District three 7%, District 427, District five for District 611, District 79 and District 823, a District 9.3%.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So as we go forward, these need to be much more equal because every one of our districts is the same 234,000 people, and they all have the right to have the same relatively same amount of lovely culture and arts and beauty in their districts.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So as we're going forward, this is where I think we're all going to be needing to work on some equity in social justice.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I Councilmember Lambert Councilmember McDermott has. That's prompted a comment.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Yes, I would like to respond to that. While I don't have the graphic that the previous speaker just displayed, I would also point out that allocate the sites, the location where an institution exists, and there are a couple of districts that have concentrations of regional institutions that serve people across the city'",
        "'speaker_3': ', across the county, in all 39 cities across King County and in many cases around the region and around the world. And so to expect such allocations to be broken out evenly by council district, I don't feel is the equity that we should be seeking.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You know, Councilmember Gossett, I know you want in on that, but I'm going to.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Have 25 minutes to go. I think you're going to see some of these issues play out in the next two matters.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Healthy debate. Thank you, Councilmember McDermott, for the counter view. And there's probably views all in between those two. So, Mary, do you recommend we proceed with our task force or our nominee to for culture? What's makes more sense?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, what would you like to do, sir?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think given the and I know there's interest in both, but we have a number of tests for how many task force members are here. Raise your hand. Why don't. Just to respect their time. I think we can move pretty quickly through that item.'",
