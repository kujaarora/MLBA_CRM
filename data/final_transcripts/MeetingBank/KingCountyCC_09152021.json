We would then rejoin Zoom the Zoom meeting before making any decisions and taking up the motion itself.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Are there any questions on how this process would work? Becoming rather frequent. So I am hearing none are Muslim and the line is yours.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Chair. Their consuming council central. The items for a proposed motion 2020 10336 begin on each end of your packet. The applicant packet also includes the judicial ratings for each candidate, which start on page 14. A little bit about District Court.'",

And the court handles approximately 250,000 filings annually throughout the north, south, east and west divisions.

        "'speaker_1': 'In its current form, proposed motion 2020 10336 has a blank for the name of the person being appointed. A verbal amendment will be needed to insert the name of the selected appointee. Mr. Chair. That concludes my remarks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you to the questions from his name and. Thank you then. I expect each interview to take roughly 20 minutes and would ask each candidate to be prepared to provide opening and closing remarks and responses to a set series of questions from council members each to limiting your responses to 2 minutes to the opening.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Closing remarks and the questions, please. Members should have received a set of prepared suggested interview questions by email yesterday from my office, which were then reset before the meeting. Today, in accordance with past practice, I would ask for members to volunteer to ask the prepared interview questions and candidates again will be asked to respond in 2 minutes'",
        "'speaker_0': 'before the meeting. We randomly assign the order of interviews and will begin with Brian Todd, followed by David Vogel and lastly, Ivie. Vargas unless there are any questions. This would be the time to speak up. I would ask the cleric in a moment to place Mr. Vogel and Ms..'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Vargas museum waiting room. Any questions? See none. Madam Couric If you would escort Mr. Vogel and Mrs. Vargas to the waiting room, and as a reminder to members and staff, please let the clerks admit people from the waiting room and avoid the particular technology temptation to click the admit button ourselves.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Mr. Chair, do you want to sign? Who's going to ask the questions?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I will take you. Eager volunteers. I've had a particular volunteer for question five already.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Well, then, let's see. I would like to take number two then.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I will expect you to step up and ask question number two.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Then I'll be happy to make.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I didn't ask question one, Mr. Chair, unless.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You plan on doing that one. It's yours.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mr. Chair, I'm not sure if our host is having technical difficulties and I am unable to move.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Our guests to the.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Waiting room. So we are. Waiting. If you'll give us just one more moment. I apologize.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No worries whatsoever.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You have one candidate in the waiting room, Mr. Chair, and are waiting for the other person to enter and wait.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No worries whatsoever.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Both candidates are now in the waiting room.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Great. Meanwhile, I was accidentally trying to print a 92 page document instead of one page document, so I was having my own technical issues as well. With that. Mr. TODD Good morning and welcome.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good morning, Mr. Chair.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. There you might hear my printer finally printing that one page document, and I would invite you to introduce yourself and share your opening remarks.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'All right. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm sorry. Mr. Tribe and I will claim rustiness because it's been weeks since we've appointed the District Court. Let me more warmly welcome you to the interview. Thank you. And let let you know that we do appreciate the time you're spending with us today.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The time it's taken to prepare the extensive application materials and your interest in serving in district court. And we look forward to this conversation with you. And with that, I invite you to share your opening remarks.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'All right. Thank you, Mr. Chair. And likewise, I appreciate the council's time. And in doing this process, I do think it's an important process. So, Mr. Chair, my my opening statement to you this morning is more of an introduction about me and how I came to be here today with you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I know many of you were on the council five years ago. It was approximately May 2016 when I first interviewed for a position in the King County District Court to be appointed by the King County Council. I was an, you know, and an eager attorney that wanted to serve the county as a judge.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'However, at that time, I had no experience. I had not protested anywhere. I had not had the opportunity to get to experience what it means to be a judge, experience what it means to have people in front of me and experience what it means to make decisions for other people and in disputes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But when I did not get that position, I did not give up. I kept going. I kept trying. And I was thinking, you know, I need to make myself better. As far as having the skills, having the ability to be a judge and to be of the pro town.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so slowly I started reaching out to courts and actually I first reached out to Judge Walden and I took, well, a municipal court and said, hey, you guys accept pro tem, do you, training programs.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And thankfully, she.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Took me under her wing and I started programing in tech. Well, I still had a practice at that time. And so my, my availability for being a pro tem was a little bit limited. And so I looked deep down within my heart, within my soul, and said, You know what?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I want to be committed to the judiciary in the state of Washington, largely in King County. I want to be committed to them. And so I made the hard decision. Oops. All right. So I made the really, really hard decision to give up my practice, start not taking any more clients, and just focus on being a pro'",
        "'speaker_3': 'tem judge for the state of Washington and for King County. And so from tech, well, I had been approached him in federal way in Renton in the morning in SeaTac and pull up in Lake Forest Park. And it's been an amazing experience and an amazing opportunity.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And as a matter of fact, I will add that recently, a month ago, as a matter of fact, I completed the pro tem training for King County District Court. And so I really do feel as though now is the time when I am ready to step in, ready to be a judge for King County District Court judge'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that would do this council very proud and would do a very good job with being a judge in King County District Court. And so that's kind of how I got here today, started from no experience to being a very experienced, confident, assured judge and would be a good judge for King County.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And I apologize. That buzzer is, in fact, the two minute timer. I'm certainly happy to have you conclude your thought, but that that will be the indication that we've had 2 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Left in these councilmen. When I said that, I didn't know that was the time for so.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You know, quite all right. And if someone would ask the first question, please.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you for being here. Judge Todd, always great to see you. First question is, what is it about your particular skills and and interests that would make you a good fit for King County District Court? So I think the particular skills that I have is I do have the experience as a pro tem judge.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I have experience presiding over any phase of criminal proceedings from arraignments, making decisions with bond hearings, pretrial pleas, sentencings. I have experience presiding over criminal trials. I presided over a civil criminal trials in Renton. I recently presided over two criminal trials in Charlotte, actually last November during the age of COVID, when where we dealing with social distancing'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and dealing with keeping juries separate. And so I have those skills to be able to do that. I presided over civil code enforcement trials in Des Moines. And so it just I had the experience to be able to make those decisions, to be able to preside over those types of cases and to be able to do well'",
        "'speaker_3': 'in the job. As far as district court in particular, I do have mediation experience mediating cases in King County District Court. You know, so as sitting as a judge in a small claims trial or in a small claims situation, you know, I know what goes on in small claims.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I know how mediation works. And I know, you know, that's the best way for the parties to be able to do that. One other skill that I do have, I am bilingual. I can't speak Spanish. His wife conducted hearings in Spanish for clients who are appreciative of the fact that a judge speaks their language.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They feel relaxed, they feel relieved that somebody is actually there and able to really, truly hear them. And so I really do feel, as I do have the experience and the skills and the ability to step right in to work in King County District Court.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you so much. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In here. Thank you for saying that you speak Spanish because I was looking at that. But I was going to start by saying.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'What is this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mean?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. So my question is, what do you see as the most significant challenge currently facing district court and how do you think it ought to be addressed?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I think one of the biggest challenges facing District three, quite frankly, all the courts in the area is the trial backlog that they're seeing. You know, obviously, we've been on hold for the past 18 months with our trials.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I know from Judge Mahoney presented at the King County District Court program training about a month ago and indicated that the trial backlog is significant. And so, you know, I would be able to step in and I would be able to to do that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so I think but I think Councilmember, I think your question is kind of more broad. You know, how can we address that issue? I think it's focusing on, you know, prioritizing those cases that need to get to trial, get them done.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'One other thing that is also current right now is just the access to the courts. You know, the buildings are closed and in general, people can and still do need to be able to come in. And so King County District Court's actually done a really good job in moving a lot to the electronic filing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I got a really good job in trying to provide more access. So I think it's just continue to provide that access to people is one of the biggest challenges right now in this current situation. You know, structurally we have the trial backlog, but then also we have just the general access to the courts.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so it's it's what it is. It's an opportunity to really think outside the box. And, you know, we did that at the beginning of this pandemic with allowing court hearings to occur by Zoom, allowing people to appear electronically, allowing them to peer virtually.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And it's worked. And so, you know, I think that thinking outside the box led to a lot of innovation. And I think it can only continue to lead to more innovation. And so just making sure people have that access and have the ability to have their their cases heard in court, I think is the biggest challenge the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'court is currently facing as a as a structure.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'A volunteer for question three.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sure. Sure. I'll ask him.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. And welcome back. I remember meeting you some years ago and really glad to hear that you really worked hard at it and getting more experiences then it's good to see you again.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Third.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Question for you is would you please describe your efforts to implement equity and social justice.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Practices.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In the criminal justice system?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Mm hmm. One thing that I, you know, always had and always had in mind is that, you know, people come from different backgrounds. And I saw people come from different places. And so one thing that I always try to do is listen, you know, I think listening is the first thing to provide that equality and provide that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that focus for people. The other thing that we really have to remember as judges is we do all have implicit biases. And so it's always being mindful that there are those biases that I have. And I always make a conscious effort to not let them enter into my decision making.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I have been in something as simple as a traffic infraction calendar or excuse me, probably not simple, but, you know, less complex as a traffic infraction calendar. And as I have the participants come in front of me, I have thought in my head, am I making the same decision mistakes that I just made in the case prior'",
        "'speaker_3': '? Am I going to be making the same decision, you know, in the future for the exact same situation? And so it it is it's realizing the biases that we have, making sure that we're aware of them, making sure that we apply the law fairly to everyone because it should be applied fairly.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'One of the way that I've actually been part of a project to increase that type of access and to increase that inclusivity is in my position at the Office of Administrative Hearings on Chief Administrative Law. Judge Loraine Lee personally asked me to be part of a project to put together to conduct unemployment hearings in Spanish, completely in'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Spanish, Spanish speaking judge, which would be would have been myself and one other judge. And so that was an amazing opportunity for me to really, truly open up access and inclusivity and in implementing any.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We're doing it. Please, you. Welcome. Finish your thought.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'No, I was. I was saying. It's just it's been an amazing, amazing opportunity to to be part of that project. And, you know, I would look forward to doing similar type projects and keep trying this record as well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think it'd be incredible.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Dombrowski.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thanks, Mr. Chair. Hi, Brian. Sorry about that buzzer. It's what? It's what customer one right now uses on me when I ask a third question. So we we apologize for that. But I've got the fourth question here today.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's great to see you again and look through your materials. Very impressive. In our question here on number four is how do you approach judicial matters that you're not familiar with?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'One thing I've done before is I've reached out to two other judges. I was in trial presiding over a trial in Renton, and there was a somewhat novel issue that came up with jury instructions. And so we we were on a normal break.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think it might have been lunch break, but I called I called Judge Murphy Richards, and I said, you know, here's the situation. What's your what's your thought on it? You know, what what's your input on it? You know, knowing that I eventually would have to make that decision.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The other thing that I do, if something comes upon me that I'm not familiar with, is I prepare. I definitely make sure that I know what's going on, what's in front of me. One novel situation I had was with code enforcement.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I had never dealt with code enforcement in my practice. I've never had to deal with it with any clients. And so when that came in front of the judge, you know, the court had asked me to come in there previous.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I was reviewing the calendar days ahead of time and I saw what was going on. And so I went in, I looked up the city code, I looked up the enforcement of the code. I looked at the procedures for civil code enforcement, hearing, that kind of thing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So if I'm not familiar with it, I researched it, I prepare, I consult with other colleagues and get get the best information, knowing that in the end, I'm the one that gets gets to or has to make that decision.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so I'm comfortable if something comes in front of me that I'm going to wear it, I will certainly learn about it really quickly.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Awesome. Thank you so much, Brian.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Chancellor Merkel was.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Chair. Brian, again, thank you for being with us today. And I have a question for you. If you were a judge in the courtroom and an attorney clearly were to display bias in the courtroom, such as calling a female witness by her first name and her male counterpart by his surname.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'What, if anything, do you think a judge should do? And if that seems like maybe a fairly minor example of a bias. I would appreciate hearing something else that you think would be germane.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sure. So I think the the answer to that is absolutely. A judge has the obligation to step in, to maintain, you know, the proper decorum, the proper respect and the proper confidence in the judicial system. And so if I were to see an attorney exhibiting bias in that manner, probably what I would do would be to remind'",
        "'speaker_3': 'all parties that we address everybody by their last name. You know, everybody deserves the same respect that needs to be exhibited there. If there's a situation where there's anything more egregious than that, I'm not trying to disrespect it certainly is the judge's obligation to step in, to maintain control of the courtroom and to maintain that there's that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'appearance of fairness. You know, this is the court system. And in this particular one, it's the King County District Court, you know. And so we need to remember that we represent King County. We need to remember that we represent the judiciary.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We need to remember that we represent those that are neutral. And so it's absolutely the obligation of the attorney to step in, you know, if need be a conversation may need to be had with counsel on the record, with opposing counsel there as well, reminding them of the need to always show respect, not show bias if it'",
        "'speaker_3': 'continues. You know, I judges have certain powers to be able to find somebody, you know, in contempt if that's really what needs to if it's if it's that flagrant. I know that's probably taking it a little bit to the to the extreme in that manner.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But Councilman Caldwell's, I think to answer your question, absolutely. The judge has an obligation to step in. I'm confident being able to do that. I'm confident. And in knowing that, I always try to show respect and trust and confidence to every person that's in front of me.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I expect everybody that's in front of me as well to also show that respect and that confidence. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And I would ask you to please share your closing remarks with us.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'All right. Thank you. Councilman Ross, thank you so much again for this opportunity. And I really feel it. I really feel like this is the time that I'm ready to step in. I'm ready to do this. I have the experience that I have.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I've trained with the King County District Court, and I'm ready to step in and ready to do it. You know, I, I my story is not necessarily a story of struggle. My story is not a story of it being difficult to do things.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'As I was growing up, as I was going through school, as I black, that kind of thing. I think it was a little bit of the opposite. But you know what? That is what sticks in my mind every single time that I'm on the bench is that I know that where I came from is different than where'",
        "'speaker_3': 'other people came from. I have that in mind every single time, and I care. I care about the people that come in front of me. I care that they are receiving a fair hearing. I care that they feel that they've been heard.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I feel obligated to provide that justice to those people that are fair, that is fair, and that they feel that they've received a fair hearing when they come and find me. I do that every single time. You know, that's based on on where I come from, what I do, my criminal defense work, my mediation, and just kind'",
        "'speaker_3': 'of where I grew up and how I grew up. And I know that I would do the King County Council proud in being a King County District Court judge. With the experience that I have with the the drive that I have and with the desire that I have to provide fair justice to the citizens of King County'",
        "'speaker_3': 'when they come before the King County District Court. And I would ask for your appointment to this seat here this morning. Thank you, Councilmember.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much for talking with us this morning, sharing your experience and really for your interest in serving the people of King County, which are already engaged in doing and wanting to continue in this way. We appreciate that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, thank you. Yes, definitely.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Madam Couric, if I could ask you to excuse Mr. Time to the waiting room and invite Mr. Vogel to join us.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so with that announcement, I'll go ahead and turn my video off. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, Mr. Longo, let me make sure we have excused Mr. Todd. I believe we have proof. Madam Cook can confirm that for me.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Todd is in the waiting room.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you so much. Mr. Vogel, welcome. Thank you for joining us this morning. And thank you for your interest in serving on the King County District Court. We recognize the investment of time and effort it has taken, particularly to apply to prepare the rather extensive written materials, and to join us today for this conversation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And beyond that, to prepare and and be in a position to serve the people of King County in this way. So we really appreciate your interest and desire to participate in the system in this way and serve the people of the county.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we'll invite you to share your opening remarks with us.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you very much. I seek this appointment because I want to help people improve their lives and make our community safer. And because this position is well suited to my legal and personal skills, I believe I should be appointed because I've had exceptional training to be a judge because of the breadth and depth of my experience, because'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I am even tempered, respectful and fair, and because I will work very hard to be a great judge. I was a law clerk for Judge Frank Johnson in Montgomery, Alabama, who protected the constitutional rights of minorities, of immigrants, of women, and of the mentally ill at great personal risk.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'As the deputy prosecutor for more than a year in the Burian District Court, I observed Judge Gary, you regard an excellent judge on a daily basis. I would have applied for this position before, but in 2008 I moved to California to accommodate my ex's autoimmune disorder when our children were young.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Practicing in California has given me greater appreciation for the laws of Washington, where rehabilitation and restorative justice are emphasized. When my younger child started college in October 2019, I moved back to the ocean. Since my return, I have been trained and appointed as a pro-tem district court judge and I plan to pro tem regularly.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I was endorsed by the Puget Sound Police Managers Association and was rated exceptionally well qualified by the Loren Miller Bar Association, the Washington Women Lawyers and the Cardozo Society. When I submitted my application and since then, I have been endorsed by the King County Police Officers Guild and have been rated exceptionally well qualified by the Joint Asian'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Judicial Evaluation Committee and the Latina Latino Bar Association of Washington. I look forward to answering your questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you so much, Mr. Vogel. And council members. All I.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you for being here, Mr. Vogel. What is it about your particular skills and your particular interests that would make you a good fit for King County District Court?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think I have a breadth of experience that is somewhat unique. I've had 38 years as a lawyer. My experience as a person is, well, I grew up in and around New York City. I've been a cab driver.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I, I know people. I like people. And I have an even temperament. And I'm I think I'm balanced. I don't the reason I think I got the endorsement of the police officers and the police managers is that they feel I will be fair to them, just as I will be fair to defendants.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I've seen I've worked in the district court for many years, so I have a lot of experience in both criminal and civil litigation. I have had civil litigation in the federal courts as well. But I think it's that large amount of experience that I have that enables me to look at individual cases with better judgment.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I think my judgment has been refined over the years so that I can handle things better, I can handle them quickly, and I treat people well. I like people. So I think that's those are all good skills for the district court.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you very.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Much. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good morning. I have a second question. My question is, what do you see as the most significant challenge currently facing district court and how do you think it should be addressed?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, the most significant challenge for the district court, like with the superior court, is that they're overburdened with cases. It could be that new judges will need to be appointed to accommodate that. But if those judges that aren't appointed, judges just have to work harder and put in the time and work efficiently.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that's something that I've learned over the years to do. The judge that was my mentor, Judge Johnson, and in Alabama, he decided cases like the Selma to Montgomery march. He decided he allowed Rosa Parks to the back of the bus.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So he took these monumental cases. But over 25 years as a district court, he was the most efficient district court judge in the United States. And I could use him as an example for how to do things efficiently.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think in the morning he'd have a stack of papers like this on his desk. By the end of the day, it was cleared out. And so I do think that is the the volume of cases. That is the most significant challenge.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There are certainly other challenges as well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah. What are those?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, another challenge would be to know.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm sorry. That was a member of the public, not a member of the council. I would ask that members of the public. We're certainly here to observe the public meeting, remain on mute, not participate in the meeting. Mr. Vocalist, if you would concluded with your question, that's.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, that's that's fine. But if, if council member Lambert would like to hear an answer to that, I think that there are other challenges and one of them is participation by minorities in the court system. I think that a lot of people are scared by the court system and I think that by being respectful and fair, you'",
        "'speaker_2': 'can take a lot away, a lot of that fear. So that's one of the things that I intend to do.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Belge.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much. Nice to meet you. And we thank you for being here today. The third question from us is, please describe your efforts to implement equity and social justice practices in our criminal legal system.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'My practice my legal practice over the years has been doing that. I've taken a lot of pro-bono cases. I've worked for a lot of cases where I reduced my fees so that people could afford to hire me. I had a case recently where my client was in prison for 29 years, since he was 19 years old.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Juan Martinez and. His sister could not afford to hire me. She said, I have 1500 dollars. That's all I can afford. I said, That's fine. And I met with him once a month for 13 months before his parole hearing, and I learned as much from one as I did.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'He learning from me. And by the time we got to that parole hearing, he was magnificent. He just was great. And he was paroled. And we still keep in touch. But that's that's by having lawyers do cases for pro bono and for diminished fees.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think that's that's important. Also, if I don't know an area of law, I will try to find someone who does know that and make referrals. So much of my time on the phone is giving free advice to people and pointing them in the right direction to get help.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You're welcome. Do you have other questions?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We do.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Councilmember guideline. When I cued up Mr. Jack. David Wright, Tomasky County. How are you? I've got the fourth question here and that is and you just touched on it briefly there in your last answer, but speed up to expand upon it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But the question is how do you approach judicial matters with which you're unfamiliar?'",
        "'speaker_2': '30 I don't think that one should try to rule by the seat of one's pants. If I don't know a subject, then I will go home and I will learn it and then I'll rule on it. I'll put it over.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'll continue a case if I don't feel comfortable making a ruling. I've been a quick study through my legal career. I've done medical malpractise cases in very difficult areas of medicine, and I don't know those areas, but I learn them and I work with experts and you keep an open mind and you don't think you don't act'",
        "'speaker_2': 'as if you know something when you don't know something. So I think humility comes into play and a willingness to work hard and learn. And I have that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Great. Thank you so much.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You're very welcome.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thanks for your interest in serving. Sure.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Member Wells.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Chair. David, also pleased to have you with us today. And my question has to do with bias. If in your courtroom, an attorney were to clearly display bias, such as calling a female witness by your first name and her male counterpart by his surname.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Surname. What, if anything, do you believe a judge should do? And there might be some examples you can think of to that may be even more challenging.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, I can think of a great example of how a judge handled that, and that was Judge Johnson in Montgomery, Alabama, when it was routine for people to treat other people disrespectfully in court. And there was a case involving a black woman who is the plaintiff and the defense attorney who was distinguished, powerful defense attorney, kept referring'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to her by her first name. And what Judge Johnson did is he banged his gavel and he said, Counsel, unless you are unfamiliar terms with this witness, you will address her as ma'am. And being on familiar terms with a black woman at that time was not something that was taken lightly.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think Chambers to meet with an attorney in chambers and caution an attorney is is a good way of approaching that. You wouldn't want an ex party communication, but, you know, you could do that and not discuss the case.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So there I think setting a good example, you know, of treating everyone the same is helpful. And I don't think it's necessary to come down very hard on people, you know, and embarrass them publicly. But sometimes it is.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think I would take, you know, lesser measures if I can. But treating people disrespectfully in my court is not something that I will tolerate.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You're welcome.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And with that, I would invite you to share your closing remarks with us.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Well, thank you. During my 38 years practicing law, I have helped many people through crisis. People have been injured through the fault of others. People who are suffering from alcohol or drug addiction. People who are mentally ill.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'People who have been the victims of crime. And people who have been accused of crimes. I've developed a broad and balanced perspective on the criminal and civil justice systems, and I want to use this perspective and the knowledge I have gained over the years as a district court judge.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I want to provide a role model by treating everyone who comes into my court respectfully and fairly. I will work hard to handle my cases carefully and efficiently. Because justice delayed is justice denied. I will work with court staff and with other judges to maintain and improve our courts.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I I'm excited to work in the community court system, which can enable defendants to acquire the tools they need to empower themselves. I want to be a district court judge because I like people and I can help many people in this very busy court.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I believe that in most cases, rehabilitation and restorative justice can make society safer, and it is in the District Court with the assistance of the probation department that we can help people get the services they need for rehabilitation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you for your time and your consideration.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much, Mr. Vogl, for sharing with us your experience and skills that you would bring to King County District Court for the time you spent with us today and again, the time it takes to apply, and most importantly, your interest in serving in this role of the people of King County.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm going to ask the clerk to please excuse Mr. Vogel back to the waiting room and invite Ms.. Vargus to join us.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I see Miss Vargas with this. I believe that Mr. Vogel is in the waiting room.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And is correct. Mr. Chairman.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Ms.. Vargas, welcome. And thank you for not only joining us today, but for your interest in Serbian District Court. The service itself, the role itself is vital in our community and the time it takes to apply.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Not only joining us for a conversation this morning, but to prepare the extensive application materials is an investment as well for all of that interest and desire to serve, I want to thank you and offer our appreciation and tell you how much how much we look forward to a conversation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Some questions and learn more about you in this interview. I mean, with that, I would invite you to share your opening remarks with us.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you so much for that. My name is either Vargas and thank you so much for giving the opportunity to talk to us today about who I am and why you should consider me for the vacant position on the District Court bench.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'As you have seen from my materials, I have been a public servant for over 17 years in this King County community, and I want to continue to be a public servant for this community in the role of a judge.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I'm very dedicated and loyal to King County specifically because King County has been the community that has welcomed me and nurture me to become the person that I am today. When I arrived as an 18 year old, I was I didn't know who I was, what I was capable of, and what the future held in store'",
        "'speaker_1': 'for me. And King County. Members of this community nurtured me to help me see myself as a smart, academic, scholar, leader, lawyer, supervisor and attorney, managing attorney of over 100 people. In perfect preparation for my interview today and to even be considered for this position, I thought it was important to put myself to the test to figure'",
        "'speaker_1': 'out, can I really do this job? Can I sit in judgment of other people and can I do so responsibly and ethically? And so I started to pro-tem. And in those experiences, along with my experiences as a public defender, what I've come to know is that members of this community need lawyers and judges who understand the challenges'",
        "'speaker_1': 'they face every day, the challenges that make their lives difficult, and the challenges that make their lives rewarding. And though it's been a bit of a struggle as a child to have experienced these experiences, I talk about them today because they're what framed my viewpoint as to what kind of a decision maker I'll be.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's important we have judges that understand poverty, that understand what it feels like to be a foreigner, what it what racism feels like, what sexism feels like. I've experienced those things. What be knocking. It feels like learning English as a second language.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Having a family member with addiction, having a family member has been in the and unfortunately domestic violence as well. And these experiences were difficult, but they also were important because they gave me the framework from which to make thoughtful and inclusive decisions that will impact members of our community.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's a huge responsibility to sit in judgment and make decisions about people coming before you every day. Our community needs judges who understand these challenges, so this will have insight into the lives of the members of this community so that thoughtful and inclusive decisions are made.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I didn't come to this position with lawyer, family members or judges. I've paid my own path and I've been very proud of what I've been able to accomplish. And I worked hard to build a solid reputation in this legal community as being an open and thoughtful advocate and person, a hardworking and dedicated public servant, and a person'",
        "'speaker_1': 'who is deeply committed to this community and strongly in this work.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I said that BlueBell was the two minute mark, if I'm sorry, if I could ask you to conclude your thoughts. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I because of the strong reputation, I enjoy the support of prosecutors and defense alike, lawyers from the private bar, state leaders, nonprofit leaders, community leaders, and current and retired district court and superior court judges. If appointed, I will work hard every day to be a thoughtful decision maker and someone who protects the safety of this community'",
        "'speaker_0': '. Thank you. Council members are hereby. Thank you so much.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'For being here, Ms.. Vargas. What is it about your particular skills and your particular interests that would make you a good fit for King County District Court?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think I touched on it in my opening statement, but basically having that first, first hand experience as to what poverty feels like, what not having the resources you need to live a life without many challenges is an important perspective that currently is not reflected on the District Court bench.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I am a person that understands what it what it feels like to not speak English as a first language and to have to figure out who you are on your own, and to not have people in your family that can help you pay your way through life.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that has made me strong. And that's going to make me a thoughtful decision maker capable of sitting on the bench in a way that is inclusive but also protective of our community. Because I'm very, as a parent, interested in making sure that Canton remains safe for all.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. I have the next question. Thank you for being here. My question is, what is this? What do you see as the most significant challenge currently facing district court? And how do you think it should be addressed?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, clearly, I think that this is the most challenging time dealing with a global health pandemic has been has made us all look at how we deliver justice in courtrooms every day. And it's very clear that we need to clear the backlog that exists in our current dockets.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think what the court is currently doing makes a whole lot of sense, which is doing mitigation by mail, also doing infraction calendars via Zoom and really dedicating the majority of our resources to people facing loss of liberty and loss of, you know, money and other things that come along with having hearings in court.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think it's going to take a bench of judges who are willing to work together to get cases tried. I certainly would open myself up to do everything I can to help people have their day in court in a timely way.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I would look forward to working with this counsel to come up with strategies to to to move forward on that. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's a memorable duty.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Chair, and welcome. It's very nice to meet you and I'm glad that you're.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Expressing interest in this position. Our third question is please describe your efforts to implement equity and social justice practices in our criminal legal system. Well, I'm very fortunate to be a leader in King County, currently in my my position and in my in my role as a leader.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think what's most important is hiring diverse lawyers, hiring diverse staff, so that members of our community who need our services have lawyers that understand their experiences and understand the challenges that they face every single day. It's about talking about issues of racial justice.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'As a leader in my in my own community, I have led those conversations about how do we achieve equity, how how do we achieve justice within our own working communities? It's about showing up in community for community events and showing up as a leader.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's about mentorship. It's about community service. It's about, you know, making your ideals, talking about your ideals openly and encouraging that conversation. But it's also about welcoming others into the conversation and not being off putting, being accusatory. It's about inviting the conversation because that's where the growth happens and that's where, you know, we all belong.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We all have a role. And we we should all work together to help make this community inclusive for everyone. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Council member, Dan Belsky.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Mr. Chair, and I thank you so much for being here, and thank you for your current service to King County and our Department of Public Defense. You have a big job there. We appreciate you. I have the fourth question and it's a fairly straightforward one.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's how do you approach judicial matters with which you're unfamiliar?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Education and not making impulsive decisions. I don't think a judge should be making decisions off the cuff. There are very important rights at stake for everyone, for victims, for defendants, for everyone. We all deserve judicial decision makers that are thoughtful and careful and measured.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We do not need people on the bench that just decide off the cuff. And so if I don't know something, I'm going to take time to educate myself because a wrong decision is never worth it. It's always best to think things through carefully before deciding.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Council member, Lambert.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'A thinking coalesce, but do.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You're right.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. And so. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you very much for being with us today. I have a question relating to bias in the courtroom. If an attorney before you in the courtroom work to clearly display bias in your view.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'An example could be calling a female witness by her first name and calling her male counterpart by his surname. What, if anything, would you do? Or do you believe that a judge should do? And you can come up with other examples as well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Well, Judge is responsible for what occurs in your work, and a judge is responsible for ensuring that equity is always at the forefront. And we all play a role in ensuring that bias doesn't play a part in what happens.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But it does happen. I've been on my own. I've experienced it myself. And I always approach it from a perspective of, you know, seeing the good in the other person and understanding that a thoughtful conversation with them is probably going to be the best way to address it, but also calling it out and naming it and making'",
        "'speaker_1': 'sure that it doesn't continue. I don't believe that most people are intentionally trying to be offensive, and I think that we have to recognize our humanity and recognize each other's intent and work with one another. Obviously, if it if it goes to the point of impacting justice and impacting a client or impacting someone, I would most definitely'",
        "'speaker_1': 'put a stop to it by addressing it head on. I think that's important because if we allow things like that to happen, it's a tacit agreement and approval of it and that that would not be okay with me.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Judges are leaders and I would act with leadership in those in those instances. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that concludes our prepared questions. We invite you to share your concluding remarks with us.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. I'm so sorry. I'm a little embarrassed and got emotional in the beginning. I'll try not to. As well. Appointing me to the bench would mean that you're going to get a dedicated public servant, that you're going to get someone who's dedicated to meeting thoughtful and inclusive decisions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That you were going to get a public servant that is dedicated to treating all litigants with respect and that will uphold the law and our constitutional protections. I understand that I would carry an enormous responsibility as a judge to act and make decisions that are viewed from the lens of equity, that are grounded in equity and understanding'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that the decisions I make on a daily basis will impact people's lives. I will show up to the job with the goal of preserving and protecting our constitutional freedoms. My courtroom will be one where people are treated thoughtfully with respect and where they will be heard.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I thank you for your time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much for joining us today. As I friend beginning for taking the time to prepare for the conversation and the written materials and for your current and future service to the people of King County.

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. We've concluded the three interviews for the Southwest District Court position in King County, and I believe I'm going to suggest we would like a few minutes in executive session.
