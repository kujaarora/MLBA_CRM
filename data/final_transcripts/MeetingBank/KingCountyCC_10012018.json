    "AN ORDINANCE authorizing a supplemental appropriation of $143,000,000 from the water quality revenue bond fund; and amending the 2017-2018 Biennial Budget Ordinance, Ordinance 18409, Section 131, as amended.": [
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Can anybody hear me okay? All right. So this is 2014 for this new supplemental budget of $10.3 billion. And just by way of background, you call that the budget for the wastewater treatment division is focused on capital projects, which is the basis of the projects.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'How much does it cost to promote projects? The 2019 rate proposal included a proposed direction for use of an incremental funding $143 million that would be used to avoid expenditure on new bond funds issuance in the year 2020.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They would have been helped actually prove that reputation. It's quite a proven. In the meantime, the Piper Jaffray made recommendations to use that money in a different way. They had recommended that because noting that there are enough people to say about $21 billion, I think it recommended to use that money to actually purchase new bonds and to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'not use the money to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'On Capitol. Okay. So I'll cut you off.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah. Yeah. So. So inside. The initial proposal can be used on unemployed $2 million and all the way you could get it back on $125,000. New $7.3 million Million. To avoid the expenditure on capital projects in future years 2018, 2019 and 2020.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The expectation was that money was going to be used to avoid expenditures on capital budget. What would be what is now being proposed, however, is to actually to issue new bonds instead of. Instead of. In the amount of $1.3 million as a way to save basically about $21 million.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That would come because, as you said, it's going to go instead of the issuance of. The proper use of capital funds must be more. Before joining the team expenditures in 2018 20. 2028. One thing to do is, is issue bonds a low interest rate and that interest rates meetings with the end result contained.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'About $1 billion. I'm looking for something between now and 23 to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So it's something that's the both business, the supplemental budget appropriation that we would. That saved us $41 million. High interest savings. Should we be getting out of the encampment wastewater treatment division and the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We're going to be need to help you the questions. He likes Rico. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good morning. My name is Rochelle and we play together and we serve as the special advisory.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I stay for the. What did.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They say growing up so surprised.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'When the industry had. But with health industry analyzing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Their interest rates, it seem.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right now you do have the county wastewater treatment plant outstanding. Trace 5 to 5 and a half percent range. And so that is something where you're able to fund without the proposal.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Plus we used to pay off those bonds.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Instead he would end up issuing new. To find out of the program. They have an interest.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In the neighborhood of 4% of. Exactly. Cash to be applied to 60,085. One of the things we were trying to. Currently 36. So there.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Will be three productions that started in.'",
        "'speaker_3': '2006. Well, the rates are already.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To be 2020. All these savings.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And they're not just making. This thing started sometime in the 1920s to go on for about a dozen. And there's a chart of 41 apartments here.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah. You see it chart. I see the microphones are on the chart on page up. Page 41 of your materials does have a column that describes rate impact. And so you'll see that, that the rate impact ranges as low as two $0.02 and as high as $0.23 between now and 2032.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's against what were expected rates. So reduced against the rates that you've seen projected in the rate rate proposal for that came out in June of this year. So there are reductions in in not the not the absolute number, but in terms of what was expected, what was projected.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'To I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Customer Biology Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'm looking at this chart. What it shows is the rate impact, which I believe would be the difference between our current rate, which I'm assuming is fixed, and a projection of what we think the rate will be into the future.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Is that what that is?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. So you recall it during the discussion about the the the the rate the sewer rate for 2019 that we provided. You and I have numbers available, I believe, provided you the numbers as to what the proposed rates were expected rates were going to be over the next 10 to 15 years.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'These are the rate impact that just listed here is a reduced reduced against that amount against the sewer rates.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Not not the interest rates.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'No. Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'These same words, I mean, two different things.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But this column is talking about the sewer rate.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's correct. So it's good.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Point to me where the analysis is that we can I want to understand how we think we're going to save money, because I'm with Councilmember Lambert. It seems to me that rates are going up and it seems to me that we're projecting that when we bond in the future, it will remain a lower rate than the bonds'",
        "'speaker_2': 'we issued in the past. So how does that work?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So the rates, I guess maybe two things on that front. Interest rates that have been getting the headlines that as far as interest rates going up, that has been primarily due to the Federal Reserve actions. And what they're doing is they're raising short term interest rates and that actually ends up helping you from the standpoint of paying'",
        "'speaker_3': 'off this debt. So it's something where, as Councilmember Dombrowski noted, this is a defeasance where you actually end up setting aside the funds and you end up paying off those bonds in three years. So 2022 is the final year.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You would end up paying those off. So you would be investing those funds for the next three years. So that actually helps the cost of the DEFEASANCE. And one of the reasons why we ended up making the recommendation at this point is because the Federal Reserve has raised rates basically three times since the last since the March'",
        "'speaker_3': ', June and September. And that ends up helping the investment rate that you would end up getting between now and 2022. The long term interest rates that you're talking about as far as those have not moved very much at all.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And that's one where you would actually be borrowing for your new capital program at those long term interest rates and would be doing so within the next hour. Anticipation is that we'll be back to you in November with borrowing for we do the defeasance where we'd end up paying off your existing bonds at those higher interest rates'",
        "'speaker_3': '. And we do that sometime in October. We would actually come back in November with locked in interest rates for long term borrowing. And those long term rates actually haven't moved very much at all. Those have been very, very, very stable.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so that's where you end up having that tradeoff, where the headlines certainly are interest rates are rising, but that is on the short term and that's where it actually it's kind of counterintuitive, but it actually helps the defeasance because in that transaction, you're an investor, right?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And you want the rate to be as high as possible. So that actually helps you, right?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I get it. So in the short term, our money is making more in the bank than it is paying off the debt. In the long term, we're going to be able to borrow at more fair and more favorable rates.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so in the entirety of that calculation means that we have $21 million more to spend on capital projects in the long term.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That is exactly right.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Are you feeling very confident about that? This is a bit of a state of events is going to continue this way.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, there is there I think there is a reason. It says approximately 21 million right now. It certainly looks like it's going to be a substantial amount of money, but it will not be locked in until that the borrowing takes place in November.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So but are you feeling confident?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We're feeling fairly confident, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Customer reality and the prior plan had us just using these funds, the settlement funds, to pay cash for capital projects. Right, exactly. So but you're saying because the short term rates have gone up, it makes more sense to invest those dollars and then retire our high interest debt that's maturing here in the short term.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then. Issue. Cheaper, long term debt. Even through all that, it makes more sense than paying cash somehow.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. Yes. Because you have those higher and straight bonds still out. And if you didn't.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Have those, then we should pay cash.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Exactly. If you do not have those, then there would be no, I guess, opportunity to reduce your overall debt service.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'All right. Two other members have questions, council member calls. Would you like to put this before us for approval?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chair. And I move post. Ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Think you're Mike? We're working on.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So they've got to join.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'm a proposed ordinance number 2018 0424.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'All right, that's before us saying no further questions or debate the critical call the room.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. Chair. Councilmember Balaji Councilmember Dunn. Councilmember Gossett. Councilmember Colwell. Councilmember Lambert. Councilmember McDermott. Councilmember of the Grove. Councilmember von Richter. Mr. Chair, hi, Mr. Chair of the Board of seven A's, no no's to excused.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'All right. We've given a do pass recommendation to that. Should we expedite that and can we do?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah, I should note that there actually has been a little bit of movement in interest rates in the last couple of days, and so that actually reduced the amount that we were expecting. There's going to be 20 million instead of 21 million.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So it's about interest rate environment. And so it would make sense to expedite this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Can we expedite to this afternoon or do we.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The better off you need.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The better off to relieve the committee. Okay. And do we want to do that?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In my communications with the agency, they have always expressed interest in moving it as quickly as possible. I should note that we had actually thought this was going to be acted on earlier. And so they urged me to encourage you to to move as rapidly as possible.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. So our counsel, Mr. Hoover, is suggesting that procedurally it might be better to let this sit in committee and then this afternoon move to relieve the committee and take action because of our agenda publication and things like that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And is there any problem from a bonding perspective with respect to notice?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And there is.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'No. All right. You would.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You would.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'All right. That's all right, Mike.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sorry, Mike Hoover, counsel for the council. There would not be a notice problem, but you would need to take testimony this afternoon if you chose to do that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'All right. Well, now that I've called a vote, I have not announced the results. But where do we stand here? We want to leave it in committee.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You you could just set it down for now and just move on to the next item. With gender, you can't actually report it out. We could suspend the rules. There's another way we could do it. If you want to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If you want to put this down for a minute, we could. Let me take a look at some things. We come back with the best way to get you where you need to be. So you could just you could just move that it hold its place on today's agenda in the committee and then move on to the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'next item.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'All right. Councilmember Caldwell's, does that meet with your approval? Would you make that motion.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'During the week to make a motion in Spain? Make do we need to make a motion to set it down?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think the chair could just say, you know, with you know, without objection.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Unless there's objection, will lay this item here on the table. If subject to further action, the committee or the full council this afternoon, see what you've done. Thanks for being here and for helping us understand this. Mike, thank you very much for thank you for your work on it.'"

Historically speaking, we've had human resources or personnel offices in each department, and we would call them and they would give us direct hands on information about openings or whatever it is we wanted'",
        "'speaker_5': 'to have. How is it going to be better having a centralized personnel and human resources department, in your opinion?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, I think that part of the issue is that every department has a different funding structure, so some of them have more robust H.R. teams than others. Standing up a department and having the H.R. manager for each one of those departments report directly to me ensures we're having some consistency of practice, investigations, hiring sort of protocol, and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'then we're better able across the county to sort of lean and be more efficient in how we do the hiring and training of our workforce.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Would you characterize that as the major reason for the consolidation into a single department?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think it's twofold. One is the ESG plan and sort of the work that we're getting ready to do throughout the county and institutionalizing some of that work. We're going to be coming back to you next year with updated code and personnel guidelines and really looking at our practices across the board for how we manage the workforce'",
        "'speaker_3': ', consolidating some of those, making it cleaner and clearer for our employees and what their practices.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'For our listening audience. Can you tell us what ESG means and what you mean by updating it in a more comprehensive manner?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think so. It stands for equity and social justice, and it is the county's commitment to provide opportunities for all of our citizens in an equitable way. And there are a lot of practices that we're doing throughout the workforce for that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'One of the budget proposals before you is also a central role in my office to work with the recruiters throughout the county to make sure that we're reaching out to the right communities and spending some time doing some quality recruitment for all of the positions.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We hire about 1200 employees every year. So we do have a lot of movement within our ranks as well.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And in terms of the racial makeup of our county work force, Howard won. Find out how the last couple of years we've been doing in each department or overall in terms of maintenance and have numbers of employees from various people of color communities.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That is a benchmark we're tracking. Tracking it by department down to work group for the last few years. We can provide that information.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. Chair. And congratulations on your appointment. J Thank you. I question I have is you really have a stellar long background experience in the county. I'm sure you know it inside and out, but your experience has mainly been in roads and parks, and now this is a new challenge, new policy area for you or not'",
        "'speaker_2': 'policy, but just new area for you. And I have no doubt you can do it and have been doing it well. But I was looking at your background and you have a B.A. in social work and in in psychology, two different ones, which may be really more suitable to this new endeavor that you're undertaking.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I'd just like to hear a little bit more about what you are bringing to this role, what you'd like to accomplish, given that you don't have the specific background in human resources.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think for me, part of it is having been a long term county employee and understanding how things work within the county and how you can get something done, standing up a department, going from a division to a department, sort of the framework around that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We've done some things like looking at how we provide support to work groups in crisis and really emphasizing some of what we're able to provide in a more consistent way. I think what I bring personally in here is just the ability to create an organization that can be functional, remove some of the roadblocks, have some of the'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. Chair. And Jay, congratulations. And thank you for being willing. This is one of the challenging roles in King County government. We we can't do much of what we do without our people. And so making sure we have the right people in the right place with the right training is critically important.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'One of the interesting things about King County is the way it's changed over the years. There was a centralized department, then it was expanded to put the h.r. Managers in the operating departments. And now we're talking about sort of tying them close more closely back to the central department.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I, i see the I see the evolution there. It's a service to the departments and making sure their needs are being met and we're being responsive in h.r. To the department. At the same time, you want to have standards and performance metrics that are consistent.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'How are you going to balance that? That tension of making sure that the departments are getting what they need. And let me just give you an example. Some of the departments are really struggling with hiring and how to fill all the vacancies that we have to do these critical jobs.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'How do how do we help departments to have a quick, efficient and yet effective hiring process address sets out and address the the things that are stopping us from being able to hire the people we need and and do all that with a more centralized focus.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Just as an example, you can pick a different example if that one doesn't work for you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And that's a good one. There's quite a challenge that we're having in some circles too, and I think so. Every department has a senior manager who's been doing this for a long time. They've risen through the ranks. They've got great experience that is working as a kitchen cabinet to some degree with folks within H.R. to really look'",
        "'speaker_3': 'at the policies, the barriers, what we're doing. They've got some great ideas and tapping into this group in a dynamic way to start to address some of these things. There are different needs for recruitment. It's hard to find jail guards on a job as officers.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Let me just stop you right there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes, correctional corrections officers.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Thank you. First day on the job. I know you're newbie.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I got working on my dialog here, so. And finding appropriate ones for this market in the housing market, where we are, what that looks like and it's a stressful job and what can we do to sort of help the stressors that are around there to make sure that the workforce that's there can have productive careers as well'",
        "'speaker_3': 'as get more folks in to help deal with the timing issues. There's that's a really good example of an area we need to focus on and sort of look at practices nationwide as well as things that we could do to stand up.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We have a lot of folks going out from some of the departments to recruiting events, having a more comprehensive recruiting process for all the places we have. Needs, I think will make a big difference as we stand up the department.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. And anything that we can do to help with these challenges, it's they're really critical to the county providing services to the public. So we're here to try to help. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Councilmember actually, Councilmember Lambert.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. Yes. So and following up with the last question, the process is of hiring is so long and cumbersome that sometimes some of the best candidates drop out. So making sure that we can be nimble is going to be a really big deal.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So thank you. What my question is, is and first of all, I'd like to thank you. I have already seen some of your good work in the fact that when we had an employee die in my office, not in my office, in the hospital, but an employee of my office, I guess a better one.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Your counseling, your planning transition and your grief counseling for our team and the entire floor was very, very helpful. So thank you for all the good work that went into that. It was it was not easy. So thank you for helping you make it easier.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'My question is the session planning? Some people are getting older. I don't know why they do that, but some people are. So how are we going to deal with that? When you look at the average age of people in various departments, how are we going to maybe overlap?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Because I my fear is that a lot of really amazing tricks than ideas. Then history is walking out the door and how do we make sure that there's some way of tapping into that other than telling them, you can't leave ever.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There's a few that we should say that to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, I know.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I do think, you know, one of the things in the code that will be coming back to you in the personnel guidelines would be an inability to let us double slot people for a few months and have some transition time.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We're also been looking at succession. Planning at the highest level. So Whitney Abrams and I have been meeting with the department directors and talking about their timelines and sort of in the appointed ranks. How are we doing all the way down through the agencies?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We also have a changing workforce and we're tracking some of that. The way we do work is changing and evolving. So how many people you need in different areas varies and how do we still make a commitment to retool, retrain and help those people be successful in other areas as they go?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We have one of the things that I'll say from Rhodes, we have some very senior people know every crack of every roadway and where to go, when and how that knowledge gets passed on to the betterment of the citizens is also a key part of what we look at as we pass down that knowledge.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I, I also when you think about roads, water inland, Tom being, I don't know, just historic roads or she retired, you know.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I don't know.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Well, anyway, Tom Beam knew every inch of every river in his entire county. And you could just say this one is kind of over here and has a band. Oh, that must be over here at milepost such and such.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And, and, and I'm like, oh, my gosh. So when you have employees like that, it's really hard to lose them. So ah, and he may still be here. I think he retired, but I'm not sure. So I really like the idea, the overlap.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And it's not possible to just hand the baton over to somebody and say, Here's my 30 years of experience, good luck without walking alongside that person. So thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'All right. Thank you. Anything else? All right. Councilmember COLAs, would you be willing to put the motion before us?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I move. Propose motion number 2018 0398 confirming the executive's appointment of Jay Osborne as the director of the King County Department of Human Resources.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's before a seminal column. Councilmember Lambert.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Have had the opportunity to work with Mr. Osborne as he was in Rhodes. And I'd just like to say a couple of things. There are many things to respect about him. One is he's very levelheaded. He sees things in a very practical way.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'He can deal with controversial issues and be the person that just can handle all the different things and get people together. He's knowledgeable on so many different areas and if you look in this room to all his coworkers are here to support him.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You don't see their pompoms, but you see their smiles. They are here because he was really good to work with. The only thing that I would complain about is he's not allowed us to clone him. I think we could use a lot more just like him.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But until then, I'm really glad that we have him where he is. Thank you, Mr. Chair.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Anything else? All right, we have an amendment. Councilman Coles, would you move the amendment? The amendment inserts the ordinance number that created the Department of Human Resources. It's Amendment One.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. Chair. I move Amendment one.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'All in favor. Say I, I. And he opposed. All right, turn to the underlying ordinance as amended, and we'll call the roll.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. Chair. Councilmember Belge, Councilmember Dunn. Councilmember Gossett, I. Councilmember Colwell, I. Councilmember Lambert, hi. Councilmember McDermott, Councilmember of the girl. Councilmember one right there. Mr. Chair. Hi, Mr. Chair. The vote is eight eyes, no no's, one excuse.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. We've given a unanimous do pass recommendation to you, J and four. This ordinance will expedite it, and I think we can place it on the consent agenda. Our council is telling me that that means it'll be on next Monday's agenda, which I guess makes some sense because.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Congratulations and thank you. Thank you all for being here and for your work for King County. All right. That takes care of our action items today. We have two briefings, one on the solid waste comprehensive plan update the other on the 2016 to 22 Equity and Social Justice Strategic Plan.'"
