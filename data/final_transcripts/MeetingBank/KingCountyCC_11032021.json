It is my hope that through this interview you'll get to know me as a person as well, see all the skills and the attributes I can bring to the bench if appointed.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So a little bit about me. I am a product of chain migration and have longstanding roots here in America and in King County, Washington. My great grandfather immigrated from the Philippines and settled here in Seattle in 1924, and as an Asian man, he suffered discrimination and segregation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yet he persevered. He remained hopeful that his family would still live a better life despite all that he had been through. And fast forward 50 years later, two generations as well. And I was graduating from federal high school.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And after college and graduating law school, I returned home to South King County with my husband and son in 2004, where I have lived ever since. And I am forever grateful for my family and all their sacrifices that they have given me, as well as all the opportunities that I've received working at the King County Prosecutor's Office'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that have led me to sit before you all today. I am seeking a judicial appointment because I have demonstrated commitment to public service and the experiences I have acquired through the years that will benefit the bench. And I believe that the court has the ability to change lives.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It can be a place where victim voices can be heard and offenders can be held accountable. It can also be a place where anyone can have equal access to the process in both the civil and criminal realm and be treated fairly and where needs are met.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And simply put, I want to be a part of that. In being a King County prosecuting attorney for the last 15 years has been an invaluable preparation for me to do this work. I've been able to participate in the traditional criminal prosecution model, but I've also had the ability to have cases go through the therapeutic and alternative'",
        "'speaker_1': 'to traditional prosecution. For example, I've partnered with the Courts and Department of Public Defense in community courts and have developed diversion programs wave justice a criminal justice system altogether. These experiences have inspired me to seek an appointment to help grow these alternatives and therapeutic programs and to ensure that those that do come in contact with the courts'",
        "'speaker_1': 'are treated with compassion, patience and respect so that disproportionality does not result, but rather justice that reflects equity and fairness. Thank you again and I look forward to answering all your questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you so much, Howard. First question. Councilmember Bell, did you? Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Chair. And thank you so much for being here and putting yourself out for this opportunity. It's really great to have strong candidates. We appreciate all the effort you put into it. The question is, would you please describe an ideal district court judge?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, an ideal district court judge, I think, is one that is compassionate, one that listens and one that is able to incorporate all of the knowledge through the legal and the legal system, as well as concepts of equity and social justice to inform their decisions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think it's important for that ideal candidate to have those things because it is only through that knowledge and that experience that just outcomes can be made and that equitable outcomes can be made. And frankly, all of the different types of people that come before the court, particularly in district court.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right. I mean, there are it's your everyday folks, your your cousins, your aunts, your pastors, all of those people that are seeking to have their needs fulfilled need to be heard and have to be in front of someone who is willing to listen, to be compassionate, and also willing to make decisions that are based on fairness and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'in equity. So that would be my hope if I were appointed that I would fulfill those those characteristics. And Q.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you so much, colleagues. Question to. Councilmember McDermott. Yes. Thank you so much. Please describe your efforts to implement anti-racist equity and social justice practices in the legal system. And a second part, if I might. What is one change do you think the district court can take to move the institution in this direction?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sure.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So this thread your efforts to implement an anti-racist equity and social justice practices in the legal system. And one change you think this report could make the institution in that direction.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Well, as a prosecutor and what I'm doing now is that I, I, I am the chair of the district court unit for the prosecutor's office. And so I am the introductory unit for all the newest and youngest attorneys that come through our doors.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so part of my function, and in fact, a very important part of my function is teaching them how to pursue justice and how to come to just resolutions, cases that they handle. And one of the things that is part of the training module and something that I take extremely seriously is encouraging and promoting and teaching each'",
        "'speaker_1': 'of them, you know, equity and social justice concept concepts. And that's through their training, that's through close, but also having one on one conversations about all of the cases that they are seeking to resolve and asking them about.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Tell me more about who is coming before you and who is this individual that's in charge. Tell me about their background to the extent that you can. And in that way, when we're talking about a person as a whole, we're able to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Look at them, not just with the incident that has come before us, but also what may have brought them to this to the criminal justice system. And in doing so, we're also having to take into consideration the history of who we are as prosecutors, the authority that we have.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And the we're making these decisions, particularly as it relates to communities of color and how disproportionality has, I guess. Resulted at times because of our lack of awareness. And so I think in for us and for prosecutors specifically, it is super important that we learn these concepts so that when we do make decisions that they are based'",
        "'speaker_1': 'in equity and knowledge and so that we can be proactively anti-racist in doing so, knowing that our decisions have such great impacts on individuals. So that's one thing. The other thing, Councilmember McDermott, is what can the courts do to do to change that?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, I think just as prosecutors and I have made collective decisions and learning all of these concepts, so must each of the judges. Just because we are we put on a robe doesn't include somehow that that institutional knowledge or that historical knowledge.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We all have to learn how our power and position has affected communities of color. And when we learn those things, I think we're able to make more compassionate and more reasonable and, frankly, more equitable decisions. And if each and every one of us are committed to learning these concepts and learning how our power and decisions can affect'",
        "'speaker_1': 'communities of color, particularly then I think we will we will over time become less, less, less racist. And, you know, and and we'll have results that are much more equitable and fair to all of those that come before us.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Question three. I have a volunteer question for somebody to be willing to ask. Question three.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I can ask both of you like.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Go ahead, please. Thank you, Councilmember Lambert.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You're welcome. Okay. Are there any aspects of this role where you feel the need to grow in your knowledge or understanding in an area of the law, policies, procedures, courtroom management or otherwise? How do you approach mastering important and familiar issues like this?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. And that's actually a great question. Obviously, as you've seen in my material, my focus and my experience has primarily been in the criminal realm. So I'm really looking forward to learning the civil parts and the civil practice in district court because it's a big one, you know, through small claims and even in infractions, which I'",
        "'speaker_1': 'have some experience in. But certainly all of the more civil aspects are the things that I'm interested in learning and excited to learn, actually. So for me, I think just as I have been as curious and voracious in learning the criminal aspect, I must do so for the civil part in order to be a well-balanced and effective'",
        "'speaker_1': 'judge, because you can't do one, just one end. And so in that regard, my hope is to reach out to my colleagues on a district court bench who have that experience, who understand the civil the civil practice, learn from them, seek out mentorship, and do my own homework.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think that's important because I had to do a lot of it as I was coming up through the ranks in the criminal and the criminal section. But beyond that, even now, as I have prepared for this for this process, I reached out to former and current district court judges who are doing the work to tell me'",
        "'speaker_1': ', like, well, how do I do this? Or What is this all about? And it has really piqued my interest. And ultimately what it has done is it has helped me seek out my own education. So I would read the landlord tenant law, which I know I'll probably do a lot of, you know, I'm going to seek out'",
        "'speaker_1': 'information on more and attend more hearings between now and the time that, if I'm lucky enough to be appointed, to serve, to watch more anti-harassment hearings, name changes, weddings, all of those wonderful things that I think people seek out on a day to day basis and that I can be a part of.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So that's my hope, and I hope that answers your question. Councilmember Lambert, thank you very much. I ask an excellent volume of cases facing the district court judge is significant, as you know. How do you approach managing multiple high priority matters in front of you at the same time?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, you know, I think. Thinking about what is to come. And based on COVID, the backlog of the civil cases that are going to be our launching over us is a huge, huge obstacle and a big concern. And first of all, I just want to commend the Council for appropriating funds for the district court to hire commissioners'",
        "'speaker_1': '. I think we need more, you know, and the more we have, I think the more we can do. But to specifically answer your questions, I think having to prioritize and manage all of these things at the same time is a huge, huge undertaking.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we have to obviously prioritize those who are in most need, you know, or where rights are being so infringed in the moment that we must we must act. So learning how to triage you, you prioritize those with the highest need is going to be learning how to do it, I think, will be a matter of what'",
        "'speaker_1': 'is the current court culture and what is the capacity. And learning those two things simultaneously will be the best way for me to manage. You know, constantly. I'm doing that with with all of the three locations that I that I manage currently in district court.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so, you know, not to be reactive, but certainly you got to go where the fire is at and you have to solve those problems. And then once you're able to to deal with those big issues or immediate issues, then you're able to strategically plan and be thoughtful and about how you're going to attack long term.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And by doing those two things, I think we'll be able as a bench to tackle all of those massive priorities that are coming between civil and criminal. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'll ask the next one.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Council members. Hello.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you so much. What lessons from operating during the pandemic, if any, should the district court carry into the future? And how should they be addressed or implemented?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, many of the concerns that have come up during COVID time has to do with access, access to justice, access to the courts safely, but also recognizing that, you know, the work doesn't stop and we have to come up with a plan.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so one of the things that I've been very excited about and again commend the Council for in the Technology with Eckhart and moving into the future with CMS for District Court has been a game changer allowing for for people to appear by Zoom for those who have the means to do it has been incredible to keep'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the work flowing. But I think one of the challenges to those things as these things advanced technologically is that we also have to, again, be mindful of the fact that those many of those who are seeking that access to justice are of the most marginalized communities and may not have the same kind of access to that technology'",
        "'speaker_1': 'as others who are more affluent. And so moving that forward and as I think we move into the future, I think that the district court and the King County Council should think of innovative ways we can provide more access to justice through the technology.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Perhaps, you know, an example of that could be what if we had publicly access computer stations, even if it means being in public libraries or other community spaces where folks who don't have access to the technology but want to resolve their their cases or want to appear before the court to get a protection order, have the ability'",
        "'speaker_1': 'to have access for free. It wouldn't cost as much overall versus potentially people not coming to court, having to be booked into jail on a warrant and having to be assessed, you know, a public defender and prosecution. Like, these are ways that we can use the technology to our advantage, but also keep the cases flowing and folks'",
        "'speaker_1': 'not being potentially incarcerated for failing to appear for their hearings. So it's my hope that with all of the wonderful things that we've been able to accomplish during COVID, that we be mindful of the fact that we don't live in communities of color or marginalized people behind.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you so much. And I ask the final question as well, which is what about the district court? Interests you the most? This is an easy one.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You know, actually, since I've been working in district court for five years, it has it has become more and more interesting to me. You'd think it would be the opposite. Like it'd be like, get me out of here.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Like this is, you know. But in reality, no. You know, what I have come to find is that the district court is one of the common people. It's the everyday people that have basic, basic needs that need to be met.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And for many of these is their first time being in contact with the criminal justice system, or for that or for that matter, in the civil realm, for infractions, for, you know, name changes, anti-harassment and those things. And these are the folks that I see every day.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And because of that, it's caused me to be so much more interested in the outcomes. It causes me to be more interested in that in the process and looking towards ways in which we can improve that access to justice or that process so that their everyday person can feel like, I trust the system, I trust the people'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that I'm working. When I look to the bench, I know that my needs will be met and that the people who are helping me navigate through this, what could be the most important thing in their lives at the moment, that they are being taken care of and being there, being the thought of as human beings, because it's'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the felony courts and all of those things which are very important and frankly, with very serious crimes. The vast majority of the community that we serve come through district court. And I believe that it's my calling really, to serve those people and to make sure that their needs are met.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So, you know, that's why I want to stay. That's why I have thrived in district court as as in the prosecutor's office and why I've applied.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You bet.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you so much. Are there any additional questions from colleagues before closing comments? See none. I've been very keen to share your closing remarks with us.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Well, I want to thank this committee again and would like to leave the committee with these last thoughts. I believe I'd be a positive addition to the King County District Court bench. I say that not only because I've been a prosecutor in the courts for many years, but for the last five I have solely practiced in'",
        "'speaker_1': 'district court. I'm consistently supervising and managing up to 30 attorneys and students and a dozen staff in our three main courts in the area, making sure that all the calendars are covered. The newest of attorneys are learning how to seek justice and do the right thing in each and every case.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'My understanding of equity and social justice is infused into the work that I do and what I teach. I know how the courts work. I know the clerks. I know the attorneys. I know the workload issues. And I know how to work with the stakeholders in order to manage a smooth running court.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'These years in District Court have prepared me to do the work. And yes, to be honest, becoming a judge I know will be a transition and with many things to learn. But that transition would not be such a departure that I know I could not do it successfully.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I am passionate about serving this court and being the kind of judge this committee would want to see on the bench. I would strive to serve with the highest level of ethics and seek to treat all that come before me with compassion and dignity.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I promise to always remain curious and be willing to admit what I don't know and seek advice and help from others to ensure that it sound, equitable and reasonable decisions. All of these things that I aspire to do will hopefully result in the community's trust.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And like I mentioned in my opening, a place that can change lives in a positive way. Thank you again for all of your time and your consideration for my appointment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you and thank you again for sharing your vision, your intent and serving on the council we on the bench and what you would bring to the people of King County if you were to serve on the court.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We want to thank you for spending time with us today. And colleagues, would you like a few minutes in executive session?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'd be prepared to move.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Wonderful. Then I would be. I would entertain a motion regarding motion 2021 for 17.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So move, Mr. Chair.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In motion. I believe what Councilmember Ismail I just did was motion 2021 for 17 before us and we would need an amendment. A verbal amendment to the motion.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Mr. Chair, I would like to add a verbal amendment, including Leah Taguba's name, into into the motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The motion before it is too late to give a name to motion 2021 for 17. Any discussion? All those in favor of the verbal learning. Councilmember Balaji.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm sorry. It's the amendment. I'll hold off.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But others in favor of the amendment please signify by saying i. I. I. Opposed nay. The ayes have it. Motion 2021 417 as amended. Final passage, Councilmember Balaji.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Chair. I didn't mean to jump to the front of the line. I just wanted to make sure somebody said something. This has been obviously a very important opportunity to get to meet you and hear from you virtually, at least about the your your qualifications to sort of see your passion and your heart.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But based on the application materials, to borrow a phrase from our friends at the Bar Association, we obviously have an an applicant here who is exceptionally well qualified for this position. And I'm happy to not waste any time and get her started as soon as we can because we know they need help their district court.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Chair.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Dombroski.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. Chair. And I wanted to thank Mr. Gruber for her willingness to serve. Your application materials were outstanding. I think I've sat in on about 50 of these views on my time on the council from building she has as well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you for the table of contents on the materials. It was very helpful and I wanted to say that Judge Casey, for we just Casey's letter was particularly helpful to me, particularly where he remarked about your treatment of court staff and the clerks and those that really make the courtroom work.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I always think that that is a terrific indicator of the quality of a lawyer, but also the humanity of a person when the court staff recognizes you and appreciate you for how you treat them. And also, I don't think hurts to get a good decision from a judge when you're good to the bailiff and clerk.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But that tells me a lot about you. And the interview today was one of the very best I've seen. I don't think you're going to stay on the district court bench for very long, and we look forward to watching you grow in your service and appreciate your willingness to do this part of it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Happy to support it. And I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So the discussion. Madam, could you please call the roll?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Chair. Councilmember Buttigieg, I. Councilmember DEMBOSKY.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. By our vote we have voted to a point. We are on to the district court bench. We will move the motion 2021 for 17 to full council. With without objection, we will put it on consent and perhaps expedite as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'An update to Tuesday's full council meeting will be on the consent agenda. Mr. Gupta, thank you so much and congratulations.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you also very much. I am overwhelmed. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Congratulations. One more step to becoming an official judge.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'For the opportunity to be considered to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Serve on the gender identity and the Sexual Orientation Inclusion Task Force. You know, I often report to this group in my role in public health and certainly through the cover of Time, you've gotten to know me in in one form or the other.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Part of about this, as important to me is as a gay man really came to the service of public health really during the AIDS epidemic. In the crisis is what really drew me to public service to begin with.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And as a person who was coming out of coming out at the time in college in the late eighties, early nineties, of course, we were just in one of our most dark times as a community in the number of people who were dying from HIV at that time.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'As you remember during that time, for those who were around, is that there was just a lot of discrimination, homophobic rhetoric, acts of violence that just really were pretty horrific in hindsight. And but we've really come a long way since the eighties and nineties.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think in particular, the thing that draws me to this task force is making sure that we're creating the space and environment as a county and as a county government that really allows people to be who they are, that to live fully in their authentic ways, and that we're providing the services and programs that really allow'",
        "'speaker_3': 'them to thrive. Although as a gay man, I feel like so much has changed since the eighties, the nineties I do see.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'With colleagues.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And friends within the community, really from our trans and non-binary community in particular, where we still really have a lot of work to do as a county and we have a lot of work to do in some of our programs and services with our declaration really as racism, as a public health crisis.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I also see the intersectionality being a really an important piece where people who are from our bipoc community, who are also trans or non-binary or have a sexual orientation other than heterosexual, it's oftentimes more difficult for them to be in a space where they feel welcome and safe.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so if there's anything I can do by serving on this task force, both as a gay man and bringing my own lived experience and to the table as well as as really serving in our public health role and as a part of our government services to better serving our public in particular, these are folks, whether it's'",
        "'speaker_3': 'gender identity or sexual orientation, to improve our services in the county, certainly want to be a part of that and bring my voice that table. And so thank you for considering me. And if there's any questions, I'm happy happy to answer them.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Let's go ahead and hear from all of the nominees and then take questions. I would ask Al Jazeera to offer insights and your interest in serving on the task force? Not.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Everyone I know get and would love to request closed captioning for accessibility purposes if possible. Also, we'll move forward with describing myself for people who might not be able to see very well. I am wearing a gray button up, short sleeve, platinum blond hair, some black background porcelain and just want to make sure I get that out'",
        "'speaker_1': 'there for folks who may not be able to see well again. Anyway, I totally echo Dennis and what he said regarding a lot of intersectionality and a lot of the things that are changing and the community, the LGBTQ community, and how this reflects in the inclusivity of policies that the county has.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think it does quite a bit already, and I think there are also a lot of gaps that are pretty evident. Just given the new way that we're navigating queerness and what it means to be gender nonconforming in various spaces.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so my interest to serve on this task force, I think, is to be more inclusive in a lot of policies and to be inclusive and mindful of the way that we take up space, both as part of the LGBTQ community and ally community that we have here, hoping to build a pretty good partnership there.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I'm also very interested in making sure that we have a sustainable approach after the task force ends. I think that's probably one of the one of the most important things to think about, because task forces are important.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think it gives people space to strategize ways to be inclusive and how to be a good ally as well. And I think it's important to think about sustainability and and how the work continue even after the task force ends appearance.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is your question. Happy to answer anything else as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you so much. Ms.. West, can you tell us about yourself, your interest in the task force?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hello, council members. My name is Catherine West. I am an attorney with legal voice and I use she her pronouns. I will follow Elle's lead by describing myself. I am a white, cisgender woman. I am in my home with a wooden door behind me and a blue and white curtain.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I grew up as a working class in a working class family. Although I acknowledge that I have had tremendous privilege as a white person moving through society, I am. I've had the privilege of working on gender equity issues with a legal voice for two years.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And most recently, I worked with a coalition of trans and non-binary individuals to draft and move forward legislation in the Washington state legislature that later was named the Gender Affirming Treatment Act. And we were so proud that the legislature passed those protections in in one legislative session.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so now folks who are gender expansive have the same or hopefully better access to health care than they had prior to that legislation and prior to joining Legal Voice, I was a staff member, a staff attorney at Northwest Justice Project, where I represented low income Washingtonians in a variety of civil legal matters, but including name changes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'in district court, as well as seeking gender affirming health care, either paid for by Medicaid or their private insurance, and a variety of other types of issues that uniquely impact gender expansive people, including school policies, harassment, discrimination. And so it's just such a privilege to be considered for the gender identity and sexual orientation task force, because it's'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so important that the county and society consider how to hold and include gender expansive people and make sure that they feel welcome and seen and accepted. And sometimes those are small things that need to change or for people to be educated about.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And other times they're they're a lot bigger. And so it's nice to be able to think through both the smaller kind of movement building strategies, as well as maybe proposing some, some larger changes. I'm happy to answer any questions at the end.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you so much. And I was wondering if you could speak to your interest and experience. Thank you so much for joining us.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah, thank you so much for the opportunity. So I'm Fred Swanson. I see him pronouns and I'm here representing not only myself but also Gay City, Seattle's LGBTQ Center, where I've been the executive director for 20 years and a week, which is a little overwhelming.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But for for those who don't know, the city has been operating as Seattle's LGBTQ center since 2012, and we run the resource and referral line for the City of Seattle and are also part of the King County Connect to Community Referral Network, where we connect LGBTQ people to and, you know, to do the things that they need'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to live happy and healthy lives and often refer to other organizations like Legal Voice and like Seattle Counseling Services. So we heard from just a minute ago, I'm also a parent, so I was a foster parent for six years and am raising three children and Darian in South King County and have kids in elementary, middle and high'",
        "'speaker_3': 'school and Dorian. And so I think I also bring the perspective of a parent of two of those kids are are on the LGBTQ spectrum. So not only do I have that perspective myself, but also the perspective of the kids that we're raising.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I was particularly, I guess, bothered or alarmed by the recent COVID 19 school report that came out from OSP about the the young people that were most impacted by COVID. And it wasn't surprising. But you know what, what really came out of that report and there's some really great presentations that have been done by you done about'",
        "'speaker_3': 'this report, but is that LGBTQ young people particularly were we're hit hard and we know that the health disparities experienced by LGBTQ community and community members are severe. And so I think what I want to bring to this task force is a perspective not only as, you know, somebody who runs an organization that is really here to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'connect queer and trans people to the resources that they need and really looking at how do we achieve health equity by addressing social determinants of health and looking at the barriers that exist between folks and healthy lives. And what are the ways that we can help break those barriers down, but also the perspective of a parent who's'",
        "'speaker_3': 'really invested. And of course, my own children and other children being able to thrive and looking at ways that school systems can and the county can really help to create environments where young people are able to thrive and be who they are and you and live happy, healthy lives.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I think those are a couple of the reasons that I'm involved and I'm really honored to be a part of this group and to work with, you know, other really smart people and to look at what we can do to address, you know, the beauty of a King County wide task force like this is a really'",
        "'speaker_3': 'looking at the systems across the county, and that's oftentimes where you can make the most impact as opposed to just in your little corner of the community. So thanks very much for the opportunity.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Fred. I remember meeting the guy who moved here to become the executive director of the city some 20 years ago. Getting to know him and appreciate your service. Over now, two decades, colleagues are going questions for the nominees before us.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'd entertain one motion to to approve motions 2021 357 358 359 and 367.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mr. Chair.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have before us a pass recommendation promotions 2021, three, 57, 58, 59 and 60 discussion. I want to offer that. On my own behalf, having served 20, 20 years in office and having been an openly gay man for that entire time, but actually not having been out all that long before he first ran for the legislature.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I really appreciate. The evolution of what kinds of issues and work we confront. When I first joined the legislature, it was a new privilege. Some would have thought at the time to be able in the membership booklet to list my partner to include the name of my partner.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Ten years ago, just over ten years ago when I joined the King County Council was the first time that we were formally recognized as a Council Pride Month and declared June as LGBTQ Pride Month. The kind of work we've been able to do in time really has moved forward very quickly.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And today we are appointing members to a gender inclusion and sexual orientation task force with the broad support of all of my colleagues on the County Council, and doing so to further understand and make sure the county is engaged and responsive to people regardless of their gender identity or sexual orientation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So the budget before us today is real and important as each one of the four nominees is spoken to. And I'm profound to me that we are able to do this work with such broad, supportive colleagues and identify and recognize the need to do it for all of the people in King County.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Further discussion.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilmember Dombroski Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you for sharing those personal and heartfelt remarks. You know, I've had a lot of privilege in my life of giving a fairly straightforward and simple existence with respect to my identity.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And it's been a learning process for me to really open up and be reflective and be made more aware of issues around one's identity. I was very proud and I'm very proud to date of sponsored the legislation that created this task force in partnership with my colleagues.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And it's heartwarming to see the candidates coming forward who want to continue serving and help us as a county government, make sure that our policies and our practices are inclusive of everybody and respect everybody's individual humanity, that we as a government meet folks where they are and respect who they are, and that our policies are cognizant of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that and don't just reflect one person's or majorities person's perspective. So I want to thank the candidates today for their willingness to serve. Dennis I don't know how you have time, but thank you for all that you're doing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And Mr. Chair, it's a it's a heartwarming time here today to see these candidates come forward. And I'm very, very hopeful to see their work and then take action as a government on their recommendation. So appreciate you scheduling the hearing today and doing it in such a terrific way.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hello.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Thank you so much for sharing your thoughts. You as well, Councilmember Dombroski. And for our guests who are here, we all know and see that our members of the LGBTQ plus communities are overrepresented in homelessness and suicide in youth not doing well in schools or at home.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so the work that you all are doing to keep all of our communities safe is is acknowledged and appreciated. I just wanted to say that thank you so much for doing that. People are really struggling out here and you are elevating these issues and making sure that our governments take the proper actions to keep everyone safe'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and thriving in King County. There's nothing more valuable. And so we all commit to you, to working with you, to listening to you, to make this a safe place for everyone. So I just wanted to express that gratitude and commitment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And remember Belushi.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. I will just echo what my colleagues have said already about our support and the importance of us thinking about the ways in which we engage with and support and serve the community of people that we serve.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So that we're being intentional about, you know, meeting our needs and hearing voices. I think in the past, we kind of took for granted that if we did something good, it kind of universally supported everybody. And we've learned a lot since since since I started in this work about how that doesn't actually work.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we have to be more intentional and more focused in how we reach out to people. I do want to thank the nominees for shining a light on the issue of accessibility of our meetings. Thank you for doing that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I wanted to share that. Although we do not have Zoom captioning, we do have captioning on our KC TV feed and we probably should work that into the beginning of our meetings so that we let people know that that is one way to get more accessibility of our meetings, but always more work to do there.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I just wanted to note and thank you for lifting up that, that important function of government.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Further discussion. Madam. I'd ask you to please call the role on all four motions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Chair. Councilmember Banducci. Hi. Councilmember Dombrowski.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Council councilmember again. Councilmember one Councilmember Lambert, I don't remember a photograph. I don't remember one. I thought.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Council members. Hello.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hi.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mr. Chair.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Ah.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mr. Chair, the vote is 8 hours. Your notes. Council member. Dan, excuse.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Me. Thank you. By your. By your vote. We've given a do pass recommendation to merchants 2021, three, 57, 58, 59 and 60. We will expedite these to a full council on Tuesday, and in my objection, place them on the consent agenda.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Very well. Thank you so much. I expect that we will confirm in full council your appointments on Tuesday. And please feel free to reach out to us during your work and we look forward to the product of your work.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I'm taking that up as well to deliver for the people of the county. Thank you so much. Today is a briefing on the proposed health housing implementation plan. The ordinance was duly referred to the Regional Policy Committee and the committee of the whole.'"
