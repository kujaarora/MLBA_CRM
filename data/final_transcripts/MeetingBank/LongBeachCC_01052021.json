    "Recommendation to declare ordinance amending the Long Beach Municipal Code by adding Chapter 21.66 relating to an Unpermitted Dwelling Unit Amnesty Program, read and adopted as read.  (Citywide)": [
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Let's begin hearing it in 13.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Report from Development Services recommendation to receive supporting documentation into the record, conclude the public hearing and determine that the project is categorically exempt from CEQA. Declare ordinance amending the zoning code or related to unpermitted dwelling unit amnesty program.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Read the first time lead over to the next regular meeting of City Council for final reading and adopt a resolution to submit amendments to the Coastal Commission citywide.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Turn this over to staff.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good afternoon, Mayor. I'd like to introduce the Development.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Services new planning manager, Patricia Defender, and she.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Will give some overview, comments and introduce the staff making this presentation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening, Mayor and council members. Hello and happy New Year. This is Patricia Devendorf here. I'm actually going to be giving this presentation, so I'll go ahead and start. This item is a code amendment to introduce an ordinance that would create a pathway for legalization of existing, unpermitted dwelling units.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This this ordinance creates a pathway that doesn't exist currently, but only in a very limited circumstance. And it's a way to preserve existing housing units and preserve existing housing stock. Similar other cities have similar ordinances. Some of the cities that have a similar have adopted a similar ordinance recently include Los Angeles, West Hollywood and San Francisco.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'A couple of those cities have had them for some time. The proposed program implements previous policy direction that was adopted by the City Council, and I'll talk a little bit more about that. The program will help the city meet its 26,000 unit regional housing need assessment requirement, which is through the year 2029 and will be part of'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the upcoming housing element that the city is working on currently. The Planning Commission did hear this item back in September of last year and did recommend approval that the City Council approve this item. So some of the goals, some of the policies that have already been adopted that this ordinance helps implement are the Everyone Home recommendation to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'expand the number of rent stabilized units. And it also implements policy 1.1 of the revenue tools and incentives for the production of Affordable and Workforce Housing Study, which is to encourage the preservation of existing housing stock. One of the benefits to the city of this ordinance will be that it will ensure that through the legalization process, that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the units are brought up to building code and safety standards and just ensure that we have safe and habitable units. So currently I mentioned there is a very limited provision of the zoning code that allows through an independent zoning administrator process legalization of such existing units.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They have to have been built prior to 1964. This is does it really provide a very big kind of opportunity to legalize, again, units that already exist that were perhaps carved out of existing spaces within multi-family buildings? The proposed ordinance would allow for these units to be legalized through a ministerial site plan review process.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It would allow appeals, but only by the applicant to the Planning Commission. Some of the particulars of this ordinance is that it targets those units that cannot qualify for legalization through the accessory dwelling unit regulations. So there's a pathway for the garage conversions in those kinds of units.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But this is targeting a group of units that would not qualify through those regulations. These would be eligible in most any zone other than heavy industrial zones. The date of occupancy you have to the applicant would have to prove that the residence was in occupied prior to December 31st of 2016.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So the idea is these are existing and it's not a pathway to create new units. One of the other benefits to the city is that there's a requirement to have an affordable affordability covenant for a period of ten years.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So an applicant who seeks to legalize such units would have to record a covenant on the property, retaining that property for a period of ten years for income levels of moderate income or below. If it's if the unit is occupied by someone of a lower income level and it effectively waives zoning requirements of it waives requirements of'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the zoning code like density limitations, parking, other such standards. It does not wave, of course, building code, fire life safety standards. So just a quick overview. There was a public outreach conducted on this consisted of a study session with the Planning Commission and it was composed in some outreach that was done on the housing element update.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we did the usual and required notification for hearings before the Council. Some of the kinds of comments that were received were just largely inquiries about the ordinance in general and what it was attempting to do. There were some concerns expressed about that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This ordinance would encourage illegal construction of units, which I addressed previously, and just concerns about ensuring safety of the units and that the rent restrictions are adhered to. So with that, the environmental this project is or the ordinance is exempt from secure and basically the recommendation is to declare the ordinance and establish this or adopt this ordinance'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and the resolution that would allow the director to refer this to the Coastal Commission for review and approval in the at the appropriate time. Thank you. That concludes the staff report. I am happy to answer any questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is there any public comments for the hearing?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. Our first speaker is Jim Cook. Hello? Yes, please begin. Hello. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I guess I'm coming into this pretty late since the ordinance is already written. But I see a lot of hurdles that a lot of people that would be interested in this probably will not be able to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Comply or get involved.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Because it doesn't seem to address the fact that most of the people that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Like.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Fixed income seniors that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Might have a room or something that they did in a while ago, they need that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Income to pay taxes or insurance or whatever. It seems that adhering to law.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'More than to have.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Flexibility.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'For humans, and.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I would encourage amendments that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Create.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Easy to obtain variances. The big developers got massive variances downtown. Let's have some for the humans.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean, the people.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No sense, say one, that some code infractions could be.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'As small as not being.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Far enough from a law with a toilet or shower or too small. Those are things that should be overlooked so.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That people can.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Maintain their businesses.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'People have access to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Non-Corporate.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Rentals because people are going to have to get out of the business.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Of renting.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Rooms because people aren't paying and we can't afford to carry people that don't pay. That's part of the problem, of course, from COVID, but also long term.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'When things stabilize, people need.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Variances.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And not more.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And more hoops because it costs money to tear out things and put them back. For instance, they might want to, but as long as it's safe. And any kind.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Of.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Variances go into maybe a written statement on the sale of the house.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Another stumbling block might.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Be ten years. That's a long time for an elderly person to commit to a covenant. So good luck with that. I hope we can get something together. And I appreciate your time. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. That concludes public comment for the sun.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Let me go and go through the council councilman's and house.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mayor. I actually want to make a motion to. To set this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Perfect. I see a second that. A second by Councilwoman Allen.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Did they have to have any comment?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. I actually went, first of all. Thank you, Patricia. Congratulations and welcome. I look forward to working with you. I wanted to say thank you to the staff for working hard on this. I think that this is this is exactly what is needed at the time.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think that anything any obligation we have to improve our housing stock is a great thing for our city. I know that this report has been a long time coming and that it has that lately, as has caught up speed.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I'm really excited about that. I also want to say that I know that when talking to staff, I did ask a couple questions on this beforehand. And one of the things that I was concerned about is making sure that that we make it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That we make it not a tough process for this to for everybody to be able to come up to code. I think that that's very important, especially for those that might have financial constraints. I think that that definitely is important.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I do think having this and providing an avenue or a way for those who are already existing units that that could become part of their property legally is a great opportunity. So thank you again for everything and I'm very happy to be able to support this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I just look forward to to this coming this coming before us he on council TV and I hope that my colleagues will support this as well. Thank you, Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilman Allen, please.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mayor. I, too, want to thank the staff for putting this together. And I do believe like councilmen, member as and has, that this is an opportunity to keep housing units on the market that are currently being occupied.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And this is going to be especially critical during a housing crisis. And also, I like the fact that the program the program will offer a clear pathway to bring units into the safe. And I have a will condition and also bringing the dwellings up to code, which is going to be really important.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I do also have some questions and I think what I'm going to do here is just I'll just ask them. You can just ask all three and then if you if you can answer those. So my first question is how do we work with what the owners whose units are not up to code and they may have'",
        "'speaker_3': 'challenges bringing the dwellings up to code. If they join the program. And also, I want to also understand how do we ensure that landlords are in compliance with the affordability cabinet? And also my last question is what happens to a current tenant if they do not qualify for the affordability element, like if they're planning on staying there'",
        "'speaker_3': 'five, six, seven, eight more years. So if you could answer those for me, I would appreciate it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'd be happy to. Councilmember And thank you. Councilmember Sanders. So the first question about how to work with the owners, so one of the things that staff is working on in conjunction with other bureaus in the Development Services Department is an advisory bulletin that will guide applicants and help them understand how to go through the process and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'what to expect in the process. So one of those features is likely to be a a, you know, an income. They will be encouraged to retain a third party in inspection. So contractors, architects, engineering firms can be hired to perform an inspection and issue an inspection report, essentially, that tells people what repairs will be needed in order'",
        "'speaker_4': 'to make the unit up to code and what that cost will be. It's at that point, this whole program is also a voluntary program. I think it's important to understand that. But at that point, once they have that in hand, it's really up to the owner to decide whether they want to take the next step and come'",
        "'speaker_4': 'to the city. But that helps the city kind of safeguard, you know, the any its position in terms of knowing about a unit. And then also it helps the applicant know what they're going to be in for in terms of process and expense before actually coming to the city.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'As far as ensuring compliance through that would happen, obviously through the process, the formal process of legalizing the unit, it's at that time that the applicant will have to get a building permit and then ensure that the the unit will meet building code standards.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then as far as if a current tenant is not of a moderate or lower income to the ordinance is written in such a way that there would have to be a covenant and recorded on the property that would essentially defer that tenure for affordability restriction period until a time when a tenant is in the unit that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that does meet the affordable that is of a lower moderate or lower income. I hope that answers that your questions.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next up is council member Ringo Ryan.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mayor. And I want to thank staff and customers in then home for bringing this forward. I was bringing it to the questions that I had with several brought up my path from reality and spread to some of the conditions.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That are.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Put out there in regards to these dwellings. As you probably know, sometimes it's easier to ask for forgiveness and permission. And so my concerns would be in terms of some of these dwellings that already exist, that might not be qualified to bid under this program.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I was wondering what the the safeguards were in there, but I think they were somewhat addressed by the questions that Councilmember Allardice. So I'm good with it and supportive of it. However, I'm just a little leery about the some individuals who would have again, rather asked for forgiveness and permission.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Mongeau.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. I had a couple of additional questions on slide four. It talked about a process through the Planning Commission. So I think that at least in my briefing, we talked about they'd fill out a form. They would have had an independent inspection from a private inspector that they would provide when submitting to the department.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'What is a step that it goes to?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah, so that's correct. This is a staff level approval. This is Christopher Kuntz, Deputy Director. But because it is a staff level decision, we need to provide the applicant due process if they disagree with the decision that's made by staff.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So the applicant only has the ability to appeal, for example, a denial to the Planning Commission. That's the only role that the Planning Commission has on this process.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. I just wanted to make sure it was an easy process that didn't require the Planning Commission's approval, because I thought I understood in our briefing that it was an administrative or an administrative change, so that that's perfect.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'What if the unit is in a historical district?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This is Patricia Defender for. I think the same rules would apply. I mean, these are, you know, existing units already. So presumably whatever construction happened has happened and happened quite some time ago. So it would be treated similar to other, you know, examples that would come that would come before the city because it wouldn't be wouldn't involve'",
        "'speaker_4': 'any new construction. It would be construction that already occurred.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So it would not require any additional hurdles for a unit that already exists in a historical district. Correct. Correct. Excellent. And then my last question was on Slide five, which Councilman Allen kind of touched upon, which was the affordability covenant.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So it's based on the tenant at the time and not on the amount charged for rent, correct?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It is. It is based on the income of the tenant at the time. But a moderate unit is is defined as a rent that is affordable to a person of moderate income. So there's a rent level and there's an income level.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that's how you determine what the income level of that person is and what the rent should be.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So if, for example, you had a zip code 9081. Renovate 136 district and bring to the housing standard. The the in the. I'm sorry I'm tongue tied. The rent that would be deemed affordable for low income in that area is let's say, 1300 a month if the rent being charged is 1000 a month.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But the renter is. It's not low income. Then the years that that unit is at a low rent would not qualify. I just wanted to clarify. Is that accurate?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That is correct, yes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. However, if the current renter is paying 1500 a month, but they are low income, then. The unit would qualify because a low income renter is there? Or would the tenant then need to reduce the rent to the affordability standard through the Housing Authority matrix?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So there's some items go in the ordinance and some items are implementation regulations that are done at the state level. It's hard to answer that question. So conceivably, what would happen is the owner would know that situation going in and if they chose to apply to the city to legalize the unit, once they recorded the covenant, they'",
        "'speaker_5': 'would need to adjust the rents to the amounts required under the affordability covenant. We would work with them such that if it's encumbered by some kind of a lease arrangement that expires on a specific date, the rent would not change until that specific date because I don't think the city can abrogate the lease.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Right. But at some point in time, they would be receiving the benefit of legalization. So the cost to that or the responsibility of that is to adhere to the conditions of the covenant which would occur at that future date.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Great. Okay. That answers my questions and I am in support of the item. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. My next step is. Who is the vice mayor? Richardson and then Councilwoman Sorrell.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I think this program is a good, meaningful approach to try to take a problem and turn it into an opportunity. And so to be clear with residents, I think what what should be noted that if you're concerned about this program being used or abused, that sort of go around or avoid quality of life'",
        "'speaker_2': 'considerations. Two points should be highlight, highlight. So one, this is really for most of these units are already built out, occupied and are substandard. They're not safe. So this is not amnesty for health and building code. This this actually brings these units out of the shadows and makes them safe.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we have, you know, our 80 ordinance did that for illegally for the garage and things like that. This is for everything else. And I think that's a good distinction for people to know multifamily units like that. This creates the pathway for these substandard units that are commonly already occupied for them to come out of the shadows'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and become stable and actually count toward our. And for those reasons, I think it's a great program and it has my support. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Sara.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening. I want to thank Patricia for the presentation and staff for their hard work on this. And I think that this comes at a great time, as my colleagues have shared and in a time when affordable housing is in demand.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think it's also a great example of efforts to preserve existing affordable housing. And I and I am curious, though, I know that we've heard about ways to make it easier, but I'm also curious about hearing how do we make it as punitive as possible, knowing that this is a voluntary program.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm just wondering if my question is how what would be the incentive for owners to come out to apply for this?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Councilmember. This is Patricia. So I one of the incentives really, as we discussed, is the fact that currently these units don't have they're not they don't have a valid building permit or a certificate of occupancy. So if a property owner owns a and a unit apartment building, but the certificate of occupancy actually says it's seven units, then'",
        "'speaker_4': 'they technically, you know, have to sell and that property is probably valued at the seven units versus the eight units. So this enables the property owner to kind of take full advantage of their, you know, of their asset in that way.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'How can you be sure that it's not a punitive approach if they do come out? It's harder is just knowing that they've been this program is in place for that much easier path. But how can we assure owners that there is protection in place so that there is an easy, a safe way to to come to compliance'",
        "'speaker_5': '? So, council member we tried to strike the balance between what what is as flexible as we can be while still protecting public safety. So we have to have our building code provisions in there because we don't want to legalize a unit that then has a fire or has some kind of life safety issue.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we've tried to structure as much flexibility as possible. But in addition, Petros had talked about before the applicant ever comes to the city and lodges their formal application, they're going to be required or encouraged to work with a contractor, architect or engineer to give them an estimate of what's going to be involved in this legalization process'",
        "'speaker_5': '. And if that estimate, let's say it's $25,000 worth of work and they only have $5,000, they will then have the opportunity at that point to say, no, this is not going to be the year that I applied to the city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I might come back in two years. The city continues to not know of that particular unit and won't be taking enforcement action because we don't have the information regarding that unit. But the process has still been positive for the owner because now they know what's involved and maybe it is a possibility for them in a future year'",
        "'speaker_5': '. The other piece that we haven't talked about here is we do find these units. We find them through the code enforcement process sometimes as a result of an unrelated inspection and sometimes as a result of a complaint. And then it is punitive because that is the way the current law reads.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So our inspectors have no discretion other than to write the citation. The way to clear the citation is to vacate the unit and convert it to no longer be a unit anymore. That's not a good public policy outcome for anyone.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's not desirable for the city, for the owner or the tenant. So we do feel that one of the benefits of this program will be in those enforcement situations where we're already in an enforcement situation. This gives us a relief well, this gives the owner a way out, a way to legalize that unit that doesn't exist today'",
        "'speaker_5': '. So there is going to be some process, there is some expense. We have to protect building safety. But at the same time, compared to the status quo, it's a it's a quite market improvement. And we think it'll be valuable.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We think some owners will come in voluntarily, but we know it will be especially valuable when we're already in an enforcement situation and this gives them additional options.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you so much. I appreciate that. And I'm in support of this item.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, Mr. Mayor. And I want to thank my colleagues for some very good questions. Actually, I've been checking them off as they been as they were and asked by my colleagues. I was specifically interested in understanding the incentive for property owners to participate.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think the question was answered. I think, you know, that it actually adds value to the property, maybe more property taxes as well. But I'm also interested in the the impact of the decision on this particular item. Do we have any idea how many units or what what we will what we could potentially gain?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean, how many of these units actually exist currently in the city? Do you have any any estimation whatsoever?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Council members. This is Patricia. Defend her for that. We really don't know because, you know, these are units that are unpermitted. We did make an inquiry of the code enforcement group and we learned that there were 157 code enforcement cases where building permits were required to remedy the issue over the last eight months or so.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But those represent many different kinds of code enforcement issues. So it's not very easy to extrapolate, like how many of these units would actually come forward. And it's likely the experience of the accessory dwelling unit regulations also has sort of proven that people don't come out necessarily right away and they they that there might be more people'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that are willing to come through the process after it's been in place for some time. And there's more certainty about the process.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you for for answering that question. And I would I would just say that that makes sense. I am certainly a supporter of this. We all are experiencing and have witnessed that. We know that in our districts that people are getting creative with housing and we have to understand the climate that we are dealing with, with the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'housing crisis. And so I think this is a this is a policy that that makes a lot of sense. And so it has my full support. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Next I go back to Councilwoman Mongo and then councilwoman in the house and then we'll go to a vote.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. I really appreciated the comments from Councilman Sorrow and thought I might ask the staff when additional units are brought online by developers. There are funds available from the Housing Authority. Is there any possibility that there could be funds available to bring units up to code if necessary?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'As I believe a unit could already be up to code and they would just need to file a permit fee. Has the discussion taken place of how much it would cost to purchase assets from the city side, not the construction side, but the application fee?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Those would be my two items.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Councilmember taking them in reverse order. The application fee is cost recovery, so it won't be zero, but we're looking in the neighborhood of a couple hundred dollars, so we don't expect it to be prohibitive in terms of assistance there.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There may be assistance available to some owners, but not to all owners. So with our CDBG and home programs, some of those dollars are geographically restricted. So there might be a building in Councilmember Sorrells district that could be eligible for housing rehabilitation.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But an owner in your district may not necessarily be available for those same programs. So I can tell you that there are funds available through our federal housing dollars. We do today support rehabilitation of existing housing, but it depends on a number of factors.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So it be available to some building owners, but not necessarily to all.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Excellent. I would just hope that we look for additional opportunities for that kind of funding because as the person who called in for public comment mentioned. There may be a person in my district or any other district that has a desirable unit that they would be willing to rent to a low income renter for ten years or'",

        "'speaker_3': 'been looking at recently that have a covenant of like 50 years for affordable housing. So I was wondering, you know, I think that ten years that may be too little. So I wanted to to see if we could probably bring it up.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'legalized. And on the funding side, we certainly can come back. That's part of our housing element discussion and our housing action plan discussion, which are on a little bit different track than this zoning code amendment.

        "'speaker_5': 'funding access throughout the city. As Councilmember Mongo alluded to. So again, it's council's pleasure, but just want the full council to be aware of the downside to increasing the period of affordability could be that fewer applicants utilize the program.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And unless applicants utilize the program, we don't achieve any level of affordability because we don't bring the units forward.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Thank you both very much for your comments. And that helps me sort out the thoughts in my mind and most definitely want this to be an incentive rather than a disincentive. And that's why this whole ordinance was proposed to be an incentive.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'Before discussing policy options, I'd first like to provide some background on the cannabis equity program. The program was first adopted by the City Council in July 2018 as part of the Adult Use Cannabis Ordinance. The purpose of the program is to promote opportunity in the industry for individuals negatively impacted by the prior criminalization of cannabis.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Numerous studies have shown that before legalization, low income minority groups were disproportionately arrested and convicted for cannabis offenses.

Median income, which is about $90,000 for a family of four, have a net worth below $250,000 and satisfy at least one of three criteria having to do with residency'",
        "'speaker_7': ', arrest, history or unemployment status. Program benefits include access to application workshops hosted by city staff fee waivers and expedited application approvals. In addition, the city was awarded funds from the state of California to provide direct grants to equity applicants.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'A portion of those funds will also be used to build a technical assistance program. It is important to note, however, that these benefits by no means guarantee a license as currently designed. These benefits are meant to act as an incentive for equity applicants to move through the licensing process.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And as it turns out, those incentives have not been enough to push the vast majority of equity applicants through the licensing process. To date, the city has issued one license to an equity owned business, with a total of five pending business license applications from equity applicants.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'By comparison, the city has had 79 residents qualify for the program. The main reason for the discrepancy between interest and success within the program is the significant barriers that exist to business ownership in the cannabis industry. Those barriers include access to capital, access to Green Zone, real estate, access to banking, construction and equipment costs, access to professional'",
        "'speaker_7': 'services, restrictions on the license types currently available in the city. The fact that those license types operated operate within a saturated and competitive marketplace. And finally, a restrictive statewide regulatory system. To be blunt, most of these factors are beyond the city's control.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Collectively, these barriers highlight the fundamental challenge of cannabis equity programs, not just in Long Beach, but really across the state and country. That is, that the cannabis industry is fundamentally one of the more challenging industries to promote equitable small business ownership.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'To demonstrate this point, I have prepared a sample list of startup costs for a cannabis manufacturing facility. These costs are at the lower end of the spectrum for what it would take to build a manufacturing business and can easily grow into the millions of dollars depending on the scale of operation.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Specifically, startup costs include lease payments for a minimum of one year while the facility is built out. Construction machinery installation which can include extraction infusion printing and packaging equipment. Initial cannabis inventory. Staffing costs prior to opening. Professional services, including brokers, attorneys and architects.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And other startup costs, including security equipment, vehicles, insurance marketing and other expenses. The city has received funds from the state to help with these costs, but grant funds are only enough to cover a portion of the expenses you see on the slide.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In light of these significant barriers to entry into the market, staff works to identify three policy options for the City Council to consider for strengthening equity ownership opportunities in Long Beach. The options identified include shared use, manufacturing, delivery, only retail and additional dispensary licenses.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'These three business types represent more realistic pathways to cannabis business ownership for individuals with limited resources by offering licenses with a lower startup cost, reduced facility footprint, fewer technical requirements, and a less saturated marketplace. However, it is important to emphasize once more that these options do not guarantee success for equity applicants, and that significant challenges remain for'",
        "'speaker_7': 'anyone seeking to enter the competitive cannabis market. The first option is to allow cannabis shared use manufacturing in the city, also known as Type S licenses. Shared use manufacturers were first authorized by the California Department of Public Health in 2018, but is currently prohibited in Long Beach per the municipal code.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Type S licenses allow multiple businesses to produce cannabis products within a single facility. The closest comparison to this would be a shared commercial kitchen where multiple businesses are able to rent space to produce food products for consumers. It should be noted that Long Beach already licenses cannabis manufacturers locally, with 25 businesses currently operating in the city under'",
        "'speaker_7': 'this business type. Under existing regulations, however, these businesses must operate out of separate facilities, which can require hundreds of thousands, if not millions of dollars to build. This has had the effect of restricting access to the license types to individuals with significant startup capital.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The advantage of type s licenses is that it provides small businesses the opportunity to manufacture cannabis products without necessarily having to invest 100% of the startup costs within the facility. Businesses can either partner together to build a shared space, or they can rent space within an existing license facility.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'One disadvantage to this license type is the fact that initial investment to build a new shared use facility can still be significant. Cities that currently license shared use manufacturing include Sacramento, Santa Ana and Oakland, as well as the county of Santa Cruz.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This slide shows some of the recent examples of shared use facilities currently under development in two of those jurisdictions. The second option is to issue licenses for delivery only retail, also known as non storefront retailers. Delivery only retailers are authorized to conduct cannabis sales exclusively by delivery.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'They must remain closed to the public at all times and therefore expected to have less impact on neighborhoods than do storefront retailers. This is not a new concept. Long Beach already allows its existing storefront retailers to deliver cannabis to residents in the city.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'However, many of these businesses choose not to deliver, given their primary focus on storefront sales. As a result, delivery only licenses represent an opportunity for equity owned businesses to participate in the regulated cannabis market. Cities that currently licensed delivery only retail include the cities of Oakland, San Francisco and Sacramento.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The city of Los Angeles also recently announced that they will begin accepting applications for delivery only licenses. The third option is to make available more dispensary licenses in Long Beach for equity applicants. Dispensaries are businesses that sell cannabis goods to customers on site within licensed business premises.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This third option is not part of the recommendation before the city council tonight. Instead, the Economic Development and Finance Committee requested staff to return to the committee in six months for further discussion on this topic. The city of Sacramento is one example of a jurisdiction that voted to move forward with ten additional dispensary licenses after initially approving'",
        "'speaker_7': '30 dispensary licenses. However, Sacramento is still in the initial phases of implementing this new program, and therefore more time will be needed to report back on results. To summarize, there are two recommendations before the city council today has referred by the Economic Development and Finance Committee.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Recommendation number one is to direct the city attorney's office, city attorney's office to prepare an ordinance to allow for shared use manufacturing in Long Beach.

That memo came to our economic development committee where we had a great deal of discussion on this and public comment and forwarded these three recommendations to the City Council.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'And then once that's done well, we'll look at the next phase, which could be defense, but that's not what we're doing today. So. That's right. So we're. So it wasn't a recommendation to not move forward. The recommendation was we want to start with these and staff recommend that the advise that these two were the most based and'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah. Thank you for that. And I think this proposal is just a great way to, you know, expand business ownership opportunities to individuals in the city that have been disenfranchized by prior cannabis laws. And I want to congratulate Carlos, who was one of our first speakers on the approval to the program.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I am super excited for you regarding the delivery only cannabis business feasibility study. I do look forward to seeing those findings. I feel like this is a great way to grow the industry without council action on more storefronts, which I believe right now are capped at around 32.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I do believe that also that a lot of the delivery that's happening currently in the city is from the illicit market. So regulating and sanctioning this may curtail some of those activities. One of the things I want to ask, I know in the presentation I saw that you're recommending that the delivery industry be cap the uncapped'",
        "'speaker_3': '. And I don't truly I don't understand that. It seems like to me that it's better to be capped. You know, too many businesses that are doing delivery only may hurt the folks that we are helping getting you know, get into the industry.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And this is, like you said, this is a very challenging industry to get into. So I am concerned with over saturating the market and I want to see all these folks who are getting into this thrive. So just a couple of questions that I have is, first of all, how large is the state grant?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That we have to assist equity applicants. How much do we have left and do you know how much has been exhausted? And then my second question is how many applicants have applied for that? And the reason I'm asking that question and how many get through, because if we have, you know, 100 Apple kids and only ones getting'",
        "'speaker_3': 'through, then perhaps we need to go back and reexamine our process for getting these approved. And then also another question that just came up as I was watching your presentation is you said that a portion of the fees could be covered.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And depending on how much grant money we have, is there an opportunity to cover all of those fees? So those are my questions.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you for for those questions. So to answer your first question. The state awarded us two grant funds, one through the Bureau of Cannabis Control, the other through the governor's office called Cannabis. The BTC grant was for approximately $960,000.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The Go Bears Award was for $2.6 million. Of that amounts, approximately 580,000 has been granted out to equity applicants to date. We continue to have grant funds available, and our hope is that by expanding access to new business opportunities, we'll be able to utilize all of the grant funds.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'However, if throughout grant implementation, it turns out that we're not on pace to use all the grant funds. We will work with equity applicants to determine if there are other ways or new milestones that we can come up with to allocate all the funds within the deadline that the state created.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In terms of the number of equity applicants that have applied and received funds, I do not have that number in front of me right now. So we will have to follow up with you on on that statistic for your third question.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Four for fees. We are currently waiving all fees for equity applicants. So that includes application fees, administrative use permit or conditional use permit fees, building plant check fees, inspection fees. They are all currently waived using the grant funds that were awarded by the state.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right. So the mayor stepped away. So the next speaker is council member Sarah.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I want to thank the Economic Development and Finance Committee and staff for bringing this up for the committee for bringing foreign staff on the work on this. And given the historic criminalization of cannabis, the consequences have been devastating on communities, low income communities of color, which is why I strongly support this cannabis social equity program.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think that it largely impacts a lot of the residents in my district. You know how, however, though, I think the criteria needs to to be targeted specifically to low income disadvantaged communities. And so I do agree with the qualifying factors are criteria of having a family income below 80% of the area median income and have a'",
        "'speaker_3': 'were a net worth below $250,000. And to satisfy at least one of the following, which is lived in a limited census tract for a minimum of three years, where at least 51% of current residents have a household income at or below 80% of the am-I, and also was arrested or convicted for a crime relating to the sales'",
        "'speaker_3': 'possession. Use our cultivation of cannabis in Long Beach prior to November eight, 2016 that would have been prosecuted as a misdemeanor or a citation under California law. And and but but I would like to, if you will, take this, Vice Mayor Richardson, since you made the motion to remove, is a Long Beach resident currently receiving unemployment benefits'",
        "'speaker_2': '. Thank you, Councilmember. Is that all your comment? Or did you have additional comment?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'No, that is it. I'll say that. That is it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. I think it. I certainly think it makes sense. I mean, that was staff's original recommendation. And it doesn't mean that someone who's unemployed can't receive a job or apply for a job in the industry, that those jobs or establish a new business within the industry, you know, but people can still apply.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But that wouldn't count toward equity credit unless you meet those criteria. So I think what you're describing makes sense given sort of the intent of the program. So absolutely that is accepted. Next is council members and they have.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor. I'm having trouble with my meeting. And I'm meeting today. Please excuse me. But I think I think that, first of all, I just wanted to say thank you to the staff and thank you to Jay for your great presentation to me.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think that, you know, this is very important going forward, especially in this industry and especially in these times. But I think Councilmember Sara just asked my question that I had. So thank you council member for for beating me to it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I just wanted to to get a little bit more clarification. I know that. You know, this industry is very new. So I know that, you know, we're still working everything out. And I think that this is a really great way to do that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I know that there was a specific mention about, you know, about how these requirements, the requirements are towards people who have been criminalized in the past. So I'm really happy to see that we're taking that into consideration. So that was actually that was my question to get a little bit more clarification on that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So Councilmember Sorrell actually posed the question and it was answered by Steph, but I just also wanted to say thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Fantastic. Thank you. Next up, we have Councilmember Price.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. So I want to thank staff for the presentation. Just a few comments. I know that when we were talking about the brick and mortar operations several years ago, one of the concerns that came up when I think I think I was mentioning the idea of the not having brick and mortar at first phasing into it'",
        "'speaker_3': 'with a delivery only model. And the concern at that time was that there would be no enforcement mechanism in place to distinguish between licensed Long Beach businesses and those that might be servicing through weed maps and other third party connecting entities.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we've had several years of best practices now, so. A-J Could you maybe speak to that a little bit? Are there different enforcement mechanisms that are now available or operational models that are available that can help alleviate the concern of the illicit market?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Taking over the delivery model.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Of the illicit delivery market continues to be a challenge. It is incredibly difficult to enforce against. It's a challenge that nearly every city in the state faces. We do have an enforcement program. It's a tax task force model.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's a complaint driven model. It's one that relies on staff from business licensing, code enforcement, health departments, city attorney's office, fire department. We have enforce against illegal delivery businesses, but it has been and continues to be a Whac-A-Mole approach where they they pop up at various locations.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That part of what drives the illicit market, though, however, is a lack of access to the legal market. So one effective approach to dealing with the illegal delivery services is to provide consumers at least access to a legal source and allowing for licensed legal delivery services because it gives consumers a choice and it gives them a choice'",
        "'speaker_7': 'to purchase tested products, regulated products, more reliable cannabis products. And it actually ends up being an effective enforcement program. Implicitly by allowing for illegal delivery services.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah, I can. I could see that. I wonder, and I know it's not the perfect analogy, but looking at how we're working with our short term rental, know the third party sites that are posting the availability of registered short term rentals.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is there some way that we can work with the third party vendors like We Maps and others so that there's like a registration number or something available for these delivery businesses where the consumer can know that they're a licensed entity in the city?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes, the state has begun requiring that we maps. And so you will find more businesses on that site that have state licenses referenced on their pages. We also have a city website that includes a map of all of our legal dispensaries in the city, and we've been surprised to see how many hits that website gets.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'A lot of people use that as a resource to determine where to to purchase cannabis. We can continue to update that site. Should the city council ultimately decide to allow for legal delivery services to identify the legal services in the city as well?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But it's also something that is going to take time for consumers to fully shift to the legal market. And so it is these incremental steps that we're taking are helpful, but they're not going to fully address the problem, which will will be a longer fix.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah, no, I agree. So I know that you guys are going to do a feasibility study and come back. So perhaps you can include in there some sort of a marketing program to encourage residents to utilize our city data resources regarding the established businesses, because I think consumer protections in terms of the product and the safety of'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the product is a pretty critical thing right now. And I think that consumer protection angle and how we can market that could be something that we could really invest in as a city. So if hopefully when you come back of the study, it can include that that marketing component for a site to legitimate businesses, that would be'",
        "'speaker_3': 'good. And then the other question that I had. What's really about the issue is, oh, no, it's not a question, it's a comment. I agree with Vice Mayor Richardson that we should encourage staff to have creativity. But I think it's creativity within the policies that we'd set.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Right. So from a policy standpoint, we want staff to have tremendous creativity in coming up with ways that we can implement our policies in creative ways. But we do have, you know, nine representatives on people who may not all agree with staff at any time on certain policies.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And since all of our residents deserve to be heard, we want to make sure that we're showcasing a lot of the policy considerations at council and talking through those ideas together with staff in a public setting. So with that, I want to thank staff for this excellent report.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think the the efficiencies that can be found in joint use facilities is a fantastic opportunity to get people to enter the market. So thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Next is Councilman Austin. Thank you very much. And I appreciate all of your comments and questions thus far. Obviously, I am a big supporter of US social equity with cannabis in our city. We've been working toward this and on this for quite some time and and we still have work to go.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'A lot of work to do. I just wanted to focus on the intent of the policies we're looking to create here. And I just need a little bit more clarification from staff, certainly in general in spirit, I support the direction that we're headed in.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I want to just ensure that that we are we are. And as Councilmember Cheryl mentioned, we are impacting the targeted groups that we want to target with what these policies. And so so first out, how do we ensure that or I guess, question number one is shared use manufacturing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Is that permitted in the city of Long Beach now?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Charges. Manufacturing is currently prohibited in the city due to our premises requirements, which restrict one licensee from operating in a given premises.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay, I understand the ideal of expanding, but how do we ensure that these shared use manufacturing facilities are not just expanding the businesses of existing operators as opposed to expanding opportunity for for equity targets?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So the recommendation to allow for the license type would expand opportunities for anyone so both equity and non-equity business owners. That's something, however, that we would seek direction from City Council. On if you wanted to restrict licenses in any way.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, I mean, I guess I guess I need to know what we we need to study and understand what our options are to actually ensure that we are delivering a policy. And carrying out its full intent. Right. Because I don't want the unintended consequence to be, oh, well, the big guy just came in and took advantage of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'our policy and now they're manufacturing and they've got storefronts and deliveries going on and they're saturating the market. Right. The ideal is to give the individuals with the least amount of advantage, some advantage. And I don't see that here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so council, with all due respect, I think we we have work to do still. If we want to make this policy work the way we want it to work. And to the point earlier stated, I think it's I support more expanding dispensary options if that means expanding opportunities.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think Steph actually mentioned earlier by expanding opportunities, we do have a have a greater impact in reducing being the illicit market in our city. And so, you know, the I guess the the conversation about cannabis equity has always been about are we looking to create, you know, equity jobs or equity ownership or both?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think we need to be on both jobs and ownership. And but we need to put some some assurances in to the policy. And I'm not exactly sure how that how we do that right now. I would love for, you know, before any sort of, you know, anything comes back, the staff be able to provide some'",
        "'speaker_2': 'some recommendations or some best practices in which we can can can put that into any sort of policy moving forward. Thank you. The next speaker is council member.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. I have several questions. We did hear this before. The Development Finance Committee, of which I at the time was vice chair. And several questions did come up at that time. And I had not been able to form all of my questions because so much that was learned at that time.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm disappointed that the commitment to an additional meeting in December didn't take place, but I know we were all very busy and and COVID and the holidays and all of those things. But I do have several questions, so I apologize if I have to reach you after the 5 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I want to echo the comments from Councilmember Sotto and Austin that we really are looking to help the communities that were most impacted by this. And so and I think that paired with the comments from Councilwoman Allen related to wanting these businesses to be successful really leads me to believe that this ordinance could be most valuable if'",
        "'speaker_3': 'we picked a certain number of licenses in each category and restricted it to equity candidates only. I think that the fact that there was $3.86 million available in grants and only 560,000 have been utilized to date demonstrates that there is funding available to get these equity candidates to the front of the line.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so I would hope that the maker of the motion would consider restricting the ordinance at this time to be for equity candidates. Then what we can do is we can see what barriers are still there, despite the available funding of $3.3 million, and then kind of work backwards and say, okay, now that we have X number'",
        "'speaker_3': 'of shared use manufacturing and we have X number of delivery, then we can say, okay. Let's talk to those businesses that are equity candidates and are being successful and figure out if they are just flooded with demand or if the demand that they have is just enough to keep them in a profitable status.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Because, like Councilman Allen said, we don't want to have 70 of these businesses, equity candidates putting their lifeblood into it. But then the market being so saturated by individuals who do this all up and down the state that they're not successful and then those businesses don't have a fighting chance.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I have a series of questions that go to that. Can the grant funds be used for lease payment, construction costs and purchases of vehicles and equipment for equity candidates?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes. The grant funds can be used for that purpose.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Great. You mentioned that there were lots of hits to our legal cannabis business web page. What is lots to you in terms of number of hits per month?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I don't have a statistic for how many per month, but the number of hits was in the thousands. The last time that we checked, I would need to go back to I give you an exact number.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is it thousands of individuals or thousands of hits to the site and was cumulative?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It was cumulative. I rechecked months ago, so I would need to revisit it for an update. It wasn't unique individuals. It was based off of total hits to the website.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. So that concerns me when I look at website statistics and the number of individuals who are purchasing cannabis in our city. I've talked to cannabis business owners. We have certain business owners that I've spoken with since our meeting about enough because I asked specifically, Hey, you're a really successful cannabis business in our city and you don't'",
        "'speaker_3': 'do delivery. Why is that? And he kind of talked to the fact that the profitability of the delivery market is so difficult because of the additional costs related to insurance. And we're not just talking about one time set up costs that the grant can work with, but the ongoing costs and risks of a delivery business are just'",
        "'speaker_3': 'higher. And so I also I mean, he even said it so far as that Amazon has a a small business incubator that an individual could go to and start their own delivery business for Amazon. And he said that the numbers in his perspective would be significantly more profitable.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'However, I recognize that you have to be passionate about what you do, and if individuals are passionate about the cannabis industry and they want to get into it, we do want them to have a pathway to being successful.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And to do that, we I feel like it sounds like phase one of this plan should really be to reserve those licenses for equity candidates and that we should see what the market bears. A Jay is weed maps a licensed business in our city.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And no weed maps is not a licensed cannabis business. I don't understand the intricacies of it, but they don't touch the cannabis plant in any way, so they're more of a marketing company.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Do they have any license in our city?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Not that I'm aware of.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Does Airbnb or any of those types of platforms have a license in our city now that we have, or will they be required to have a license in our city? Now that we've changed the short term rental market.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Christopher Coons is going to answer that question.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Great.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So if council. Council member. It's not a license like a business license, but we do have a written agreement with Airbnb and other platforms regarding the sharing of tax information and lodging information, and that's part of our short term rentals regulation program.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If your 5 minutes are up.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. I will you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Have anyone else queued up so you don't remember?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Oh, wonderful things.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If you think you can get it done the next few minutes, I'll just suspend the rule and just finish your question.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Great. Thank you. AJ Do you believe that Weed Maps is the number one tool utilized for finding.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Cannabis related businesses?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I don't think I'm in a position to comment on that. I have read a number of articles that point to weed maps as one of the larger marketing firms in this industry. But I don't know if they're the largest or if people use other means now of finding cannabis businesses in the state.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Perhaps we should, similar to how we reached out and had a partnership with Airbnb. Perhaps we should reach out to weed maps and discuss with them the importance of only including licensed businesses on their platform and what we could do to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Work with them to to focus the efforts into our license businesses. That might be able to support these businesses. Let me see my last few questions on. So I guess if if this is really focused towards social equity.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'AJ What is the limit per applicant? For utilization of the grants. Is there a limit? Is it 200,000?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Currently the total amount available per equity applicants for reaching all of the milestones in the application process is approximately $250,000.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And what do we believe the start up costs of a. Non storefront delivery. Business would be. You had that chart.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yeah. The the chart that we showed in the presentation was for manufacturing facility. The total cost can range, but we tried to identify something on the lower range of the spectrum for a manufacturer, and that was about $500,000.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We were using that as an example for how, even with the significant resources that we've received from the States, there are still major hurdles for equity applicants that include access to capital. To see a project through delivery only services have much less capital requirements.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'They're able to have a much smaller footprint and therefore a lower square footage space for their business. They have fewer, fewer technical requirements. The construction that's required within the facility is much less. I don't have an exact figure for you today, but we do believe that the grants that are currently available would be enough for equity applicants'",
        "'speaker_7': 'to go through the process to secure a delivery only license as opposed to the current licenses that we have available.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I guess I would say that there's $3.3 million left approximately based on your assessment. I'm going to do a quick math problem here on my calculator. Divide it by 250,000. That would be 13 additional licenses. So I would request the maker of the motion to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Start the program with authorization of the staff recommendation for first items one into shared use manufacturing licenses and. Non storefront delivery licenses for, let's say, 15 equity applicants. At least then the equity applicants will have a head start in the process and not have to compete.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It also provides you'd mentioned that of the 32 licenses in the city, only one of them is an approved equity applicant. And so technically, unless we restricted these licenses, there would be potentially a 31 additional non equity applicants at the front of the line to do the shared manufacturing licenses.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Now I recognize that multiple businesses are often owned by one entity and so they might not have a need for putting manufacturing onsite at all of their facilities. But I would say that if we want to be true to what we say is our intention, then I would ask the maker of the motion to approve the recommendation'",
        "'speaker_3': 'with the modification reserving. Phase one for equity candidates up to 19 license. What did I say? What was the number? Only 13. So up to 15 licenses.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I have two things I wanna respond to. But before I do, I want to make sure we have everything, all your comments, and I'll respond when you're done as your last week. I'll just respond to it before anything else.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I did have one other thing. I'm going through my work. I went through my notes and I don't see what that last comment was, so hopefully I already got it. If not, I'll kill again. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay, great. Okay, so just a few things. So there's been a number of members who who expressed some of the common themes. The point here when the committee recommendations come forward is to get feedback from the whole council, and that's what's taking place tonight.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So Sorrel, Alan, Austin and Mongo all expressed interest in starting this with equity candidates only, and I support that in terms of the cap. I want to ask staff to respond about is a cap legally of a legal considerations on a cap.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If that we need to know about.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We we do have concerns for how we would administer a cap and determine who has access to a license and who does not. We went through a process like that for dispensaries in the medical ordinance, and there were some challenges associated with that and maintaining the overall integrity of that program.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Having said that, though, if the City Council is interested in having staff explore a cap within the framework of delivery only, we're more than happy to include that in our feasibility analysis and look at other models that other jurisdictions have followed and identify the pros and cons to the various approaches for for shared use manufacturing.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The challenge is that cannabis at this point in the state of California is a borderless market. So any attempt to restrict the number of licenses in one city doesn't have that necessarily the effect that was anticipated, because manufacturers can locate in other cities that may or may not have a cap and that product can go across borders'",
        "'speaker_7': 'very easily. So we're also happy to explore that as a policy option if the city council wants to pursue a cap for that license type as well. However, we would need some time to to consider it because that was not included or considered for this recommendation.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So we would need to discuss internally within our policy group and also with the city attorney's office to determine if there are any legal concerns or other concerns associated with it, specifically in regards to shared use.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Great. So. So that makes sense. So what I'm going to accept is I think we go forward with with equity only on both. We will explore. We are going to ask staff to explore the feasibility of the cap on on delivery since you have some evaluation to do there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So that is an amendment to this motion. And then secondly, I just want to acknowledge Councilman Soros, her amendment earlier, her friendly amendment, that we're accepting that and we're going to apply that to business, new business opportunities and employment opportunities, as echoed by a couple of the council members as well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So those are the two additions and that is the motion. And let's go to the roll call.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Please report from Development Services recommendation to receive a report and confirm the proposed Climate Action and Adaptation Plan and direct staff to prepare the subsequent IIR citywide.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mr. MODICA.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Members of the Council were here in front of you tonight with a really significant policy action for your consideration. This has been several years in the making. It's clear that this council has prioritized climate change and that staff has embraced that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This is a multi-year effort that is really grounded and based on science. And we came to you in a study session a couple of months ago when we were close to a climate adaptation plan, but not quite there yet, where we got some direction from the council to focus on a couple of areas, including electricity, oil and'",
        "'speaker_6': 'the port, among other things. We're happy to be back to you in front of you tonight, having resolved all of those and met our targets and are looking to present that to you tonight and get your feedback so we can start the process.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I will turn this over to our development services staff to walk through the presentation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Council members. Jennifer Lee will be making this presentation. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Hi council members and Jennifer Li, planner with development services. So as an overview, what is the Climate Action and Adaptation Plan or the CAP? It's a road map for the city to reach state greenhouse gas or GHG emissions mandates and to adapt to the impacts of climate change.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It does this by establishing a framework for creating new or updating existing policies, programs and practices for Long Beach to reduce its carbon footprint. The plan aims to cut carbon emissions while fostering a healthier and prosperous city. The cap is informed by technical studies of climate stressors and community wide vulnerabilities.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'As a timeline of of recent Council actions and direction. The City Council heard a study session update on March 19th, 2019, and provided direction to establish an aspirational carbon neutrality goal by 2045 consistent with state goals. The City Council recently heard a study session update on Oct 20, 2020 and directed staff to work with departments to identify'",
        "'speaker_8': 'reduction measures. Staff did that and this is what was identified. These are the key actions which we will tell you more about later in this presentation. So why do we need a cap? The state mandates that 40% below 1990 levels are reached by 2030.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The CAP is the plan for Long Beach to meet the state requirement. Long Beach has established an aspirational goal of net carbon neutrality by 2045, consistent with the state's recent executive order. However Long Beach Long Beach is, CAP is a plan to the 2030 Horizon year.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'There are a variety of additional laws that the CAP helps Long Beach comply with. Additionally, the City of Long Beach joined the Global Covenant of Mayors in 2015, which is the Global Alliance for City Climate Leadership. Additionally, the cap is a mitigation measure of the general plan.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Land use element or GHG emissions are associated with growth anticipated by the iwi, which would include things like vehicle trips and electricity usage associated with future development as a mitigation measure to address GHG emissions associated with the plan.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The city has committed to adoption of a cap within three years of the adoption of the EUI and subsequent monitoring of GHG emissions. California is doing well and is on track to meeting GHG reduction targets statewide. However, local climate action plans are needed to implement mitigation measures locally, help communities adapt to climate change and to advance equity'",
        "'speaker_8': '. Examples of actions that occur at the local level are updating building codes and zoning and siting electric vehicle infrastructure. Local climate action plans help studies be more resilient against current and future climate threats and help ensure that efforts address environmental justice, such as by steering climate finance opportunities to communities most impacted by climate change.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The Long Beach City Council has adopted a resolution acknowledging racism as a public health crisis and adopted the framework for reconciliation. The camp supports this initiative, which calls for advancing environmental and climate justice in the communities most impacted by racism.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Very extensive community outreach and engagement was done to provide information and engage the public, reaching more than 10,000 community members. The cap is divided into mitigation and adaptation. Mitigation actions reduce GHG emissions their across transportation, building and waste sectors.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Reducing vehicle trips, for example, is an important mitigation measure. Adaptation actions help adapt to the impacts of climate change. An example of an adaptation measure is to address extreme heat by increasing shade. The cap increase includes a number of actions across mitigation and adaptation in the plan.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The plan includes an equity strategy for each action. An example of an equity strategy is to identify corridors in the areas most impacted by extreme heat or poor air quality, to prioritize them for urban forest, cover, shade, pavement and other cooler surfaces.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Emissions come from three main sectors stationary energy at 49%, transportation at 44%, and waste at 6%. The stationary energy category is made up of emissions from building electricity and natural gas use in residential, commercial, institutional and industrial buildings, as well as emissions from energy industries operating within the city.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The transportation category is made up of emissions associated with passenger vehicles, busses, trucks, rail transit, freight rail, Off-Road Vehicles and aviation operations within the city limits. Most of emissions coming from the transportation sector come from gasoline vehicles. The waste category is made up of emissions from waste disposal and emissions from wastewater treatment.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The CAP implements the state's GHG reduction strategy. The graph shows business as usual forecasts which protect emissions in the absence of specific local action, as provided through the city's cap. As you can see in the graph business as usual, forecasts decline over time, which is due to statewide actions that decrease emissions from the energy sector, as well'",
        "'speaker_8': 'as improved vehicle efficiency standards in the transportation sector. The CAP also implements the city's general plan element, which provides for greater density and mixed use. Mix of uses in development of the city. This graph shows city emissions targets versus forecasts from 2015 to 2050.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'GHG emissions forecasts or business as usual forecasts and the Purple Line have a general downward trend due to efficiency improvements at the state level. The solid blue line that goes from 2015 to 2030 represents GHG reductions from actions that the city will take to reach target levels and the dotted blue line, which is the GHG reduction goal'",
        "'speaker_8': ', which goes to zero in 2045 representing the state and the city's goal of net carbon neutrality. The production needed between the business as usual forecast and target emission level in 2030 is 192,600 metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Provide a better idea of the amount of this reduction target based on the EPA's equivalencies calculator? On the left you can see that 192,600 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent is about the emissions from 41,600 passenger vehicles for one year.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Or electricity usage for 32,600 homes for one year. This is a relatively small reduction compared to that needed to achieve net carbon neutrality in 2045, which is 1.5 million metric tons of CO2, i.e.. On an individual basis, each person living and working in the city would need to reduce their emissions by about 90 sorry 9% in 2030'",
        "'speaker_8': 'to achieve the GHG reduction target. The city must reduce GHG emissions by 190 to 600 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2030 in order to reach our target. Here's how we'll meet and even exceed the target reduction.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The GHG reduction pathway includes GHG emissions reductions achieved from implementation of cities, commitment to providing 80% of carbon free energy by 2030, an increase from 48% carbon free electricity delivered in 2019, as well as the additional net emissions reductions that would occur from 10% voluntary participation as these 100% green rate program relating to oil extraction activities in'",
        "'speaker_8': 'the city. The GHG reduction pathway accounts for decreased oil production by 20%. The GHG reduction pathway includes the city purchasing 100% carbon free electricity for ominous by accounts, as well as an increase in solar power use for a continued community wide from an estimated 2% of current solar potential developed to 5% of solar potential developed.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'In the transportation sector, the duty reduction pathway includes actions to implement the ports clean trucks program and reduction of vehicle miles traveled or VMT consistent with the state's VMT reduction in the waste sector. The GHG reduction pathway includes actions to increase commercial recycling and organics diversion.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'A total emissions reduction achieved by the actions on this slide and the previous is 363,200 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent exceeding the reduction needed to reach the target. There are additional actions that were not included in the quantified GHG reduction target at this time, but are anticipated to be implemented and will result in reduced GHG emissions'",
        "'speaker_8': '. The port has committed to 100% emissions free cargo handling equipment by 2030. The port will also implement curbs oceangoing vessels at berth regulation that will result in reduced use by certain vessel types when at berth. The port's waterborne emissions are not included in the city's jurisdictional GHG inventory because they're not regulated by the city.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So the reductions are not reflected in the city's pathway. But emissions reductions are going to be achieved through these efforts on the part of the port. The Long Beach Airport is implementing programs to increase use of electric ground service equipment, to reduce emissions from gasoline and diesel powered equipment, which will also result in GHG emissions reductions that'",
        "'speaker_8': 'will be tracked by the city through implementation and monitoring. The recommendation at this time is to receive the report and supporting documentation, confirm the CAP and direct staff to prepare the subsequent environmental impact report. Next steps are to prepare the subsequent EMR and when that is complete, adopt the final plan and environmental document.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. Includes the president.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Wonderful presentation. Why don't we do a public comment first?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Our first speaker is Dave Shukla. Eve Shukla. Hello? Yes, please begin. And thoughts and prayers for everyone in Long Beach with the coronavirus. The proposed cap in front of you today is an important starting point to formalize and catalyze legislative.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Efforts to. Not only account for, but. Drastically. To reduce the carbon emissions. Many of those carbon emissions or. Specifically tied to. The utilities we. And the electricity factored in. The gloss put especially in the presentation on how one of the pathways by sticking with you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'A proposed schedule of slowly adding in 10% of the population by year over the next ten years. They are on record proposing rate increases, which no doubt will increase even further. More recently, the. Rate increases each and every year along with improving.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There's a lot of hard decisions, especially it's one of our legislative priorities of the city is local control. The city has to make. I've been on record many times supporting the development of a Long Beach specific. Community Choice Energy Program.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think that is not only a viable, but increasingly necessary. Pathway for not only meeting eight targets that are reflected maybe in SPF 30 to, but increasingly in more ambitious 2030 part as a signatory of the Climate Safe California campaign.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think it's only possible existing renewable along with emergent clean energy economy technologies, especially distributed energy resources to achieve. The goals of. Not only that, but. With an understanding of climate science and what realistically we want business as usual to become.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'What the embassy. What a climate stabilized. California and specifically Long Beach after all the. Climate change is the reason people have come and gone, really that kind of vision of how everyone can participate in building that for the future.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's more what I like to see coming out of this plan and look forward to providing further written testimony along with the county plan on Friday. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. Your next speaker is Elaine Vernon.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening, members of Council. My name is Dr. Elaine Bray and we have a. I live in the fourth district and my address is on file. I teach chemistry at Cal State Long Beach, and I teach global climate change in Catholic Dominguez Hills.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'My comments are Appendices D and E for the CAP report. Regarding appendix, the IT states that the AOP and 2015 study showed a recent downward trend in air pollution in the region. However, the American Lung Association states that there was an increase in average number of unhealthy ozone days in the Los Angeles Miami area, and the area'",
        "'speaker_1': 'had the worst ozone pollution in the nation between 2015 and 2017 too. Ozone is only regionally monitored by Air Canada and the EPA, but levels can change on an hourly basis and differs from neighborhood to neighborhood. We need to be specific and transparent about where we are placing air quality monitors and advocate for census level data.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Most of our sensors in the region are clustered in Islam Beach, but you have more north and west side residents being impacted by asthma, and we have less sensors in those areas. And finally, for community outreach as listed in Appendix E, we need to shift more effort towards listening to the community by working with grassroots, local organizations'",
        "'speaker_1': 'about how they are being impacted by environmental racism and climate change, rather than pushing information out from local, state and academic institutions. We have a wealth of cultural and indigenous with them on how to steward our land, and I believe that as a city we have failed to acknowledge that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Think your next speaker is Maryanne Buchanan.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hi. This is Mary Ann Buchanan, District three. I attended all of the city's forums on the Climate Action Plan, and they were there were informed speakers from the good people at Development Services who just brought you that slideshow.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There were easels outlining the climate threat. We looked at maps and found where we lived and could see just where the climate problems will be worse. Many solutions were added to those evils by ordinary citizens, and I thought we were off to a great start.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Now I am just disappointed.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It is bad enough that this plan does not meet the state's greenhouse gas reduction targets. But it also suggests that Edison will solve our energy problems, and it leaves us both sort of out of it. Where did all that community input go?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's time to get out the city's equity tool kit and take a harder look at the solutions, not just the problems. This plan has almost no actionable items that address equity and frontline communities. If you're under the Gun City Council to get this process started so you meet a state deadline, I beg you to also revisit this'",
        "'speaker_1': 'particular climate plan so it's made more accessible and actually attainable. There's climate trouble coming and we can fix it. We just need a clearer plan than this one. I thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. Your next speaker is Grace Lawrenson. Grace Lawrenson. Grace Lorenzen, please meet yourself. We'll move on to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Dean Todd, you. You know. Okay. The intrigue. Please begin. Yes, sir. D.A., can you hear me? Yes, please begin.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So what would you say? This has been.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. Please begin. I look. My name.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Dean told me. Or Star six. What do you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Need?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Oh, please begin your public comment.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay? Yes. Okay. And ready to go.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I don't see the number going in.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Please begin. Your time has already started. Okay. My name is hello. My name is Dean Todd.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I live in the seventh district. I teach at Cal State Long Beach, and I'm a member of Long Beach 350, which put together the community letter you got today.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I also.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Served on the scientific advisory committee for the CAP.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We are recommending that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The Council not confirm the proposed cap and to return it for revision, to put.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It in the more.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Readable form that's actually more usable to you and to the community. There's two reasons that I'll talk about. The first one is on page two that talks about the greenhouse gas reductions. The state law requires a 40% reduction in greenhouse gases that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Cause global warming.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The chart, if you look at it, shows how the cap is supposed to reduce those gases. Take a look at the line that starts in the year 2015. It's the lower solid line that goes down to 2030. If you do the arithmetic based on that, that's a decrease of only 29% rather than 40%.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So by its own evidence, on page two of the document, you got a 17. The cap is a failure on the most basic thing it's supposed to do.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The other problem is that it might even be worse.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There's other information in the appendix that talks about reductions are case by case, by different actions. And I could find that it only added up to a 13% decrease. So this seems to be serious deficiencies.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In the most.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Basic thing that the cap is supposed to do. The other problem is that it's extremely hard to evaluate the proposals. It's written and organized in a way that prevents policymakers. That's the city council and the community from evaluating the proposed actions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's basically it's really.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hard to find the evidence that supports the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Proposals issues. If there's a proposal that you're interested.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In, the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Action proposal, you can't find the evidence to back it up. There's no way to get from the main draft to the appendices. It might be somewhere in there, but the proposed cap doesn't see where that is, and the appendices don't have useful tables of context, content or indexes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So you have to scroll and go through the whole thing to find what's there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I don't think I have.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To make an analysis for this problem. Try it yourself. Choose an interesting issue that you're interested in or a proposal, and see if you can find the facts to back it up. You might find it after a couple of hours.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think your next speaker is Grace Lawrenson.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'GRACE. Hi, this is Grace. Grace LAURENSON Hello.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. Please begin.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes, I'm a resident of District seven and I've been following the cap since the early neighborhood meetings. And I know the plan is not perfect, but I do think it is a start. Climate solutions are urgent and we need to start on one item at a time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I would urge the Council to approve the plan and then make sure that any of the climate actions take into account the equity toolkit that asks us to consider how the action reduces racial, economic and social disparities.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That is very important in the climate change issues, reducing the economic and social disparities. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. That concludes public comment for this item.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Well, thank you. Let me go to the council and start with Councilwoman Price.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You, Mr. Mayor, I want to thank staff for this excellent presentation and the briefing that I'm sure we all have the opportunity to participate in prior to council on the report. The attachment that were prepared, I thought, were very thorough and very, for me, educational in terms of some of the need and some of the goals.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I want to thank staff for that presentation. I do have a couple of questions that I have for staff. When we're talking about reduction of greenhouse gases and our emissions numbers, is there any way that we can somehow quantify that for residents in terms of what that means.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'On an individual.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Basis or a household basis? For example, is that one less car per week or conservation practices that might help? That's a question that I get a lot from residents is how can they individually contribute to our broader goals?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is it realistic for them to individually contribute?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes. So we've done a give, just a brief overview about that. So the website is this, to meet the state GHG target, it would require that each person who lives and works in the city would reduce their GHG emissions by 9% for because their GHG target reduces emissions beyond the required state target that would result of a'",
        "'speaker_8': '363,000 metric tons of CO2. E would be a 17% reduction per person who lives and works in the city. And we can do a little bit more to to put those in terms of like, you know, cars driven our electricity.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Usage, right? Yeah. But basically, what does 9% look like? That's just a question that we get a lot of what is 9% like. So yeah, if there's if there's any way to quantify that with examples, real life examples that people can, you know, one, utilize themselves but also educate the youth and the community about.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That would be really fantastic. I did have a couple of teachers collectively email me today and say that this is a topic they've been talking about in schools and and finding ways to bring it home in terms of what these percentages mean to to children and the youth would be really helpful.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I'm not sure if there's any way to quantify that, but just something for you to think about. And the other thing is the community outreach component. I know staff has been really gracious with their availability in terms of providing information at community meetings.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But what's the community outreach process moving forward from here? I know that. There's some information in the staff report regarding, you know, regular progress reports and updates. How frequent do we expect those to be? I certainly hope that we can engage the community more frequently than on an annual basis.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Council member this is Patricia Defender for be happy to answer that question so that the plan has a section that sort of identifies city leadership actions. And among those actions are you will see ongoing education, outreach and engagement.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's actually on page 182 of the plan. So really this demonstrates the or expresses the city's commitment to continuing to do outreach on climate issues through the implementation of the plan, engaging the public, raising public awareness. The comment you made about helping people understand what some of these numbers mean on a very kind of individual level, I'",
        "'speaker_4': 'think those are things that we can really strive and attempt to do through the ongoing engagement. There's also targeted education working with the schools, so there are a number of strategies outlined in the plan, in the ways in which the city content will continue to engage the public going forward.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Great. The other question that I wanted to ask was about the conversion of our city fleet to electric or zero emission. What's the plan for that? Maybe that's a better question for the city manager moving forward.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I got it. I got it. Councilmember. This is Christopher Coons. So well, this is a plan developed by a development services. We have a lot of partners and that includes public works and RFM. And we've had a lot of discussions about fleet.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You know, we've made a lot of improvement on the efficiency of our fleet already. So you're going to see by 2030 a basically almost entirely electric fleet, but that's not going to happen overnight. So one of your budget balancing measures this year was to actually delay certain fleet purchases and to extend the lifespan of certain vehicles in'",
        "'speaker_5': 'the city. And that's going to have an unintended positive consequence climate wise, because technology improves every single year. So what performance we get out of electric vehicles and the cost efficiency of those vehicles improves every year. So there are a it sounds a little counterintuitive, but there are times where delaying that changeover by an additional year or'",
        "'speaker_5': 'an additional two years actually helps us in achieving our 2030 goals because we're trying to hit that future number. And that doesn't necessarily require us to turn over everything tomorrow, and it requires us to be knowledgeable of that future goal point.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And that's what we're working with all the parties on.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And just to add to that, Councilmember, this is Tom Modica. We currently are a leader in terms of Green Fleet. We just won an award for that. I think we're the third best fleet in the nation and we also have a policy in place that every replacement that comes up, we ask the question first Can it be'",
        "'speaker_6': 'an electric vehicle or an electric plug in vehicle? That has to be disproven before we can move on to purchase other types of vehicles. So that's already in place.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Understood. I'm probably running a little bit short on time, so I'm.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In or 5 minutes are up.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Sounds good. I'll come back up. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilman's in the house. Councilman's and day house.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mayor. First of all, I'm saying the staff that has been working on this for you. I want to thank the sustainability committee that also has been working on this for years. But most importantly, I want to thank our community organizers that without their organizing, we wouldn't have what we have before us today.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think that we've you know, there's been a lot of work that has been put into this camp, both by the community and our city staff. And we've been trying to be as creative as possible, trying to be as forthcoming and forward thinking as possible when creating this plan.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So thank you very much for all your hard work on this. Would it be possible to force staff to explain how much? How much of this adaptation plan that we have before us. I know that in my mind I see it as, you know, we're giving permission or we're in this plan.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We're giving Southern California the chance to meet our requirements by 30 years. And from what I understand then, if that those are not met and then we can go into CCR. Is it my understanding that correctly?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Council member, Mrs. Patricia Devendorf. Her I think what you're alluding to is the fact that the plan itself is meant to be kind of an iterative plan. There are provisions in the plan that call for monitoring all of these measures that we've quantified.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Biannually, we will look at that the how we're doing in terms of meeting those reductions. And we will have opportunities to evaluate whether those strategies are resulting in the emissions we expect or whether we need to pursue other strategies.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And this is time the council action is still stands, which says for us to continue to look at CCR, especially as the market changes. And that was instead of delaying it for two years of a look at what it is to bring that down to one year.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we'll be back at the end of the year. Things have changed. For example, when we were comparing CCR to Edison, Edison was not nearly at the level that they're making the commitment under the cap here. So that is increased substantially is the level of commitment to greenhouse gas emission reductions by Edison.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes, thank you. And so I see this as a win win. I'm hoping that Edison will help us get to where we want to get with this plan. And I like the fact that we're not completely omitting the ACA with this plan, but actually, you know, providing some some opportunity for it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I look forward to that. And I think that. That right now it is very important. And, you know, for this plan to move forward, I, I also wanted to ask I know that some community members were thinking that we're not ready to move forward with this plan.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But if we were to halt it, for instance, which you know, I I'm not sure that I support that right now, but because I don't understand what it would do if we were to halt it right now. Can you explain can somebody on stuff explain that to me?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This is Patricia Devendorf. I think that there's a lot of cost. I mean, we always talk about the cost of inaction and not having a plan in place that allows us to pursue grant funding and other opportunities to partner with other agencies.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So there is, you know, sort of urgency to 2030 is not that far away. And we do have to have a plan in place so that it provides that roadmap so that the city departments can work together and pursue funding and help to implement some of these measures.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. Thank you. Thank you for the explanation, Patricia. I think that that not only does it you know, does that prevent us from getting some financial assistance? But I'm really hopeful that with this new administration coming on board and the new administration really having some some plans for for these kinds of plans, I think it's important that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'we as the city have a plan like this in place already so that we can be in the front of the line to be able to receive some of those funding. So, again, I thank you guys for all the work that you've been doing on this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I know that a lot of my residents here in the First District would benefit a lot from having an action plan like this, because right now we are obviously one of the districts that is the hardest hit with having, you know, the 710 adjacent to our district, which is obviously one of the freeways that supports our port'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and all the traveling that goes in and out to our port. And as identified in the presentation that we're.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Going to have 5 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And thank you. I thank you very much. And I'm just out recue if I have more questions. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Ciro.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mayor. I, too, would like to thank the community organizers and advocates for working hard to ensure that it's a community engagement and led process with the council members, thanks to council members and staff who have been working so hard to get us to this point.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I know that a lot of work for many years was done, and as a new, new council member, I appreciate all of that. I want to speak to just how do we ensure that there are accountable mutual accountability points that maybe we can put into the process to ensure that community is engaged in this?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Perhaps we can consider kind of a quarterly meeting where, you know, community can provide feedback and also ensuring that we hopefully set up markers or measures about, you know, around equity. And for example, you know, I would like to see how do we ensure that we also have measures on addressing environmental racism and inequity in the communities'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that are largely impacted, such as my district, for example. How can we be sure that there are green jobs allocated to marginalized community or disadvantaged communities impacted by pollution or other other issues? So for example, are we going to make sure that they are getting maybe green jobs like just installing EV charging stations?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So so that's one of the things that I'd like to ask is can we create a quarterly, you know, a mutually accountable meeting, a mutual accountable meeting with community members to ensure that we keep equity in the forefront of this plan as well?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Council members, I'll start out by answering and saying that, you know, part of this plan involves creating a dashboard. We are working with other departments to create a dashboard that's going to be available to the public that will create a lot of transparency about how we're doing in terms of reaching these different metrics.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Many of the actions of the plan, you will see that there are specifically actions associated with ensuring that there's local workforce and economic development is integrated into any of the of these measures. So, for example, many of the building and energy actions that are associated with clean energy, solar power, many of them have actions that would involve'",
        "'speaker_4': ', you know, involve entities like the Pacific Gateway Workforce Innovation Network and educational institutions like Long Beach Community College in the School District. So there's there's a commitment on the part of the city already expressed through this plan about and this is part of that equity lens as well, about trying to ensure that there are, you know, economic'",
        "'speaker_4': 'opportunities created for those communities that are most impacted by the effects of climate change. There will be biannual reports when we do the monitoring to to report to the city council on how we're doing. And so there may be opportunities to to do certainly more outreach in that the plan expresses the commitment to do outreach through the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'implementation process.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. I do hope that we ensure there is a process to include community input in these plans and reports so that we're not only certainly using science and data, but also are we being effective in is it actually getting through to communities that are low income but also speaking other languages as well, such as Spanish and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'climbing? So I just want to make sure that we don't overlap those communities and sometimes it's a great way to just do a check in. I do like the idea of dashboards. It's a great way to look at markers for some of these, I think, actions we can measure.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But sometimes it's a little harder, I think for, you know, in a community is feeling like the plan is is working for them. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next up is Councilwoman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Big thank you to the community for their input. Big thank you to the staff for putting this together. And it's just an introductory step. We have a lot more to do. I did have some specific questions about the plan.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's extensive and I know we've seen it twice and I just wanted to see if I understood this plan by 2030. Expects what percentage of the city fleet to be electric.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Councilmember. I'm looking for a particular page in the plan. I don't think there's an express number of like a target for the city fleet. It it does have a we have an action associated with just increasing electric vehicle charging stations in the city overall.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that is. Sorry, one moment. I'm just looking for that. So that is a there's a one of the options is to develop an electric vehicle infrastructure master plan in the city. And there is an ongoing partnership right now with among the city, between the city and the Southern California Edison.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's called the Charge Ready Program, and it has installed. There's a plan to install 140 electric vehicle charging ports at public and city fleet locations between 2018 and 2020. And there's a target to by the end of 2020 to have 65 more charging stations.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I guess we just passed in 2020. But so there there has been a very concerted partnership between the city and Southern California Edison to increase vehicle charging stations. And that is that is the commitment that's in the plan right now.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Wonderful, great plan. And I just want to echo the comments of Councilman Zoro. I also love dashboards to see our progress.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next up is, uh, who hasn't gone yet, Councilmember? I'm sorry. Vice Mayor Richardson then comes from a supermarket.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Just a few things. So can we. Can we see that that the slide that showed the totals of our goal for the carbon and how we how we plan to make that up. And while they're pulling that up, I'll just give some my comments, though.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'First, I think the outreach was impressive here. I love the slide. The infographic talks about 10,260 total participants, 67 events, so on and so forth. So really great work for the staff and consultants and the community based groups and the community members who participate in this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's fantastic. Also appreciate the fact that the feedback from October is clear and evident here. We, you know, we talked about, you know, accelerating the timetable and what's presented in front of us today accelerates the timetable by five years.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think that's that's a good thing. And I'm looking for that. I'll wait on that slide. You know, today briefing with with with me and talked about, you know, the L.A. Times op ed and, you know, how we are at the place where we have the worst air quality index in a decade in our L.A. region'",
        "'speaker_2': '. And, you know, how does that happen when all of our technology is newer, everything is cleaner and the cars are cleaner, mobile sources are a lot cleaner. How does that how does that actually happen? And the answer is really that we're beginning to see we're seeing the impacts of climate change.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You're seeing you know, you're seeing hotter summers, you seeing wildfires. All of those things accelerate. They're causing intersectional problems with air quality and other issues. So we have a more responsibility to accelerate our climate action adaptation plan. That just makes sense.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The slide I'm looking for, it is the one that shows how we're going to meet our what the target is and how we're going to be our target. You keep going. No, it's not. Okay. This is it. This is the one.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So it shows that what's needed is 190,000 metric tons is what we need to reduce. And the plan, if you go to the next slide shows 363,000 is what will be produced if we follow these these strategy. I love that each strategy has a one pager that outlines what's needed, what we need to do as a city'",
        "'speaker_2': ', and what external factors need to be part of it. I think, you know, I think that a lot of this is outside of our direct control. Some of it is reflected in the port. Some of it is reflected in partnerships with Edison.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think we want to know that what we like to see are what are some things that the council can do within our own power to accelerate this? For example, I know there's a big conversation about the waste incinerator facility.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I know that. And I want to ask staff about this. I know that, you know, we've seen that, you know, eliminating it outright. Maybe it directs things into landfills and it creates other methane issues and it doesn't give you the same impacts.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But moving forward, what we have isn't feasible option either. So I'm looking for sort of some strategies or something that shows that there's a B or C, option B, option C is that can you speak to some alternatives or how you plan to think about the incineration facility?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Councilman Richardson, this is Christopher Koonce. So there's a few things to understand. As you see in the slide, everything is quantified and it totals 363,000, which is far in excess of the reduction we need, which is 192,000. So we fully anticipate, while we will try to execute every recommendation in this plan and every implementation measure, that we'",
        "'speaker_5': 'won't be successful on every single one. So there's a little bit of wiggle room worked into the plan to start with. But then when you talk about waste, you know what's in the plan talks about improving commercial recycling and improving organics diversion.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The most plan A is to be able to do that at Serv and to be able to do anaerobic digestion at surface and be able to handle organics there. That requires a whole series of decisions that this council will be a part of and that have financial implications for the city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So that's the plan. A but that's not the only plan. So while it may not appear in this document, there's working groups across the departments that are looking at it. If we had to send waste to a different organics facility, where would that be?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'How would that happen if we had to? Unfortunately, which would not be a good outcome. But if we had to just start landfilling everything that actually results in a number in the other direction, that's an increase in emissions.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But we're thinking about in that case, how can we achieve greater reductions elsewhere to offset any of those increased emissions from from waste? So we're doing a lot of that scenario planning. There's only so much we can put in the plan.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think it's like a thousand pages with all the appendices already, but I want you to feel comfortable that that type of scenario work is happening at the staff level today.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Thank you. I'm happy to back up. But three things I want to just note. One, I think, you know, organics and commercial waste is important. I want to make sure that we are revisiting the conversation on the commercial waste and franchising system.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There are benefits here and it makes a lot of sense. Secondly, the plan needs funding. We know that measure was passed. There will be some portion of funding to go help implement and make and bring this plan to life.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But there will certainly be more. And and third, I think new industry can be created through through these regulations. New industry can be created. That's the plan on the state's mandates, on getting rid of combustion vehicles is going to create entire industries around infrastructure and clean vehicle infrastructure within our within our state.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I would like to see a real I like programing an emphasis on the green industries and the things that be correct created by going through this transition. This will require changing traffic, creating jobs through transitioning equipment and all these other things.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm really interested in that. So the last thing on task relates to funding. Do you have an idea of what your gap in funding is to implement this? Or can you come back with your update with some ideas of what the gap in funding.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This is Tom so we have a general sense of what we tried to do in the plan was to for you like lay out what are the relatively inexpensive ones and what are the the heavy the heavy duty items that we would have to do pay for.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we categorize that in the plan. We would suggest, when this comes back to you, that we come back with a more robust financial analysis. We are certainly going to need money. So this is going to be costly both to the city and there will be some cost to it, to our business and residents as well.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We think it's manageable, but we would like to come back to you on that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. What you have Councilmember Supernova and Councilmember Allen who have not spoken yet. And then I'll go back. Councilmember Supernova.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Thanks to the staff and the public for a presentation and a question on one of the slides, you don't have to go back to the site, but it was on the reduction of oil production and I was just curious how we get there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Does this reference I just city of Long Beach production or is it both public and private sector production?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Councilmember this is Patricia defender over this represents reductions in in oil production in the city boundaries. So the in on the inventory side any oil production activity has a certain amount of emissions. And this is a reduction. This is GHG reductions, emissions reductions from reducing oil production in the city by 20%.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'In 2030 by 2030.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so the answer to that is both public and private production.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes, oil production.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Thank you. Then during public comment, I just wanted to commend Dr. Elaine Banal for her comments, one in particular about something. I think it's just very practical, and that is when we have something where we have fewer air quality monitors in the areas of need.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That seems to be something that's very tangible, very measurable. And to Councilwoman Price's point, something the public could really understand if we make some inroads in that area. So I would just like staff to keep that in mind.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Now, Councilwoman Price. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Councilwoman Allen. And then we'll go back to Councilman Price. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mayor. I, too, would like to thank all of my council colleagues with comments and think generally for the presentation and the staff for providing a road map for a more sustainable and equitable city. I know I met with the staff earlier today and I know that you guys have been working on this for a lot'",
        "'speaker_3': 'of years, and I know you put a lot of work into this, and I do appreciate the time that you spent with me today answering a lot of my questions and as I have heard from members of our community and advocates.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'One of the things that I'd like to say is we must be willing to change aspects of this plan, even those that are already approved and underway, if they don't significantly tackle air quality issues and track and tackle climate change.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I also look forward, I know there was a huge community involvement in the plan and I look forward to continuing at forward and the process and some of my questions have already been answered. I know with regards to compliance and the dashboard, but a follow up question to that is so when the dashboard shows that we're not'",
        "'speaker_3': 'meeting our goals, then what do we do? What is the process for making sure that we're ensuring compliance? And I also had a question on a gap in funding that Councilman Richardson talked about. So I look forward to seeing any reports on that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then also, I had a question that I didn't ask earlier today. When you look at the city multifamily organic waste ordinances ordinance, what is that? I'm not familiar with that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Councilmember, I'll start with your question about what happens when we're not meeting our goal. So that's the purpose of the monitoring. The biannual monitoring is to see how we're doing in relation to those goals. And then the plan also has provisions for plan updates.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They're contemplated to be potentially as much as every five years. If the measures are not achieving the objectives that they were intended to achieve, then we would come back to council with essentially updates to this plan that would suggest new measures that might need to be addressed.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then also those those biannual monitoring. When we do the biennial monitoring, we also measure redo the inventory. So we have an understanding of what our emissions are, how they are changing, and then also whether the measures that we have we're pursuing are reducing, resulting in the reductions that we are had estimated.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So that's that's the answer to the question of what happens when we don't achieve the targets, the funding. Okay. And then I'm sorry, can you remind me what your last question was?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I apologize.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Councilmember, if I understand your last question, it's about what is multi-family organic diversion. So a couple of things need to happen in the waste sector, both to comply with state law and to achieve our goals. So organic waste is waste that could be composted but oftentimes ends up in the waste stream and is either incinerated or ends'",
        "'speaker_5': 'up in a landfill. So for some single family homeowners that have the space, they can compost at home and there's programs that encourage them to do so and we can do better. But if you're living in an apartment or a condo, your options to compost on site are zero, right?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So right now, we don't have a way to segregate that waste. There's not a separate bin and there's not a separate pick up for that organic waste. What the state and this plan are looking for us to do is to be able to separate that waste, either at the point of pick up or later in the waste'",
        "'speaker_5': 'stream so that it can be either composted or processed in a way that results in the fewest greenhouse gases possible as part of the waste disposal process.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, Councilman Price.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Mr. Mayor. So I want to go back to one particular issue that I see that that both contains the greenhouse gas goals and measures that we have, but also the add up to climate change adaptation goals that we have.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And that's the Senate takes place every day on the peninsula with multiple trucks taking sand from west to east because our sand shifts from east to west during the day.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we have.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Multiple truck trips back and forth every day. And so the city has participated in some pilot projects to try to replenish the sand without utilizing those trucks. And that's an example of us trying to reduce our our emissions, but also think about sea level rise in terms of broadening our beach.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So when we're talking about vehicles like these trucks, the fleet, the truck fleet, I don't believe the ones that are currently on the beach doing the sand replenishment are electrical electric trucks. But does the city manager or anyone on the development services team know whether we're moving in that direction for similar projects?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm not sure that there's any projects that have that much consistent traffic or perhaps sewage, but I'm sure there are some others in public works that I'm not aware of. But I know that in the third district it's a consistent daily, multiple trucks back and forth.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I think reducing or converting those trucks to electric would make a huge difference. What's the status on that?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah, this is Tom. So the the market for commercial heavy duty machinery is really just getting developed for battery electric. We're starting to see some battery electric pilots for dredge trucks in the port and they have been exploring those really aren't in big commercial production at this point.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The type of equipment that we're using on the beach is really heavy duty and requires a big load. So those are right now still, you know, they're they're the cleanest type of fuel that that we can find when when we're able to buy those new machines.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But they are not electric at this point. We would love to if there is a market that would create those for us. We would love to switch those out as we go forward.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And that's good. And I'm hoping that we have technology available to us that I know will be costly, but that will eliminate the need for those trucks like the the the the pumps the sand pumps that we tried to utilize.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And now we're thinking about utilizing a second version of that. I know we've talked about funding gaps. I mean, the funding gap here is is enormous. And I'm hoping that there are state and federal grant opportunities for us to be able to tap into immediately after we've approved this plan.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I'm sure that since this is going to be administered out of the city manager's office, we have committed staff looking at exploring grant opportunities for both the climate change adaptation portion and the greenhouse emissions portion. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So, yes, our experience has been once you have a solid plan that's been adopted by your policymakers and lines up with what state and federal governments want to fund your chances of getting funding go way, way up. So we do think that will help.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We will then look at the various grant opportunities that are out there. We don't have dedicated staff just in our department that only does grants. We do have some high level coordination, and then we'll be working with each individual department to help implement those strategies for their specific department, but coordinated through the city manager's office.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So in the city manager's office, will we have is there a goal moving forward to have a climate officer or climate action officer, anyone that will be able to take this project on and move it forward through the years?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes. So we're going to be having a task force type model to really maintain accountability and to have a governance structure. It'll be led by our assistant city manager, Linda Tatum, who's got a lot of experience in this area from her previous oversight over development services.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If we need to be bringing on dedicated staff, you know that go beyond that. We'll have to address that through our budget process. But we believe we'll have the initial governance structure run kind of each department will have representatives.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We have Linda kind of at the top and then we'll use some analyst support as we need to in our office to help support that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's fantastic. And I know Linda is extremely well versed on this topic because we worked with her, all of us worked with her on this before her current position. So that's great to have her leading the team. The other question that I had was for development services in terms of how this plan gets merged with our city'",
        "'speaker_3': 'policies in terms of buildings or other zoning type of regulations that we might want to adopt. Is that currently being folded into our applications? Let's say I know for Coastal Commission, for example, any project that we put forth, this Coastal Commission has components of this adaptation plan that's required by that regulatory agency.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So is that something that's already being factored into our our plans moving forward in terms of permitting, planning, developing specific plans and zoning and things of that nature?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Sure. So Councilmember, on the adaptation side, absolutely. That's part of our permitting process. And we want to be aware of sea level rise and other climate risk. At the same time, I think it's just important to remember that on the reduction side, these are reductions that are going to be achieved by the city and everyone that lives'",
        "'speaker_5': 'in the city and every business in the city working together. So we've been very careful not to balance the budget, so to speak, on the carbon carbon reductions, on only new development or only on the business sector. So you will see minor changes to affect, you know, sort of those sectors.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But really, the on the reduction side is going to be achieved by small changes across all of society here in the city of Long Beach. So it's not going to it's designed not to burden any individual, new business or new construction, but rather to be something that everyone contributes to in some way.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I hope that answers your question.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It does work in terms of controlling.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Price for 5 minutes are up.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. I'll just finish the thought of converting our existing facilities so that they're most energy efficient would be a major priority and I'm sure something that we can apply for matching grant funds for. And I know that the city manager's team will be looking at that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So thank you very much. I appreciate all the answers.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And then to close this up, we have Councilman Sun in there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I will be quick. I know that this has been long and that this this plan has a lot a lot of information in it. One of the things that I wanted to say that Councilman Price did touch upon was the fact that we now have are moving this plan under the city manager's office, which is a'",
        "'speaker_3': 'huge win. I know that this is going to be a good place for this plan, but I also want to thank the ability department for all of their work on this on this plan, but really happy to see it in the city manager's office, as well as the fact that I am a big a big fan of'",
        "'speaker_3': 'leading by example. And I was wondering if someone on staff could explain to me how we might be able to lay out a specific timeline for our city government, for us ourselves to transition to 100% green. And renewable energy.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Do we have a timeline for that?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So that'll be part of it. Sorry, this is Tom. So that'll be a part of when the plan is adopted. Then we go into implementation mode on that. That is, if I memory recall, as from the discussion on CAAs, that's probably about a 3 to $4 million price tag to go to that level of 100%.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So that's tough to do in any single year. I think we would look at a phased in implementation plan, but that is what we're trying to do in this plan is to lead by example. So before we asked residents to do about 10% of residents to sign in to that plan to do 100% green power, we wanted'",
        "'speaker_6': 'to lead by example, so we'll need to plan that in in our financial projections. I do think it'll take several years to get there just because we're facing some budget deficits, but we would include that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Just simply wonderful. Thank you for explaining that to me. Time. With that, I'd like to just say thank you once again.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I'm going to make some closing comments. Wait. Actually, I'm sorry. Councilman Allen, did you did you come back up? I think you may have another question. Sorry about that. Councilman Allen.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes, I do have one more question. And one of the things I would like for the staff to speak on is how can we prioritize activities that deliver the most improvement on our day to day life by aligning with the state requirements?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Can someone speak on that?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So this plan has already prioritized actions based on the metric cubic tons of CO2 that are reduced. So there are a number of actions. There's several dozen actions in the plan. But the ones that we showed you on the PowerPoint slides are the ones where we get the most bang for our buck, we get the most actual'",
        "'speaker_5': 'reduction. So the plan has already gone through that prioritization, and I think we'll be doing some more materials for the public. But I think. If you think about achieving that 10 to 30% reduction, you're in your own life.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's things that are not one time but are recurring. So when we talk about building energy and making buildings more efficient and we talk about transportation and clean vehicles, you know, as COVID subsides, you know, for the individual residents, it's about can they make one trip per week, not just one time, but per week, you know, on'",
        "'speaker_5': 'foot or on a bicycle rather than in a in a car? Can they think about their next vehicle being electric? So we're going to put together some more public outreach materials as we switch from plan preparation to plan implementation.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And that will really help the public better understand their piece of how they prioritize actions. But in terms of the actions in the plan itself, we've already done that prioritizing, and that's based on the amount of carbon reduction and ranking those those measures.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you so much for that. And again, I just appreciate all your hard work on.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And I'm just going to wrap us up. I want to just first thank the staff. Amazing work. This is really a significant, huge contribution to the work around climate change and climate action and ensuring that we have a safe city for all of our healthy families.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I want to thank the staff who put in a tremendous amount of work on this. I also want to give a shout out to former Councilmember Pearce. She really wanted push to get this before she you know, her term was up and we tried, but she wanted to come out.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right. And I want to thank her for that. And I know the amount of work that she also spent with staff time. So just a shout out to her and to this entire body. Thank you for your incredible work.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Folks on on this body have been working on this plan incredibly hard. And I can think about community meetings and think about, you know, Councilman Price or some of the early meetings in her district that I think happened first.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And the involvement of of Councilmember Super not particularly what he was on the Sustainability Commission. The contributions that our council members in the North have made on the issues that matter around equity issues, basically. Richardson So everyone has played a big part in this climate climate action plan and the community has as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So a huge thank you to the community. I want to just note as we move on to this next, you know, kind of E.R. phase that and I mentioned this to staff already, we have still a lot of work to do as it relates to to oil.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I just want to I know that it's referenced and I think cause we're super and I brought it up. But I think as we as we move forward and we have to also put and dig in a more on how we really, really reduce our fossil fuel consumption and how we really transition from, you know, an'",
        "'speaker_0': 'oil economy that has been for many years very beneficial from a revenue perspective to the city. And we depend a lot, of course, on oil, but it's also damaging our community and it damages the planet and it damages our long term ability to be sustainable.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so we we have to redouble our efforts in that transition away from oil. And I think that that is a both a part of this discussion, and it certainly is in the plan, but it has to be part of a much broader discussion as well, and one that needs to be more aggressive and that this body'",
        "'speaker_0': 'has to weigh in on, because so much of our services that are dependent and have been for for decades are on oil and how and how oil the tidelands is doing and so many other aspects. And that's a conversation I look forward to having.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And it's one where I think this council is ready to weigh in on. And I want to thank again the staff for their incredible work on this issue. And with that, I want to turn this over to the clerk for the roll call.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'District one.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'District two. I. District three.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'District four.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'District five.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'District six. Park District seven. District eight.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'II.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'District nine.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Motion carries.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Appreciate the great work here. And again, thank you. And a huge milestone. Well, that concludes the agenda. We are going to go to two closing comments. I do want to really, really close with a few a few folks that we're going to close the meeting in remembrance of some amazing people.'"
