        "'speaker_4': 'Over the past few months, I've been and my staff has been following the efforts of the Long Beach Human Trafficking Task Force. Specifically with relation to the Senate Bill 1193. This agenda item tonight is to support those efforts on enforcing this law and to further the city's commitment to combating human trafficking.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'SB 1193 requires specific businesses and other establishments to post a notice that concerns contains information related to slavery and human trafficking, including information hotlines for specified nonprofit organizations that provide services and aid that aid in the rescue of those victims.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The hotlines are toll free and available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. There are also anonymous, confidential and accessible in numerous languages. The 12 types of businesses and establishments that are required to post those are most likely to be used by trafficked individuals.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Currently, an enforcement plan has been developed by the Human Relations, the Human Trafficking Task Force, in partnership with our city prosecutor's office. I'm asking that. It's asking that the city create an enforcement plan to assist in those efforts and ensure that all proper sites comply with comply with this poster law.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So at this point, I'd just like to ask for an update on where we are with the implementation of this enforcement plan.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Vice Mayor Lowenthal.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And council members Councilmember Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'City staff from various.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Departments.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Will be working together to create.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'That meet the criteria.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's established.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Great. So at this point, I'd like to just so I've made the motion, but I'd like to go ahead and just inquire with the city attorney about those specific types of businesses. Could you just state what those businesses are that are listed in this law?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Vice Mayor Members of the Council. Yes, the there's actually 12 in the civil code section 52.6. I do point out that they are for on sale general purpose premises consumption maybe under under the ABC act. Adult or sexually orientated businesses.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Primary airports. Inner City Passenger rail or light rail stations. Bus stations. Truck stops. Emergency rooms within urgent care centers. Farm labor contracts. Privately operated job recruitment centers. Roadside rest areas. Business or establishments that offer massage or body work services.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Those are the 12 currently listed under Civil Code 52.6.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So are there any. So can you just update me on what other states or other agencies have done in terms of including motels as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'As other other states or other jurisdictions have looked at the options of requiring the notice that either hotels are motels, if there has been a conviction at the location for certain enumerated crimes, including solicitation or prostitution.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. So with my motion, I also want you to I'd like for you to come back with some options on whether it's legal or appropriate to explore, maybe going a little a step further with this bill. I mean, with this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah. With enforcement of this bill. By including motels, is that something you can do?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We could certainly research that and get back to you. Councilmember Great.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you so much.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilmember Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I want to thank Councilmember Richardson for bringing this forward. I think this is very important, especially since PD has been working so very hard on this already. My question goes to the various languages. I think I meant I read something that had mentioned a couple of them, but I don't know what is covered currently or what we'",
        "'speaker_5': 'would legally be required to do. Anyone know?'",
        "'speaker_0': '17 Vice Mayor members of the council. Yes. The under the current section of the Civil Code, these enumerated businesses, which I read would be required to post in the code section itself. It talks about the size of the notice and what the content of the notice should say.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's also available on the Attorney General's website and working with the police department and the other departments. There will be a concerted effort to make sure that these businesses that are located in Long Beach will have the necessary language posted in their facilities.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The the language provides for civil penalties. So I work with the prosecutor's office on this, but I anticipate our office would be through our code enforcement individuals. We would be if there is a problem where they're not posting it, we would be contacting them, advising them of the penalties associated with not posting and making sure that we'",
        "'speaker_0': 'gain compliance.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Which languages would be required to? I don't know. Oh.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm sorry. Yes. Under the Civil Code section, the notice to be posted is printed in English, Spanish and one other language that is most widely spoken language in the in the county where the establishment is located.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Oh, it's in the county. Not specific to the city, though.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So that's correct under the civil code.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Because I would think that in some areas, I mean, especially along Cambodia town, I mean, it'd be nice to have something in, but I don't know if there's something we could.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Currently we were limited to the statute. The an option might be is is or you could refer potential amendments to this bill to the state led committee and they could certainly talk about it on a statewide level if you wanted it made changes there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We're going to be looking at options for the city, for Councilmember Richardson's memo. We could look at this. Also.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Can we friendly amend an amendment that as well?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Absolutely.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay, great.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilmember Andrews.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And thank you, vice mayor. You know, I'm happy to see that this enforcement piece has been, you know, included in this agenda. You know, this is definitely a great idea because it's about protecting our community. And I would like to think the human trafficking, you know, task force and community and Councilman Rex Richardson taking leadership on this'",
        "'speaker_7': 'and bringing it forward. I appreciate this very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilmember your Yarrawonga.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, bass player. I have a couple of questions in regards to I know it's probably described somewhere in terms of SB 1193 in regards to what is the definition of human trafficking, because I'm sure that there are many instances and broader definitions of just sexual oriented abuses of people who I'm sure that there's others as well'",
        "'speaker_0': '. Is there a definition in here somewhere that I can refer to in terms of what is a definition of human trafficking and slavery? That I can look at. Is it in the bill itself or vice mayor or members of the council?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It is not included in the bill itself. Because I would I would define slavery. Ed, for example, as what takes place more commonly is sweatshop. For example, people who are working in the sweatshop, working under adverse working conditions, not being let out to go take breaks and that type of stuff.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So is that included in this? Would it be would it be incorrect for me to to include that in there? The current thing is. Definition I'm sorry. Thing. If you or someone you know is being forced to engage in any activity and cannot leave, whether it is commercial sex, housework, farm work, construction, factory retail or restaurant work'",
        "'speaker_0': 'or any other activity, call the national human trafficking resource. So while they don't specifically define it, they they do indicate in a very broad sense, the areas in which if an individual feels that they're impacted by any of those areas, they give the 24 hour hotline numbers on the notice and then it describes the hotline and it's'",
        "'speaker_0': 'toll free, anonymous, etc.. Okay. So when we're talking also about potential penalties, we're looking at any establishment that refuses to post these notices. That is correct. The first offense pursuant to the Civil Code section is $500 in subsequent offense or $1,000.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And how would that enforcement take place? Would that be through our police officers or inspectors or various other types of agencies that would be entering these establishments? Yes, the the if the establishment is is failing to comply, obviously, our goal is to get full compliance.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And if they're not in compliance, we would probably be referred to us and we would reach out to them to contact them and and indicate to them what their penalty assessments are. If they did not do so, then we would go forward with a civil assessment and try and get an award for the either thousand or 500'",
        "'speaker_0': 'and then subsequent thousand dollar assessment penalties. Well, that definitely is pretty broad. And I'm just wondering how many establishments are we are we talking about I mean, you're looking at liquor stores, you're looking at markets, you're looking at mom and pop shops.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You know, it could be pretty expensive. How is that cost going to be covered in regards to the printing and the distribution of these notices? Is there a plan? That's that would be the responsibility of the business owner.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Our responsibility is to ensure that they do it and comply. Okay. Clarification, the business owner posted. How are we going to how are we going to get that to them? Are they going to come to city hall and pick up a bunch of posters or what?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We would talk in our committee, as Commander Lopez talked about, but more than likely would provide samples of posters or documents that are recommended by the state. And then it would be the responsibility of the business to have those photocopied or created and posted.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Also, there was a discussion about language. We're talking about the county. We know that sometimes that sometimes we know we have a problem that's in human trafficking and it's an international problem covering many cultures, many languages. And it seems that we're going to be limited to a very few languages around here and that even Carmine was listed'",
        "'speaker_0': '. In Tagalog, it would be in the West Long Beach area is an example of how we how are we going to address that issue in terms of the target that we want to address in regards to people being aware that human trafficking is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Natalie Allen.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Councilmember Barunga. One thing that we can do besides an educational campaign for the whole community is we can post these requirements on the city website also so that the community can be aware of it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We can also.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Seek.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Voluntary compliance.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'With businesses in different parts of town where the language may be different than that. Third most common language in the county. In the county.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think that's it for a nice clarification.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. And I want to thank my and my colleagues for bringing this item forward. This is certainly an issue that that has plagued our society. And Long Beach is no exception. Some of our business corridors and what goes on behind closed doors is actually appalling.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so I commend that human trafficking task force and my colleagues for for bringing this forward. I think this is a no brainer, something that we do have to support here this evening. And so I'll certainly be voting in support of this.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But I did have a couple of just clear point questions. Regarding the point is that established in the legislation. And is that specifically does it come to the local government or does it go to the state.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Vice mayor or members of the council? That that's an excellent question. The the fine is established in the civil code. I don't have an answer for you tonight on where the money goes, whether the city or jurisdiction gets to keep that or it goes into the court system and we get a small percentage of that fine.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I believe it would it would be the latter.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. And then when you in the item, it makes references to the following businesses and establishments that are required to post the notice. Number two, who refers to adult or sexually oriented businesses? Is there a definition for that or is that just a broad kind of stroke?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There is a definition in that adult or sexually orientated businesses as defined in Subdivision A of Section 318.5 of the Penal Code. I don't have that in front of me to read it to you, but I can provide it to you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'll be happy to to research that on my own. Like I said, I don't think there's anything here that prohibit my support for this this item. But I wanted some clarification. And Councilmember Richardson mentioned motels. Obviously, that's not included in the type of businesses.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We do know that there are. And I don't want to. I don't want to generalize any type of business, but massage parlors where I know there has been calls for service and issues with human trafficking activity, is would that be considered under this number two definition or is this something that we would have to look at.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Including possibly vice members of the council? I believe that would be included under number 12 business or establishments that offer massage or body work services for compensation.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Oh, good catch. I have no further questions.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilmember Turanga.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. Yeah. Well, I had one more thing I forgot to mention is that now that the work of the task force and I thank them for their work has been completed. Is there a monitoring mechanism that we're going to establish here, maybe through the Human Relations Commission, in regards to how how we're doing with this with this'",
        "'speaker_0': 'effort? I'm at this stage, we don't know exactly how we'll monitor, but that's something that Commander Lopez and the department teams will work on probably through business licenses. And we certainly could report back on a regular basis to the city council and perhaps a suggestion to Councilmember Austin's inquiry about the penalties and where it goes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I would suggest maybe establishing some kind of child fund or a victims fund to help individuals get back on track.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. There's been a motion and a second. I'd also like to just add that my own gratitude to Councilmember Richardson for his interest in this subject. I know we have members in the audience that are very supportive of this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's extremely important to encourage the public awareness. And we have folks that have been doing that. And for us to join as a city to help with that I think is critical. Hopefully we will inspire victims and would be victims to seek help.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There's clearly a common misconception that these are somehow victimless crimes. We hear that time and time again, and those in the community, the advocacy community, have highlighted for us how that, in fact, is just a fallacy and a false narrative.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'My thanks to our city prosecutor Doug Halbert and our human trafficking task force for your focus on this and related crimes that upend families and demoralize communities. And I think we can only improve our efforts as we work together.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'With that, is there any member of the order of the audience that would like to address this council on item five? Please come forward. State your name.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Hello. Virginia's aunt with a human trafficking task force. I'd like to thank Richardson for bringing this forward to the council tonight. We're happy to have your support behind us. Thank you. And I just. Just a few comments. One is that, sir, before this law was passed, survivors were asked what would help those victims who are currently in'",
        "'speaker_5': 'the life. And over and over again, they said if they had more information. So having this phone number out in public places for victims to see and have access to is very important and helping them get out of the life.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I thank you for your help and support on this. Also, I just wanted to make one comment too about the posters and the language. We do actually have a poster that's made with it's one poster and it has the language in English, Spanish and Kami on it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we do have that in the language came from this, the secretary of state of California. And so thank you all for your support.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Anyone else. Please come forward and state your name.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes. The city prosecutors should be commended. This is a very serious subject, equally serious. And I'm wondering whether or not there's a way of developing it since you're dealing with the massage dynamics. Whether or not we can establish of a program to go after those that are involved, particularly those in this building, of massaging the numbers, if'",

        "'speaker_7': 'So the city cannot develop a program.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'So in conversations with our city prosecutor, Doug Halbert, over the you know, in the in recent months, about a number of our key initiatives that are taking place around human trafficking, I learned of a very interesting program that he's brought forward and that I would I wanted to provide the opportunity for our city prosecutor to help inform'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the council about the Johns exposed programs. So that said, I'll turn it over to our city prosecutor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, thank you. Quick report on the Johns Exposed program. I sent a memo to the city council in late October explaining how my office is going to join some other prosecuting agencies in publishing the the pictures and the names and the charges of defendants who have been convicted of crimes related to prostitution, the so-called johns.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The reason that our office started to do this is along the lines of other discussion tonight, it's generally realized that human trafficking obviously exists because there is a great deal of demand for it. In fact, the United Nations Office on Drug and Crime estimates that the total market value of human trafficking is $32 billion per year worldwide'",
        "'speaker_0': '. In order to help law enforcement and other agencies trying to stem the demand. We've decided to take the step of making it public when people are arrested, charged and actually convicted of the crime of prostitution. The charges for human trafficking are very severe.'",
        "'speaker_0': '15 years in jail for human trafficking. 8 to 6 years for pimping the charges. Most charges, though, most cases don't result in those serious charges. They're misdemeanor prostitution cases, even aiding and abetting a prostitute, which in many times we realize is someone who may be a pimp.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That case is handled as a misdemeanor because there's not enough evidence to file felony charges by actually exposing these people and putting their face in their name and open them up. Opening them up to public inspection, I think will hopefully help over a long period of time reduce the number of people who are actively seeking sex for'",
        "'speaker_0': 'for money. The idea of posting the names, I have to say, did not originate with my office. There were a number of volunteers with the human chain human trafficking task force that came to us. The police department also made some very good suggestions and sometime in early November we started posting them on our website and they are'",
        "'speaker_0': 'in fact posted on our website right now. We're going to continue to do it over the course of the year as more and more convictions are secured. And I just wanted to mention this. This is just one of many, many things happening.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I do not pretend that this is going to change prostitution in our town overnight. I think this is one of 100 things the city is doing, that the city council is doing, that the police department is doing, that the community is doing that hopefully will show and bring awareness to this problem.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'When when a person engages in prostitution on the on the buyer side, they are quite often doing business with criminal street gangs. They are quite often putting themselves in harm's way. There are many examples of very serious crimes that result as as these crimes unfold.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So there are serious consequences. One more consequence is the publishing and posting of a name and a case number and a conviction charge and conviction date. The last thing I would add is that we do not make. We do not post information for subjects who are simply arrested or who simply have charges filed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We do it upon the conviction. So we make sure that either a jury has found the person guilty or they have admitted guilt in a court of law. The conviction is a public record. We do not want to invade the privacy of people who are charged, but once they are convicted, we do want to make that known'",

        "'speaker_2': 'I think the handout and a short synopsis will be fabulous unless you have an interpretive dance you'd like to offer with that. But.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'In short. Brief synopsis. Honorable Council Members Metro provides an opportunity for local jurisdictions to apply for projects that improves transportation. Pedestrian activities, bicycle activities and so forth. So this is called cold call for projects. It happens approximately every two years or three years.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And it is slated for this call for projects, is slated for moneys to be awarded in 2020 or 2021. So we're looking for a five year or six year period. We have identified eight projects. Two of these projects have been previously applied for, but we were not successful.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Reason being is Metro uses very complicated system to grade the agencies. So we have taken those two projects that we have previously applied and we have improved upon them. So to increase our chances of winning. So there are eight projects.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'One category is regional surface transportation improvement. That includes the seventh Street connectivity. Basically, we're looking for enhancing the entire seventh Street corridor between the Shoemaker Bridge towards East, and that includes bicycle, pedestrian traffic, signal modernization, synchronization and so forth.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'In the same category is Artesia Complete Boulevard, and that's the same vision that Councilmember Rex Richardson had through the COG. So this is going to kind of kickstart this process. And if we're this is all contingent upon if we're selected and we are where the winners of these grants, we have three bicycle improvement projects, which is one'",
        "'speaker_6': 'is Walnut and 52nd Street. The other one is Atherton Bridge and Campus Connection. And finally, it's the L.A. River Gap Closure. Those are the three bicycle improvement projects that we're submitting. For our pedestrian improvements. We had a downtown pedestrian improvement project, which is in Council District one and two.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We also have a signal synchronization and bus bus speed improvements. This is on seventh Street, Fourth and Broadway that. It's the entire corridor. And finally, we have one last category, which was transportation demand management, which is part can, right?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So and in the few following pages you will see, we have shown the estimated project cost, estimated grant request and the match. A metro requires that we have a minimum 20% match. We have shown the funding sources and none of them are the general fund.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We're using transportation funds to match these and also the 20% is minimum. We haven't made a strategic decision yet. If we want to increase that to two basically by points, by increasing our match will have a higher chance of winning.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Councilwoman Gonzalez?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes, I think you are. These are great projects. I'm very excited to see a few of them in the First District. And my question is geared towards the great seventh Street, the Connectivity Project. Now, how will that be married, I guess, with our park?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I mean, is that I know that's in the works.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Correct. So the guy Minor Park project, if you can envision or visualize, it's between Alamitos and Atlantic. So we are trying to mimic the same kind of traffic enhancement that is west of Atlantic, all the way to Shoemaker Bridge.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This is again has to marry up with the future Shoemaker Bridge and looking at more of a complete street, maybe decoupling the traffic all the way to the Shoemaker Bridge. So those are all possibilities that will be studying.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'The one question I need to and I want to ask and what is to make sure? That we don't have a repetition of what we had when grant monies. From various different agencies, including those that get those transportation monies, including the people that put money in a bucket at a concert, including money from the state and the'",

I remember when I began as chief of staff four years ago, we were able to have four staff people and then that'",

        "'speaker_4': 'in-house. So I think the work that's placed into having an office holder to go out and raise dollars to support these things, it's it's necessary. Secondly, you know, a number of the committee assignments that I was given upon taking office, they require travel.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I was placed on the National League of Cities and was not able to go to that to that conference, the first Fed alleged visit. My budget could not support a trip. And actually, you know, our mayor's office denied us attending because our budget did not have the availability to go.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we had you know, so we had a healthy bit of discussion about this. So I feel very strongly that considering that there's been over a six figure cut in our office budgets to talk about raising on the private side $30,000 that, you know, to negotiate it down to 20 out of the sake of not having enough'",
        "'speaker_4': 'discussion, I don't know that that's really a fair conversation. So that said, I'd like to offer a substitute substitute motion. So my substitute substitute motion would be to go back to $30,000 and $75,000 for me, or $30,000 for city council and $75,000 for mayor.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And to add in a CPI to build in a CPI consistent with the same levels that our campaign finance limits are in the election code for elections.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Councilwoman Gonzalez Yeah, I would add that, you know, our committee worked very hard. I think we're a committee that has done tremendous work, both myself as the Chair, Councilmember Turanga and Councilmember Mungo. We based this off of information based on adjacent cities.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So this wasn't just an arbitrary number we picked out of the sky. This was information that we we we received from various cities that are our size, are larger, and we're pretty much behind the times. We're a little bit antiquated in our policies.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And our main goal here is to reform a lot of our campaign finance policies. This was something that we could do and that was attainable. We all agree that the largeness, largeness of our city, the complexity of our city would certainly make sense for us to increase our officeholder accounts, both on the mayor side, the city wide'",
        "'speaker_5': 'side, and the city council side. And inflation, your rate hasn't gone up. It's not based on that, but it is based on a lot of our council budgets going down with RDA gone, with the discretionary funding gone, we do have to find other facets to be able to take care of our communities.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so I see this as certainly one of them. And so that's my certainly my stance. I believe that the substitute substitute motion will take care of that, and I hope that we can move forward with that substitute substitute motion.'",

So the issue that I would take with this would be the increase to the citywide electeds would be a three times increase, whereas a'",

        "'speaker_5': 'I remember that argument from when we first debated this at Hampton Park, the committee's research came from other comparable cities. Yes. And it wasn't to be proportional. The mayor isn't three times more demanded at events or community functions or anything like that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It came from looking at comparable cities and comparable officeholder accounts and the such. So I feel like the original intent of the committee at 2575 with an adjustment for CPI two, both would be the most logical.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And a compromise.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Between many people.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I get that. And what I would say is, is there. So which cities and specifically more specifically, which cities of a comparable size are you comparing us to?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So they pulled together a bunch of charts and brought them to the meeting. Larry Herrera brought forward documentation, which I don't have with me tonight, but I could have someone run up to the office. And Paul, do you remember Councilman?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Anaheim was on the list, but I think Anaheim and I think our city attorney is up to speak as well. So maybe I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Have that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'd like to know about Anaheim and Los Angeles, and let's just hash out this and figure it out right now.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Anaheim, almost a thousand per donation. If I might if I might weigh in. Councilmember Richardson, this is this right? Councilmember Richardson, may I address this? I know in the spirit of compromise, this is something that's been vetted by the committee for quite some time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It was vetted in a very healthy way the last time this came up on the council floor. So. There is a substitute substitute motion made by Councilmember Richardson, seconded by Councilwoman Gonzales. I have. Councilman Mongo, is there anything further?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We're seeing the friendly amendment to restore to the committee's original intent of 2575, incorporating Councilmember Richardson CPI.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm not in support of that. So no.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilwoman Pryce.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. I appreciate everyone's comments. One thing I want to point out, and I hope it's something that we can respect as a body, not just today, but moving forward is if an idea or a concept is discussed in committee.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And no doubt every single member of this board, this council works diligently on their various committees. No doubt I have full respect for the work that comes out of committee. However, it is perfectly acceptable and appropriate for council colleagues who don't sit on that committee to question certain aspects of the findings and recommendations of that committee.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's actually our job and that's what the taxpayers have elected us to do. So. So I appreciate and I think last week I said several times that I appreciated the work of the committee and and my thoughts on the issue were no reflection at all on the work of the committee.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Furthermore, if an item comes before us and then we give a recommendation and we have a debate and the recommendation results in an item coming to us for a first reading and a second reading. The whole point of that gap in time is to allow an elected body to vet a particular idea, a proposal, a change with'",
        "'speaker_5': 'their citizenry, with their community, to study up on it, to find out what the vibe is, to see how they feel about it. Because the decisions that we make, when I press this button here, this is a decision I have to live with.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's my conscience. It's something that I have to be comfortable with. And if I express hesitation one week and do some more research and learn more about it, I'm not tied to what happened the week before. That's the whole point.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's why the system requires a first reading and a second reading. So, you know, I've heard this in the past and I've tried really hard. I know it doesn't seem like it, but I do try to bite my lip when I hear things like we already talked about this.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Why are we talking about this again? The whole reason there was a first reading and a second reading is so that we can have an opportunity to further educate ourselves. And if there's an issue that we feel uncomfortable about it to to to say it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I started off this discussion tonight by saying we can agree to disagree. I don't want to talk about it any further because I didn't want to make anyone feel uncomfortable. It's my personal belief is that fund raising and raising the limits adds noise in an area that we don't need.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I understand. I don't I'm sure the committee did their research on what other cities do. And sometimes what other cities are doing is something that we can learn from and grow from and adopt in our own city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But sometimes we can simply say, we are Long Beach. We are different. We do things differently. We reject certain things that aren't healthy in other communities. Just because other communities are doing them doesn't mean they're healthy for us.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And that's my opinion. So there are many things that the City of L.A. is doing that's fantastic and great and would be great for us to incorporate. There are a lot of things that are doing that I don't want to see here in the city of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I've had that attitude in my job in in every in everything in my life. You do what's right at the moment, not based on what everybody else is doing. So with that, I have a feeling I'm not going to be doing what everyone else is doing tonight, and that's okay.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But when we're talking about, you know, we already went through this or this already went through, you know, every single time an item comes before us, it's an opportunity to express concerns, support, hesitation, whatever the case may be.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's my right as a member of this council, and I'm going to exercise that right. I'm not going to be bullied into. We already talked about it. Why are we talking about it again? I will talk about it until I feel like I don't need to talk about it any more.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And tonight I tried not to talk about it. For the record. Thank.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilwoman Pryce. I appreciate that. I think my comments were directed at Council Member Richardson in expressing my own opinion that that's where I'm coming from, that I felt that it was a thorough discussion and I'm satisfied with that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It is not to influence yours or anyone else's. But expressing my own, I oftentimes, as with everyone else, we all express our opinions differently, as you just did. And that was my way of expressing my opinion that I have great appreciation for the work of the committee as well as the discussion we had last week, and that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I am satisfied with that. That is a personal opinion of mine and I hope that the remarks you just made, you will ensure that you regard everyone else's way of expressing their opinion that way. That was mine. City Attorney.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Vice members of the council, just for a point of order. On the third motion, the substitute substitute motion to return the limits to 30 and 75 and add the CPI. If that motion is successful this evening, then it will come back for a first reading again on February 3rd.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'By adding the CPI adjustment. That's a substantial change in requires to come back two more times. So that just FYI.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilmember Richardson, if I might ask perhaps that you can ask for a report on on the potential of adding CPI later as opposed to adding that. Would that would that keep it?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That makes a lot of sense. Is that would that keep this as a first reading?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The the problem with removing that as then it's not a substitute substitute. You're basically making the first motion. And so you would go to your second motion first.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know, you actually, Mr. City Attorney, it would be a substitute substitute to keep the the amounts. The same with the addition of asking for a report in 3 to 6 months, whichever the maker of the motion would like from staff or the committee on the concept of adding a CPI down the road.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I would disagree with the chair. The the motion that would pass would be the item of the recommend the recommendation in your your original motion. The request for a report is is not what would be relevant for what you would pass.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You would pass was actually recommended by council. So in essence it would be your original motion.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay, what was the substitute motion? If you can remind me.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The subsidy motion was to change the limits to $20,000 for city council and $50,000 citywide.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. We have a couple of more speakers that we can certainly take up the substitute motion and go back to the original if that is what ends up happening. Councilwoman Gonzalez. I'm sorry. Councilmember Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. So I think I think most of my concerns were were vetted out. But I wanted to just say that by no means, you know, is this discussion implying that folks shouldn't bring up certain topics. I think it's fine.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Absolutely fine. And I appreciate the fact that you, Ms.. Councilmember Price stated that she didn't want to talk about it. I agree. I don't want to talk about it either.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilmember Gonzalez. Councilwoman Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you again. We welcome the discussion. You know, this is a really healthy discussion. I think what where you know, it may get heated at times, but I think we can all respectfully agree to disagree, like Councilman Price had mentioned.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But I have to reiterate, you know, we're each representing about 50,000 constituents and $30,000 to me is but $50,000 individually in our districts, 500,000, half a million folks. And so $30,000 each to me is not really, really too much.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I'll I'll stand firm on that. And I respect the comments that have been made out there. But, you know, certainly I need to stand firm and what we originally decided.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilmember Urunga.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I totally agree with my colleague, Councilmember Gonzalez in this call for the question.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Are we voting on the substitute substitute council member Richardson?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I would love to get back to the original motion to vote on. So what I what I'm going to do is I'm going to withdraw my substitute substitute and I'm going to encourage my colleagues to vote no on the substitute motion.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilmember Richardson and I will do the same. I will ask my colleagues to vote no on the substitute motion. We are taking up the substitute motion at this time. Members, cast your vote.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Public comment.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm sorry. Is there any member of the public that wishes to address Council on item 16?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Very good. The clerk has the address. First, I would suggest you hold off because I don't want to embarrass anybody. But I would ask I would think that if I. Each one of you had to stand up now.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Insight sentence for sentence, what you're voting on. I don't think you know what you're voting on, period. All right. At the end of this day, nothing's going to, you know, a day, another week is not going to rock the boat.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'What I have serious issues with this and there's no issue with having a fund. Period. It's how it is. I understand it. Unless my information is wrong. Some of these monies are all of these monies could be if you wanted get to some political dynamic within to a labor union or to the Chamber of Commerce.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Is that a that needs to be clarified, because if that is the case, that should not be done, period. It should be only for legitimate parks, neighborhood association improvement projects and things like that. There's an easy way to address the funding issue, quite frankly.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Is, first of all, cut travel. This is the high tech age. You don't need to travel, period. We have emails, we have Skype. We have teleconferences. We conduct wars by teleconference. Your only reason for traveling is to try to build your political career, period.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So go a couple of years without any travel. Secondly, you need to put sideboards on it so we don't have this type of thing. Again, the hymnal to hold know this hymnal of hosannas using taxpayer money. Or donations to fund some political hack or pipsqueak, period.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You do have a serious problem. I understand that with inflation and shortage of money, but that's very easy. Just cut out your travel. Period. And if, quite frankly, I'd even cut out your automobile, aren't I? Did you get a bus pass, period?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That's the way to solve that. But again, I before you vote. Stand up and recite exactly what you're voting on. If you do know it, you will have no problem. If you don't bring it back and think about it or think about it and then bring it back.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Members. There's been a substitute motion by Councilman Austin and seconded by Councilwoman Price. Please cast your vote. And this is on the substitute.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Motion fails.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right. We are now back to the original motion. Made by Councilman Andrews, seconded by Councilwoman Gonzalez. Members, please cast your vote.'",
