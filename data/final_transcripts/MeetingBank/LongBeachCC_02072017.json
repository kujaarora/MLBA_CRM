I want to thank both the civil service department and the Human Resources Department for working with us as we prepared to sign them and for the work you do each and every day to ensure that we hire the best employees possible here in the city of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It goes without saying that the city of Long Beach is one of the most diverse urban cities in America, and we should be striving to ensure that our workforce matches the diversity of our city. Diversity is a key driver of innovation and is a critical component of being successful in a large scale.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Many Fortune 500 companies look inward and adapt inclusion and diversity strategies. And I'm excited to take this first step towards developing such a strategy in our workforce in the city of Long Beach. As many of you may know, I worked for the city of Long Beach in a civil service department as a recruitment officer for the city'",
        "'speaker_9': '. In that role, I worked to ensure the city's employees and fire, police and other departments reflected the diversity of the city.

I think it's important that we use data in tracking and analysis to make sure that we are being intentional in terms of being diverse in our workforce and making sure that we as public employees reflect the community, that we community that'",
        "'speaker_10': 'we serve. And that's a challenge at times given, you know, there are, you know, laws we have to follow, process we have to follow, but we can always do data and reporting and those things are important to do.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So we should always have a good read on, you know, on a good gut check on where we are in terms of our diversity. Does our city, you know, does our workforce look like the crowd or does it look like our city council?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Well, we don't know and we'll find out. So thank you so much for doing that. And I'm glad to support you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I'm going to go ahead and let the city attorney has some comments and then I'm going to go to the rec down the rest of the. Those are plugged in.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, mayor. Members of the council councilmember during the. The motion includes under item B additional language regarding disability and veteran status. And there's ADA issues with recording and submitting those. So we will assume that your motion will say collect all of this data as applicable or in compliance with state law.'",

Trying to have a workforce that represents the constituency and the demographic makeup of the city is very important. And I think our city should be committed to that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I agree with Councilman Turanga that first and foremost, our recruitment commitment should be to finding the best candidate for the job regardless of their background. We certainly want to make sure that we have qualified candidates working in the city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But to the extent where we have the opportunity to allow for greater diversity in our workforce, we should definitely make that a priority. So thank you for this item, and thank you for including me.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. I, too, want to thank Councilmember Suranga for bringing this forward and the supporters of this item. I think it's great that we are looking at this a little deeper and that we can include we can look at diversity in so many different levels.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I do want to ask if we are able to and I must I believe it's in here and the intent of the item. But if we if I can offer a friendly amendment to add the LGBTQ community, I know when it says data should include gender, ethnicity, age, disability and veteran status.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'd like to see if we can include our LGBT community as in that as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mr. City, attorney.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Mayor, members of the council that maybe fall into another category where we don't record that or ask that at the time of the hiring. So we would want to be you and I, as I mentioned earlier, we would take the motion, be as forward as we can in compliance with state and federal law.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember, you really want to respond also.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Certainly understood.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That's correct. We would get all the information that we're legally entitled to accumulate and assimilate and then report back to you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. And I guess I was reading this a little bit differently because it's it's just in the practice of hiring, is that correct? So it's not after the fact as we are. Is that correct? I would have thought it would also be just our demographic after hiring.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But maybe I'm getting it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Incorrect, I think. Mr. City Attorney. I think what the councilman is asking for is, is are we doing data collection post hiring as well so that, you know, we track that on any sort of dashboard. Is that something that's possible?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If it is, maybe you can come back and let us know if we can if we can track information or voluntary, of course, on LGBT representation.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Okay.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'You know. One of the additional items I want to add to this and I didn't see it in the report, is I would like to have this institutionalized in respect to every year. I would like to have an update as to where we are in our hiring practices, the number of recruitments that we conducted or our hires'",
        "'speaker_9': ', and what the results of those recruitments were in hires on a yearly basis.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That included a yearly report. Thank you, Councilmember Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. And I want to thank my colleagues for bringing this forward. I think when we're drafting policy and talking about things that we're doing in the city. Overall, it's important to know if we're being reflective of our values.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so I thank you for that. So just clarity, if we're going to be doing this report yearly, this would be something that we would be able to look at our current staffing. I think that Councilmember Gonzalez just asked that question.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But city attorney, I wanted to just double confirm that we would be able to look at current higher staffing as well as ongoing. That's correct. And then I had another question, because it talks about building an online portal for this.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Is it something that we can already include in the open lbe data? This is already included in that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think the intention would be that it would be part of our open data portal.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Great. Thank you so much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Let me before we go to a vote and go to public comment, I just want to add that I'm a very, very supportive counselor here, and I want to thank you for moving this forward. I do want to also just recognize, I think, Mr. West, I think if you look at today, the the diversity of the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'management and the department heads, there has been great progress made just in the last few years. And, of course, it's not just folks that are that are reflective of the city, but incredibly qualified leaders in their field. And so that has been, I think, some important progress.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think to have a open dashboard that is open to the public and accessible to the public so that anyone can go in and view departments by departments and see hiring trends, whether it's gender equity issues or whether it's issues around diversity, I think is pretty exciting.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And all data that can be transparent and open I think is a really good thing. So I strongly support this thanks to the council members that are moving this forward. And is there any public comment on this item?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Please come forward.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Very good new Coke as he addressed. I've always thought the best standard to use is the same standard you'd use if you rushed your kid to the hospital. In critical condition. You could give a rodents rear end. What color?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Gender. Orientation the person is. You want the best that there is. And that's the only standard that should be used. Anything else? Invites disaster. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. Any other public comment? Please come forward.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'll just. My name is Anna Christensen. I feel compelled to speak. After this last speaker and point out that not everybody who rushed their child to the hospital was allowed in the hospital. We have a long history of discrimination in this country.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you so much for moving to change that. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. We have a motion in a second seeing no other public comment. Members, please go ahead and cast your vote on council or your rearranges motion.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilwoman Margo. Motion carries nine zero.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. Congratulations, Councilmember. And and just so you guys know, Councilman Rank has been working on these issues. This. This was one of your leading issues when you were on the College Board. And I remember because you would always, always bring it up on the board.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so thank you for for doing that. Let me move on now to our presentation on. We have a couple of items have all been moved up. And so just so we know the order so folks can can know what we're doing next.'"

Councilman Gonzalez's presentation on the Senate on the Senate bills moving forward. And then after that, we will have the conversation around 19, which is around the turfs and the turf field project.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So those are the next couple items. I think most people here are for though here for those items. And so we'll get try to get through those pretty quickly. So let me begin by going over the next item, please, which is going to be about the county homeless initiative.'",

        "'speaker_12': 'Thank you, Mr. City Manager. Just waiting for the PowerPoint to be loaded up here. But. Well, while we're waiting, I'll just go ahead and provide a brief summary of the expenditure plan and the ballot measure that will be before voters March 7th.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'That is coming up on March 7th. And generally speaking, it is a quarter cent sales tax for ten years. It is assessed county wide. There it is. Okay, here we go. Mrs. Measure H. A L.A. County ballot measure countywide again.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And the vote is on March 7th. And we'll do a quick overview with the purpose, the revenue mechanism, the election date, which is March 7th, as well as revenue collection methods. So the purpose of the present, the purpose of the ballot measure is to combat the homeless crisis in Los Angeles County.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And the revenue mechanism, as we had very briefly discussed, is a quarter percent special sales tax beginning July one, 2017. Short Measure H path. The county is estimating that this revenue mechanism will generate about 355 million annually and it will be for ten years.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Again. The election is on March 7th. And because this is a revenue measure, a dedicated sales tax to combat homeless, the homeless crisis in L.A. County, it does require a two thirds vote. So the ballot language is pretty simple.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'The snapshot there is what voters will see in their ballot when they go to the ballot box on March 7th. And the revenue collection is county wide. So this is a sales tax that is least county wide. So whether you shop in Long Beach or elsewhere in the county, you will be assessed the sales tax at some'",

So Long Beach, La mirada, Linwood, Pico Rivera, Santa monica, Southgate and Compton. All of these cities are at our local sales tax cup at the moment.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And so Measure H is written in a way that does not require us to give up any of the sales tax that we have are collecting as a part of measure A until measure A decreases in six years to a half percent sales tax, at which point in time in Long Beach we will be paying the quarter'",
        "'speaker_12': 'cent sales tax towards Measure H. So the baseline working information that we have.'",

So I think it's really important to note that the cities and listed that Mr. Tang listed behind us or have all essentially reached their sales'",

And so in in essence, if Measure H, which is put on by the county supervisors, were to pass the county in the election, then Long Beach residents would not pay into the tax until year six, which is when'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the measure a tax goes down. And then the the the the quarter cent would then go into the the tax. In addition to that that the tax would total is a total of ten years. Is that correct.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Excellent. So let me go ahead and continue.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So moving on, we are going to go over a couple of baseline working information that we have countywide need. The county has identified about 450 million in need per year and this is their unmet need. So in addition to what they are currently investing in homeless and housing services, they recently did a study that was published last'",
        "'speaker_12': 'year that demonstrates this amount. The county also did. A recent homeless population counts as a count of persons experiencing homelessness, and they're seeing a growing population as well as a growing population of unsheltered individuals who are experiencing homelessness.'",

If Measure H does pass and the expenditure plan is one that the County Board of Supervisors will adopt as part of their their their budget for the next fiscal year.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And if Measure H does pass in March, then a working group of approximately 50 individuals from across the county representing Council of Governments. The service providers will will come together and work on the recommended plan to present to the Board of Supervisors.'",

        "'speaker_12': 'issues that we are experiencing here as well as throughout the county. I'll really quickly go through the six investment areas that are stipulated in the framework that is in the ballot language resolution. The first one is to prevent homelessness.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Second is to subsidize housing. Third is to provide case management and services. Fourth, increase income for those who are experiencing homelessness so that they can sustain housing on their own. The fifth investment area is to create a coordinated, county wide system to address homelessness.'",

May We're hoping that that expenditure plan will start to come together and then in early May, take that expenditure plan out to the community and reach a consensus. Late May, the county homeless policy deputies will meet to review and discuss the recommendations that the working group has developed in order to present to the Board'",
        "'speaker_12': 'of Supervisors. And then in June, when the Board of Supervisors adopts their annual budget, they will also include in it and then expenditure plan for Measure H if the ballot measure does pass. So I'll at this time, turn it over to Kelly Culpepper, director of Health and Human Services, to go over homelessness and Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'So within the city of Long Beach, July 5th, 2016, the city council declared a state of emergency to combat homelessness within the city of Long Beach. When we conducted the 2015 count, we had 2345 individuals are experiencing homeless in the city.'",
        "'speaker_14': '94% or 3094 were unsheltered veterans, and 731 were what we consider chronic, unsheltered individuals. We just completed the point in time count two weeks ago. And so we are calculating those numbers now. So we'll have more current numbers available to us coming up in the next couple of months.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'We provide services on average to 1100 individuals and families each month through the Multi-Service Center and through the continuum of care for a total of over 13,000 client contacts over the course of a year. Right now with our service providers, we get about 90 to 100 requests for outreach and engagement every month at the Multi-Service Center for'",

That is from the Housing and Urban Development Continuum of Care Hour. We received when we were just announced a $7.6 million funding for this next year from the Continuum of Care.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'We also receive it. We also receive additional resources from private foundations and from the city as we move forward. So about $10.9 million a year specific to homeless services. We have the multi-service one stop shop where we folks who are homeless can come in, be assessed and connected to services and move toward permanent housing as well as'",
        "'speaker_14': 'we do a lot of street outreach. So we are out on the streets every day reaching out to individuals and families who are homeless to connect them to service. We have a lot of different housing and shelter opportunities within the city, so I'm not going to go through each of them.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'But you'll see that we have quite a continuum of housing with 1452 permanent supportive housing beds. We also run the winter shelter that's opened for three months and it looks like it may be extended this year for an additional few weeks.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'We also have emergency shelter opportunities. The Housing Authority provides 70 vouchers annually to individuals who are experiencing homelessness. And also we have over 700 vouchers for for veterans. So if they're coming through the VA, we are we are able to house them through the housing authority for veterans.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'And we also have supportive services. The heart team within the city is the fire department. They were here in front of the council in the last couple of weeks, really being able that are moving forward sort of street medicine and education to be able to connect with individuals who are homeless and then the quality of life teams'",
        "'speaker_14': 'through the police department. As we've looked at what our funding needs are moving forward and that we'd be looking to address through the Middle Ages a year round shelter permanent supportive, additional permanent supportive housing, transitional housing, additional rapid rehousing.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Preventative supportive services and mental health and substance abuse programs. And with that turn it of questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Let's go ahead and go. We're going to take questions first just because this is a measure item. So let me go through questions. I might turn it over to to Vice Mayor Richardson, and then I'll take it I'll take public comment as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But let me let me just make one clarification point that I think is important. Councilman Mongo also just clarified which is which is correct. Just to clarify the position that Mr. Heng and I said, of course, sales tax, as you all know, doesn't follow you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I just want to make sure that's clear so that the sales tax is not increased in Long Beach for Long Beach residents. But of course, someone who went to another city, that sales tax rate is depending on what the sales tax rate is over there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So. Well, that's you know, I know it's obvious to most. I just want to make sure we all know that sales tax doesn't follow us around. So. Right. Unless it's an automobile. Okay. So going on to Vice Mayor Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you. And before I get my my comments. So in terms of process, you want to go through a discussion before making any motions?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think it'd be I think if there's questions first, it'd be great to go through any questions on the measure. And then if there is going to be a motion, I also want to hear from the public if there's any public comment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I also know that there's one of the supervisors deputies is here who wants to comment, since I know that she put it on the agenda. So if we want to do some of those things, first, we can get back.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'To you because I want to make a motion here. So I think if everybody respects that, we'll just have that discussion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Let me let me do that first. Let me let me ask. I can Supervisor Janice Hahn was one of the two supervisors that put this on the ballot. So I know that Mr. Linda Chico is here representing the county supervisor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I know she wanted to say a few words about the motion she made for at the county level. So I'll start we'll start there.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Mary Garcia, for giving me the opportunity. Thank you, city council, for considering this item. As you know, Long Beach is the second largest city in L.A. County, and the supervisor is committed to working with the mayor, city council and staff on facing this crisis.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We've actually met quite a few times already addressing some of the issues. On any given night, there are 47,000 people living on the streets in L.A. County. 3000 of them are veterans, 4000 are children. So just over a week ago, the body of a homeless man was found in the fourth stoop of his aureole district in Wilmington'",
        "'speaker_8': '. He had been living in homeless camp. He had been living in a homeless encampment in Harbor City. And despite the best efforts of law enforcement, he was swept away and killed during a heavy storm. This is just one of the many heartbreaking tragedies caused by homelessness and a reminder that this problem has reached crisis level.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I participated in the homeless count here in Long Beach, and I got to tell you, the stories that we heard out there were heartbreaking. So that's why we're here today, to educate voters on Measure H using Measure H.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We will work to break the cycle of homelessness and connect people in need with proven solutions like mental health services, addiction programs, rapid rehousing and job training. With Measure H, we will work to move 45,000 people into permanent housing in five years and help another 30,000 people avoid homelessness.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Voters know that this is no longer a problem isolated to Skid Row or even the city of L.A.. Encampments are in communities, including Long Beach. I know there are some who have reservations about adding to the sales tax, but know that homelessness is already costing taxpayers in ways that are less productive and more painful.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The L.A. County Sheriff's Department spends $41 million annually on arrests, jail stays and probation supervision for homeless individuals. And we know that Long Beach PD is feeling the same impacts. Our health care system spends millions of dollars a year caring for sick individuals who would be healthier if they had a warm, dry place to sleep.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We are asking for this small sacrifice that will allow us to attack the causes of homelessness and provide real solutions. A quarter cent sales tax would amount to an extra dime on the price of a $40 sweater. A dollar on the cost of a $400 TV.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So both the South Bay COG and Gateway City's cog have voted to support Measure H. The election is on March 7th. And with this comprehensive plan, we're confident voters will say yes. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, thank you on behalf of the supervisor. And I'm going to what I'm going to do on that. Take it back to Vice Mayor Richardson. If you want to make a motion, that's fine. But I'm going to go through the the council comments and then go to any public comment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So. Vice Mayor Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So my thoughts on here. Well, first of all, thank you to Supervisor Hahn and to her, Linda, for coming down in and giving us those comments. And we do want to acknowledge and thank city staff for the presentation.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And this is something that we've we've all sort of paid attention to from different different points of view. But to have a presentation here in a solid action plan, I think makes a lot of sense. Something that stood out in that presentation was the number a half billion dollar a year problem.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And that's the gap that's not inclusive of the funding that's already allocated across the county. So it can be safe to say this is $1,000,000,000 a year problem with a half a billion dollar a year gap. And and we see this personally here in Long Beach and North Long Beach has been home to the winter shelter for'",
        "'speaker_10': 'the last five years or so. And we know that, you know, every year it's a rush for us to get it open. And and we know that we have a number of rights of ways flood channels, freeway on and off ramps that are very complex from an agency standpoint to get a handle on in terms of really'",
        "'speaker_10': 'counting and servicing the homeless in our community. It really requires a county wide coordinated solution. Just just here in Long Beach, along our river, you have the 17 freeway on ramp, the 91 freeway on ramp, Southern California Edison right away and county flood.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That means four different law enforcement agencies and multiple health agencies, just the direct service to one encampment. And it's it's completely challenging. So I'm really glad to see the county step up and really lead this this effort because we can't handle it alone as Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I think it's really interesting to note not only that, Long Beach residents wouldn't pay initially because I believe that they would, but the fact that we do maintain a seat at the table through the continuum of care says a lot about our health department and our city city team.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The fact that they've sort of carried on this fight and have built that respect countywide to make that happen. And I think that puts us in a really strong, unique position that we should, as a city, take a position in support of this.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And tonight, you know, the thought was this would be a receiving file presentation, but multiple councilmembers have expressed interest here and taken a position. And I didn't agree. So so I want to make a motion that the city council tonight takes a position in support of this measure and and communicate that position publicly.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. There's a motion. Is there a second, Councilman Ringo?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I want to thank Councilmember Richardson for making that motion, because as a member of the Gateway City Council government, I made a motion at that meeting to support this measure, and I'm glad that we're going to be moving that forward here today as well.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'There's no question that homelessness is an issue in Long Beach, and I think Councilmember Richardson. Oh, sorry. Excuse me. Vice Mayor Richardson brought brought the motion forward and basically described adequately as to what the issues are. And, you know, I have a major issue with homelessness in my district as well.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Just recently we had to vacate the Willow Springs Park from a major encampment that cost us hundreds of thousands of dollars to vacate because of the level of encampment that was there. So with a measure like this would be able to address that with less of a cost to the city.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And as has been described, there's no cost to us, not for at least six years. And that that would be the most significant part of this measure that we can live with. So as far as I could see, it's a win win situation for the for the city, for us to support this and to move forward with'",
        "'speaker_9': 'it. And it's a win win for the county as well. So I would wish to have the support of my colleagues as well in this on this motion. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. I think that one of the things that's remarkable about this opportunity is it really answers to questions. One of the things that came up with the increase in the sales taxes that neighboring cities would be less than ours now we would be closer to an even playing field, if not on an even playing field, determining depending'",
        "'speaker_5': 'on which city is discussed. And because of the way that the allocation structure is, the county supervisors were very mindful of knowing that just because homeless populations are residing in a particular city or the sales tax comes from a particular city, it doesn't necessarily mean that's how the distribution is.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We soon will have a mental health center that will service the region and therefore we would be a part of that. And so I would be very supportive of this motion. I think that on multiple levels this is really great for Long Beach and really great for the communities that have homeless individuals and the homeless individuals themselves'",
        "'speaker_5': '. So I really strongly support this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilmember Pierce.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you so much for the great presentation and to Janice Hahn's office for coming down and putting this on our agenda and in our attention and our minds. I know that homelessness is something that impacts our entire city, but in downtown we definitely feel the impacts in a very strong way.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'From Pine Avenue. Then branching out to retro are different business corridors, and each one of those people has a story that is unique to them that we in Long Beach for the last ten years have really changed the way that we think and talk about homelessness.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so really thankful that we've gotten to a point where we can have a measure like this, be something that so many people on our council want to take on and really thankful to have people like Kelly Colby and our staff that have worked really hard to say homelessness isn't just about moving out of our sidewalks, but'",
        "'speaker_8': 'homelessness is about moving into shelter. Homelessness is about finding a detox bed with love and care that we can help support people, change their lives. And it just really want to recognize this moment in history that ten years ago it wasn't like this in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The conversation was very different. And so I definitely support the motion made by the vice mayor. I wanted to ask one question of staff if someone could let us know if the residents of Long Beach decided to renew, measure or bring in another tax, would that affect this tax in Long Beach?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Mayor's member of council. I'll try and answer that. I think the answer is yes. It would impacted by the quarter percent. So in year six, when the city's tax is reduced by a half a percent, you create, if you will, a little room in the tax bucket.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It'll only go down in year six by a quarter percent because it'll be replaced by Measure H. So in theory, you have a quarter percent area that you could renew Measure eight, but you could not renew it for the full one half.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Let me also add just one other thing. I think it's important to note that I believe Measure H is a ten year. That is correct.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. Or in ten years, the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Measure a measure expires in, I believe in ten years as well. So. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. And then one other question. The work groups. I'm sorry if I missed it. Who compiles those work groups? Are we? What's the decision process for who's involved in that meeting?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'The County Board of Supervisors is compiling that working group. There are two representatives from each of the Council of Governments that will be requested to participate, as well as the service providers in the region, both those in Long Beach and countywide.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I believe the County Board of Supervisors, their deputies on the homeless issues will also be involved. So it will be a fairly large working group.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Great. Thank you so much. And thank you, everybody, for your hard work on this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. Baer. And I do appreciate the motion and I will be supportive. Measure H provides this critical issue of homelessness, the attention that it really deserves. I want to thank Supervisor Hahn and the Board of Supervisors for being bold in addressing this issue.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's all it's it is, actually. Well, the issue of homelessness has actually grown and transformed before our eyes in a very, very short period of time. The numbers have gone up significantly in the last just five years. As the president of the Gateway Cities Council of Governments.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I must mention that we do have a great continuum of care. This is not just a Long Beach problem. It's a regional problem. And the Gateway Cities also, as Councilmember Urunga mentioned just last week, voted to support this issue.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And this was 27 cities in the southeast counties coming together in support of this measure. I see this as a small sacrifice that we all can afford. This is a moral and humane commitment as citizens that we have to commit ourselves to to to really address this problem.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Nearly 50,000 homeless, homeless individuals in L.A. County is not acceptable. Of nearly 3000 in the city of Long Beach is clearly not acceptable. And this measure measure will help us address that. And so I will be supportive of the motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you, Councilwoman Gonzales.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes, thank you. I also want to extend my support. I think this is great that we are talking about this again. I also think the supervisor's office for bringing this forward. I'm excited about the different investment areas that especially creating a coordinated system where we can all be on the same page and discussing each of our respective'",
        "'speaker_3': 'cities issues and how we can work together in conjunction with the county, which I know we're already doing for the most part. But I also want to thank Kelly Colby for all your work. You've done a great job.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I personally participated in the homeless count two weeks ago. It was eye opening. I will continue encouraging residents. If you are not a part of that, please be a part of that. Even tour. Some of our facilities get to know what the city is doing and the county resources that are being expended already.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This will just enhance that. So thanks again.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Council member, supra.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Thank you. And I'd like to thank Kelly Coffey also for all our hard work. And I do have a question for you with the count that was conducted two weeks ago. Now, historically, that number doesn't come back to us till around April, which would be after the ballot measure.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Is that is that what you anticipate this year?'",
        "'speaker_14': 'That is that is what we anticipate. But we're trying to will be working our best to try and get it a little bit earlier. I don't know that we'll have it before the.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Ballot, but that's that's kind of the nature of my question. And I don't want you to speculate, but it has been speculated by my constituents that we have more people experiencing homelessness today. And I put that in perspective.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'I participated in the count in 2009. In fact, Long Beach, Small World, Miles Evans was part of the team I was on. I mean, Miles Nevin, who we just approved tonight for a commission position in the area on the eastern fourth district.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'That is from Clark to Studebaker. The four or five freeway is the northern border to Atherton. We counted one person experiencing homelessness in 2009, and I think my constituents would speculate that the we'd have more people today. So can you put a number on it or a percentage, or would you not want to speculate where we are'",
        "'speaker_14': '. And we're not ready to put a percentage one way or the other. Moving forward, the numbers are being analyzed right now and we'll be moving forward. But at this time, with the different data and things coming out, we're not ready to speculate.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember. Councilwoman Price.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I just wanted to thank staff for the presentation. The questions that I had have been answered and of course, thanks to Supervisor Hahn and her Linda Chico for being here. This certainly is probably the issue that has resulted in the most inquiries from our residents in terms of long term planning.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I'm happy that we are having these discussions and very mindful that we need additional resources to provide long term solutions. So I think staff for the presentation and for the education tonight. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Andrew. Yes, thank.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You, Mayor. And also, I'd like to thank Council Vice Mayor Richardson and Mr. Rangel for bringing this item forward, because the fact that I think all of us can remember when we took that big dove back about nine years ago, and a lot of those individuals have not, you know, recuperated from that situation.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'A lot of those individuals, some of those individuals out there that are homeless today and no, I don't think any of us thought that it would be at this, you know, count of individuals as being this homeless. So I think we are going to have to take a deep look in and really seriously think that it's not'",
        "'speaker_7': 'about money, it's about compassion. And we know that those individuals could be as individuals. You know, we're just very fortunate. So really, you guys are going to have to take some time and really seriously know that we're in a crisis here and we'll have to do something about it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And don't look at the tax about $1 one cents or whatever it is. Let's be compassionate and try to help these people out there who are homeless. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Let me thank you. We're going to take public comment in just a minute. I just want to add to our supervisor, thank you for being one of the two supervisors to bring this forward to the county board for adoption.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm also incredibly proud of every member of the city council for their words and support for this measure. This will bring resources that we currently do not have in the city of Long Beach. We currently do not have these resources to be able to do this really important work in the years ahead.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so to be able to have this additional source of support of revenue, to be able to go and do the programs that we need in this community, like a year round shelter, like permanent supportive housing, like rapid rehousing, like the mental health connections that we need to make in the community.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This is really, really important, I think, for the community, and so I'm also happy to support it. I look forward to working with the supervisor, Long Beach, which is the supervisors largest city, and also probably the city with some of the largest need in her in her community.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so we look forward to working together on ensuring that these funds come down to the city and that we're able to address some of these large challenges that we have as a community. And to close, I just want to remind us and I try to do this whenever I can, is that every single person that is'",
        "'speaker_0': 'experiencing homelessness has a name. They have parents. They have people that they've loved in their life. They are individuals, and they deserve our respect and our support. And so with that, any public comment on the item?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Good evening. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And Distinguished Council members Gerard Wright with Move L.A. and I just have various all been already said about this wonderful measure and the importance of providing the services that will get people up off their feet and be able to stand for themselves again.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And that's the importance of what of what will provide the ability to bring them back into the society, bring them back into being Americans that can stand here and do the things that we that we need to be in a compassionate society.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So this is an important piece. Thank you, all councilmembers for your support. I'm just going to pass this around. This is almost a fait accompli because there's over 150 organizations that are in support of age right now. And it's growing because this is such a vital need for L.A. County, for L.A. County, and can be a vision'",
        "'speaker_13': 'for the rest of the nation, as we desperately need right now. So thank you all very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Can just pass it to the clerk over here and we'll go pass those out. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Good evening, in control. And I'm glad you're talking about this tonight. I just got my mail in ballot, and I didn't even know this was going to be on the agenda on the. Be on the ballot in March.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'This is a very short time for you to educate the public about this. And I'm sure one of the things that Long Beach is going to say is we're already paying the highest tax. And I'm glad to hear you say you're trying to even this out.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I see there's a number of other cities that are also going to be exempt from paying this one fourth tax. My question is. Are the cities that are paying this tax going to object to the fact that there's many cities that aren't paying the tax and they're going to have to bear the burden of the cost of'",
        "'speaker_8': 'this. How is this going to work out if we're not paying into the county? All all of our extra tax is staying in the city. Is any of our tax a money going to the county to. Help pay for this major.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I hope some of you can answer that question. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I just want to just make a comment. I think this is an important issue for for for everyone so that this was discussed as part of the deliberations of the county supervisors. And they realize that in their deliberations of putting this on the ballot, that there were a handful of of cities in the county that'",
        "'speaker_0': 'were essentially at the cap of the sales tax. And so they anticipated that it was part of their deliberative process. They understand that most folks in the county shop all across the county. And so their part of the determination was that folks, whether they live in Long Beach but might work in Burbank or might work in West'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Los Angeles, and so that they they understood that that would move around and essentially even itself out. In addition, they've been very clear that the the payment back into communities is going to be based solely on where the need is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So they're not interested in, you know, what, what city might be at 10% versus a 9%. They're interested in solving the the the crisis that's happening across the county. And so that's where the resources are going to go, regardless of that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so but they I do I do know that the county had extensive conversations about this question, as did our staff with them as well. Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Good evening, Mr. Mayor. Members of the City Council. Josh Butler, executive director for Housing, Long Beach. And as rents continue to rise in Long Beach and vacancy rates continue to fall, their need for housing measures and measures to support homelessness are greater than ever.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Housing Long Beach is in full support of this measure and has been in full support of this measure since the days Supervisor Hahn was sworn into office and put this item forward. We encourage the city council to do the same.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Voters in L.A. County have shown support for addressing homelessness by putting skin in the game. The city of Los Angeles did so last fall, and they'll raise, I believe, $1.2 billion over the next decade to support housing measures.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The county has recognized the vast shortage of housing and the need to support and stabilize our communities as we build housing to meet need in the future. These early, these county, these countywide resources are designed not only to help stabilize communities, but also to stabilize lives.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We hope that this measure will support the efforts of Mayor Garcia as he works to address affordable housing here in Long Beach. We need your support tonight. We need it more than ever. Ultimately, this money will come back to Long Beach and come back right away.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'As Mary mentioned, it will go based on need. The need here is great. And we also have to remember all the folks that aren't currently out that we see on the streets, that we're not able to count in the mornings.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The folks that are living in hotels, that are sleeping on couches, that the hidden homeless population. And also remember that our homeless count only represents the homeless count for that one particular day. It's not a static number. It's constantly moving.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We need this more than ever as we can expect the safety net at the federal level to get even smaller and smaller. And Californians know that tonight, not only with issues like sanctuary cities, but also issues like this, that we need to know that our local leaders will have our back as we know that our safety net'",
        "'speaker_7': 'is going to get yanked out from under us. We have a shortage. These funds are needed. And we thank you for your support tonight.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Please. Good evening, Mr. Mayor and Council. My name is Andy Kerr. I live in the eighth District and I represent Councilman Austin on the Homeless Services Advisory Committee. I, too, was able to participate in the point in time count a couple weeks ago.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'd just like to commend Ailsa Ramos and the staff, Theresa Chandler, the staff at the Multi-Service Center for just doing a phenomenal job of organizing that event. It went very smoothly and I was really impressed by everything that happened that day.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I was on Mr. West team. I think we had the best team. We were with the the new heart team in the fire department, which is a really impressive team, and thank the city for supporting their efforts. During the count on Third Street, we encountered a gentleman by the name of Richard, and Richard really had a hard'",
        "'speaker_7': 'time understanding what was going on with the information we were trying to get from him. It was very clear to me and in doing this work for for quite a while, that Richard was suffering from severe mental illness and.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's it's very frustrating for me just to know that if Richard were suffering from cancer or if he was suffering from a lot of other similar acute illnesses that wasn't related to mental illness, it wouldn't be okay for him to be sleeping on Third Street.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And it's a breakdown of public policy and governance at all level, from the federal level to the state to the county that for for 40 years this has been going on. And it really warms my heart today here the council and you, Mr. Mayor, for the support for this measure h i to support it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think this is a tremendous opportunity to correct all those decades of bad policy on this issue, issues related to substance abuse. That also contributes to the level of homelessness that we've seen throughout the county in the city.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I'd like to echo Councilman Richardson and Councilman Austin the words that that that really this really is a regional issue. And I'd also like to commend Kelly Collopy and Theresa Chandler and the city's team for the level of collaboration I've been seeing lately with the county.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I think it's a level available at the collaboration that's there really is unprecedented since I've been involved in this work. So thanks again for your support for this measure. I know it's going to be a really big push to get the two thirds threshold of the voters.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I'd like to offer anything I can do personally to to help and inform the public to encourage people to get behind it. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Good evening, honorable mayor and council members.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'My name is Maria Lopez. I'm an organizer for housing lobby and first district resident. I'd like to commend you all today for having.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This difficult conversation. Right.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Homelessness and housing has become the issue of our generation with rapid gentrification that has impacted rents, which has led to the displacement of vulnerable communities, which has an an overall affected and increase the amount of homelessness.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Which continues to take a lot of our resources. So for me, as an individual having to.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'See and help these families.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I see Measure H as.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'A light at the end of the tunnel. Right. Personally, I have experienced the restraints and services. Right. To get in a shelter. You need your ID, your birth certificate, your Social Security, even in some cases. Right. How many homeless individuals carry that around?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Not necessarily. Right. So there is restraints.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And getting.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'These services to get a family of four to get a TB test done, they only take the first five. I had to drop off a family in the middle of a storm at 7 a.m. and the Multi-Service Center offered a ride, offered.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'To pick them up to get them there on time so that they can take.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Their nine year old.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Boy who at eight who had.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'ADHD into a shelter. Right.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So there is barriers that these individuals face and that we as individuals cannot help with as well. Right. So I do see the deep need for case management, affordable housing and also protections against displacement. Supporting those in need has always been the heart.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Of our Long.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Beach residents. Right. That's what we do. That's why we live here.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so today.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I am glad to live in this city, because once again, we're standing up for the little guy. And once again, we are seeing a great.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Need and we're solving it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So a huge thank you to all of you. And I look forward to to March 7th. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And please, sir, so be our last speaker, this gentleman here in line, and then we're moving. We're going to go ahead and take a vote. So please.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Mayors. Council members. First of all. Jesus. My, my, my. I wasn't going to say anything on this, but I heard Mr. Butler, Joshua Butler, speak, and he mentioned about the high prices and all this Long Beach and everything.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I was at a meeting a few weeks ago with him and he was telling that he was telling the meeting how some of the highest in the nation, when I just read is some of the lowest cost in the nation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Everybody who for what, 1100 dollars living right off ocean one bedroom. You can't do that anywhere. Anybody knows that. Not in Hermosa, not in Redondo. And so and then I called him up on that and he yelled at me.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So my thing is this. And court, if you say something and it's not right, they usually impeach your testimony. So that's the reason why I'm up here, because I heard all the bleeding heart stuff, he said. But what I'm thinking about this whole situation, I hope this goes.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'The huddled masses who yearn to breathe free. And they're here. Let's keep them here. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Good evening, everyone. My name is Maribel Cruz.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I have with me my goddaughter.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Natalie Cuevas. She's about to be five.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I am here. I work with the Long Beach Immigrant Rights Coalition. But tonight I'm here on a personal note. I am a resident of District four, and I have personally seen the fear that not only my family has, but my community has.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I just want to not only fight for them, but also for her. She's so small right now, she doesn't realize what's happening. But her mom is undocumented. She should not grow up in a place where she might not see her mom when she comes back from school.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I'm sorry. I really I feel for her because she is so young and she doesn't know what's going on. And if you have the if you have the power to push policies that protect families and prevent family separations, I urge you to take that step.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Long Beach needs to be a sanctuary city, not only for us adults, but for little kids who don't want to be and should be separated from their families. And so that's why I urge you and I thank you for pass for supporting SB 54 and SB 31.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But I strongly urge you to think about making Long Beach a sanctuary city. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Good evening. Thank you for taking your time to hear everyone. And thank you, everyone for for speaking on my coming here in support of both these resolutions. And I hope we will make Long Beach a sanctuary city and let's it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Excuse me. Immigrants contribute enormous amounts of value to the country and to the world and to our community. It's just insane. California has some of the most productive farms on earth, and I wonder why that is. The idea that Donald Trump thinks he can wave a few drops in the bucket of federal funds to try to make'",
        "'speaker_7': 'us capitulate to his racism is, I think, insane and insulting. We have some of the most productive people in the world. I'm sure we can find a couple more million dollars of tax money if it comes down to it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think, again, I think that's a breach of the way the federal government should be behaving, using its privilege and its state power to come down on small councils and state governments. Immigrants contribute value and they don't just and that's not just in my heart or in my mind.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Value is a real thing and has economic worth. Everybody who's in this room tonight, if they move to Long Beach or if they chose do like I did, they probably came here because of its diversity, which means that diversity shows itself in higher property values, which means immigrants contribute to high property values because people want to live'",
        "'speaker_7': 'in a city that's diverse. Of course, those property values end up getting privatized by the landlord class, which is very unfortunate. It's a lie to say also that immigrants don't pay taxes. Anyone who has studied economics will tell you that the incidence of taxation can rest largely on consumers, depending on the tax.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And our immigrant communities definitely are consuming their share of the goods that we produce, and they're producing more than their share of the goods that we consume. I think it's very insulting to our immigrant communities who have contributed so much.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And who have risked so much to get here with no promise of reward. For us to not even take the very small step that these resolutions demand, which is a small step and a reasonable step, in my opinion.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We should be taking and I think a lot of people in this room would back me up. We should be taking more radical steps to ensure that our immigrant communities have greater access to health care and greater access to education and greater access to services and greater access to housing.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We? We should be. Giving back to these people who give us so much. Rather than joining in one great American tradition which is taking from immigrants whether they were forced here or not. America also has a different tradition that we all share and we all know, and that is the tradition of giving American people are some of'",

        "'speaker_8': 'Major Robert Garcia, honorable city council member. Thank you so much for your attention for this led to a lesson to all of us to express and why our opinion. To protect the refugee and immigration. My name is Chen Hobson.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'And yes, we have to struggle. But when we struggle, we get to see each other and all you people at home come on down.

        "'speaker_8': 'And that goes down to our own police department. And I would very much like our police department to be able to have some kind of a position that is open and to comment or somehow to rethink and make very, very clear how our our police department is going to respond not only to the child who ate the'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Here, Mr. Mayor, members of the city council. My name is Steve Downey and I'm a resident of the third district. I'm also a retired deputy chief from the Los Angeles Police Department. I'm on a national board of 10,000 criminal justice professionals that support criminal justice reform and initiatives of this sort.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'When I read about the introduction of this legislation by the two senators, I said, we have two very courageous heroes and Sacramento. And I would like to say to you that if you find the courage to pass a especially a unanimous resolution to make Long Beach a sanctuary city, I would celebrate you as heroes as well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I think that there is more than just the support of this legislation. It's going to take a while for it to pass. And I think that there is more than just declaring ourselves a sanctuary city. I think that we need to be involved with implementing policy that truly makes us a sanctuary city.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'As a senior command officer in the Los Angeles Police Department in the 1970s. I was involved in initiating, drafting and implementing what is known today as special order number 40. It was the genesis of making the City of Los Angeles a sanctuary city.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We told our police officers how to treat the immigrant population, what kind of questions to ask of them, what kind of questions not to ask of them, and how to approach our enforcement policies in the city. That special order was our guiding light.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But it has to be reinforced. It has to be reinforced through supervision and training. And as the years passed after I retired under some weak chiefs, I saw it dwindle a little bit. And as a result, we saw.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The Rampart scandal. Very, very nasty scandal. But it was strengthened again under Chief Bratton when he came in. And it remains a document that should be live by by all cities across this nation. And you can really show an example by in your resolution saying, let's get that document.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Let's see how it works for Long Beach. Let's implement it. Let's put it into training at our police academy and our roll call rooms, and we'll be a better city for it. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And. And our final speaker.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Don't boomy Robert Council. Mr. Mayor, my name is Johnny Weir and I am from Better Housing for Long Beach. We are a property owners in Long Beach. And I do want to I really appreciate the passion in the room here.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It's quite a group. I actually recognize a lot of people I recognize since your show because I actually work with them and I had some issues with the tenant of the building. I recognized Porter here from the Gay and Lesbian Center.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I recognize that there is what Leon is here building healthy communities and better house and housing. Long Beach. Josh Butlers Housing. Long Beach Now. In fact, a lot of you were involved in pushing an ordinance called Prep, which was very, very unnerving to a lot of the undocumented community.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So, you know, you got to remember that some of these things that you guys push have unintended consequences. And so we don't. Better housing for Long Beach is a bipartisan group. We don't have a dog in the fight in this in this situation.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But we share a lot of the same things that you share. We share fear. There's fear in the room. Housing providers are in fear because there's ordinances that are being pushed on us that are putting a lot of us out of business.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Excuse me. Did you say something? Oh, I'm sorry. I thought I heard a voice. VOICEOVER It must be Robert. Anyway, so I just want to say that that raising fees, more taxes drives rents up. Ordinances that stop redevelopment creates less affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So we're in the we're in the business of creating affordable housing. We, you know, we see ordinances coming through and being pushed in these kind of forms, and they are not really supporting the community. And I think it's important that we look at the same groups come every time when there's an issue that's being presented.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I wonder why they come. Because housing Long Beach is supposed to be about housing. Why are they here focusing on this ordinance right now? So, again, you know, we support good renters, whether they're documented or undocumented. I have some tenants.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'They may be undocumented. I have some incredible people that work with me. And, you know, we are not a racist group, which Rob Josh Butler is telling a lot of people that we're about. We want to bring a community together and this is not our issue, but we're being brought into this issue.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I will say this better housing for Long Beach supports good renters and good property owners. And Robert, the gentleman is booing. He's a renter. He's not a property owner. So I just want to make that clear. And he just joined our group.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So we have a lot of colorful people that we support and we encourage to get involved and give give their perspective. You know, hey, there's room at the table for everybody. There's room at the table for everybody and all differences.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So, Danielle.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you so much. And I'm sorry it's been a crazy night, but I do really appreciate everybody's passion. Thank you. Bye bye.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Okay. Thank you. That's it. Okay. Thank you. Let let this gentleman speak real quick.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I swear to God. I swear. I swear.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. All right, guys. I got. I've got to get start. We got to start. Go ahead. So, listen, we're going to we're going to go into the get go meeting, so. So what? I, I cut out the speakers.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Listen, I'm going to let you speak, okay? So it'll be the last one. I had cut it off earlier, but you got in line, so I will let you have your 3 minutes. Okay, sir. And then we're going to go back to the Councilman Gonzales.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Go ahead, sir.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And you all great in the city council meeting. And Jack Kim of. You know, very well known in Long Beach, German people shouldn't be bullied. And speaking of Darren or Drew, legally, they write the book, not the Bull, but Darren or Drew.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'He wants everybody to think. When I'm thanking them, then they're.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Having.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The support of immigration. You're more than a drain. You don't have no respect for people in the laws of the land. You know, people illegally can accuse or.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sir. That's that's very rude. Okay, sir. So if you keep doing that, I'm going have to ask you to leave. So please stop that. Please continue, sir.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Don't drink or have no respect for people and the law. Because he. He beat Davis, Barenboim, all five of the Jews for defending people that. There. He says he let go, but there was legal. And so right now they're going to go to the Supreme Court.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So if he may have dead was bad for them all to move on to the Supreme Court and married and get. Who could give. And Pete I'm supposed to be helping people with job they say everybody is is illegal in California all legally where 22 year old burn burned by.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We love. So he say everybody is illegal in California. He needs to know who's legally illegal. The American. I think God speak the truth to. To help to help a lot of people understand to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you for always coming down. We appreciate.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Your birthday. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You have a good night.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Keep up the good work. We're doing great.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, sir, for coming.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You too. Thank you. We're going to go ahead. Now, I'm a turn this back over to Councilwoman Gonzalez, who has the floor. Councilwoman Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes, thank you. I want to thank everybody for their comments and all of their great discussions around this issue. I think it's very important that we're hearing all voices from all over the city and even some of you that have supported this item for many, many years now.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I want to thank you for your advocacy and your hard work. And so as one of the largest cities in the state of California, the fifth largest economy, as we've heard, we cannot and I believe we cannot stay silent on this issue.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We have to take a stand. We have to remain committed to ensure that we are known as a city that supports its diversity and inclusiveness, supports people that have positivity, has positively I'm sorry, contributed to our city and country as students, service workers, engineers, lawyers, entrepreneurs.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The list goes on. SB 54 and SB 31 will reaffirm that immigration enforcement collection of religious information is not a state or local issue. Specifically, SB 54, carried by Kevin DeLeon, sets a statewide standard for protection so that immigrants are not only safe in Long Beach because of course, we want them to be safe here in Long'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Beach, but that they're safe statewide. And I think as we think about our neighbors and our brothers and sisters in different cities, this will reaffirm that protection for all of us, which I think is very important and key.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I have a few questions for Diana. Just to clear up the process and what has been done so far. Diana.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I can barely see you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilwoman, I think these things are right.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Okay. Yes, I'm here.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Great. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'These two bills are currently in the Senate where they were introduced earlier this year. They were heard in the first policy committee. And now both have been referred to the Appropriations Committee. So both have passed the first policy committee.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'They're in appropriations. There's no hearing date yet that we're still pretty early on in the legislative session. So it's not very common right now for there to be many appropriation committee hearings. If the bills do pass the appropriation committees and they would be heard on the Senate floor if the bills receive a two thirds vote because they're'",
        "'speaker_12': 'both urgency bills. If they receive a two thirds vote on the Senate floor, then the bills would go over to the state assembly and the Rules Committee. They would be referred to a policy committee or two, and then also the Appropriations Committee and then on to the assembly floor for a two thirds vote there as well.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'If the bills pass each of those milestones, then they would be eligible to be sent to the governor's desk for his consideration.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Great. Thank you. The legislative process is, you know, definitely important to to learn as we go through this process. I also have another question related to the amendments that have already been discussed by Senate Pro Tem Kevin de Leon, respective to SB 54.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So what has he amended already? Because I know as it stands, there are some questions related to violent and serious crimes committed by individuals. So can you explain and clarify what has been done so far?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Councilmember when SB 54 was heard in the Senate Public Safety Committee on January 31st, there was testimony by some law enforcement agencies requesting clarification on their ability to partner with federal law enforcement agencies when it comes to serious and violent crimes.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Currently, that is allowable. And the question is, is that going to be allowable into the future? Because I think the bill in its original form, it has not been amended, but there are some areas that could be clarified.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And so that in particular is is one that they are working on together.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. And have any thank you and have any items already been stricken from this bill at this point?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'SB 54 is still currently in the original form that it was introduced in on December 5th. So there have been no adopted amendments thus far.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. I was under the impression that something related to human trafficking might have been taken out. Is that correct or no?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'No. So in in the bill as it was introduced, there are amendments that are being proposed to existing law. And I, I can't speak specifically to human trafficking, but I think that one of the issues that law enforcement agencies have requested is the ability to continue to work with federal law enforcement agencies to combat organized crime, such'",
        "'speaker_12': 'as human trafficking. But that issue specifically is not in any of the amendments in the bill right now.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. So at this time, with that said.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman, can I add one thing to that? I want to also add that I know that Mr. Tang has been speaking with with staff at the Times office, and I spoke with Senator DeLeo and pro tem today as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so just the the two areas in which he's trying to work with and not just are I know are some of our folks in our police department, but with other law enforcement and the two that he mentioned to me today and certainly said that it was I should mention was one is he's working with the State'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Police Chiefs Association to ensure that there is the ability for there to be multi-agency conversations around a variety of issues so that interagency issues, particularly around human trafficking and other issues, are able to be worked on in multi-agency and in multi-agency task force.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'He also had mentioned mentioned to me that he was looking at and supports changes so that the for serious and violent crimes that there would still be access for law enforcement agencies to have discretion with local agencies. And so that hasn't been completely vetted out.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But he is working with state law enforcement and advocates across the state on that issue. And so as bills come forward, as you all know, these things move and have amendments can come back and forth. But those are the areas of which there is discussion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I just want to make sure that I mentioned that I spoke with him today directly, as well as with Senator Lora, and those are the two areas that are being discussed for four amendments as of today.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Great. So with that said, and I'm glad that our Senate pro tem, de Leon is discussing having discussions with the Police Chiefs Association. I've personally spoken with our police chief about this very issue. I've spoken with many of you about this issue.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I feel that it is certainly important that we support SB 31, the California Religious Freedom Act, and SB 54 the California Values Act. However, I'd like to include an amendment to the letter bill, SB 54, similar to what Kevin DeLeon is already doing to ensure that local law enforcement agencies have clear discretion to partner with federal'",
        "'speaker_3': 'law enforcement agencies to combat serious and violent crimes. So I'd like us to also include the participation in multiagency federal task force operations with the intention of fighting organized crime, such as human and drug trafficking, which I think needs to be clear and disclosed.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'With that said, I'd like to move forward with these items and support with these amendments solely. It's important that we support the spirit of our immigrant and faith based communities, but also that we are making sure that these two amendments are supported as the bill goes through with its through its state legislative process as well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then I'll conclude by saying that there are tons of supporters for these items. I think Long Beach making a statement being the first city to support this effort is very important. We have supporters from the ACLU, California Faculty Association, the AFL-CIO, the South Bay Islamic Council, even my own soon to be alma mater, Loyola Immigrant Center'",
        "'speaker_3': ', LGBT centers across the nation and ACP chapters across the nation. And I understand that SB 54 is intended to protect the safety and well-being of all Californians and believe amendments addressing those two issues I just referenced are important and remain in the spirit of the bill, which is to protect immigrant communities and religious faiths who are positively'",
        "'speaker_3': 'contributing to our communities and our economy. I've been in contact as well with our Senate pro tem office and I know they are actively working with the Police Chiefs Association. As we discussed, discussed and I understand the Police Chiefs Association is currently, you know, looking at the bill as well with us, Long Beach's support for SB 31'",
        "'speaker_3': 'is also important and I believe it is equally important that we are involved and engage with. SB With both of these efforts in support of legislation and with the amendments we are seeking. It's imperative that we extend our support to both of these items now to ensure that we are not proactively engaging in any type of action'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that would prohibit immigrants or people of religious faith from coming here. And we cannot vilify the bad actions of a few, but instead we must support and stand committed to the incredible actions of many immigrants in our city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so to clarify, those amendments again will just be amendments already supported by Senate pro-tem Kevin DeLeon. They're already working on these issues. However, I don't want this to be misconstrued as not supporting immigrants and people of religious faith.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This is a support. Now we want to make sure that our local resources are supporting our immigrants now that we as a council are supporting them now. And I ask for my council colleagues support in this. I think these amendments are reasonable.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They tackle issues of public safety that are important to all of us, but they also are all encompassing of of this spirit and effort. So I look forward to hearing dialog from my council colleagues. And thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Gonzales, Councilmember Pierce.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. Thank you, everybody, for your passion and for your courage for those that are undocumented to come out and speak tonight. I know how hard that must be. And I just really want to say I've never been prouder being up here on council chambers to see you guys speak from your heart and really push us to'",
        "'speaker_8': 'do what you feel is the right thing for your communities. And so thank you for that. I want to thank you to the colleagues who brought this forward and asked us to endorse this. And I have a couple of of comments and then a couple of questions.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I want to say that I think it's really fitting tonight that Long Beach takes a stand as a council. We voted on a resolution in November urging the federal government to provide Jose Alvarez with humanitarian parole after he was pulled over for a broken headlight at Cal State Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And it was Jose Alvarez's son, Victor Alvarez, who gave moving testimony on his father's deportation to the Senate Public Safety Committee, which approved the California Values Bill just last week. Long Beach is a city of immigrants. We've we've been a refuge for those escaping war.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'For those seeking a better life. Over a quarter Long Beach, its population is foreign born, with 40% Latino, 12% Asian. And we are believed to have the largest Cambodian community outside of Cambodia. Many of who came here as refugees like Jose, many immigrants in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'On their businesses, they work at our hotels, our restaurants that contribute greatly to local economies workers, consumers, business owners and taxpayers. In a study Dhaka found and a study on Dhaka, recipients found that 43% were in school and 83% were fully employed working to advance their lives in this country.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy has estimated that undocumented immigrants pay 11.6 billion in taxes, and other data from Pew Research and Public Policy Institute say the undocumented that are part of sanctuary cities are less likely to commit crimes, not more.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Finally, we know from police chiefs that a relationship of trust between police and community is critical to making sure that crimes are reported and that we can ensure safer communities as a state, as a city, we've come too far and we will not go back.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I asked my colleagues to join me tonight in supporting this item. As city leaders, we have a moral obligation to stand up for our diverse communities. With that being said, I've had a lot of questions around what does it mean to be a sanctuary state and what does it mean to be a sanctuary city?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so I want to ask a couple of questions to kind of make sure that we are on the same page, because I really appreciate the community coming forward with your list that you want to make sure that Long Beach is really diverting enough resources away from this.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So if this state bill 54 passes, it says that we will not use city, we will not use resources to aid in the deportation. And so I want to be really clear that it's not at the state level, but that also means that locally our city police, our schools, our universities and our hospitals will not participate in'",
        "'speaker_8': 'that. So a mustang, if you could. Diana, if you could. Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Go ahead, Councilman. I am. Well, can. I'll just say that the bill is in its infancy. It was just introduced about a month ago. It just had its first policy committee hearing, as we heard. Thus, the author is working with stakeholder groups on amendments and so without it being enacted legislation, I do believe that it would be'",
        "'speaker_12': 'too early to speculate on how it would impact Long Beach and what changes we might make.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. I mean, in my my reading of it and. It would make sense to me that this would mean that our police, just as they already are, would not support that. So let me let me ask another question.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'For the trust act right now, and I'm not sure if it's you or if it's our police chief that could answer this question right now with the Trust Act. What are we doing locally? No.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Sorry, guys. We have officers in Chief Beckman who can answer the questions about the Trust Act.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. Just trying to get some clarity on what if we do this at the state level? What does it mean for us to come back to a conversation around your request tonight, which was obviously very loudly heard?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Council member, Honorable Mayor Mike Beckman, and the deputy chief of the Support Bureau and police chief Robert Luna cannot be here tonight. He sends us his regrets. He's traveling on city business. I'm going to give you an answer that's probably shorter than it took me to get out of that aisle.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But basically, the Long Beach Police Department complies with the California Trust Act, or Assembly Bill four. And I can provide some specifics with regard to people that we have in custody, if you wish. But generally speaking, we do comply with the Trust Act.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And can you clarify for those in the audience what the Trust Act is?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The. The Trust Act. Well, what I'd rather do if it's okay, is go through how we handle people who are in our custody with regard to the Trust Act. If that would be okay, that's fine.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'When we arrest a person and upon processing, there might be an occasion where immigration would send to us a immigration detainer, where ICE would send us an immigration detainer. And upon receipt of that detainer, our booking staff would then assess a person based on criteria provided in California.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Government Code 7 to 8 2.5 a. And at that particular point. If the criteria is met and the criteria is quite extensive. So I won't get into detail about that. But if that criteria is met, then the Long Beach Police Department fax is a form that we've created back to ICE that states we will not hold an'",
        "'speaker_7': 'affected inmate unless ICE provides a signed court order commanding the Long Beach Police Department to further detain that individual. If we do not receive that signed order, then the release of that individual takes place as any other release would.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'If a signed court order is received, a no bond holders in placed and ICE is notified to pick the individual up. And I will close with this. I will tell you, to our knowledge, since the Trust Act was implemented, ICE has never provided the Long Beach Police Department a signed court order and or has traveled to the'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Long Beach Police Department to take custody of an undocumented immigrant.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you for that. I appreciate that. To be clear, in the SB 54 or how it's drafted now, that is the essentially the same language in SB 54, from what I understand. So. From calling the office today and going through their policy that essentially says that they would have to have a judicial warrant to come after and'",
        "'speaker_8': 'ask for us to detain. And so I just want to clarify that when we talk about using city resources to do deportation for providing diversion alternatives to our incarceration for low level offenses. Is Kelly here? Kelly Colby, we.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Kelly. We had talked a little bit earlier today with my staff around just clarifying what the city is already doing in these matters, because I think we have the health department, our city prosecutors that have done a lot of great work on this.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so when I take the opportunity to talk about we're already doing.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Good evening. Our primary focus for diversion for a low level offense is around mental health diversion. Our work there, as we've been in conversation and planning for the past two years, is a partnership with the city prosecutor's office, the police department, the health department and a number of community providers, as well as L.A. County.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'We we participate in the Permanent Diversion Committee for the for L.A. County as well. In those plans, we are applying for Prop 47 to resource those efforts. So we'll be looking at different ways to divert from custody at different sort of different places to divert.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'In terms of where in the process into mental health and also substance use treatment through the Prop 47 fund if those funds become available.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Great. Thank you so much. One of the requests in here is a policy of siting and releasing individuals charged with low level offenses. That is something that, as you just said, we are already doing in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. I want to number three on this list says defend pro-immigrant policies from attacks from the federal government. I think that this is something that definitely is not already included in SB 54 and obviously has a lot of discussion that needs to be included in that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I would like to ask if it's appropriate to send that section to the Fed led Committee for you guys to discuss in further detail. Is that something you would be open to?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. So absolutely, I'd be open to that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Great. Thank you. And then the opposing any registry based on religious identity or other protected characteristics. This is included in SB 54 or not, NESBY 54. Yes, it's only 31. And the only part that is in there, that's the only part of your request that is not included in that is the sexual orientation, which I'm not sure'",
        "'speaker_8': 'is something that's come up yet. But I think it's worth the conversation down the road about how do we you know, right now we're talking about immigration status down the road. We might be talking about how policies that come forward around the LGBT community.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I think we need to have that discussion when when the time is appropriate. But that obviously Long Beach has been a champion on this issue. And so we want to work with you guys to make sure that it's not just around immigration, that we're working on it, but that it's a bigger policy.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So this is I think what I'm getting to is the fact that at the state level, if we pass this and we support this, which we need to urgently do, because we know that families right now are living in fear and are already torn apart.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I want to urge us to vote yes today on this and to have some good conversations following around the legislation piece or on the Fed ledge and the LGBT component and maybe come back with some clarity down the road around exactly how this would implement once the policy's completely fleshed out.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So, again, urging my colleagues to vote yes tonight and sending that one section of what the community requested to the Fed lunch time. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilwoman, I want to go to councilman and before we go, because I had to just go clarify with Mr. Hank, which I want to make sure I had heard it correctly. But just to clarify, the Councilman Pierce's initial question on whether her, her or her comments were included in the current bill.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They're part of the current bill. But I'm correct. I'm wrong here mistaking. But any bill, of course, is never final until the very end.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Absolutely.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But they are. But what she said is part of the current bill. Correct? Okay. I just want to make sure because I that's why I had it over, just to make sure it was hearing that part. Correct. Okay, great.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Ringo.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I can live with that. I had prepared statements, but hearing. The wonderful testimony tonight, hearing it earlier and having them having dealt with the Jose Alvarez situation back in November. You'll make my total thinking of this is is different.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'In a good way. I. I don't want anybody to misunderstand what I'm trying to say. It's you know, I reflect on this. I'm the son of immigrant parents. If they were around the time today of this president. I think that they would be in complete fear of being here in this country.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I would be in complete fear for my mom and dad. Because they came here. All they came here with with a green card and a visa, and they would renew it every year. And every year my dad would say, what's this green card?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I'm not an alien. I'm a human being. And every year he would have to fill that out to re read reality. His his humanity to the country, to the United States. My brother was also an immigrant. I was the first one born here.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I was the last of six. I was born here. So my brothers and sisters were also immigrants to this country. They were educated here. My one brother served in the U.S. military, honorably discharged what he had been living in fear of being in this country.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And would he have wanted to serve his country even though he was not a U.S. citizen? And so I reflect on that right now in terms of what that what are we saying to families now here who are immigrants and they're validation of who they are and where they want to be.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It's interesting that, you know, history goes in cycles and we're we're experiencing a cycle right now that's not very, very good. Not only that, we're experiencing a president who is a thug. Who's a blackmailer. And who is potentially an extortionist.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'He is threatening to withhold federal funds. To not only the states at state of California, but to the city of Long Beach as well. So what we're doing here today with this support of SB 54 and SB 31.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It's preemptive. It's a preemptive measure. We're saying to the to the president, you threaten us. We've got things in place to stop you. From threatening us. It's like preempting a blackmailer. If you can do that. You're blackmailing me.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But I'm going to. I'm going to hide my money before you get to me. So what we're doing here today is a is a step in that process of stopping this president from making those kinds of threats to us, to our immigrants.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'To people who come here to. Get away from oppression. To get to exercise your religious freedom. To exercise the their own abilities to want to live. A greater and better life in this country, in the U.S., just like my mom and dad did, though, so many years ago.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I want to reinforce what my colleagues have already done, and I want to thank my colleagues who who signed off on this as well. Councilor Gonzalez Pearce and Vice Mayor Richardson. Because it's it's that type of courage that we need to take to ensure that our residents in Long Beach, our immigrant families in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I protect it. And it can live here safely without any fear of having a simple encounter with any of our agent agents, whether it be police. Fire. Housing inspector, animal control officer, anybody that that would be a prelude to endangering their status in this country or their status here in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I want to thank you guys for that kind of of exhibiting that kind of courage. And I want to especially especially thank our senators, President Pro Tem Kevin de Leon and our Senator Ricardo Lara, for bringing this forward because that is courage.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember. Thank you, Councilmember. Councilwoman Price.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you very much. I want to thank my colleagues for bringing this important discussion to the council chamber. I really enjoyed the comments that I heard from the audience tonight. As many of you know and I have shared, I am a descendant of immigrants from one of the countries where there is currently the non ban.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And and it has been a very scary time for people in my community as well. And I actually had the opportunity to meet with them on Sunday. We had a great conversation with Congressman Lowenthal. And I explained to the people in that community my concerns with sanctuary city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And really it does come down to a financial concern for the city. I don't know if the city manager might know off the top of his head, you know, how much money we rely on in federal funding for our homeless programs and our law enforcement programs and things like that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'm going to give that to Diana Tang.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Councilwoman in terms of the total amount of federal funding that we receive. That amount inclusive of what is provided to the port, is in the range of $224 million, and that is just a number that we were able to pull off of financial reporting or financial reporting system.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'But I would also like to caveat that the executive order that was issued. Is unclear how much and of what pots of money would be vulnerable. And so that is the total that it's we don't yet know what is actually at risk.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you very much. So I mean, that that answer alone demonstrates kind of what I want to share is that we're living in very uncertain times and there is a lot at stake for many members of our community.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Immigrants? Well, we're all immigrants. We're all descendants of immigrants. But everybody is living in uncertain times right now. And so I think for me, I know the item tonight is and I appreciate it almost. You know, I was trying to count the comments.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Almost all of them were about sanctuary city. And I really I took some time to read through the agenda item again. And I don't that's not an item that's on the agenda tonight. And I, I want everyone to be clear about that, that that is not an item that anybody that was on this council had on the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'agenda tonight or prepared for. It's item 23. You guys are welcome to read the agenda. There's no there's nothing on there about Sanctuary City. So that's not a conversation that I think we're going to have this evening, because that's not and I know that's what I'm listening to the audience and that's what you guys were asking us'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to do. And so I want to make sure you understand, if we don't do that, it's because it's not on the agenda tonight, among other things. But there are a lot of considerations in regards to what we do in these uncertain times as a city and how we go forward.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I have a friendly amendment that I would like to propose, and I'd like to articulate why I think we need to do that. And then I'll I'll ask Councilwoman Gonzalez if she's open to this. I have no issues with Senate Bill 31.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'My I have a hesitation about both of these bills, and they're both recently introduced, which means they're just undergoing the process. And we know that there's going to be a lot of modifications and changes that happen through the process.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We don't know yet what amendments might be added by virtue of a compromise that legislators might get involved in. Similar to what we sometimes do as a body, we don't know what form the bill is ultimately going to take.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'What I do know is that we here, all of us in this room, support the idea of not splitting up families, support the idea of inclusion, support the idea of people not being discriminated against based on their national origin, their gender, their religion, all of the things that are so important to this body.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So the intent behind both bills is is I think is a very, very honorable intent. But my recommendation would be to go ahead and support Senate Bill 31, because I think that that particular Senate bill has minimal amendments in terms of what it would need to become satisfactory.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I don't think there's going to be anything on there that's going to surprise us.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I did go through.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And read the legislative history, which is very minimal on both bills today on Senate Bill 54, my recommendation or my my friendly amendment would be to send that particular item to the state legislative committee and the Public Safety Committee so we can track the bill as it goes through the Senate process so that we can see if'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the changes that we're recommending. By the way, we can't amend the bills because they're they're not our bills. We're not the author of the bill. We can recommend that the author of the bill add these to his bill.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But then the item asks us to support the bill and the bill as written. We can't amend we can't amend the bill. So that's my understanding. So one of the few things that I have concerns with in Senate Bill 54 is that I think we need clarification on before we would vote to support it is and again'",
        "'speaker_3': ', it's very preliminary written and I'm sure just with any piece of legislation, the author hasn't gone through and made the necessary tweaks. But if you look at it, for example, in the Public Safety Committee analysis, they talk about the database, but it's not clear, for example, in 54 that the database relates only to immigration and not to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'other databases that would be maintained by law enforcement, such as a gang database or human trafficking database.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Also talks about.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Educational institutions, and they talk about the University of California being encouraged to adopt a policy. But they don't mention the California State University, which I'm sure we would want included as well. They talk about partnerships with other task forces.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And although I know that the personal conversation that our mayor had with Senator De Leone indicates that he's looking to amend.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That the bill.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'As written prohibits our law enforcement officers from working with federal. Ortiz They work together all the time, and they have a great partnership that helps make public safety a priority for our city and our state. They work together on drug task forces.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They work together on human trafficking task forces. They work together on gang task forces. And so it's very important that that language be amended to allow that collaboration to continue. There's also the intent of this legislation.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Initially that's.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Being changed.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Was that people.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Who.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Were witnesses and victims in a crime and Stefan spoke to it should not be afraid to come forward to the police because they are an illegal immigrant. And that is absolutely true. But what 54 doesn't do currently, and I'm happy to hear that Senator De Leon is working on that, but it doesn't currently address what happens to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'serious and violent offenders, people who have been convicted of a serious or violent felony as defined in the penal code. There's no provision in this code for whether or not those individuals can be. Their information can be shared with law enforcement.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Those individuals are actually not contributing to the economy as the item that was submitted by my colleagues would like us to support. Those individuals are actually taxing our economy in our system. So those individuals, in my opinion, should not be covered by the protections of the intent of SB 74.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so I think there's a few areas here where. And drug sales activity, for example, that one of the main this this particular SB 54 seeks to change a section of the Health and Safety Code 11 369 which dealt with drug activity.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The Senate Bill 54 doesn't address drug dealing activity at all. So people who are convicted of drug dealing, selling drugs are not addressed. And SB 54 and certainly we can all agree that the intent of the comments tonight was not to protect people who aren't following the law, who are committing serious and violent felonies, but rather to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'protect people who are hard working, who live in our our community. So my recommendation would be that we send 54 to the state ledge and Public Safety Committee to have them evaluate and track the bill.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Because.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Right now we are adopting support for a bill that's in its infancy and we know is already going to be amended, and we don't know how it's going to be amended. There may be amendments that are made to it that we don't like.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There may be amendments to it that we didn't think of that we really like. And I would just recommend that we forward it to the Committee for review. And that would be my friendly.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilwoman Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I appreciate the discussion. Councilwoman Pryce I do. I have to respectfully disagree and say that, and perhaps I was. Not clear. And perhaps I was not very clear, and that is certainly my thought. I'll take the blame for that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But when I created the amendments, what I said was I wanted to support SB 31 and 54. I know 54 still has a lot of work to be done. Being the vice chair of both the state and federal legislative committee, the immigration issues have been at both committees, and I know we have a meeting scheduled very, very'",
        "'speaker_3': 'soon to talk about these very issues. And I assume if this passes, we will add those to both the state and federal legislative committees anyhow. However, what I had mentioned is that I would like us as a council to support these items, however, support as amended.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so, Diana, can you clarify what that means, support as amended? Because I understand that as it's going through its amendments, we will support it as amended. And that includes amendments such as local law enforcement agencies having clear discretion to partner with federal law enforcement agencies to combat serious and violent crimes, participate in multiagency federal task force'",
        "'speaker_3': 'operations with the intention of fighting organized crime such as human and drug trafficking, which I think is a point that Councilwoman Pryce brings up very clearly. And I think we need to make that distinction so support as amended.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'What does that mean? Diana, can you just clarify that for us?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Sure. And if I may also clarify, we are supporting SB 31 and then take a break. We are supporting or the proposal is to support SB 54 as amended with the two amendments that you had described. Correct. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So the term support as amended or support with amendments is something that is used when there's interest in supporting legislation. However, with the condition that there be additional components added to the bill or taken out of the bill, whichever it is that the amendments that we're asking for and in this case as support, as amended position on'",
        "'speaker_12': 'SB 54, would mean that we would support SB 54 on the condition that the bill also include the amendments that you had described as they relate to partnering with federal law enforcement agencies on combating serious and violent crime as well as organized.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Organized crime.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Thank you. So we would not we would want to support this with those conditions. And I think that that puts us in a really good place because it speaks to both of those issues of support for immigrant communities.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Also with these conditions as amended, as described as we described. So and then also, I know that Senate pro-tem Kevin de Leon also had suggested that we could be we could have a seat at the table. Since he is meeting with the Police Chiefs Association, he wants to hear from Long Beach to see what the issues are'",
        "'speaker_3': 'with this bill as he's amending them. As this bill is evolving, I think it's important that we have a seat at the table, that we contact him directly, whether it's you in the audience or ourselves, myself as a state legislative committee member and also federal legislative committee member, we're going to have to take these at both levels'",
        "'speaker_3': '. And so I think it's important that we all provide an opportunity to speak to our senators and describe these amendments, because we also want to make sure that we're taking care of our public safety here at home. So I hope that clears it up.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I thank you again for discussion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Next up is Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. And I have a I'm really want to just say the public comment today has really moved me this evening. I've listened attentively and tried to be respectful to to everybody's point of view this evening. I mean, my colleagues, the back and forth has been very, very helpful when I'm asked about what democracy look like looks'",
        "'speaker_4': 'like. I look around Long Beach. I look at this council chamber tonight. I look at this dais and this is what democracy looks like today. Thank you. I wanted to spare you the chant tonight. Today, millions of residents and American citizens are living in disgust and fear due to impulsive and reckless and mean spirited executive orders from'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the current occupant of the White House. I want to thank my colleagues for bringing this item forward. Somebody brought up and called me out and asked me to support this item. This is a no brainer for me to support in concert.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This is a no brainer for me to support it. If you know me, you know this is a no brainer for me to support. When you bring up forth an item you can only bring for the maximum amount of supporters you can bring on is for and I'm support.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm very, very sure that this is going to get more and more people to support at the end of the night. And so and as chair of the city's state legislative committee, I look forward to working to get both of these Assembly bills or Senate bills passed with my colleagues.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think Council member Lena Gonzalez's amendments are considerate and responsible, but I'm going to be offering some more advice. Obviously, California cannot condone profiling or discrimination of any kind. That's not who we are as a state, and I don't believe that's who we are as a city.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I know for a fact that's not who we are as a city and as elected officials. It's our responsibility to protect families and oppose injustice. And Dr. Martin Luther King, his famous quote was An injustice anywhere is an injustice everywhere I was raised to.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And this is a political slogan nowadays to be my brother's keeper. Right. And gentlemen, the first speaker referred to me as his brother. And yes, I'm your brother, but I'm his brother as well. Right. His brother as well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm his brother as well. My brothers are black, Latino. They're white. They're Cambodian. The Filipino. They're all what's. My brothers are Christians and Muslims and Buddhists. This is a diverse city and I love this city and I wish that the rest of the nation could experience the life and the community and the sense of community that we'",
        "'speaker_4': 'have here. Councilmember Gonzalez, I do appreciate the conversation between you and a. Councilmember Price regarding the bill. And we do know that in Sacramento. Bills do go through machinations. Right. And today, this language is something I think we can support in concept.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so my my my advice for friendly amendment or my friendly amendment would be to support this bill, this bill, SB 31 and SB 54 and any other bills that may be introduced. Right. Because there may be a few bills out there that we may want to have the flexibility as a city to support in concept that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that that accomplishes the same same thing here. And and again, I think you said where we're stuck right now is support with amendments. We can take support and concept. I think we can we can bring everybody along. So that would be my recommendation.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. I appreciate that and I'll gladly accept. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh. Vice Mayor Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And so I've particularly enjoyed this conversation. I think this is, you know, occasionally it's our job to to lean in and better understand these issues and take positions on them when appropriate. And these bills on the table, they demonstrate some very critical values, religious freedom and trust.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I personally believe in both of those things. But this goes a long way in terms of having an impact on community policing, which is entirely built on trust. The tone in Washington is quickly eroding that trust. And local communities should take a position and particular interest in protecting that trust and congruence and respect with our community'",
        "'speaker_10': '. Now, despite the fact that these bills are not signed, it may still change. I think something makes sense to lending our support to a bill while it's being crafted and add to that momentum to help it to get across the finish line.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It's important. It's important. Thanks. It's important that know that residents know and understand that we understand and acknowledge their plight. And we prioritize that as we serve them. I'm concerned about the moment we're in in our country, because, frankly, we've seen this before.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Let's just say the great majority of us that immigrate to this country were not under ideal circumstances. When we got here, we were all forced with opposition oppression, second class citizenship. Jim Crow laws. Mass and carceral internment. Deportment.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But deportation. Intimidation. And that's why we have to protect values like checks and balances. Separation of church and state. States rights and democracy. And so comments like wait in line are incredibly insensitive and privileged. And to me, this means as a.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So to me, this means as a city, we should be patriots and take a position on federal issues based on what we feel is right. Now, history has always looked favorably on those who have served as havens or sanctuaries to those who are oppressed.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And and we should consider that as we address this threat, this this threat on cities in California who have taken positions or the state of California who has taken a position to serve as a sanctuary or a haven.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And so I you know, I do serve as chair of our federal legislation committee, which is particularly interested in the impacts of federal policy. I serve as chair of our housing authority, which use federal dollars to protect and to house our needy individuals.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And my position is not that we should sit back and wait to see what the see what these policies or these laws should become. I think we should go get a seat at the table now, take a position early, help craft that.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I believe Councilman Gonzalez said get a seat at the table so that when these are are adopted, we can say we had a hand in that and it was crafted for Long Beach. So that said, I do believe that we should take a position early, but should also engage our committees to make sure that legislation that'",
        "'speaker_10': 'comes down federally and on the state side, we are at the table for that legislation. So that said, I do strongly support this motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Then we have we have Councilmember Supernova, and then I'm going to make some comments and we're going to go to a vote council for Superman.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Okay. I too would like to thank everyone for attending tonight. Being here a long time and speaking and you spoke with a lot of passion. And I'd just like to reiterate, because I still see the signs about Sanctuary City, and that is not the agenda item tonight.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And the city clerk can correct me if I'm wrong, but I think I'm not even allowed to talk about it. It would be a Brownback violation. Is that accurate? Mr. City Attorney.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That's correct. You can't engage in dialog or conversation about an item which has not been placed on the agenda according to the bar.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Okay. Thank you. But and that's troublesome to me in that so many of the speakers, that is what you felt you were here for tonight. And we're here on to state legislative items and and also like to thank Diana Tang for speaking.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'There was no staff report tonight. Do we know when this item came to us on the supplemental agenda? What day and time?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I mean, I guess it'd be a question for the clerk.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It arrived in the city clerk's office on Friday.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Okay. So my weekly newsletter goes out at 1:30 p.m. every Friday. So I didn't even get the message to my constituents. And I appreciate everyone being here tonight, but that's one duty I always feel. I have to let the folks know what is on the agenda and give people a chance to contact my office.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'The other thing I'm troubled by, and that is what Councilman Pryce brought up. And I would just call it a vetting process that, well, the Fed Pledge Committee was mentioned and my colleague mentioned the state committee. I can think of half a dozen committees or commissions that could take part in the vetting process for this.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And I'm concerned in the process, and I don't want to hang the item up tonight on process, but we're kind of getting a habit here. I hope it's not a habit, but we tend to pass stuff and then go back and reverse engineer and make sure it's right after the fact.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And I think the purpose of our committees and commissions is to vet the items first so we get all the facts here to make a reasonable, rational decision. Also, I think that dollar amount, that's also what we have to weigh of two state legislative items.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And then this issue of the dollars. And one of the speakers said, you know, a couple or a few million dollars. And while the 224 million may not be accurate, it's still a substantial amount of money here we're talking about and all of us as as voters here tonight have to consider that.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'I think I think the ideas for the amendments that Councilwoman Pryce made were reasonable. But if that's not accepted moving forward, I guess what we're being asked to do is to sign onto an item. And I'll use Dinah Tang's language items that are in their infancy.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And even a phone call from the mayor to Senator De Leone could not sort this out today. So that's we all want to do our fiduciary responsibility here and vote the right way. But we're really kind of flying blind.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And let's hope that this council has that influence at the state level because we have no guarantee of that and and we can sort it out in committee after the fact. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. I'm going to wrap up. Councilwoman Pryce.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I just have just one more possible friendly. Is it possible that we can bring it back and it's amended form and again vote to support it just in case there's any amendments that we didn't already? I know that we listed two areas, but there could be other amendments that are added.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is it possible that we can bring it back to council once all the amendments have been added so that we can again vote to support the completed legislation? So after we know what all the different amendments were, I think what we're doing is we're supporting as amended.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's what it states. So in the amendments are included and that's okay. But what if what if there's another city council somewhere that has a different amendments they want to include and the senator listens to a group or other groups and adds amendments in there that we don't like or we don't.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Then if we if we're firmly opposed to something, we're not going to support it. Okay. So we're not voting to support it tonight. We are voting to support as amended. So the amendments that include the local law enforcement participation and multi-agency federal task force.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I also think yeah, so I'll just leave it there. We'll support as amended. I think that it's very important that we we do this and we support it today and. Continue discussions with our state legislative committee and federal legislative committee.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Let me just make some comments and then we're going to go to a vote. Well, first of all, I just want to say to everyone that came out, you all made me very proud to be an American tonight.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I wasn't always an American. And so to see so many folks just come out and support people that are undocumented, people that are may have a different religious background than the majority of the country, I think is very inspiring.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We should all be inspired by all of your words. I especially want to thank the people that were here, the young people that were in high school or younger that came out really, really proud of you for being vocal.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think it's important to note that Long Beach is a city of not just immigrants, but refugees. And in fact, this city's history, if you're a student of the city's history, is a story of refugees from Cambodia of of incredible pain through an immigration from our Filipino Americans throughout Long Beach and the county, including their incredible service'",
        "'speaker_0': 'to our military, which is literally they literally built much of the military economy that was in throughout Long Beach. It's a story, of course, of all sorts of people from different religious face coming to the city of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And as you know, is now a city of an incredibly large and robust Latino community, both Latino-Americans and and Latinos that would love the honor and privilege of one day being an American. And so I think in my conversations with our both the president of the Senate and our state senator, I'm really proud of them of stepping'",
        "'speaker_0': 'forward and bringing forward these pieces of legislation. I do want to say a couple of things we think are important. There are already there are already about 40 cities across the state of California, including the largest city, the largest cities in the state, whether it's San Francisco or whether it's San Diego or Los Angeles, San Jose, that'",
        "'speaker_0': 'essentially follow or have codified what is currently already in the California Act that's been proposed by Pro Tem DeLeon. So those cities are most of those cities are either close or have already codified the work that's happening. What the intention of of this bill in part is to ensure that if you are a citizen and so is'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Long Beach. By the way, I have personally worked with our police department, our chief and other folks to ensure that we are also a city that is supportive of everyone. And but what is important is if you are a citizen of Los Angeles or of Long Beach or of San Jose, I want to make sure that you'",
        "'speaker_0': 'are being treated the same when you go to Fresno or when you go to Newport Beach or when you go to any other city that may not have the same protections. And so I think having a statewide standard and a statewide protections is important.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I think that's that's what I think is important about these bills. The other thing is and Councilmember Austin knows this because he's very involved with me, the two of us in a lot of the state bills is bills.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Change.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And they adapt through the legislative process. What we're doing tonight is no different than many of the other bills that we've passed years before. We support a bill, we may recommend amendments, and then the bill moves forward in the process.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And of course, at any time if a bill got to a point where we didn't support it, the council can step in and pull their support for a bill. But today it's possible to move forward. We support four bills and that's something that is that the council does in common.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I want to just begin by saying that I support both bills. I have supported them from the day that they were presented. And and I certainly support Councilwoman Gonzalez tonight as well. I want to say that. Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And this is I think it's important to say as much as possible. And if we're connected on social media, you know that I actively and consistently trying to bring voice to our values. And Long Beach will always be a place that supports all people.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's what that's what Long Beach is about. Long Beach is about everyone. And everyone includes people that are undocumented, that are Muslim-Americans and that need our support. We should not at any point as a community feel threatened. Or bullied by anyone, whether it's another governor of another state, a U.S. senator or the president of the United States'",
        "'speaker_0': '. We have to always stick up for the values that we believe in. And so I will say that I think I would encourage us all to stay active in this conversation as the bill moves forward. I think there have been some good ideas brought forward tonight, and I also believe that everyone on this council, every single person'",
        "'speaker_0': 'on this council, believes in supporting immigrants and wants to see people protected. I do believe every single person on this council believes that. And so I want to think again, the makers of the motion, I want to thank our two senators.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And and hopefully tonight will be an important step in ensuring that there are statewide protections that include Long Beach, of course, but statewide protections across the state of California. And so with that members, I'm going to call for a vote.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Motion passes seven zero.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you all. I'm I'm going to go ahead I'm going to go ahead and take a just a few minute recess because we have an agenda that's still very long tonight. So thank you for coming. We're going to take a two minute recess and we'll be back in 2 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. We're going to if I can have everyone please exit the council meeting if or if you're going to stay. I need to start the meeting. The meeting again. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you very.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, guys, I need to start the council meeting, so I need everyone to take a seat or exit, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you again. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Rock roll call, please.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Hey, guys. Everyone hear that staff hash? We have we have a meeting. We're running right now. So if you're talking, you need to be. Thank you very much. Especially Pat West. Take a seat, sir. Thank you. Okay, we got to we have to finish our meeting, so we're going to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think we have. Item number. Hold on 1/2. 19. I don't even. We still have. I think we have two members of public comment so that we haven't done. So let me let me do. We're going to do.'"

I know that the decision of picking two would would be difficult, but I think that we came up with the solution where the needs were most and the community'",
        "'speaker_5': 'will be best served. So I appreciate everyone for all the hard work on this and especially on public works, who has to do all the project management and design and implementation while also managing all of Measure A and the other crumbling infrastructure and most recently leaking infrastructure.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So thank you for what you're doing and keeping everything afloat.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you. Councilmember here again.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you, Mr. Richardson. I want to echo the comments made by Councilmember Mongo. This is a great opportunity for us to activate some fields, and not only that, but to make them available year round because of the the less maintenance that there is.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And it's also a public safety issue as well. I mean, there's many times when you have overwatering or you have heavy rains, as we've had this last couple of weeks, where overuse of a park can really create divots and potholes in the fields and kids can break their ankles.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And anybody who uses the for for for recreation as a whole. So I want to again, also commend staff for their efforts and the and the Parks Recreation Commission for doing their diligence in reviewing all of the available.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Options that we have for turf and choosing what I think would be the best one that works for Long Beach. So I want to commend everybody involved in this project. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilwoman Gonzales.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes, I, too, just want to say thank you to Marie and Craig for sticking with this. I know this was a bit of a process as we've described, but I know for Seaside and District one, we're really excited to finally have the opportunity to have some sort of greenery there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so a lot of the kids and students at Washington Middle School are excited to start playing soccer again and, you know, just allow that park to come alive and really that neighborhood to come alive. So thanks so much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Any public comment on item 19? Please come forward.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Good evening in Cantrell. And I want to thank Council Mongo for. Going with. Natural grass in El Dorado. I hope that this will be a. Prepared field with leveling and gopher prevention. Such as you're using for the artificial turf fields, and you'll notice that it can be done for $800,000, whereas the total cost for seaside is 1.5'",
        "'speaker_8': 'million and the total cost for. Admiral Kidd is even more than that. Think of what 1.5 million could have done for the homeless tonight. I think. Children in Long Beach deserve soccer fields that are as well-maintained as golf courses, and I think it is possible to have it with natural grass.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You were given the benefits of artificial turf, but none of the disadvantages were mentioned, such as it's hotter. It can get up to 160 degrees on a warm day. It's more abrasive. It needs greater maintenance. Your warranty includes brushing and aerating, which means watering and breaking.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It doesn't include disinfecting, which you need to do with artificial turf because it can harbor staph infections. Another thing that I find out from my soccer playing grandchildren is when they play on artificial turf, they need special soccer shoes.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The shoes that they use are natural grass aren't allowed on artificial turf. So I'm thinking of the children in your neighborhoods that are getting this artificial turf, whether they're going to be able to afford special shoes to be on here.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'These fields have to be fenced off. From the rest of the community because you can't have soft drinks on it, you can't have spiked heels, you can't have bicycles. It's not going to be open for the use of the public.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I urge you to take a look at what happens with Drake Park. It was supposed to be a pilot program and it's supposed to open in June. Look at it. See if all these problems that I'm saying are going to happen, happen.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'If they don't, then go ahead with this. But I would postpone making any contracts until you see the Drake. You so.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Much.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Success.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you so much. Next picture, please.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm so sorry to be here again, but I need to support. I mean it. You tired of me? I'm tired of me anyway. I need to support my friend and Cantrell and. And. Absolutely. Beg you to listen to this elder who has spent her life fighting and trying to convince endless numbers of city councils to do the'",
        "'speaker_8': 'right thing for the environment and in a natural way to preserve nature. Now, artificial turf. I mean, I guess it's made out of stuff. It sounds kind of natural. But I do believe there's even a question of the contractors being sued.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I would just ask you also to slow down on this, but then again, to speed up on stopping spraying roundup in our parks. If we're concerned about safety, where all we are is concerned about safety, that from beginning to end the whole night, everybody wants to be saved.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Who doesn't want to be safe? Sometimes convenience or something shiny and pretty like, you know, a plastic lawn. Maybe it saves water in the in the first, but then if it seals off the ability of the of our runoff to soak into our aquifer, where are we?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm going to cut this off early. Just listen. Please listen to an Cantrell. She doesn't have any other interest than our our future generations. We love her.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I wanted to actually commend the Council for going with the Natural Grass at Eldorado Park because I mean, I, I've had many pleasant experiences at that park and I really appreciate that it's one of the better maintained parks that kind of resembles a more natural setting.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'With that, I wanted to raise a couple issues with artificial turf as the production of oxygen is kind of inhibited because, you know, you don't have organic material that kind of AIDS in that process as well as the rainwater runoff, because artificial turf tends to kind of just keep it at surface where grass actually kind of absorbs'",
        "'speaker_7': 'it and puts it back in the soil. So it serves more of a purpose to maintain as much as possible grass or natural sort of settings, especially when you are dealing with children in inner city that normally don't have exposure to natural resources or, you know, outings, if you will, because most of the kids in the city'",
        "'speaker_7': 'are surrounded day by day with, you know, asphalt and sidewalks and all these things. So the ability to be still surrounded by something that's very natural, very I mean, I have memories of growing up and running on field.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I mean, I'm allergic to grass, but I still love it. So I think I think it's a thing that we should and especially in bigger cities and cities with more development preserve to keep. It might not seem as a sound investment, but I think there could be ways and to looking to better use natural resources to'",
        "'speaker_7': 'do efficient you know green preservation of parks that are in fact efficient in water use as well as giving back to the environment and not as abrasive like some of the previous points.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thanks so much. Next week, last speaker.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Hello again. I just wanted to point out a few things and stress a few things when I initially hearing Astroturf. Be a strategist inside me jumped, my skin crawled and then I started getting itchy. But I do appreciate the exploration of the best possible ways we could implement using Astroturf, including a formula that is organic.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'However, as someone that admires good design and also strong urban design, one of the tenants of urban design is creating environments that enliven and enrich the community in ways that they didn't know they need. Things like art, murals, benches that art you wouldn't think are necessities, and also green spaces that are real and not abrasive and artificial'",
        "'speaker_7': '. I just think about, for me, living in an urban environment, the most exotic places that I would visit as a kid would be Eldorado, Park and Disneyland. And I would really hate or not hate, but I think it would be unfortunate for young kids who don't get to come out and experience nature, to experience Astroturf and that'",
        "'speaker_7': 'be a hallmark of their childhood. I also think that while it's tantalizing to look at this as a way to mitigate climate change, I feel like in the long run, Astroturf only works in seriously contained environments like theme parks or private residences.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The speakers before me have explained how it sort of cuts off water runoff. There's more maintenance involved, especially when it comes to sanitary issues. So I just ask everyone to consider those points as well. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Please come forward.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Good evening. My name is Abraham Bashagha, and I had I just felt a little compelled to speak on this this issue, just because I'm a former intern at the water department and I was working with the conservation unit and we were doing lawn garden conversions and synthetic turf conversions as well.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I was working with this program very closely and notice that there are two major differences. So it almost was almost like night and day. We had a lot more people signed up for the turf removal as opposed to synthetic turf.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But working with the synthetic turf, there was a lot more detail behind it. I don't have an issue per se, if there will be synthetic turf parks and of course, grass parks. I think the balance is actually very good.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The only thing with synthetic turf is that there must be an adequate amount of research done and just information as far as maintenance and safety is concerned. I just think it'd be smart to educate the public on the difference between the both.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'As lady mentioned earlier, that there are there are certain requirements based on the turf who's manufacturing it and who's implementing it as far as special spikes, special equipment that does exist. However, as long as the public's educated on it, I think there shouldn't be a problem.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'As well as the heat island effect on the synthetic turf in the summer, it does tend to get a bit hot, and sometimes it did. In one instance, I did see the turf melt on home. Well, I was doing an inspection for the water department, but that was just one instance.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And that was because he went to a retailer that that was not on our approved list. So maybe I like I said, research would be great. If you guys need information from the water department, I'm pretty sure they would not hesitate to help.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And that's all. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And our last speaker. And then we got to go to a vote, sir.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Hi. My name is Ramon. I'm in the fifth district. I'd like to compliment Stacy Mango for at least giving us the grass soccer fields. I do have some objections to the artificial turf that's being put in the other parks.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Before I go any further, I'd like you to know that I'm also been given permission to represent the air. So one one for which has 2250 people, plus the residents that I have that are about 3000. Okay. This is the same group of people that I got to sign a petition during the budgetary meeting.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. Um, the water savings for the. That we receive for the. For the artificial turf to remove and install the grass is actually less than the cost of install. I mean, the installation and all that stuff for artificial turf is cost more than the savings for maintenance and water.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That's what I've gotten the. There's a lot of problems with the with the health aspects, the the biological issues that are involved, some of the cancer stuff that's still there. This is a new surface that nobody's ever tried before.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And we're now rolling it out in full blast that we're that we're doing so. To me, it doesn't make a lot of sense. There's three times as many injuries and artificial turf as there is on on. Grass. The residents prefer grass.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So do the all the soccer players and all the teams. I did survey in Roberto Urunga area for Admiral Keter, and I spoke with the people using the soccer fields, which incidentally already have light. And they they don't have any problems with the field.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'm sure you did. I don't know if you did or not. So I'm letting you know that the residents and the the soccer player teams, they prefer having grass themselves. I think it's important that you know that because we don't know why you're doing it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That's why it's only the guys behind the desk, I guess. So the Long Lobby School District also has done a study on the different uses on soccer. And what they've discovered is they've got a 2% loss in students that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Excuse me. Well, I guess you don't want to hear me. It doesn't matter that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You don't want to. I don't you know, it doesn't matter.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'These guys are so rude. They don't even want to hear me.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So, you.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Know.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Sir Ramon.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I actually called you today to talk about this specific matter.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You know what?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, let's let's not. That's not that's not going to here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right, sir. Okay. So let's let's go ahead and. Okay. Thank you, sir. So anybody anybody else who would have comment on this item? Okay. See the public comment on the item. Mr. Boland.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Hi, Larry. Roland, I had come forward. I had an opportunity to spend time at City College. The dean and the grass out in front of the between two large buildings was just a terrible mess. And the flower beds weren't taken up with all the gardeners who were being paid to do it.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So I met with the head groundskeeper and I said, because I work for a company that did turf management. And I said, Look, why don't you do this? Grass will hold up. It doesn't have to look like that with all these holes in it.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'If you do one thing and that is you assign one person to that spot and you hold them accountable. That it looks like it's supposed to look. And guess what? Next year, the grass was just beautiful. But the grass next to it, where they had another guy, it was the same way.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So it got down to people keeping it as it supposed to be. Now, we'll have to say this. I think you have to put a little more money into real grass. But there's also the human element of who's going to take care of it, who's going to fertilize it?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Who's going to cut it? Who's going to make fix the patches? And I just say this and I'll make it short. I think everybody prefers real grass. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Mr. Bowlen. Councilman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. I wanted to point out two clarifying questions to answer some of the questions that were brought by the community tonight to the first part. Who's going to take care of it? I appreciate your comments because that is a very important component of the entire process.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And Parks, Rec, Parks, Rec and Marine has brought on a specific field and grass maintenance expert. So we now have someone who knows the difference between a piece of grass that has two goalposts and an actual field. And the things that Ms..'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Cantrell mentioned, which is irrigation and all the different components that make grass durable for play. The second component to Ms.. Cantrell's question, 800,000 is not enough for the projects that we will be doing at Eldorado Park. However, we're bringing forth a community item, a follow up to a council agenda item I had several months ago where we'",
        "'speaker_5': 'have talked with Parks Rec and Marine about sponsorship and partnership opportunities so that the organizations that are going to be utilizing these fields will make up the variance or hopefully will make up the variance. They have said that they're interested in doing that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So while it is 800,000, there are three fields and the potential sports space that we're looking at and what that looks like, I mean, it would exceed the 800,000. But if these community groups would step up in the way that they think they can, we would be able to pull in another hundred thousand dollars from that community'",
        "'speaker_5': 'and make everything possible. Otherwise the project would have to be reduced slightly. But and we're giving that discretion to Parks Rec and Marine and public works to make that all happen for us without any more delay. So I'm excited for this to move forward.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. And I hope my colleagues will support this item.'",

Part of my team tonight includes Kelly Collopy, the director of Health and Human Services, and then Laura Turnbull, who is the program coordinator for the Healthy Active Long Beach program. We are pleased to present this to you tonight.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This is a public hearing because this will be a technical appendices to the mobility element, and therefore that's why we needed the public hearing portion of it. So for those of you who might not know what six three is, it is the communities of excellence in nutrition, physical activity and obesity prevention.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And the Health Department has been working for quite a number of years on the healthy, active language program. And then that has evolved into the the Sea X Initiative. So what this plan represents is focusing on ten specific neighborhoods that met certain criteria and focusing on opportunities for change to improve those areas, both from a food desert'",
        "'speaker_5': 'perspective and then also from a safety walkability and livability perspective. Clearly improving walkability is important for us as we move towards being a more mobile city and then clearly access to healthy foods fall into those two program components.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'These are the ten neighborhoods that we're focused upon as part of this effort. The ones that are in the dark shaded area, you will see the top graphic is a graphic of the city. And then the six three neighborhoods are made up of ten neighborhoods in west and central Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We recently brought to you a pedestrian plan for the metro areas around the metro blue line stations. So those areas were exempted out of this plan. But but you can see between the lower left hand corner, the mob and the pink, those are the areas where we now have certified pedestrian plans.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That will be a technical appendices to the mobility element. Here are the guiding principles that we're focused on in these ten neighborhoods. Clearly, our streets and sidewalks need to be safe and accessible and the environment needs to be livable.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And it needs to be a an environment that is reducing pollution, is reusing rainwater through bio swales and then focuses on recycling. We do want to support the economic development of these neighborhoods, the social life of the neighborhoods, provide recreation and health opportunities, and then also enhance the esthetics and beauty of these neighborhoods as well.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so part of the plan format was that there was an assessment of existing conditions in these neighborhoods, and then there were neighborhood snapshots that include demographic analysis and then then survey intercepts, focus groups and then walk audits in some of these neighborhoods as well.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That helped us prioritize what those pedestrian priorities should be for these neighborhoods. So I'm going to give you a number of examples for two of the areas of what the plan involves. But it it resulted in 76 concrete recommendations in the plan that would them, as I said, become part of the mobility element.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So, for example, in the Washington neighborhood, we did focus quite a bit on what the snapshot of health looked like, the number of schools, the number of physical assets that were either publicly owned or owned by other institutional stakeholders, and then focused on the accessibility to healthy stores and recreations, recreation opportunities to see what sort of improvements'",
        "'speaker_5': 'we could make to either improve access to healthy foods or improve access to recreation opportunities. And so that resulted in some suggestions for priorities on how to enhance the 14th Street greenbelt, focusing on getting the folks in the neighborhood to utilize the park to an even greater extent, particularly where the the park is not being used because'",
        "'speaker_5': 'there are a couple of blocks on the park that are heavily used, but others that are underutilized potentially focusing on ways to increase circulation and safety for those neighborhoods as well for the Lafayette neighborhoods. Similarly, this we went through this exercise for all ten neighborhoods focused on the healthy snapshot, the numbers of stores, those sorts of things'",
        "'speaker_5': 'as well. And then potential improvements that we could make in the Lafayette neighborhood that would enhance public safety, enhance the pedestrian safety, and then also add add amenities to those neighborhoods as well. So the Planning Commission approved this back in late 2016.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We are asking for your recommendation and then if you do approve this, we would then seek implementation grants and incorporate planning efforts into future infrastructure projects. If you have any specific questions about the six three program, since it has been going on for quite a while, I would turn those over to health to Kelly and Laura.'",

We are your pedestrian safety and walkable communities advocate, and I'm also a proud board member of City Fabric. First, may I say what a great night this is for active transportation and democracy, as he pointed out, what you'",
        "'speaker_9': 'have before you in the six three plan is absolutely a labor of love. I want to thank Laura Turnbull and her healthy, active Long Beach team and Neil Chesky and the Cityfibre team for all their efforts. They really set a high bar with this plan, both in terms of process and in terms of content.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'This pedestrian plan was prepared with substantial and meaningful engagement. And it was not just one of those efforts that was one and done. There were repeated consultations, the outreach with the community, and the plan was evolved and continued to be developed.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The plan reflects this extensive input and provides a viable and detailed plan for the city to move forward on pedestrian. Work. Long Beach wholeheartedly supports the plan's adoption and its incorporation into the mobility element. While we're talking about pedestrian planning, let me mention.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'A few other things that are important.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The first, of course, is Vision Zero. On May 24th last year, the city council took the critical first step. To begin the hard work of comprehensively assessing our roadway network and to figure out where the collisions. And remember, we call them don't call them accidents.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We call them collisions because they're predictable where collisions occur for all modes of travel. More and more cities are moving ahead with Vision Zero, and we need to keep the momentum moving forward on this effort here in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The second item is expanding the content from the fabulous six three plan and the downtown interior master plan. Pedestrian masterplan into a citywide pedestrian masterplan. Not unlike the bicycle master plan we'll be discussing soon. We stand ready to partner with the city to reach out into the community and bring this back to life.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Six plan has a robust tool kit, which, by the way, has been translated into both Spanish and Combi. And interestingly, Appendix A of the Bicycle Master Plan in the Next Agenda item provides best practices for design guidelines for bicycle facilities.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I would like to remind everyone that the very first implementation in the mobility element. Is to develop a street design manual. This is a vital step for creating streets that we want consistently and in.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'All parts of town.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Ensuring consistent engineering design practices. Improving safety and economic vitality and reducing air emissions from mobility. It's the everyday decisions that we make that will build the city that we say we all want. Our third goal policy priority this year is to get the city to start working on a comprehensive street assignment.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'After tonight, we will have two major chapters completed for the design manual and can look forward to seeing the Complete Street Design Manual with a full range of complete streets, complete streets design policies and detailed guidance about how we rebuild our future.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Much. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you so much. Any other public comment? You know, the public comment were going back then to council and council comments. Councilor Mungo.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I just wanted to ask a quick question related to implementation of the program and the care that it took. I know that sometimes I've read some of the comments related to the emails we've received and the questions that some in some community members have put forward.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I just wanted to ask Amy to take a moment to talk a little bit about the best practices. There were some comments about council members dreaming up ideas that they think are fun pet projects versus I know you mentioned the safety, but if you could just give a little look into the professionalism and credentials of the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'staff that are gathering this information and data. Certainly, we do look at all of the best practices that exist both at the state level and the nation at national level. And those are really coming into play. We do focus on, you know, the I forget the acronym for Eric's group, the APA.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The active transportation group that is a huge proponent of a lot of these efforts that we're doing. We are embarking on a huge mobility effort, and this falls under those mobility efforts which this city council adopted in 2013.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we do have professionals both on staff and our consultants are professionals who work in these fields for their at their daily jobs, who provide us advice and guidance as we go forward on these plans. I'm glad you mentioned the consultants, one of the public comments sent in.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Actually, I looked at their online post because it didn't fit all in the public comment section of the post and they specifically talked about the consultants. But we go through a bid process for that. There's no handing out bids to people who are going to do it the council's way.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's done through a professional standard without much influence from the council at all. Is that accurate? That is correct. We do go have to go through a purchasing process and there are purchasing guidelines that the city, the CFO of the city establishes and that we are all obligated to follow as departments.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And in this case, the consultants were selected through that process, as well as the Mobility Element Consultants and that the development services and public works, if better systems come in play over the years, we can always modify these plans.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Absolutely. Thank you so much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. There's a in a second.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I just wanted to say yes. Thank you to our staff here. Um, and I just wanted to briefly mention that I remember almost, you know, five or six years ago when I had walked with Laura Turnbull's team and did an assessment in the, I think it was the Edison Drake Park area.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And now to see this these items actually come to fruition visually is is wonderful. So I just want to thank you for your work. And I know Brian's work as well and I see so me here. And so it's it's just incredible to see that we're putting this into a plan.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And it's also nice because as we sit on many boards like Skog and state and federal legislative committees and we have to go and pitch these plans for money, it really helps us to do that a little bit better.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Vice Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I just want to chime in and say this is really creative. It's good work and we're paying attention. And, you know, L.A. just went through a process with the Prevention Institute and looking at the social determinants of health and how they can use that as a lens for land use.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And we're already wrapping up something like that. And that says a lot about the fact that we're forward thinking and sort of connecting health and planning. So I like seeing these two people together. Our health director and our planning director.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And so I would my question for you would be, how can we take what we've learned from this and integrate it into our general plan across the city? And I think it's great that you were able to target and go in depth in some of those neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And so that's that's my first question. How can we sort of take what we've learned and spread it or put it into future planning efforts? This approach that was taken.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's actually one of the long range efforts under the land use element is to create a more livable, walkable city. But specifically, these two are related to the mobility element, which specifically calls for the idea of a pedestrian master plan for the entire city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So that's on our work list. It's on our dream list as well, because that's that's critically important for everything that we've been doing. You probably do remember that these two departments collaborated a number of years ago to come up with the healthy, active living policies.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We put those in place early on with a grant from the county health department. And those really led to these efforts as well. So those sorts of coordination efforts have been, you know, growing routes over the last few years.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And these documents really establish that. And to Councilmember Gonzalez, at this point, it does put us in a position to seek grant funding. So these planning efforts are critically important for that purpose.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Great. Motion in a second. Please cast your votes.'"

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I'm going to turn over to staff for this. Thank you. This is a really important one as well. So I know it's it's late. I hate hearing stuff like this at this time, but. I just don't want you guys to, like, rush it either, because it's important.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So thanks.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. We absolutely agree this is a very important update and a hearing. So I will turn to Amy Burdick and Craig Beck, our directors of Development Services and Public Works, to give the report.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I will ask Eric Winston to join me instead of Craig Beck. So, Mr. Mayor, members of the Council, thank you for your time. I will go quickly, but take my time as well explaining this. As you well pointed out, the Long Beach Master Plan is a milestone effort in our long range planning efforts.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This was last updated in 2001. So we are a little overdue in updating it in 2013. You as a City Council adopted a groundbreaking mobility element that was very progressive for its time and proceeded Los Angeles in their mobility efforts.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we are very pleased to be always one step ahead of our larger neighbor to the north. This mobility element that you adopted in 2013 called for a great expansion of our mobility efforts citywide, both on the pedestrian perspective and then in other mobility modes of transportation, including bicycles, transit, as I said, pedestrians.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So with that, in 2016, we kicked off a very significant planning effort to update that mobility element, which, as I said, was last updated in 2001. So we were focusing on safety for road users, equity across the entire city, environmental perspectives, public health, quality of life.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'All of those outcomes were critically important to us as we strove to reach the goal of creating a more livable community and continuing to to progress the city forward. As I said, 2001, we adopted the first bike master plan, 2013, the groundbreaking mobility element.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then today we're considering the update to the bike master plan. It does coordinate with other efforts. You have been adopting these piecemeal, but we as staff understand how they all linked together. You recently adapted adopted the TOD in downtown pedestrian master plan, the green tie plan, the mobility element, and then a couple of other documents.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This will also tie into our land use planning effort that we are trying to conclude this year as well. Some of the recent progress you've all seen in your neighborhoods, we've got separated bikeways across the city. We launched a bike share program.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We've got road diets and buffered bike lanes going on throughout the entire city. Newly separated bike lane on Artesia Boulevard. Signalization and bike lanes on Shoreline. We've got grooved bike ramp installed at the beach access lot, a new beach path renovated with a new beach counter, shared lane markings and then bike lanes also on Seaside Way.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So you've seen these throughout the city. But one of the things that we needed to do is try to figure out the best way to link all of these different improvements together and to try to match that goal of creating access and equity throughout the entire city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So here's our existing maps. They look pretty okay. There's a lot of activity down towards the south and towards El Dorado, some of the major East-West corridors as well. But there's a lot of white on that map that needs to be filled in with new access routes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You can see also that this is a pretty telling map because it does focus on the bike collisions and where in most of them occur. And the focus of one of our goals of safety is to reduce those bike collisions to the greatest extent possible, actually, through an effort also called Vision Zero.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This had extensive outreach that took the form of open houses, community events, pop up workshops, going to some of our open street events, having focus groups and then survey responses both online and in person. We did set the goal of trying to design these bike facilities so that they were fully accessible, increase awareness and support efforts to'",
        "'speaker_5': 'enhance bicycling throughout both programs and social equity, and identify, develop and maintain a complete and convenient bike facility network. There are four types of bike riders and there is a strong and fearless, which is our city manager, the enthused and confident, which is our Deputy Director of Public Works, the interested but concerned Director of Development Services and'",
        "'speaker_5': 'the no way, no how. I'm not sure who they are, but we're working on getting them into the yellow. That would be Mr. Super nor apparently we're going to work on him, getting him into the yellow in the summer.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm a blue, but in the winter I'm a yellow. So here is something. It's a maybe a new concept for some of you. It's called 880 facilities. And we learned about this over the last couple of years where we are trying to establish a citywide network where an eight year old or an 80 year old can feel'",
        "'speaker_5': 'comfortable accessing that network. That is how safe and accessible and equitable that bike network or that mobility network is throughout the entire city. So it's called an 8 to 80 network, and that is really a key focus of our entire system.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I want to highlight the recently completed Artesia parking protected bike lane. This was an effort that we tried out where we physically relocated the parking spaces away from the curb. It has been proven through scientific research that the safest type of bike lane is separated from traveling cars.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And one way to do that is to separate the bicyclists from the traveling vehicles through parked cars or other forms of barriers. We also have a number of bike boulevards that we've we've implemented in some roundabouts, some of those bulb outs that you've seen, some of those median refuge islands, those are all in efforts to enhance safety'",
        "'speaker_5': 'and slow traffic down in order to reduce those bike collisions. Again, here's some of those 8 to 80 pipeline facilities that we're focusing on in this master plan. And then you can see that we are trying to layer those with other facilities that the more confident rider might feel comfortable in.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then we're focusing on facilities that close a gap in the system between protected bike lane or a another kind of bike lane where there is frankly a gap. And it's not very easy for a cyclist to traverse the city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So this map focuses on where we would do those gap closures. And then there are vision network facilities. This is to try to reduce those collisions to zero and what it would take for us to implement a Vision Zero network throughout the entire city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So with that, our plan focuses on the vision. The traditional table of contents. Introduction, existing conditions, our community input process, what we were trying to achieve and how we're going to implement it through administration and funding that will come later.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then here we are today. We're asking for your consideration to adopt to this. We intend to continue this. This is not in any way a static document. It is a living document that our mobility folks, particularly in our traffic engineering section, work on on a regular basis.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We will use this for grant applications. We have submitted a couple of grant applications already for a couple of specific protected improvements. We do have also have a number of improvements under construction that some of you are familiar with, Sixth Street in the Third District and then Daisy Bike Boulevard going in a North-South direction as well, particularly'",
        "'speaker_5': 'in the seventh District. So I believe that concludes my staff report. Eric with Strand and I are available to answer any questions. We also do have our consultants in the audience and then various members of staff who worked on this effort for the last year and a half.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Vice Mayor Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And I just want to thank everyone who played a part in putting this together. And I did read the entire plan. And the reason I went through the entire plan is because I actually saw my neighborhood represented in in throughout this plan.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So it was really interesting to me. So I see the intent. I heard equity twice in the presentation. I saw equity in the plan. I see there is a real intentional effort to make equity a part of this.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I see there was an intentional effort to make sure all the neighborhoods all the neighborhoods were represented. And, you know, if this is a direction, we're happy we're heading in. I'm happy. I'm happy with this. This is a good direction to go.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So I'm really proud of this. And I think this is the kind of document I will be proud, I will be legitimately proud to put in front of our residents and say, I stand behind this. You've seen this coming.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'You've been engaged in this process. And they would they will believe. They will remember. Taking part in different different points in this process was good stuff. And, you know, last thing I was just say as a part of this is and Councilwoman Gonzalez would probably agree with me, we were we got a chance to go with Skegg'",
        "'speaker_10': 'to Shanghai and Beijing, and we were able to see like true multi-modal. There were just as much on a small street, just as much road dedicated to bikes and, like, mopeds and things like that. As as cars. The cars the area where the cars were was much more dangerous in the areas where where the bikes were.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And, you know, it might have seemed chaotic, but it was a lot of ways safer. It seemed a lot more safer, more walkable. And they were way more dense. And and, you know, I know that city staff has done different, you know, visits to other communities to see that stuff.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I support that. I think we need to continue to look at what things are happy with, things that are happening around the world and make sure they're implemented and integrated into our planning. So thank you and keep up the good work.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Gonzales.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah, I'd like to reiterate the same. I think this is a really great document, very comprehensive of the whole city. And I also what struck me was the education component, because I know all over the city, but particularly in places like downtown, people are not super educated on where you can ride and what the safety rules of'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the road are. And so I think it's great that we're going to be emphasizing education in that sense. And even, you know, small points of facts like 11,300 Long Beach residents do not have access to an automobile. I think is is great to point out and so wonderful plan.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I look forward to seeing it evolve. And thank you for your work, both of you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes. I also wanted to congratulate everybody on their work. This was something you guys have done a lot of before I was in office. And I want to say on both the presentations, I know Vision Zero is something that's extremely important.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'To a lot of residents in my.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'District, both around Rose Park and around AOC seven. And so I appreciate it seeing that. We're trying to include parts of that where we can because it's a.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Really big lift.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I did have a resident question around the Anaheim corridor. You know, it's not in my districts. AOC seven shares that area. And so can you expand on that for me since the councilmember.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And part of that area isn't here? Certainly, we believe that Anaheim Street has a role as a multi-modal corridor. We don't know if it's feasible to have bikes on that street or a protected bike lane on that street in particular without removing parking.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But that's something that we could continue to study as we go forward.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. Thank you for that. Great job, everybody. I look forward to seeing this come to fruition and also really happy to hear the word equity and things that, you know, when when Charles first came and started doing the single bike lanes as a constituent, a lot less just one bike lane, you know, and you get a little'",
        "'speaker_8': 'frustrated because like what what's the point of one bike lane of A to see everybody really advocating for an entire network, a bird's eye view of how we're really connecting the community? It takes a big vision and it takes a real commitment from the city.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so I'm really proud of all the work that you guys have been doing over the last couple of years. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Price.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. I want to echo the same thing and thank staff and our consultants who are involved in this project. We have been the beneficiary of some of the innovative traffic enhancements that have been going on throughout the city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And change is very, very difficult for folks to accept. But I think that all the improvements that I've seen have been very positive. So I want to thank our staff for giving us the the confidence and the support that we need to make changes like that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I look forward to seeing this plan come to fruition and of course, seeing the Sixth Street Bike Boulevard come to CD two and three. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilor Mungo.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I want to echo some of the comments of my colleagues. First, I want to thank the staff for the work that they did, not just in the plan and the implementation, but in the recovery that we've done a little bit through the communities as some of these have rolled out, because similar to what Councilmember Pearce said, someone'",
        "'speaker_5': 'sees one bike lane go up and it's not connected to anything and. Some think it's beautiful and some think it's atrocious, and the community's come out and they're upset. And so it's important that we do this and continue to do outreach.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You did considerable amount of outreach. I would only recommend that in the future before bike bollards go in a residential community, that we notify that residential community and gain their input. I look forward to potential modifications as we roll these out and connect them to understanding the difference between what belongs in a residential community and what belongs'",
        "'speaker_5': 'in a commercial corridor, and how that all connects together appropriately. Because I think that we're going to have to make some minor changes along the way. But I think that we're open to a. A period where they're all together and connected and then an assessment of modifications and what that looks like over time.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And the most important component is maintaining things every time the council brings up great ideas that make the city better. We also have to talk about what does that cost us long term and how are we going to pay for that and how do we make sure that it doesn't take from other important infrastructure needs and public'",
        "'speaker_5': 'safety needs? So I will be supporting this item and look forward to a 6 to 12 month turnaround and modification as needed for residential communities.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And just to reiterate that you are committed to doing before and after studies on these projects as they go in and afterwards.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I appreciate that. I know that a lot of the community is very happy to have the road diet that is created by the bike lanes because it does slow down the traffic, or at least I feel that it has.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I like Amy and probably in the yellow section. I've been biking a little bit more since the bollards have been up, mostly because I feel like I have to. And like these, these bollards are here. I better go biking and see what that's like in the BOLLARD area and I had not done that before.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'd only really stuck to the riverbed because I felt safer there. And so now I'm out in the community. But it is scary when you go from a protected lane to a completely out in the open. I have I will I don't I don't know how to bike down, Clark.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's just a scary experience and I probably won't do it again. But we have a lot of college students that do that every day. And I thought to myself, Man, I should try it. Oh, my gosh, how do they do this?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I look forward to creating that safety for both cars and bikers and also maintaining the esthetics and beauty of the community. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. And I'll be brief. I think both of my colleagues have said it said most of what needs to be said. I'd just like to thank everybody and appreciate everybody who contributed to this or most importantly, our staff and our residents who who I know for a fact, at least on one of these projects, the Daisy'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Lane, we had close to 18 meetings, community meetings, too. And I don't think we ever reached complete consensus on that. We got a few nice roundabouts and some treatments in the neighborhood, and we're looking forward to the Linden Project coming on board really soon as well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This active transportation mode is where we need to go for the future. I think these both presentations, the pedestrian as well as the the bicycle master plan will will help us get there and make our city much more livable.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so, again, I just want to salute the staff and the consultants and the residents and everybody who had anything to do with this, this plan.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Councilor Entrepreneur Yeah, briefly. I was just being facetious. I'm not a no way. No. Hi. No how bicyclists. In fact, I'm assuming you may remember I think it might have been like 2010. You had a meeting at many Gan school.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'I think Alan was probably there too, and I was the only attendee who rode a bike to your bicycle meeting. So but I just want to mention, because Clark Avenue was brought up that there is no bicycle lane planned for Clark Avenue in the fourth district, that is between Atherton and PCH.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And what Councilmember Monga was referring to would be north of the four or five freeway. I believe I'm correct in that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We actually don't.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Have one either. Okay. I just won't bike there anymore.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Okay. I'm just trying to say it was both a lot of calls to our office. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. We're going to go to the public in a minute. Wanted to say a few things and then turn to Mr. West.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Mayor. Councilman, I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Just want to actually, I'm going to say a few things and then turn to Mr. Smart. That's okay. So just a couple of things. So first, obviously, great document, very supportive, have been, you know, since I was on the council of all this stuff.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm I just really want to make sure that we're like really pushing this stuff. Mr. WEST Because I know that sometimes it's I feel like we're making more progress and and other times we're making less. And I know that's important to all of us.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But are we being aggressive when it comes to infrastructure when we're doing our cap? Or are we going to see a lot of this progress implemented through the budget process? Because there's a lot of projects in that they're not adequately funded.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We can have like Eric Wickstrom. Give us a quick little report. He's been he and his team have been extremely successful in getting a lot of Metro dollars that are going to come down the pike in the next 12 hours.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And now we're going to get more of this.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Well, we can put that in a report or something. But Craig and his team have been very, very successful in getting infrastructure dollars to implement a lot of this and make it reality.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, I mean, do we have a lot of dollars to implement this stuff?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Eric So, Mayor, we have.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We've been successful with a lot.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Of the grant funding. I think historically some of it's 25 million we've gotten.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But how much do we have now?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Now? Well, that's kind of we're still implying with that, but we've been going after grants continuously. And you saw that we've got the Spring Street and Orange Avenue backbone networks that will be submitting a grant application for we've got money in the pipeline for Artesia coming for Metro, coming online in several years.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So it's a it's a continuous effort going after grant funding.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is there is a daisy project fully funded the Daisy project.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'We have a federal earmark. We're waiting to get processed. So there's funding there, but it's a process of swapping dollars.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So when when does that start construction?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Daisy We don't have a.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Timeline yet because we have to wait for the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Dollar. We've been talking about. We've been talking about that project for like five years.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'I know.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, so when do we start construction on the Daisy project?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'We're hoping to get dollars finalized this year and then start construction later this year or early next year.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So this project is way behind what it should be. Yes, correct. Okay. And what about the Sixth Street project?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Sixth Street. Bids open on that tomorrow. So construction will start this summer with completion by the end of the year.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Because we've been planning the Daisy Street project, even when the six year project was a twinkle in the eye. Right. Okay. So that's concerning. Not that the other one is an important because it is, but I just want to make sure that that north south connector connecting the north of the city to the south of the city'",
        "'speaker_0': 'has been put on the back burner over and over again, it appears to me. So I just want to make sure that that gets the priority it deserves. Absolutely. Okay. Mr. West.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I just wanted to point out, Mayor Councilmembers, that we've always had active mobility coordinators in the city. We have three out of the four that we've had in the audience tonight. We've got our first mobility quarter. So Meghann is here tonight.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yay, Sumi. We have our second mobility corner. Charlie Gandy is in the audience tonight as well. Our third coordinator, Al Crawford's in the audience tonight. Nate Burgess just left us and we're recruiting right now for another one. And we also have our bike ambassador for a long, long time, Tony Cruise, in the audience.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'They've obviously been very, very instrumental in the whole effort.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You guys are the best. So thank you, guys. Any public comment? Ford.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Let me start this off, Alan Crawford. I was the former white coordinator.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Representing Bikeable Communities, and I get to do a lot of consulting with communities throughout.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Southern California on putting.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In bike.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Facilities and in walking facilities. And I assure you, everyone is jealous of Long Beach. One of my colleagues in the San Fernando Valley the other day said, You guys are 20.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Years ahead of us. Not sure it's quite that good, but we're certainly leading. And what's so cool about it is that it makes Long.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Beach such a desirable place to live, to work, and to play.'",

I'm going to say something very politically incorrect here, and that is as I drive around the city, there's nobody using them.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I used to go down Second Street from one end to the other and look at that green thing on the ground. And there's not one bike there. The bike along the trail, along the beach. We can use the bikes on the river we can use.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But I'm sorry. I've lived here all my life. Rode my bike to school. Didn't need a bike lane. I'm still here, but has any. But I didn't hear the word utilization at all in that presentation that was just done.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Utilization. What is it? From my perspective, the mind may be all wrong, but I think you've got an underutilized system with a lot of money being spent. And what I was hoping not to hear was the word grant.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It seems government thinks that Grant is free money. No. When you get a grant from the state, where do they get it? Taxes. You get a grant from the feds. Where do they get it? Taxes? Well, they print it, I guess.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But anyway, I'm sorry to throw that on there, but I think. Maybe you could ask staff to give you a utilization of the first bike paths that are in on every day and make them different colors. Don't you know, start out slow but make the people who are putting these bike lanes in show utilization.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Why do we want to spend the money? It was not being used. And you're not evidently tracking the utilization of the current bike paths we have in it. Mr. Mayor, I know you have a dream, you have a vision.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I appreciate that. But Vice Mayor Richardson, as we were talking, I got thinking of the pictures of Vietnam, Sully spikes or somewhere in the Philippines or or in China. This is not China. We have 28 million cars and trucks.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'In California, you have 3 million in Colorado. Just to give you a thing, this is a car place. Anyway, please do a utilization study and require the people who make the plans to build this stuff to measure what goes on to it.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'And the biggest reason is that heat map you saw earlier in the presentation when you're looking at collisions. Anaheim corridor has a very high rate higher than any straight corridor.'",

I studied city and state development in Munich, Germany, where I rode a bike all over the place, walked all over the place while I was exploring Europe and the modern infrastructure they have there with some of the projects that are trying to be put in place'",
        "'speaker_7': 'by this plan, I learned that the Dutch opened their car doors and I didn't hear this in terms of education. It might be in your briefing book, but they open their car doors with their opposite hand, so it forces them to look over their shoulder to see if there are cyclists coming in those protected bikeways.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So this is something that happens in Amsterdam, in The Hague, in cities all across Northern Europe, and it's something that I think should be raised. It's something I just wanted to get up here and bring up because it's a super simple, easy and effective education technique to get this made safer for everybody.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'When I first moved to Long Beach, I would ride my bike every Friday morning before work from the Bixby Village area all the way up the river and then back down the Studebaker. After grabbing a donut. And the amount of times I had to dodge around, people who just threw their car door open was pretty shocking, especially'",
        "'speaker_7': 'on a Friday morning at like 7 a.m. But it's just a super simple thing. I don't think it adds really pretty much any cost. And if you have thought of it, awesome, then I'm not a broken record, but if you haven't thought of it, I think it might be a good idea.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So thanks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You speak?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Hi. Steve Gerhart with Long Beach. The bicycle masterplan is an important update to our active transportation puzzle, and I applaud the efforts that the city has made so far. A few years back, bike bike facilities were being installed so quickly around town that there's no way a plan could have kept up with it.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And we have lost some of that momentum. We'd love to see it come back. We're super excited about the ADT concept. It's a great way to design our streets and the city and the idea of closing gaps. That's really important to make the network complete, and we want to stay focused on that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That's really all I had to say. I did want to point out that I just had a conference of healthy community activists all around the country, and when I told them I was from Long Beach, he said, You guys are doing amazing things and I want to keep it that way.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So let's stay ahead of that curve. Thank you so much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Speaker.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Darling. Thank you, Mayor. Council people. My name is Charlie Gandy. I'm a citizen of the second district. I'm also a bike advocate. And I support, obviously, this bike master plan. As a professional in this world, I see a lot of plans and this is state of the art.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think it's going to be something we as citizens of Long Beach are going to be proud of. But I really came tonight to talk on behalf of a friend, and that's Mark Bixby. He wanted to be here, but he couldn't.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so he sent me. Mark was a serious bicyclist. He was also a serious runner, a serious swimmer. He was a businessman. He was a community builder. And of course, he was a family man. So he would endorse this ambitious bike program.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'He'd endorse a serious swimming program. He would endorse anything to encourage people to get out and enjoy Long Beach under their own power. And because he saw what the potential would be if Long Beach became a place where people could be free range kids and get around town by bicycling or walking or transit.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So he endorses all this as a business man. He knew that this was going to be an important part of Long Beach narrative. He knew if we wanted to attract young people and new businesses, we needed to keep up with these sorts of trends.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And he would have said, go big or go home with this kind of program. So as a community builder, he saw bikes as influencers. He saw police in recognizing that if kids were cranking on bikes and learning to build bikes, there were less kids that were trying to steal bikes.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'He saw that the Health Department was carrying on all these active living programs and endorsed the concept because he knew that he wanted his kids to be raised in a place that they could be active. And they knew the public works department recognized that these facilities were invitations for people to get out and ride bikes.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so all combined Mark knew and embraced active living. He knew that it was good for his hometown. It was great for his city, his family, his friends and his neighbors. He influenced us all, and he continues to do so here.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So in his name. Let's go big. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Speaker.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Hey, Mayor Garcia, council members. My name is Tony Cruz, and I'm the bike ambassador for the city of Long Beach. And I just got to say, it's really nice to listen to all of the previous speakers because I think it really shows how much support we have, you know, not only on the consultant side, but just, you'",
        "'speaker_7': 'know, community members. And then as well on the planning side for our bike master plan. And your guys's support for updating that plan is critical, and especially if you look at the network that we are envisioning, you know, having here in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so for me personally, I do a lot on the education side with kids. And my number one goal is to teach kids how to ride from one does or to ride to a destination, to pick a destination and then figure out how to get there using bike infrastructure.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I typically run a 3 to 5 week camp and by the third week all the kids in my group can tell you what the type of infrastructure that they run on. And also by the third week, a parent will usually join.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So it goes from just being a kid type of activity to now I have parent involvement and it becomes a family activity. And so now I if I'm out on the beach bike trail or on trail close to home, I'll run into families riding, you know, after taking a class like this.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So it's really important that we continue to be leaders in the bike advocacy and infrastructure world so that we can, you know, build a better network, obviously, for our community and be that example for, you know, cities like L.A. and others.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So that's, I think you.'",

        "'speaker_13': 'And I know, Mayor, that you know that because we spent some time together at the opening for the Artesia. Bikeway. And I'm glad that the plan does include so much, so many of the areas of the city that often get left out of these things.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Councilman Mongo. I'm glad to see that you've kind of come around on this or or maybe understanding a little more. I was in attendance at the Eldorado Public Comment event and. To see that you're not willing to throw the baby out with the bathwater on this is very encouraging to me.'",

All of the bike lanes in the city because I do like to cruise around the city and check out all the different bike lanes because I'm really interested in that and, and, and being'",
        "'speaker_13': 'involved in. Go into the public comment meetings and and getting involved in this process. I started writing my cycles about again because I wrote them with a kid. I started writing again about ten years ago because my I met Tony Cruz.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'I don't know if that was a good thing or not. But getting out on the bike. I've learned so much more about the city that I've lived in all my life and about some of the other neighborhoods that weren't necessarily accessible.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'To me because of the natural barricades that they get put up. You have freeways, the 91 freeway cuts, north Long Beach right in half. And these things are important to the quality of the quality and the connection of the city so that.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Everybody gets to see more about what's going on with the city. And I think the last thing we need to do to really improve bicycle safety in the city of Long Beach is to get pet West to learn how to ride a little more safely.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'I'm just kidding here. But that's what I and I just. I think we're headed in the right direction. I want to be Portland at some point in time. And and I think this is an important step in the right direction.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I appreciate many of you staying after the meeting to talk with me. I've learned a lot. My fiance and I bike shopping. I've had the same bikes in seventh grade and I've recently had to replace both wheels. I've learned the difference between a bollard and an armadillo and a bunch of other things that I didn't know that'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I had any importance in my life. But as I learn, I hope to grow. And I think that's a big part of being a council person. And we have to go in and listen to our constituents and those with the loudest voices often get heard first.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But that does not mean that that is the end of the argument. I've always said that. Research and knowledge and speaking to all the constituencies, even the ones that aren't loud, yelling the loudest is very important in the decision making process because sometimes the most supportive people are the quietest.'",

        "'speaker_11': 'But in the private sector, there are checks and balances that don't exist in the government. Big government, all government. Because we're in a company, a guy says, Well, I want to attract good people, but I can't afford to pay that.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That's why private sector salaries lag in government salaries because of no checks and balance. Now, the guy who can figure out the solution to the problem should be president. But you see what I'm saying? That there's something wrong here, that we we always have an increase.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We never say, well, we can't have one. And by the way, when the remember, the in lieu of thing that we paid the 25 million a year and the employees only had to pay 2% of their share of the 9%.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'You remember the letter that came down from the union boss in Sacramento that said to all employees, do not accept anything from your government employer for the in lieu of that does not make you whole. So what Mayor Foster did was real simple.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'He increased he took away 8% and he gave everybody an 8% increase. So the 25 million was eaten up by the 25 million increase in salaries. Anyway, I just want to express that thought about it for a long time and I know we need good police, but something's wrong.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Needs to be fixed. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, sir. Any other public comment?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This is Steve Downey, and I'm a homeowner and taxpayer in the third district. I sent an email to each of you earlier. I just think that this what the public has been given lacks transparency. We've asked for this so called market analysis in the benchmarks, and we're told there's there's nothing on paper.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, how can there not be anything on paper when the announcement, the press release first came out? We come to the website and we look for the memo. You it's not there once you're going to be there. Well, we're still working on it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I don't know how you're still working on it when the play had two weeks to vote on it. I guess that suggests that the members of the play didn't get to read it. My big concern is not knowing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The changes that are in this whole new section, whether those changes are spiking the pension. And that question should be asked how many changes are adding to the pension computations as compared to before in terms of the bonuses and the incentives and things like that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then the last thing, it's just something that's been on Microsoft for a long time. We have the. Millions. Brown Act that provides all of the working condition representation that the play needs is provided for in law. But on top of it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We are paying full time benefits for the past 17 years. Why we have allowed an individual with no experience in the field to promote from policeman to sergeant to lieutenant. How can we do that when he has no experience in the police department?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And what really bugs me? They have a First Amendment right to go back. The Washington and New York. And to vote for that toxic play. Thing and a vote for Trump. That's your First Amendment right. But they're doing it on my dollar.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They're doing it with a taxpayer dollar. And we have the Miller the the Milius Meyer Brown Act. It's plenty. Let's roll that back. Let's give something back to the taxpayer. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. See no other public comment. Go back to the council. Council member supernova.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Thank you. I have a question for staff and maybe the city attorney would like to weigh in on the document under item two, skill adjustments we have with $3.8 million for recruitment and retention. And as opposed to taking a look at this in three years and see if it worked or not.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'I think it's in the interest of the taxpayers and also to the DOJ to have some benchmarks in here to see with what we come up with if it's working. So what I'd like to suggest is, is maybe a progress report come back to the city.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'If Chair Price will agree to our public safety committee and we get some type of benchmarking or some type of report as to what systems are in place and how they are affecting the numbers.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Council member. Sure, we could work with the police department and the Civil Service Department to put together a report and provide you.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'An update on how.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They're making progress in terms of being able to recruit and fill their.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Positions.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Okay. And I probably would have been a lot more articulate about 4 hours ago. But I just want to be really clear that that this is about we have a need here. We have a $3.8 million need. And we just want to make sure it's working and do our part here on behalf of council.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Council member Austin.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you very much. I just want to congratulate you. I'll start by congratulating the players. I expect we will ratify their IMO you this evening. Our our director and her team. I believe that this and I work in the labor relations field.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I believe this email you and about financial packages is consistent and in line with many of the public law enforcement agencies in the IMO use that have been ratified in other agencies in the region and throughout the state.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I do believe that we need to do all we can to make sure that we are retaining and recruiting quality police officers for the city. The taxpayers expect us to to do that. Public safety. When you when we do surveys during the budget season, when we talk to our residents, at least I can speak for myself'",
        "'speaker_4': '. When I talk to my residents and residents, public safety remains a top priority for our citizens, and I do believe it is a very high priority for our council as well. So I'll be supportive of this and more you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I will just close and state to our police officers to whom much is given, much is expected. I know you guys will be great professionals out there and you'll earn your the money that you have gained in this contract.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I've been very fortunate to travel the country and talk with police agencies and be able to share great stories about things that we're doing in California and things that are being moved around. But one of the things that I always try to do is promote the Long Beach Police Department and some of the programs that we have'",
        "'speaker_5': ', and people are always excited to hear that we have openings. Until they realize the cost of living. As we look at the pay here and we compare them to some of the places that I've traveled to in the last year in Colorado and Florida and other places.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Police officers would be ecstatic to make that amount of money if they lived in those cities in Florida, in Colorado, in those places. And so I would really implore us to take a strong look at what kind of housing incentives we can offer to our police department locally, because the only way we're ever going to get solid'",
        "'speaker_5': 'good transfers from out of state is when they can move here and have the kinds of private sector benefits they give to move someone to a region that is so expensive as ours is. So I look forward to seeing some things with that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I know I've talked with some of our police staff and the Pope about it. The cost of living variance. I mean, the dollars per hour were astronomically higher here than in Sanford, Florida. But Sanford, Florida, you can get a three bedroom, two bathroom house for $74,000.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's not even in the range. I think a two bedroom, one bathroom in the fifth District is 600,000 right now. And so it's just not a same quality of life opportunity for these police officers and their families to move here.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I hope they'll move here eventually. But I think we need to address the housing component, too. It's not just about pay. It's about everything if it's going to be for transfers. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Gonzales.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I just wanted to thank Alex and, of course, our police department for all their hard work. I know it's you know, it's always tough sometimes getting to this point, but we've gotten here. I think we're in a good place.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I will say similar to Councilmember Super Na I and Councilmember Austin who mentioned about recruitment and I think we'll hear that a lot. We want to make sure we're recruiting good police officers. And I know that some of the conferences that have been attended by the chief, I've been looking at some of their conference program agenda'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and they do have really good ideas on police recruitment. So I don't know if any of that has been put into action, but it'd be good. As the evolution of recruitment evolves that we maybe take a look at some of these conferences and what they have to say regionally to bring that back to the city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So thanks so much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Now everybody's ready to vote. But I did want to ask our H.R. director just a couple of questions, just so that our public at home can understand the some of the recruitment challenges for a lot of these people.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'PD Mr. Vasquez, can you explain the the difference between the pensions? The pension package for for Long Beach PD and competing agencies across the region and state. Today for new, new hires.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm sorry. Can you repeat the question?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The pension formula for our police P.D.. Our public safety versus public safety in the region and throughout the state. Can you explain the difference or is there a big is there a difference here in Long Beach that that impacts our recruitment?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Most agencies that are in the CalPERS system have the same formula at this point with Keppra. The differences might be if the agencies provide any.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Support in terms of.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Picking up the employee cost of their pension. Some of the other our competitors, such as.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'LAPD and.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'L.A. County sheriffs, have their own pension system.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So that might also vary.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But I think the.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Biggest difference what we.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Found when we did our survey was.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Actually the salary.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So again, as I indicated, we looked at agencies such as Santa monica, Orange County, LAPD, Lasso, Glendale, Pasadena, Huntington Beach.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Santa Ana and Torrance. And we were.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'At the bottom just in terms of base pay and also in when we added in skilled pays that are provided across the board.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'They add to that? One area that we do see some challenges is with laterals, because Long Beach was one of the very first cities to take on pension reform and we were a leader in that area. We actually have a lower pension formula for people coming into our established police officers coming into our organization.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So that is a challenge for us because we've been a leader in the past on pension reform.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think that's where I was going. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. There's a motion and a second. Members, please cast your votes.'"
