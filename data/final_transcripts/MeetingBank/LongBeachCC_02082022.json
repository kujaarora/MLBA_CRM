        "'speaker_1': 'Extensive community feedback and input would inform the goals and policies and programs and other facets of this draft plan and that that outreach and engagement was summarized in the November 16th City Council letter. Details were provided there on the input received and how it was incorporated into the plan.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'On January 18th, 2022, the Housing Department provided a second round of feedback outlining a much smaller number of issues and edits to be addressed. Most were technical in nature, as I mentioned previously. That is primarily related to additional analysis that supports the site inventory and fair housing analysis.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The final plan and technical appendices are what is before the Council for Adoption this evening. And upon action. If the City Council adopts, then it will be resubmitted to the Housing State Housing Department for final review and certification.'",

While the state housing the state housing Department has not issued guidance about how they will enforce this law.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Most cities have been unable to meet the certification deadline with the changes instituted by that new law at the very late stage. But by having council adopt this plan this evening prior to the deadline, staff hopes that the state will make a favorable interpretation and find the city's housing element to have met the statutory requirement.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And staff will be working with the state to demonstrate that the city has made all best efforts to meet the changing deadlines and requirements of the new law. So after tonight, again, HPD will have 60 days to review and certify the plan after it is submitted.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'The letter also requested that the city update programs based on that analysis and show how such strategies will improve fair housing conditions when paired with identified sites.

        "'speaker_1': 'last time we presented. The staff presented the plan to you. Next slide, please. So in particular, additional analysis was focused on the site inventory and the fair housing assessment, specifically on how the site inventory is expected to improve and or exacerbate fair housing conditions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And more information will be provided on this in a little bit later in the presentation. Additional analysis to support assumption. The assumptions used to develop the site inventory, such as the likelihood that sites would be used for 100% commercial use rather than housing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The likelihood of non vacant sites being developed with housing and what potential impediments to residential development are. And to demonstrate that small sites and lot consolidation are not impediments to housing development. So generally speaking, all of this additional data and analysis is to support the fact that the sites, inventory sites really are feasible for development and that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'they are likely to be developed with housing in the time frame of this plan. And the plan appendices in particular were augmented with additional information about that, essentially shared local knowledge and identified relevant factors that contribute to the city's fair housing issues and experiences in achieving high achieving housing goals.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So, for example, more information and community feedback was added from the framework of reconciliation, the draft race and suburbanization context historic context statement, which is being prepared currently the 2016 Housing Assessment of Fair Housing and the city's success in in the last several years in implementing the housing goals identified in the Mayor's Affordable and Workforce Housing Report'",

So the next several slides are data heavy, but they are intended to just convey what some of the quantifiable outcomes of the planned site inventory are, which are supported by the plans, policies and programs.

The data on the right represents the important strategy that the city has put forward to help address patterns of segregation by focusing new low income units in high resource areas and more higher income units in low resource'",
        "'speaker_1': 'areas. You can see that the data on the right show overall a disproportionately high number of percentage of site inventory units in lower resource areas. But that is in part explained by the fact that those areas are where some of the highest transit access is located, and again, that there are most there are the most moderate and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'above moderate or market rate units focused in low income areas as well. And conversely, there are low income units in high resource areas. Additionally, many of the low resource or high segregation poverty areas, like I mentioned, are near transit and locating housing opportunities.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There help align with the city's climate goals of priorities of prioritizing housing near transit and reducing carbon emissions. And it also addresses prevent future displacement by directing additional housing where residents are already living. So just to point out very quickly, some notable stats from this table, which have a lot of numbers when looking at the distribution of'",
        "'speaker_1': 'units as a whole. Just over 50% of the units are in the high and moderate resource areas, and just under 50% of the units are in the low resource areas. But when you look more closely at the numbers, it does illustrate the mixed income strategy.'",
        "'speaker_1': '19% of the lower income units are in higher resource areas as compared to just over 9% of the market rate units. And 38.2% of lower income units are in the low resource areas. Those areas that are near transit and proximate to job.'",
        "'speaker_1': '61%, almost 62% of lower income units are in the combined high and moderate areas as compared to just under 40% of the above moderate or market rate. Conversely, 54% of the above market rate units are in low resource, high poverty areas, as compared to 38% of low income units.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And this distribution allocation of higher percentage of a above moderate income units in low resource, high poverty areas ensures that these areas will be more mixed income in the future and addresses concerns about concentrated poverty and segregation. Next slide, please.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So this this slide more specifically looks at the racially and ethnically concentrated areas of poverty, which are called recap. You can see the map on the left shows the site inventory with the blue dots and it's overlaid with the with these recap areas that are shown in yellow.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'As a reminder, the map on the right hand side shows in green and then the circles within the green areas, the areas that are most that have that are transit priority areas and have the highest quality transit, in particular in the black circles, which is where the inventory is focused most.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Again, the table shows how more higher income units for the site inventory are concentrated in recap areas, and fewer number and percentage of lower income units are in those areas to help begin to reverse some of the patterns of segregation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Only 10% of the lower income units are in the recap areas and nearly 90% are located in non recap areas. And similarly, nearly 40% of the moderate income and mercury units are located in recap areas. Helping again to make sure those areas become more mixed income in the future.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Next slide, please. Finally, this is the left data slide, which shows how the site inventory units compare to total units citywide, putting the distribution of units into a sub regional and historical context. You can see the city was broken down by zip codes into six subregions listed on in the table.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Those subregions are north, central, east, south, east, downtown and west. For purposes of the data analysis and at the request of the State Housing Department, the table shows how many site inventory units and what percentage of the inventory are at each of the sub areas.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You can see that west, south, east and east are underrepresented in terms of proportion of site inventory units compared to existing housing units. While North is proportional and downtown and central are overrepresented. You'll remember, of course, the high quality transit map on the last slide, which explains why more of the new housing is focused in downtown in'",
        "'speaker_1': 'central, which are served by the highest quality transit. The bar graph on the bottom of the slide puts all this into historical context. While there's still some over and under concentration of housing by area, some areas had very specific historic developed historical development patterns due to a combination of market forces and governmental policy at both local and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'national level, which has resulted in the distribution that you see represented by the bar chart here. When taking a long view of the site inventory, the distribution of the site inventory is an important step in making the city's housing stock more equitably distributed among the subregions of the city.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Next slide, please. So it was noted earlier that refinements were made to the programs of the plan. The most significant refinements were made to programs related to the fair housing strategies and strategies to affirmatively further fair housing there.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Cuts are shown here on this slide specifically, and additional refinements to actions, objectives or timeframes of certain programs were made based on the additional fair housing and site inventory analysis that I just ran through, the data that that was just shared.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so the the changes are shown here in blue. Some specific examples for is more specificity of geographic focus such as housing production of A2 use in high resource areas, which is shown in the first row there. There other examples are a commitment to have to do targeted programs such as home ownership assistance and tenant right to'",

        "'speaker_1': 'that I talked about in detail. Next slide, please.

        "'speaker_1': 'Update Housing element builds off of the vehicle's policies and strategies and provides a more detailed road map for creating sufficient capacity for needed housing in the city, including through the zoning code, amendments and rezoning of properties that are on the site, and how the elements inventory, which will be reasoned in alignment with the LME and will implement'",

        "'speaker_1': 'The housing element update and the rezoning of specific properties do not result in any physical improvements that were already analyzed, and particularly because this is a planning action.

We you know, you should if there's any biblical scholars in the room, should read the book of Jeremiah, in which the protagonist warnings for the destruction of the city of Jerusalem were unfortunately left unheeded with respect to the air.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you for the presentation, Miss Patricia. You know, historical context wise, I didn't hear the term redlining referenced explicitly, which is why these transit hub areas are so remarkably transit focused because the land was purposely maintained as blight in order for the development that we see today.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'With respect to this general plan, we have to put teeth and have prerequisites, contextually speaking, before we even have these development projects come down the pipeline. There needs to be mandated. Low income and affordable housing. There's a there's an agenda item later that you guys are changing the definition of what affordable rent even looks like in the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'city. Chapter 21.67 In the Municipal Code. You guys are changing that in the agenda item later. Mark my words, these kinds of developments are going to push out black and brown and Asian people and low income poor Caucasians out of the city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We need to make. We need to mandate prerequisite affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Your time is up. Our next speaker is Ailsa Chang.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening, Honorable Mayor and City Council Members Ailsa Chang, District five resident and Long Beach Forward Staff. I want to start by thanking staff from the Development Services Planning Bureau, especially Patricia Defender for Allison Spindler, Ruiz and Alejandro Sanchez Lopez for their tremendous, tremendous work and leadership over the past two years of the housing element process.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Now, as a result of years of tenant and housing, justice organizing and as a result, as you heard from others of the city's investment and community based organizations to engage in capacity building for the first time ever, the housing element incorporates critical community led housing justice solutions that reflect the needs of the people and the people of'",
        "'speaker_1': 'color. Renter Majority. Such community wins include program 5.2 to implement various tenant protections, including a program to allow substantial remodels while minimizing displacement program. And 6.8 on Community Land Trust and Program. 7.2 to establish dedicated rental housing staff slash division within the city government.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Despite, however, the significant progress, the housing element still does not go far enough to advance and invest in housing justice solutions, including, as you just heard from the staff presentation, fair desegregated housing. Born from generations of racist policies and market practices.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I want to turn quickly to the community engagement process. While which forward is grateful to have been one of the CBOs to partner with the city during the.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. That concludes your public comment. Our next speaker is Gabriela Perez.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening. My name is Gabriel Perez. I'm an organizer with Land and Lobbies, Coalition for Good Jobs and a Healthy Community. The stories and experiences we've come across from community members have made clear that the programs incorporated the housing element are significant victories for working class voters of color.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Program 6.5 in particular, which implements tenants rights to council, is a huge win for monolingual residents like my earlier Breda, as well as working parents like Calvin Warren and Reynoso, all of whom face the threat of eviction and will now be more empowered to navigate a confusing legal landscape and advocate for themselves and their families.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That said, the city still has a way to go to ensure that Long Beach residents are protected by a proactive, comprehensive and just approach to housing. Moving forward, this means a housing element process where CBOs that have trust and relationships, marginalized bipoc communities serve as critical, positive partners with the city, especially when involved from the very beginning'",
        "'speaker_2': 'of city processes and a housing delivery process where engage in marginalized communities and land use planning processes is mutually supportive and beneficial instead of extractive and tokenizing. This means meeting the immediate needs of people by collecting and sharing resources and potentially offering direct services such as rental assistance, application support, housing counseling and legal assistance.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Our next speaker is Ruben.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening, Mayor. Vice Mayor, Little Beach Council members, thank you for your time. Thank you for the presentation. My name is Ruben Minerals and I am as well a union member from the Southwest Regional Council of Carpenters. So I just come to you, the panel here today, you know, off script, just with an open heart and humble'",
        "'speaker_2': 'mind. I work and live in Long Beach. I'm currently involved in marine construction with the Port of L.A. and Long Beach. And I just can't express to you enough the importance of local workforce, skilled and trained workforce. We definitely all know the challenges of logistics, right?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'When with the rail, the freeway, 710, 110. So we come to you, you know, with numbers and just want communications, transparency, be involved and again can express how important it is to having this local and trained and skilled workforce.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Our apprentices are dreaming in the field, doing a safe job, doing a good work, beautiful product, put out skilled craftsmanship, and that's only going to help the logjam. Like was mentioned earlier with suppliers just, you know, the highways and byways again.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And just please take my words. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Our next speaker is Natalie Hernandez.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hello, councilmembers. My name is Natalie Hernandez and I'm a ninth district resident member. I'm speaking to support the adoption of the City of Long Beach housing element in the housing need. Summary data shows that Long Beach is a city of 61% of renters, with black and Latino renter households more likely to be rent burdened than white renter'",
        "'speaker_1': 'households and having the highest rates of rent hardship in a city that is majority renter, there should be more programs that assist first time homeownership, like establishing the Homeowner Assistance Program with Recovery Act stimulus funds. I can personally speak to the barriers to homeownership as a next resident.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'My family and I were in the process of buying a home for about all of 2021. One barrier was constantly being over bid by all cash investors in our Long Beach flipping properties. I was even overbid by Zillow.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I see in the housing element there's no policy guardrails to limit investor speculation. And another barrier I haven't seen addressed is incentivizing sellers to prioritize first time homebuyers. More work needs to be done on the barriers mentioned, but I hope the Down Payment Assistance Program proposed in the elements will be one tool to give local residents a'",
        "'speaker_1': 'pathway to homeownership. Though the housing element needs strong and swift implementation, I fear the suggestions put in the element are already being outpaced by the Long Beach housing market, controlled by investors and realtors. The city needs to actively work with local realtors to ship local renters to be first time homebuyers.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And the city needs to continue to work through this so that we will stop being a city of renters and workers and won't have to keep talking.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Our next speaker is Luis Flores.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. Good evening. My name is Louise Flores with the Southwest Regional Council of Carpenters. Look, 22 and I just want to say that, you know, I believe in that you should hire, rein in your workforce that we provide through our union.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And also, you know, if you hire local hire, it would diminish the pollution in our city. And also, I believe that if we live here, which you work here in our city. You know, bring more revenue to our city and reduce our traffic as it is.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know, I live here then we in. All the pollution that we get from that and also the refineries around. So I believe that if we live here, we shall be the first to work here. They'll be all.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Our next speaker is Myron Walden.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hello. This unmarried woman. I am the immediate past president of the Long Beach Great Panthers. We are advocating for seniors in Long Beach, and therefore, we are concerned most about affordable housing for seniors. And we see that there are mentions of seniors and disabled, but we are concerned about some certain things that can be done to improve'",
        "'speaker_2': 'what is generally has some very good things within the plan. We find there's no provision, for example, for multi-generational housing. We see that there's nothing there about LGBTQ people. We like very much the fact that it mentioned no net no net loss.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'However, there's one provision within that one thing that's happening within the senior community that we're very concerned about in terms of loss of affordable housing for seniors. And that's among the high housing where the contracts are up and speculators are buying what the housing and therefore converting them to market rate.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We are concerned about this issue. There would be, therefore, a net loss of affordable housing for seniors, and we would like the city to get involved and come up with plans to alleviate the problem of loss of senior housing, affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Please think about this as an issue and don't leave it to HUD, to this to the federal government. Think of innovative.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Times included our final speakers, Melody Osuna.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Evening. My name is Melodie Osuna, and I'm an attorney with the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles through our Long Beach community office at 601 Pacific and clinics at the Long Beach Courthouse, LeFlore is deeply invested and committed to justice for the people of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'As such, we take a great deal of interest in the city's housing element and its impact on poor and low income residents of Long Beach. We appreciate all the hard work and effort that went into developing the housing element over the past two years.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We genuinely appreciate the attention the city has given the developer to developing a robust housing plan that addresses the needs for tenants. We look forward to working with you on developing and implementing these programs. Many of these programs, such as technical assistance for Community Land Trust and expansion of the inclusionary housing requirement, have specific target dates in'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the next few years, and we eagerly await the opportunity to help develop these policies on their scheduled timelines. Others, such as the rental housing division, are more aspirational in nature, and we hope that the city remembers that and the housing element and also that they remember that these legally mandated objectives and timeframes over the next eight years'",
        "'speaker_1': 'as we work together to make Long Beach a safer, healthier and happier place for tenants of all income levels. We do have certain reservations about the assessment of fair housing and what this plan does plan to do. And we hope that the city takes more.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. That concludes public comment. That concludes public comment for this item.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, thank you. I appreciate all the comment. We're going to continue the hearing that we have. I'm going to have counsel deliberation first. So if you want to speak, please make sure that you queue in. Let me just get to the queue really quick.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I first up, I have Vice Mayor Richardson. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. First of all, I want to take a moment to just thank staff. We've certainly come a long way as a community. You know, I was around the last time we did this, I believe I was Councilman Neal's chief of staff at the time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And it was a very different experience. We didn't have community coming forward saying thank you for including us, very different experience. And you know, what I saw in terms of the consultative process between HCB and Skaggs last year as president?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It was it was you know, it was a little tense as we were discussing Rena and disagreements. I'm glad to see that you've had a better consultative process here with our original plan. Here's our feedback. Here's we're responding to the plan.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think that's helpful. That's helpful. That's going to help us to get where we need to go. I think more more globally here. You know, I think it's important for people to understand what it is we're doing. You know, cities need to plan for growth.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Growth is going to happen. Demographic growth will happen whether you plan for it or not. The question here is where the growth is going to happen in a haphazard way. We have over crowded conditions, folks living in cars, overcrowded in homes, or, you know, living in motels and on the street, or whether we can plan in a'",
        "'speaker_2': 'healthy and safe and smart way for growth and accommodate the growth within our city. And that's what the goal of this plan is. You know, the good thing about it is we plan for it. We protect ourselves. One of the kids, through something down the stairs threw me off a little bit.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So, you know, we plan for it. I think that's a good thing. We can advance economic development, create jobs. But one thing we definitely need to do and we've done a lot of strategies in terms of inclusionary housing and other things include include including here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But it will be hard to develop the affordable housing without a dedicated source of revenue. We still haven't replaced it. We know we used to have it with redevelopment. We knew we to invest $45 million a year into that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we're doing a lot of other things. You know, we're squeezing as much from the term as you can. But the truth is, we just can't compete with the scale that's needed to keep them affordable. Premier housing, great housing, we'll get there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But as it relates to affordable housing, we have to continue to work to find dedicated source of revenue and some of the middle income housing stuff and all that. That helps. We have a lot more work to do.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I also think it's important to know that, you know, we've got projects today that were held up because of the entitlement processes. We have to make it easier to get projects approved. I've got a project on Artesia on Artesia Boulevard right now.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Smaller project was the first one using up plan zoning. And, you know, they're being required to go well and beyond what I would have expected them to be able to do. We have to just keep in mind that we are in a housing crisis and we have to build housing and we're going to have to be flexible'",
        "'speaker_2': '. We have to be more in our in our in all of our processes of getting approvals, get housing built. And so that's what we certainly need to do. I think the downpayment assistance and homeownership programs are incredibly important.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We're funding a pilot recovery plan. I think that's important. I like that we have a mid-term evaluation on this. I think that's good. And so I'm generally supportive of what I have today, what I hear, what I see today.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I'm happy to make the motion to support staff recommendation. I think it's certainly timely. We need to get this done. And one question. I know that we have we've done a number plates. We have the idea of zoning.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We've done a number of things downtown, uptown, midtown. What's actually left to do? What areas of town actually need to be? What zoning needs to be updated? I'm really curious about that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor Richardson. Patricia Defender For the record. So currently we're working on the central Long Beach area. So you may have heard us talk about the Anaheim Corridor zoning implementation program. That is the Anaheim Corridor, some area north and south through the central area of the city.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We still have to work on the West Long Beach rezoning in West Long Beach, and it's just going through and all of the places where the land use element changed the place type, we have to just go back and ensure that the zoning is consistent with that place type.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So it's generally in there's some areas within continuing the plan, right? The plan north Long Beach, the phase to the west, Long Beach, Central, Long Beach, there's some areas in the east side looking at the the founding contemporary neighborhood place type and developing, you know, low density residential zones that are more commensurate with that place type as'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well. So there's still a lot of areas of the city that we need to evaluate and read them.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Just a thank you. Thank you. I have the second by Councilwoman Allen.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Ank you. I'm mayor and I just want to thank staff for the presentation today. I appreciate all of staff's hard work on this, and this is important for our city's future. And I enjoyed seeing the progress unfold. This updated housing element gives a roadmap for accommodating.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All of the help you need and also guide our future decision making when it comes to housing issues. I really am impressed with what we have today. We are prioritizing housing production for all income levels, including those with special needs and improving housing affordability and preserving existing affordable housing, and also promoting fair.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Housing options.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'For all of our residents. So I really appreciate the community outreach and the incorporation of feedback on this plan. I think that has been a really important role that what we're seeing today and I will be supporting this item.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Pryce.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. So I, too, will be supporting this item. And I want to thank Patricia for an excellent presentation. I have a couple of questions that I wanted to talk with you about. Just couple of because I know these questions have come up in terms of our our radar numbers.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'What do you think is contributing to us being able to increase our housing production in the way that we have? I mean, I know that I'm familiar with some of our specific plan CCF and the downtown plan and others that have allowed for additional housing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But what are other factors that are contributing to our ability to be able to make progress towards that 2029 requirement? Thank you for your question, Councilwoman Pryce. So as you noted, our specific plans have made a huge difference in particular and more recently, the Southeast Area Specific plan, which accommodates 2500 units.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think, to answer your question, streamlining the environmental review process by doing the program level eyes and tearing off of the the program level. I.R. for the land use element. Do you facilitate the housing production by streamlining the process for the environmental review?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's a significant way in which housing units are facilitating the development of housing units. Some some programs going forward are looking a little bit more as site plan review thresholds. You may have noticed some of the programs in the plan that look at both site plan review thresholds and can they be increased in order to allow more'",
        "'speaker_1': 'projects to go through a more administrative review process for things like design? Applying objective design standards is going to be important going forward and taking advantage of some of the state streamlining as the 35 we had one SB 35 project in the city recently that qualified for that process, which is a process that if it meets various'",
        "'speaker_1': 'criteria, it can go through a more streamlined review without hearings, but through a staff level review. So those are some of the ways in which those those housing can be facilitated by the things that we're doing. So is that the streamlined process?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is that because it reduces the turnaround time or the time that a developer has to wait? Is that okay? All right. So basically, it's it's facilitating more housing production within the timeline of between now and 2029, because we're shortening the time that people have to wait for entitlements.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. We're doing everything we can to do that. You know, from the entitlement process itself to the environmental review process and taking advantage of different in sequence streamlining. Okay. Can you talk a little bit about I mean, I just reading this article about only 24% or something like that of Californians can afford to buy a home right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'now in California, which was a shocking number. So can you talk a little bit about down payment assistance programs? And you know what what we're doing, I'm I'm hoping and I'm assuming that we're being as aggressive with those programs as possible and that we're leveraging all state and federal resources.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But maybe you can talk to that a little bit more. Yeah, I believe that. I think our deputy director has and our housing staff have a little bit more information on the homebuyer assistance program. But I believe there's a program there's money available through the Long Beach Recovery Act, too dedicated to providing the homeowner assistance program in'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the calendar years of this calendar year in the next calendar year. Believe that a dollar amount is about $3 million.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And this is Christopher Terrence. Patricia is correct. There is $3 million in the Long Beach Recovery Act that will go to first time homebuyer down payment assistance. And, you know, that will not, um, you know, that will help hundreds of families that want to help thousands of families.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But it will be incredibly significant to those who we are able to help through that program. That's kind of going through the procurement process now. And families should be able to apply come January of next calendar year. We also have a state program, which is how we do programs like Habitat for Humanity, and we're looking at funding'",
        "'speaker_2': 'kind of there are homeowners that may have very low incomes, but they do own homes they bought at a time those homes were more affordable. And we're looking at how can we help them build 80 years on their backyard, which would provide additional rental housing in the city, but also provide an additional income stream to those low'",
        "'speaker_2': 'income homeowners? We received a grant from KD to do that. So where we can gather funds, like I just mentioned, we're able to intervene directly into the housing market. But the most important thing we can do in terms of homeownership is having a robust supply of housing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So that means, you know, producing housing units in general to the degree that we can get rent increases under control, that gives people more money each month to save towards a future home purchase. And then we need to find the right mix of carrots and sticks to make sure that that we're building condos in the city as'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well, because, you know, a single family home and you look at the price of a single family home in this city and throughout California, that's not going to be a first purchase for for most folks. But to the degree that we can build condos that maybe are smaller or they those could be available at a much lower'",
        "'speaker_2': 'price point and at current interest rates at a price point that's probably commensurate with your rent. So that could provide a lot of great options for first time homeownership. And that's all part of the overall housing strategy we have here in the city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then the housing element is one piece of that. But there's there's other pieces that, you know, we want to continue down that road that continue to make improvement.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you so much for that. I appreciate it. I think my head's pretty much up. So all of you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Sara.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mayor. I want to thank staff for just really your hard work in getting the housing element plan to this point. I appreciate the effort and policies taken to include community voices in this, and I hope that you'll continue to do that as we will be able to get report back on how things are progressing on'",
        "'speaker_1': 'a periodic basis. That's what I know, that we're not going to get everything we want in this plan. But what I do hope to have is a periodic follow up to see where we're at a meeting. Our goal on a yearly basis to also, hey, what, what can we learn from what's not working and catch that and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'see what we could do to improve it for the following year. You know, one of the things that I'm wondering is, you know, we we we try to make sure that we create a housing element plan that will develop housing for all different income level.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I'm wondering, how do we collect data and how we're helping to address our homeless numbers? Like how are we are we, you know, at the end of the day, I want to make sure we're also helping people to get home, becoming homeowners, getting into affordable rent.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I also want to make sure that we're decreasing our homelessness number. Is there a way for us to see if by meeting our rent, a number were also able to decrease our homeless numbers as well? Thank you, Councilman Ciro.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You know that there's a whole continuum of care infrastructure in the city that's charged with providing those kinds of services. And we work closely with them and the housing authority to to, you know, implement all of these plans and to track numbers.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we do have to do annual reporting each year on how we're progressing and in developing housing units and how, you know, the site inventory is working. And we can certainly try to look at additional data points that we can include in that process that can help us understand how we're making significant strides in addressing with this'",
        "'speaker_1': 'as a result of the housing that is being developed through that. And of course, there's the the programs around permanent supportive housing and shelters, all the things that the the many different ordinances that the council has adopted recently.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And the plan cumulatively tries to address those issues and those concerns. Yeah, thank you. I really appreciate that because I do know there is a fine line and how where development services track you know that the number of people getting housed as far as making sure there is, you know, units available and that they're being built.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I think that it's really important that if we could make sure there is a connection to our Health and Human Services numbers, I know that we don't track people going into long term housing or even if it is short term.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I think that that I want to make sure we're painting a whole picture about how we're housing people in addition to making sure that we're increasing housing. So thank you. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Next up is Councilman Ringo. Basically very simple. I think that's a wonderful job and doing there in the analysis done. I think that value, as we know, is a very stressful process that we went through four years ago.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And to get to this point, this is a it's a good indication that we've made a lot of progress. Still a lot of work to be done, obviously. Our numbers have not gone down. They've gone up. And we still need to be aware that we still are challenge with our housing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Thank you, Councilwoman Jan De.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mayor, and thank you very much to staff for all the hard work that they've done on this great presentation and throughout the time in bringing that up. I know it's been eight years, eight years. That seems like it's an eternity to some, but as many of you know quite well, time really flies.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This is why it's critical that we act now to address. And yet we saw at the same time that long term solutions. What got us to this situation and where we are now was a combination of the past decisions, of past agendas, of past decisions and standards.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'What we need to build for the future is that desire, and what we deserve is a new and long way of looking at things, especially when we're coming together with community. I think that is the main thing. Making sure that our agenda is equitable and that our visions raise humane living standards for all.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That is exactly what this housing element presents as hope for a better tomorrow, in which housing will no longer be a dream or a necessity, but actually a reality. And I have a lot of hope for that with the housing element.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It is going to take a lot of work and it's going to take an intersectional approach to getting there. But I know that here in Long Beach, we as a community know what work is all about and we're willing to put in the work.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So thank you to every single community member who showed up and participated in the process by voicing your needs and concerns and guiding the development of this housing element. I'm excited for the future of the cities of Thrive and I support this item wholeheartedly.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Constable Austin. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And I share of most of the sentiments of my colleagues already expressed here today. Obviously, this is a this has been a long process, one that I have been part of from the very beginning.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I'm very proud of the document that is actually before us. Obviously, our need is great for to build housing and our goals are our aspirational. We need to build 28,000 new units in the next ten years. That's that's significant.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So this decision, this housing element is a huge step forward. This housing element will help to give us strategic direction and clarity for future housing development in our city. It will certainly. And one thing that I'm really pleased to see with this document is that it has taken an integrated approach to community engagement and outreach.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Because mentioned in this work several different types of community outreach forums where they extrapolated public input related to housing, put it to this and that consideration and I think that is very important, shows that our city staff is smart with their time and resources, but also is listening to our constituents, listening to the people of Long Beach'",
        "'speaker_2': '. And so this document is comprehensive. Looking at the housing plan, I'm literally seeing just about everything that this council has voted on related to housing in terms of our values and direction in this document. So with that, I, too, am happy to support this 100%.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you so much. Thank you. That concludes council comment. I'm going to say a few comments and then we'll go ahead and go to the vote and close the hearing. I just wanted to thank the the staff for really the incredible work I'm putting the document together.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It should be noted that if you look regionally and how housing production is faring in our neighbors, I mean, Long Beach is certainly ahead across the region. Whenever when when you're looking at population and versus the amount of housing units that we're creating.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think we cannot forget that that in Long Beach, we should always strive to ensure that housing is a right for everybody, that it's accessible to all people, regardless of income level. I think the council has worked really hard to change in the last decade of our approach to housing, whether it's been through inclusionary housing policies or'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that's been through protections and new protections for tenants and renters, whether it's also been through the amount of affordable housing that we're building, which I'm really proud as a great to see, particularly go along the downtown corridor along midtown, along Cambodia town.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Are you going to see a lot of great housing projects and development that's happening and much of it affordable? And I think that's really a testament to not just the staff work and the community work and the community work, but a lot of organizing around housing that has happened in the last ten years.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I remember I was just thinking at first, one of the first meetings I had with now Councilwoman in the House was when she was a housing advocate and I was on the city council and she was advocating for housing policies ten years ago.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think believe you're on the board of Housing Long Beach Councilwoman. And I remember that very well. And so many folks have been involved in this work for a really long time. So I do want to thank everyone that's been involved in housing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Your voices and organizing and advocacy and advocacy has really made a difference, I believe, and has made us have better housing policy, more inclusive housing policy. I also want to thank so many partners. I think when you look at a housing element like this and the progress we've made, it's it's easy to not think fully about who's'",
        "'speaker_2': 'been at the table. But we have worked with incredible housing developers and partners, both on the nonprofit side, as well as, of course, private developers that have built significant amounts of housing. Whether that has been the affordable projects, we have some of our new middle income housing projects that are starting to come up and our market rate'",
        "'speaker_2': 'projects. I have been one and not everyone agrees all the time, but I think that we should be supportive of all types of housing all the time. A unit of housing is is good housing. We know that we need all types of housing in this community, particularly focused, of course, on housing that is affordable to folks.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But we are we are I believe also the research is very clear which which I think tells us that any type of housing development actually overall helps folks get into housing at all levels of income because it's just an additional unit that enters the marketplace.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so we got to continue that production, not just in Long Beach, but across across the state and across across the country. I want to add that the this housing element reflects some really significant policy decisions the Council has made, especially, I would say, in the last 4 to 5 years around protection of renters.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think about some of the decisions that were made, not just to build affordable housing, but to preserve housing that has been traditionally affordable. Some things to remember that when when the city steps in to preserve a unit of housing, there is a cost there's a public cost to doing that work.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And and it's an investment that the city decides to make. Well, we hear all the time we want more affordable housing. Think we all do. Someone has to build that housing. Someone has to, in many cases, subsidize that unit for a period of time since the housing unit can actually get built.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so it is a complex system to get affordable. Housing is not easy to get it developed, but thanks to the federal government, the state county support, city support and the work of our commissions and our city. I want to thank our community investment company.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That commission or housing groups that have come together to support this work have really done. It really fantastic job. And so I just want to thank everyone. Lastly, just moving, looking forward. It is great to see all the housing that is currently under construction and I would just encourage us to continue that work.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We should not be afraid or we should not be reactionary to looking at opportunities for up for us to up to zone appropriate areas across our community. We've had that discussion in the past. It's been difficult sometimes, but we have as a as a city up zoned much of the city, whether we're talking about certainly the downtown'",
        "'speaker_2': 'or we have up zoned midtown. We have done a lot of zoning across the northern part of the city and even in East Lombard recently with what we went through with our or Southeast plan there, there was a housing up zone that we did there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I am encouraged that the city has supported a smart and as they call it now, a gentle density and commuter phase where it's been appropriate. And certainly there are communities where where we're built out and we have historic neighborhoods and single family neighborhoods that folks deserve to have their neighborhoods preserved in a way that is'",
        "'speaker_2': 'historic and that is there for their families. And and that makes sense. But we have so much of our city still where we have opportunities, I think, to to develop and to build more housing. And and certainly that's something that we should continue to support.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And it looks like where there is success in this work, thanks to our city team and looking at these numbers, I hope that those numbers continue and I hope that we continue to to create strong density, especially in our downtown and our long along or our Midtown transit corridor.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There's so much more opportunity to build really great housing. So thank you to staff for this. I know it was a long presentation, a lot of council comment, a lot of community comment, but it's a really important topic as it relates to housing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so thank you for all the great work. And there is a motion any second by Vice Mayor Richardson and Councilwoman Allen to approve and close this hearing and move forward. So I will do a roll call vote when the clerk is ready.'",

I want to note that because Long Beach has its own health department and because we have a health jurisdiction, it's also our responsibility to have robust conversations and insert also and insert ourselves when we can in these important and these important conversations in debates around women's health and access to, in this case, abortion and and women's health'",

Those recommendations really revolve around working with Planned Parenthood and other agencies to address what the overturning Roe v Wade could mean for county health agencies and their relationship with, with or with clinics and the coalition of health groups that are out there.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'So let me turn this verse over to Councilwoman Allen.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I just I just want to say thank you, Mayor Garcia, for leading on this and for coordinating this item. What we face is a potentially dangerous Supreme Court ruling against women's health and against women. Against women, period. And I'm scared.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm worried about women all across this country that are scared, too. I think, you know, as you mentioned, as a city that owns its own health agency, in a city that values women, it is our duty to protect anyone made vulnerable.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If the Supreme Court strips away a woman's right to choose. There are so many low income women, men in our community who rely on public services for care, and we must be ready to provide these services. I'm going to share just a little bit of a shocking story.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I would ask anyone who's sensitive to this topic just to turn off your volume for a couple of seconds. In a recent trip to Kentucky, I stayed in a motel room where a woman. Had an underground abortion performed on her because she had nowhere else to go.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'An abortion in a hotel room. This is unbelievable and it's dangerous. And I'm not going to give you any more details because it's too hard to hear or even believe. You know, this is this is 2022. And women are being driven to these dangerous and harmful extremes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And many more women will be, you know, would have would be forced to make these drastic measures like this woman in this motel room. This is unacceptable. We must provide support for women who would otherwise be forced to consider dangerous procedures.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I wish that we could protect women all over the country. I'm so glad to hear the mayor talk about how California is going to reach out to women. But we start right here in our backyard, and I will be completely supporting this item today.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilwoman Sara.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mayor, for your leadership in bringing this item forward. It's unfortunate that we have to prepare for the worse. You know, the attack against women's reproductive rights have happened ever since Roe versus Wade have passed and so many efforts taken to chip away at not just, you know, older women, but young women, miners rights to be'",
        "'speaker_1': 'able to make the decision over their body and their access to health care, especially marginalized young women of color. There's been already enough shaming about women's body, and then there's already a layered challenge for them to be able to access care, much less have these legal right and access affordable access to care provided to them.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I definitely stand with our county and our state being a reproductive freedom state and and becoming a reproductive freedom city to make sure that regardless of your status, regardless of your income level and regardless of your background, we want to make sure that women feel safe in in the decision they make, not just for themselves that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'their partner. So if the reproductive justice issue is a gender justice issue, that the attack is being targeting, targeting women, but also it impacts on men and the families of these women before the fact that if they're taking desperate measure like potentially to lose a daughter, a sister.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so it's really a family. It's a community issue. At the end of the day, because we want to make sure that women regardless have access to care and feel comfortable being able to get them. So for that, I stand in preparing for, unfortunately, the watershed, the right for access to abortion and care is taken away that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'we look at in every way possible to put measures in place and resource in place, to continue to tell young women and all women that we stand with you and we will fight this. And if we can't, we're going to make sure we protect you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilwoman. Councilwoman Price.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor, and thank you to my colleagues for their comments, especially Councilwoman Allen, with sharing that story. That's just a reality that I think we don't talk about very often. And it's obviously happening. And I appreciate you sharing that story.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that's such a horrific, horrific thing to even imagine. Thank you to our mayor for asking, bringing this item and for asking us as females to sign on to this item. I think it's very, very important that we highlight the importance of women's rights to reproductive health care through this item and beyond.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In recent years, we have seen the courts move closer and closer to overturning a landmark decision that protects women's rights, fundamental women's rights. It is this legal decision that has changed and caused a lot of anxiety for people around this nation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And if this decision changes, it will change the rights of millions of women across America, and their fundamental rights will be impacted in a detrimental way. It's important for us as a local government with a health department. We often talk about our health department.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Our health department protects everyone and should protect everyone, especially women in this scenario. And we need to work with our federal partners, our state and local partners, to make sure that we take a stand together and are prepared to work together to protect the rights of women and to protect the women.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Should the laws change in the future, we need to stand together to protect them. This is a fundamental right for all women, and I thank you for bringing this item forward.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman's in the house.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mayor, and thank you to my fellow council women for signing onto this very, very important item. Roe versus Wade recognize the fundamental right to choose an abortion. Since then, it has served as a layer of protection for women's reproductive rights.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'However, it's been challenged time and time and time again by claims that disregard or just devalue a woman's right to autonomy over the decision regarding their own body. I am proud to support this item that stands to reassure our women here in the city of Long Beach that your health and your rights are important.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We are committed to working with the county and other partners to ensure access to contraceptives, abortion services and other services that we need, even in cases of even in the case that this week to be overturned. However, I am hopeful that the Supreme Court will find to uphold the president it established in Roe versus Wade.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But thank you for this item. And I welcome the opportunity for us to become a city for reproductive freedom and a state that really embraces the rights of women to choose.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. I have Vice Mayor Richardson. Thank you, Mr. Mayor, for bringing this forward. Thank you to my council colleagues. Alan Price, borrow for your comments. Hey, you know what we've seen in Washington, D.C., in terms of partizanship and gridlock?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All it's done is force local governments to find ways to expand what we traditionally haven't had to do. And I think this is another example of local government thinking about adding additional protection for folks, because we can't count in many ways on consistency from the federal government on issues that are that are critically important.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I think this is a great strategy. So I applaud the L.A. County Board of Supervisors for really being creative and saying, what can we do in the event that is, you know, this landmark this landmark ruling is overturned?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'What can we do to add an additional layer of protection and safety and comfort to the women here in Long Beach, across L.A. County? And so I think that's incredible. And so I just wanted to chime in at my, you know, my strong, unequivocal support and to thank my colleagues for bringing this forward.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thanks a lot. Thank you. Councilman Ringo. Thank you, Mayor, and to my council colleagues for bringing this forward. I totally agree with all the commentary there. We are in dangerous times, and if we don't do something now to prepare ourselves, we'll be in a very bad spot once the season goes forward.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hopefully won't. But we have to be prepared. And I sit in solidarity with my council colleagues. Thank you. Councilman, Councilmember Austin. Thank you so much. This is just a reminder that issues matter of political ideology, matters of Supreme Court justices.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Those decisions whose make who sits on the bench matters. This is an issue that is a landmark if you thought it was settled many years ago. But it has served as a litmus test for an issue in a very divisive issue for many, many years.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I wasn't going to say anything this evening because this is this is a matter of women's reproductive rights. And I want to yield to those my colleagues who we have a great deal of respect for. The majority of our city council today are women.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so absolutely, I stand with women and I stand with my wife. I stand with the women in our country who are standing up for our reproductive rights. And I certainly support this item. I think we have to be very, very strategic, just like we were with.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The immigration reforms that were coming down and the draconian kind of efforts that were coming from Washington, D.C., from the administration just a few years ago, we designated ourself as a sanctuary city. In this regard, we are going to stand strong and show as the city that we stand up for women's reproductive rights.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I'm happy to support. City councilman, Councilmember Superdome. Thank you, Mayor Garcia. I would also like to thank the councilman who brought this item forward. And I'd just like to state that as the father of a daughter and grandfather of two granddaughters, I stand in support of this item.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Thank you, Councilman. Let me go ahead and we will make sure if there's public comment and if there is, we'll go to that right now. But I just want to add one thing. Mr. Murphy, as we develop the motion that certainly when the report comes back, it will also be great to hear from the health'",
        "'speaker_2': 'department as to how we are, how we're preparing as far as these partnerships and what we're currently doing as the date, as it relates to reproductive health and and what our partnerships look like. We obviously have a Planned Parenthood clinic in the city and in services and other agencies as well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so be great to get that as well. Is there any public comment on this, Madam Kirk?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If any members of the public would like to speak on this item, please use the raise hand feature or press star nine. Our first speakers, Tiffany, Simon, Davey.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Tiffany Simone, Navy fourth District resident, sworn to speak in support of this item. I think. You know, just and, you know, women haven't gone through enough. There's there's always more to overcome. Sisyphean feat, they say. Looking forward to seeing this item again when it returns.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Being able to read that memo that will be issued in support and really hope to see, perhaps, you know, a detailed guide for residents of the city, you know, this year, possibly from the public health department, you know, for those residents already residing here and thus something to make it easier to know.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There are, I believe if you ever use two of the most popular abortion, you know, search sites there are really only showing two clinics, although I know there are other private offices as well as those in the area.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So just looking forward to again seeing, you know, collaboration between the Black Health Equity Collaborative as well and really glad to see, you know, former first council district now current senator. Supporting S.B. 245, which just made it to it through its third reading.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You can go ahead and resign this comment with saying. Also hope the city can draft a similar memo to support the passing of the VRA.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Our next speakers, Sue and Vasquez.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening, everyone. I hope you can hear me. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And the city council members. My name is Selina Vasquez, and I'm the chief external affairs officer for Planned Parenthood, Los Angeles. I'm also a daughter and a mother of a young child and teens.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I want to thank the city of Long Beach for your foresight and for working alongside Los Angeles County, as well as the state building off of what Governor Gavin Newsom, the pro tem and the speaker and the California legislators have recommended to preserve abortion access and the breadth of reproductive health care services to reduce health disparities and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'inequities. This item should not be happening at a more critical time. You do have the health department in your jurisdiction. Planned Parenthood. Los Angeles does have a.

And as a reminder to the community and to the council, I would recommend, if you haven't had a chance to visit the incredible facility that it has that serves these tens of thousands of patients on a regular basis.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think you heard the numbers from from his past, because right now I would recommend that you do. So it's a really incredible facility here in our community. And with that, I want to go and take the vote.'",

And we've talked about tiny homes for some time. Just a couple questions for staff. I thought there was a proposal that will allow springs at some point to explore.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Do we evaluate something that will allow springs for tiny homes? Who's going to self-report on this? Hoosier. So we have our Health and Human Services Director here. I don't recall something specifically for four Willow Springs, but we can look into that discussion on a few locations just and would like an update on where they are.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It was like, well, spring. I know we talked about Inside the warehouse, which was a feasible warehouse at the ABC shelter and some other efforts. Can we just speak to that?'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Can you hear me there? You hear me?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I can hear you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. So we have not looked at sites like springs. We looked at some sites. We are currently looking at the MSI. We'll continue to be looking for other sites that the Willow Springs is not originally inside the camp.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mm hmm. And the MSI, you know, I know there was a talk about the warehouse and site once we acquired the warehouse outside of the ABC. Where did that discussion go?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That discussion has not continued at that stage because we're looking at what the possibility of that overall site will look like. The infiltrating homes. So in the funding courses that we're currently aware of, there's a 15 year commitment to the tiny homes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we would need to be able to carry those forward to either the site we originally land them on or into the future. So we're looking for longer term sites going forward. And the ABC site did not was not a fit for those criteria.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. And I know there was a conversation that everyone at home and some exploration of state dollars. What are the state dollars is the idea roomkey is that we're talking about switching from what i just want to roomkey opportunities.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We are looking to apply for roomkey, but we're also looking to explore for. I mean, we're actually putting in a proposal for tiny homes for the masses. So we are putting forward in this round one, round two for the Multi-Service Center for 10 to 20 or 30, 20, 25 sites at the Mercy.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then through this item, we would also be looking at additional sites for residents.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Now, the last question is really about the development of tiny homes. So I you know, I've heard, you know, for years, you know, folks would have the ideas about tiny homes or container homes. And I know that in development services, we've had some challenges with establishing whatever standards that we need to have to make these things possible'",
        "'speaker_2': '. What are we doing from a planning standpoint to prepare, let's say, a developer set in how to have a small parcel? And I want it developed for tiny homes, you know, as opposed to, you know, a commercial building, whatever it is.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we, you know, updated what our pathways are or regulations around tiny homes or modular, modular homes. So the container. Vice mayor. This is Christopher Coons from Development Services. So there's two. Parallel answers to that question. So we're we're working with the health department and the item in front of you, the health department administered tiny homes that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'specifically target homeless individuals through provisions of state law, were able to waive various provisions of our own rules, as well as state rules because of the crisis of unhoused persons and the shelter crisis in the city. So there's a very straightforward process for that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You're asking a different question, which is not the city, but Joe Philanthropy Street Developer walks in and says, I want to build four tiny homes. So we're still bound by various rules. The tiny homes need to be certified by the California Department of Housing and Community Development as a modular construction forum.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The good news is that a lot of different models of modular housing have been approved over the last couple of years. There's a major manufacturer not in our city, but in the next city over. And and we our staff, our engineering staff and development services have done tours of the factory to help us better understand how the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'modular construction works. We still have to plan check aspects of those projects because they need utilities, they need water and they need electricity, and you want that to be done safely. So we have a process. We haven't seen a lot of interest from the development community in terms of tiny homes, which, you know, if you're thinking of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'what you see on HGTV and you know, this cute thing on wheels, but what we do see a lot of interest in is more modular type construction, whether that's in the form of an 80 unit backyard or a larger construction of an apartment building, if you think of it being put together and just like a Lego set'",
        "'speaker_2': '. So that technology has come a long ways and we do permit those structures, but we're just starting to see them today. So we don't have a lot of examples yet, but when we talk in a year, we'll probably have more to report back.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Oh, sorry.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I just I just want to add from the different perspective, so tiny homes, modular housing as a shelter perspective also includes services. And so it's a place for at different sites is not our strongest proposal in terms of the ability to work with folks, provide the case management and other services to move these people into permanent homes'",
        "'speaker_5': '. So I think there are multiple conversations here to look at.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Look, I think we have to be as creative as we can. I certainly like making sure we pay our services. But if there's a private model out there, you know, because I'm hearing about things around tiny rooms and services, we just have to be open to make sure that, you know, whatever policies we have locally, we're able'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to explore. But, you know, I think this is certainly a step in the right direction. Look forward to the report. Thank you. Councilman Allen.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I thank you, mayor. I also want to thank council member Austin ran this forward. I think it's an interesting and promising item, especially since there is state funding to support expanding shelter beds. So I'm happy to support more housing to get folks off the street and connected with that coordinated services.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman Austin. Mr. Mayor, I want to defer to public comment at this point. Great. Let's go ahead and go to the public comment and we'll come back. Have comment and then to an awesome wrap up.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If any members of the public would like to speak on this item, please press star nine or use the raise hand feature. Our first speakers Lee Charlie.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman. Austin Today I spent 3 hours and got a self-guided tour at the West V.A., the West L.A. VA. They actually have 32 tiny homes that are in operation as of three or 4 hours ago. I learned a whole lot and I hope that maybe we can expand and improve on what I saw this afternoon'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and be a little bit more forward. First of all, accessibility and location is key. They must be near transportation where they can either get a bus line or a train. The whole goal and intent of a tiny home is to get permanent housing and get employment.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I think the report really should look at how close and how feasible the accessibility to the cost. I would encourage the city to look at these two echo cubes ranch which have solar panels pet friendly and have a mini garden.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And fortunately, many tiny shelters and tiny homes do not accept pets. Also, there's a lot of unhoused and Lumbee that I speak to almost daily that are couples married and the tiny homes. Only the ones I saw only have one.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So please think about that as well. Also, we need to have some kind of wraparound service, 24 hour emergency hospital or emergency service if there was a medical emergency. Also, I think that having some tiny homes, I know of three areas that would be very beneficial.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And District one and district two where a large concentration of the unhoused are. And I know tomorrow and Thursday we're having our point of time training and then we're going to be counting and getting an accurate number for our city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Please look at where the highest concentration of unhoused are, and maybe we could put some tiny homes there. And then also, I learned today risk assessment and time frame. Well, and how a person have six months, a year or two years to find permanent housing, permanent employment.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then also the risk assessment really needs to be taken care of. There's LGBTQ youth that I spoke with yesterday. They're students living in cars. They're in a house. There's two pregnant women along the 710 that need help.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'An elderly man has cancer. There's a woman that was raped eight times the last three months. So what is the risk assessment priority of who gets these homes and not? And I would ask that all these reports, maybe questions be looked at.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I'm super excited about Tiny Homes and I personally will take anyone on city council, our staff and my car to go visit the West, L.A. West, L.A. VA. It's only a 25 minute drive if you go in the afternoon.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's quite enlightening. Thank you so much.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Your next speaker is Brandon Washington.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sorry about that, folks. I want to thank you for having me again. Thank you, Mayor. Thank you, Vice Mayor. Thank you, city council members. Again, my name is Brandon Washington. I am a board member with the Long Beach Continuum of Care Board.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I am the board member with lived experience of homelessness. So this issue is of particular note to me. Folks, there are a lot of questions around tiny homes, and I really want to thank Mr. Charlie. You kind of stole my thunder here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I am a licensed clinical social worker. Other than my board role at the West Los Angeles V.A. and the tiny home project that he was referring to is called Stress in S.T.A.R. Se. What we do is we combine these tiny homes with treatment and rehab rehabilitative services.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It is a low barrier to entry outreach program. And what we do is we provide homeless veterans or unhoused veterans with a clean living area, regular access to medical care and, of course, behavioral health services. And like you mentioned, they are close to transportation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The same project could be undertaken here in Long Beach, and we could be using a model similar to what is being used in West L.A., since we have our own Health and Human Services as well as a V.A. hospital here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The project could start as a veteran based project and be expanded from that veteran based project to a all citizen wide project. I mean, make sure that you are aware that these aren't just thrown together projects. When I initially heard things about Tiny Homes, I thought it was just a way to divert funds away from traditional brick'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and mortar buildings. However, these shelters have an added benefit that people haven't really played into, and that is the social component of creating these very small communities. Those small communities actually help these folks along with those supportive services that they're receiving to lower the rate of reverse ism into homelessness.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Now, these tiny shelters are completely equipped with beds, mattresses, their fire lined with safety equipment, air conditioning, heating. And of course, these shelters provide additional privacy and protection from the elements, making the participants more comfortable as they work with their case managers, licensed clinical social workers and MSW.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Just like we have here in Long Beach, and especially with our wonderful, wonderful teaching and training institutions like Cal State that have a massive amount of social workers who could be utilizing the the service, offering their services via practicum, where they would be learning and helping our homeless population here in Long Beach.'",

Think about these items in construction, then you do not you cannot dignified people and lift them up to employment.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm sorry, but literally things like that suggest that the city does not understand what it means to have dignity and to move from low income to high income. So I specifically with item 11 as well as these tiny home projects.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Please assure me that any plaque that you may erect it to applaud yourself for. And I think you should be applauded. Right. But I think those things should be in resource rooms and not be available for public view for every guest that comes by.'",

And as my colleague also mentioned, the place where we went that care closet took us to, they were saying that there was trash there for nine years that had'",
        "'speaker_1': 'been built up for that long. And it just makes me sad to think that it took organizing of people that were in house to actually do that work and just put that into your perspective. Thank you again, council member Austin, for bringing this word.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I really hope that we start seeing some action on this item. Thank you again.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think our next speaker is Russia.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening again. My name is Jose Torres and I'm also part of Project Dignity. Like the speakers before me, as I mentioned, we did go and have a tour this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Sunday.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And it was very insightful. The property that we are is a large lot is adjacent to the 710 Freeway. The address is 1325 through 1395 West Carson. Our partner and project entity care closet Long Beach has been working with the large community about housing individuals near that location.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Giving them a sense of purpose.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's really important for all of us to not just think about our own house neighbors.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'As a burden, but also they are our neighbors.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So let's think as human beings and let's not wait a year or more to bring housing, more tiny home housing in Long Beach or tiny homes that can be found throughout L.A. County. Let's bring tiny home to Long Beach sooner than later.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Homeless residents can't wait. And with those tiny homes, we bring critical resources.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Everything in one location to uplift our neighborhoods. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Our next speaker tonight can be.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. Thank you for hearing me, Counsel. First, I want to thank the eighth District Council in Austin for bringing this item to the agenda tonight. I think that tiny homes are a great opportunity for us to draw people out of the streets and empower.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Friendly with respect to placing them in housing. Situations that are agreeable to the reality of what it looks like in the end to find them in a scarcity model that we're facing here in California. With that said, I'd be curious to see what happens at entities that we can partner with.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There was a reference by staff.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Our next speaker is Jim Howitt.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening. Jim Howitt. I have been working with the homeless for probably about 30 years. And everything everybody has said before are all true. But one thing that I noticed in working, particularly with homeless individuals or unhoused individuals, you probably call them, is their sense of community they have among themselves.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'When I first heard about the tiny home concept, I visited a few of the villages in Seattle, and what I saw there were individuals helping each other, getting sober and getting dealing with all the problems and moving into permanent housing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In other words, they had become a community. And I think that's very important. Sometimes we forget that the unhoused do live in communities among themselves. And to me, that is one of the important things the tiny homes do that allows them to live in a community where they can support each other.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It also provides stability. That you have a place to be where you can get services and everything that you need can be what you can work with it at that point. And another point that a few people have mentioned is dignity.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There is a dignity in having a house and having a place to do what some might call your own. You know, the old saying is that home is where the heart is. It isn't necessarily a building or a house or whatever it is, but it's where you believe you belong.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that's what I think that we give people when we talk about the tiny homes that we give them a place that they can call their own and they can start that process of moving on, doesn't it? We don't know exactly how long it's going to take, but we can work with them and they can make those'",
        "'speaker_2': 'moves they need to do to transition into permanent housing. I really support this and I really think the councilman for bringing this up, if he knows I've been been somewhat of a passion of mine and. I think it is probably the best way would come about to work with individuals who are not how.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. That concludes public comment for this item.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Right. Thank you. Let me just add that I am absolutely a strong supporter of the tiny house concept. I think we've seen it work in other places. And so thank you to Councilman Austin for bringing this in front of the council and thank you to the staff.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I know that I continue to explore new models to help folks that are unhoused and also really great to see so many community members also just coming forward to say that they welcome these types of opportunities for housing even in their neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so that's it's really always encouraging to see so thank you talked to them and very supportive of of this and and Mr.. Mr.. Modica, I know that you had already been looking for some state money for projects like this for different types of, of solutions.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Is that something you're still feeling pretty confident about? Yes. So besides the money that we've set aside in the Recovery Act, we'll certainly be looking at Project HOMEKEY as one of our top priorities, and it absolutely qualifies. And so we're going to be putting together a very strong application for that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Great. Thank you. And then the council in Austin is going to cause a stir. Yes. Again, I want to thank all of my colleagues. We are very encouraging words and for your support of this particular item. Again, I want to just lift up for Mr. Graham how it serves on our on the Service Advisory Committee.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'He's been advising me and talking to me about this particular issue of tiny homes for literally years now. And so I want to thank him for coming forward and speaking for all to all of our public speakers. I know that this is a passion for many in our community who want to see us resolve and get to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'immediate solutions on this issue of homelessness. I think the city council I mean, we're going to get a report back in 60 days, like the minute the instructions or the recommendation if if I might, just to include working with potential public private partnerships, community partners to try to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'To construct and build and locate tiny home communities. That's okay, Senator of Motion. And I'd also like to just as a as a council, we should we should be not closed in it, but be very deliberate. And when this item comes back, I'd like to for us to set some some real goals in terms of what we'd'",
        "'speaker_2': 'like to accomplish, in terms of housing people in tiny homes and and building this into our every one home kind of strategic approach. And so with that, I would love to have your vote support on this. Thank you so much, everyone.'",

We come before you to thank the city for its ongoing support. Your support uplifted our staff. Your support enabled us to not only survive the last two pandemic years, it allowed us to thrive.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so, in addition to thanking you, we want to share some of our new programs and we want to share our financial results. Next slide. Starting with the programs when the pandemic hit. Suddenly, there were no more yellow school busses parked outside the aquarium.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Nonetheless, we found ways to connect with our youth. We developed online education programs that reached over 200,000 students who were stuck at home. We mastered that new short form of communication tik-tok and built a global following of 2.5 million.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, 2.5 million tik-tok followers. Learning about our otters, learning about our sharks, our penguins. And so much more. Next slide. This next new program is my personal favorite. And let's hear from Anthony Brown, as he describes it. Thank you, Peter.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In 2020, we developed the idea of an African-American scholar program. After raising sourcing over $100,000 in early 2021, we awarded scholarships to ten college students with studies in the areas related to the field of aquarium. Each scholar received $10,000 and ongoing engagement with the aquarium.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I'm pleased to announce that our second cohort. Of 11 students. Have been identified. Our scholarship committee has identified these students and we will acknowledge them. As the newest class of scholars at our African American Festival on February 26.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'While the monetary award has certainly been meaningful to these scholars, these students have communicated that the community building, the networking, the support by the aquarium has been invaluable towards their future. Next slide. Picking up from Anthony. In the last few months, we have created an American Indian Fellowship.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It may be one of the. Only once in the nation and a Hispanic fellowship program. These programs bring young people to the aquarium to participate in meaningful mission related work and to learn important professional skills. Finally, another new initiative we are introducing is the opportunity for students to gain transferable college credit courses in marine conservation and science'",
        "'speaker_2': 'from our facility. This is free to high school students and could be a gateway to STEM fields. Next slide. Then there is conservation. During the pandemic. Our specially trained staff have been out along the shoreline, rescuing and recovering our precious wildlife.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You see some of them here in protective gear. Sea turtles, elegant terns and oiled seabirds. We are also developing a sea otter surrogacy program that will foster baby otters to release back into the wild. We are becoming a leader in California conservation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Next slide. And I now I'd like to turn it over to Anthony. Thank you again, Peter. So the aquarium, the Pacific, operates and runs its financials on a calendar fiscal year. And what I have here is an illustration of the last three years.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In 2019 pre-pandemic, the aquarium enjoyed its best year ever with its major expansion, complete and total operating revenue reaching a historical high of 41 million. And of course, in 2020, with the pandemic and the aquarium was only fully open for 91 days.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We were fully closed for more than two months and partially opened with outdoor only access for the majority of the year. We suffered tremendously. You can see a net loss of nearly 13 million and earnings. I'm pleased to report, though, in 2021, with pent up visitor demand and record level spending in retail and annual memberships, we achieved'",
        "'speaker_2': '43 million in total operating revenues. Operating expenses were offset significantly by a 10 million federal grant that the aquarium was able to switch to get awarded. And so favorable revenue and expenses resulted in a net earnings finishing at a historic high of 22 million.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Next slide, please. This allowed the aquarium to focus on recovery and growth. We work together with city leaders in Treasury, Financial Management and the city manager's office to achieve the following results. We reestablished our operating and operating reserve account.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We created with the city a financial model that uses the surplus that I talked about to secure rent obligation of 2.2 million per year that we pay for more than four years. And also, it allocates the same amount, 2.2 million a year for four plus years towards a capital account to improve the city's facility.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'During the pandemic, the city allowed the aquarium to pay off our $10 million loan early. This loan was granted in 2017 by the city to help the aquarium with the timing of construction payments versus the contribution for our capital campaign.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And most notably, our our 2021 financial results were achieved without the need to exercise the option to use the two loans the City Council had previously approved. The $2.2 million in 2020 we thought we might need to fulfill our rent covenant.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then also in early 2021, we had our four or $5 million loan option to pay for rent and to cover operating expenses if we remained close. Never. We never needed to exercise those loans. And so the results that you saw on the earlier slide reflect the hard work and commitment of the staff here and now.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I would like to introduce our newly elected board chair, MPO, who will conclude this presentation. Thank you, Anthony. Next slide, please. In closing, we thank the city for its support of the aquarium during the period of our shutdown.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'These ten meetings were comprised of nine district specific meetings intended to receive communities of interest, feedback from the public to inform them for the mapping hearings. And there was one citywide meeting to make sure we covered all of the bases.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And the six mapping hearings occurred between October and November. So how we got the word out on this project, we had a three phase engagement plan education, motivation and activation. Through these phases, we kept equity in mind by promoting digital in print advertisements that were translated into Spanish, into Gaelic with the educate phase.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It was to introduce the public to the commission, but also provide the basics of redistricting of motivate phase was the period but for the the communities of interest hearings that get information from the public regarding their community and also train about the public mapping tool workshops.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And the activate phase was to encourage public the public to draft maps and that was from October to December. So with all the work that the Commission and staff put in regarding communities of interest testimony, there was 772 communities of interest forum submissions.'",
        "'speaker_3': '16 total hours of public comment heard. Over 1000 pages of emails submitted from the community in 90 C0 II mapping tool submissions and 110 partial and full district plan submissions by the public. Using all of the information that they received as a commission, they were able to create the new district plan map, and that was adopted on'",
        "'speaker_3': 'November 18th, 2021. And the map became effective on December 18th, 2021. So as a final act of the commission, they were they transmitted a report with recommendations for future commissions. The first recommendation was regarding application and recruitment. They wanted the project to be clear about the commitment adding to the and adding to it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And as.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You see.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They wanted to be clear at the beginning about the time commitment and the limitations on political participation during the term of appointment and the assessment of analytical, analytical skills of applicants. In addition, the Ethics Commission is also planning to form a separate report highlighting their recommendations regarding the Ethics Commission involvement in the recruitment and selection process for'",
        "'speaker_3': 'future independent redistricting commissions. The next recommendation was around training that future commissions should receive training assistance from the 2021 commissioners and city staff with direct experience with independent redistricting commissions. Regarding staffing, the commission involvement should be in the budget in spending.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The Commission should also be able to select the demographer and also work directly with independent legal counsel and develop rules around commissioner outreach activities. Regarding public input. They wanted to make sure that meetings were held at schools and community centers.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If mapping begins after the district specific meetings, then another round of district outreach should occur to avoid skewing towards a political outcome. Incumbents, their staff, consultants, candidates or city lobbyists should be discouraged from participating and provide the commission with a list of registered lobbyists.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Regarding the chair and vice chair selection before the selection of the chair and vice chair, a commission should create opportunities to get to know each other and assess leadership skills and also consider the use of an interim chair and vice chair prior to the selection of permanent chairs.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'During the mapping stage. They should that the next commission should start with public drawn and cause in consultant drawn maps to avoid starting with a blank map and transition to a public live line drawing to increase transparency and allow the public and commissioners to understand the intent behind every line change.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So in conclusion, the new map has been delivered to L.A. County, the L.A. County registrar. The map will be used for the 2022 upcoming election. And the Independent Redistricting Commission report has been posted to the redistricting website at Lone Star.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Gov. Slash redistricting. Slash Resources. So just as a reminder, the this is a received following a presentation for the 2021 Independent Redistricting Commission for the City of Long Beach. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That concludes the staff report, just acknowledging that the commission came up with a variety of recommendations. And in the coming weeks and months, staff will be reviewing and assessing those recommendations. We will be holding on to those. And the whole idea behind those is to make sure that the next redistricting process is more efficient and a more'",
        "'speaker_0': 'positive process. And we will be forwarding those recommendations to the next commission. Thank you. We're staff is available for any questions or feedback.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Amy. First, I have a motion to approve the report by Councilmember Gringa. Let me start with customary ringa, and then I have some cues and I'll go through all the cues and then I will speak as well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mayor, for regulating me. Basically, I want to just thank the District Commissioner for all the work that they did. And, of course, to stay positive or to get ready to commission. I think that this report is a very thorough it provides a lot of good ideas for the future commission.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We're only eight years away year. I mean, it is not that far. When the next census comes up and we're going to be doing this again. The the recommendation to have it future commission talk to those who already participated in this one.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think it's an excellent one. It's something that they can provide their knowledge and their expertize and experience and work in this commission. How that can work from this all around. And I think that this recommendation, this report basically is a is a matter for future commission as to how they want to participate and how they want'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to move forward with another redistricting effort. And kudos to the commission as a whole. They maintain their integrity, maintain their professionalism, their competence. They certainly show that in regards to the whole process. And they really maintain their their patience.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean, they were there. I was looking at it and many times it ended at 1230, 1:00 in the morning. And it was very grueling, I'm sure, for not only the commissioners themselves, but for their families. So thank you, Mayor and I wholeheartedly with this report forward as we see the file.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. I think I think there's a second to receive on file and also with some possible comments and questions. Councilman Nelson. Yes. I'd like to just, first of all, commend the commission staff who spent really long hours working on this this exhaustive process.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This was mentally exhausting to watch. And so to be in the midst, in the seat to the decision makers, I know it was not an easy process. So those citizens who were selected for this inaugural independent districting commission should be commended for their their endurance, but also their their efforts to create what and listen to the community'",
        "'speaker_2': '. Because I think there was many hours of public comment and input from the community. I think many lessons were learned in this process. And so I do appreciate the report. I'd love to see these maps once. We can.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We can. They can be displayed on the. The County Registrar's office. Print them out. We kind of understand them. I think there's been some delays and some lags in terms of efficiencies with the process and obviously the challenges of getting the data which could have been made for a better process overall.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so, again, I wanted to lend my. Kudos and salute the commissioners for their their efforts, their work. Not everybody is happy with the outcomes. Well, no, but that I don't know that this council would have been able to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Draw maps that would have made everybody happy with the outcomes. It's always a very political and politically charged process that that is very difficult to to satisfy the the ideas that everybody has about what a community of interest should be overall.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so that I brought I was the guy that brought forth this concept became a ballot initiative, became reality. And no impacts were made as a result of this independent redistricting commission. I think one way or another, like it or not, the imprint and the commission have made a Long Beach change for for, for for the next'",
        "'speaker_2': 'two years. And so, again, I want to thank them for their service. Thank you, Councilwoman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. I appreciate the work of the commission.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I did have a question on one of the earlier slides. It talks about the amount of participation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And one of the things that has been brought.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'To my attention by some constituents was.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That they felt as though to really participate.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You couldn't just submit a map. You actually had to go to all.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The meetings, stay.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Till.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Midnight, and really for your voice to be heard.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You had to continue to raise your voice over and over again. So I guess I would just like to add that. I would love to find a way where are very vocal advocates who spend.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Considerable hours submitting multiple.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Options and comments, etc. could be balanced against those.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That are senior citizens that worked.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hard and went to the library and and submitted one comment or one map. And I think that that's something that's interesting about becoming a council member. And we have our regulars that we listen to and we hear their input and their feedback.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We also take a lot of time to spend on individuals who make a comment or a question or concern about just one agenda item or something that's just.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Important to them. And maybe they're not a regular, but we learn their names and we learn the things that are important to them. I know that that's a process.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That when you become a new council member, you're overwhelmed at first with the high, high touch constituents that call every day. But over time, you work with them to make sure that their issues are addressed, but that they're not more important than the constituent that calls just once.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I would love to know, based on your first slide, I'd love to get a follow.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Up report on how many people was.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That if there were 70.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Maps submitted or 700 maps submitted? Did five people submit.'",
        "'speaker_4': '500 of them? I mean, there were people who submitted dozens and dozens of maps, and I'd be interested in knowing what the total person interaction was. And I also think that it would be interesting to see what that interaction was by district in the new maps, because I think that if you did it by district of the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'new or old maps, you would find.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That individuals who were really.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Invested in the way things.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Were and didn't participate as much, and then they found.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Out, oh my gosh, things are changing. And if you're things are.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Changing mid process and maybe you galvanized in the middle of the process.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Like happened in the third district, but if it changed on you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'At the very last minute.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I like the fifth district.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'A lot of people called me and said, Stacy, why didn't you tell us?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I said, You know, throughout the process, I provided feedback and update the maps regularly, but it's really up to the commission. And in supporting the initial agenda item I propose by Councilmember Austin.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I felt as though council members shouldn't be.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'In attendance.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And supporting and doing those things.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'In the in the volume and in reading the the pink that came from Charlie Park. And then I know that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We all followed the rules.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that those rules were supported by our city attorney. But it was just a very, very different process for different parts of the city. And so I'd like us to work on that next time. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilmember Supernormal. Thank you. I just have a question for you. I think I heard Bradley Brown say that there was a lot of attention paid to outreach. And I believe, Bradley, if you can correct me if I'm wrong, but you said it, my words, a very robust effort that included both digital and print media.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Is that correct? Yes. Okay. So and this is what is a major disconnect from me. Was there any discussion at the commission or by staff explaining to the commission that. If you take a district by district for. And you're only going to retain 20,000 of the residents.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Are you going to have that district gain, 30,800 residents? Maybe we should have an equally robust system for alerting those residents of the change. And when you say print and digital. Yeah. Like a postcard program or something like that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I began asking for this on November 18th. I saw this coming and I didn't wait for it to be finalized on December 18th. So I don't think I'm ever going to get quite that I've asked for. Can you give me the names of the people I can do?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The outreach I've received that I did finally get the number, I think that was shared with everyone because I suspect that it was this staggering a number. So I know that's a very long question, but my question but I guess I'll make a very simple.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Was the commission ever engaged in this problem that was created? Or was there any comment from staff to them that while you're doing this or did anyone suggest, hey, we better do something moving forward so this all works?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Uh, Councilman. Super. Now, I, I think that the, the, the commission was really guided by looking more specifically at the communities of, of interest in redrawing the lines. I'm not sure that there was a lot of focus, our attention paid to the the the differences and the ultimate impacts of those lines in terms of the the numbers'",
        "'speaker_0': 'of of of residents that were leaving a district or coming into a new district. So that is a feedback that we can certainly capture and make a note of so that it can be considered in future redistricting efforts.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I will say that as a result of the new maps, staff has done a very extensive outreach to to publicize the new maps. And that is, in addition to the postcard mailings, there has been extensive social media.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There has been neighborhood contacts for all of the Cities Neighborhood Association. So we are making it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I have to interrupt for 1/2, Linda. I'm not aware of any postcard mailings.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That is in process. And those I think we communicated with your staff earlier today that we just got the date that that will go out next week. But that is in.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Process so that they may go out next week. And that would be two months after this is finalized, three months after we knew the data. So that's my issue, is that this simply was not addressed. The report tonight, if I had this the final year that I'll have them, we're going to go guess what?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Our issues are just starting. And I know for my district, we have another district that had gained 211 new residents. I gained 30,800. So I'm just asking that moving forward, that included in the plan, if we're going to put that much effort into outreach, let's get something together for after the fact and how we communicate to the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'residents of these massive changes. Because every day in our office is not just the 30,000 is the one we've retained because it was so huge in the fourth District. We get calls from people. Hey, am I still in your district?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm not quite sure. And the idea of sending out a postcard that where you would have a QR code and that person has to look up the map, it's a generic postcard that goes to everyone. If you want to know what district you're in.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Scan this QR code. That's the antithesis of a print medium, telling someone what district they're in. So that's all I have to say. And I hope that's considered next go round. Thank you. Thank you. Councilman. Councilman in Dallas, please.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mayor. I just want to thank the commission for all the hard work that they did on the commission. I know that this was the first time that we as a city had an independent redistricting commission and that there were many lessons learned.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I hope that some of the comments that we share here today that those those lessons were actually learned. I do have to agree with my colleagues on there being more outreach. I know that it was it was a difficult time absolutely a difficult time to do the redistricting commission because of all the things that that were'",
        "'speaker_1': 'in place. Right. With with COVID. But one of the things that I think was very positive is that the community came out to see those that could. And I want to echo Councilmember Mungo's comment that we really, really have to do better when reaching out to those that may not be able to come and not be able'",
        "'speaker_1': 'to physically be in the spaces, including our seniors and people with disabilities, that that feel that they missed out on an opportunity to voice their to voice their voices, as we all witnessed. It was this had a significant impact on our communities and our city overall.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'For that reason, it's crucial that we learn as much as we can from this experience to ensure that next time around the city has all that. When I say city, I mean the residents have all the tools that they need that are necessary for this process to be to be able to have an efficient redistricting process.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I also noted in the presentation today by Bradley that it said that the new commission would be trained by the old commissioners. One of the things that I would say and I would recommend is that that not happen only because it is supposed to be an independent redistricting commission and the commissions, the old commissioners, which did a'",
        "'speaker_1': 'wonderful job to the best of their ability, they might still have something pending where they might not come in with or they might come in already influenced and wanting a certain thing. So I think it's good to actually take all the recommendations from the commission right now that is fresh in their mind and and then pass those'",
        "'speaker_1': 'on to the next commissioners instead of having the commission itself come back and train them just so that it could be fair to them, to the new commissioners, and so that they that they are able to start from a fresh slate.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If you may. Also, one of the things that I think is important is to be able to do outreach to the community. Earlier, I know that there had been a lot of outreach. I know that you know a lot of my constituents, because we live in the first district, we found out about the meetings that were happening'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and a lot of my residents missed it and were upset that they didn't have a chance to participate. But I know that it was a lot of factors that caused them. Also, one of the biggest things that that also hurt is that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That let me rephrase that that we can improve on is actually doing outreach, maybe, you know, door knocking, you know, house to house, making sure making a real effort to reach out, especially to those hardest to reach communities that don't have the ability to get online, that don't have the ability to do a math online.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Maybe they don't have that capability because they don't know how to do it, or maybe it's because there's language barriers that prevent them from doing it. I think that that's important only because sometimes the redistricting process affects them, sometimes the most.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So again, I just want to thank all the commissioners for all the hours that they put into this, all the late nights that they put into this. And I hope that we take all the good things that we that we gain from this process and really work through and to get through those that weren't as efficient going'",
        "'speaker_1': 'forward. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Last May, Richardson. Thank you. First, I want to just take a moment and just congratulate everyone on completing this process. We know that the goal was to ensure that resources to reach every part of our city, and that is fair representation and resources.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We also know that we had a late census, and that puts some pressure on our ability to conduct our redistricting process. And that was outside of everyone's control. But I do want to congratulate, I think, all involved for making sure that we are able to finish that process.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Kolb It was also a barrier to outreach through the census and through redistricting. Folks forget that. But this commission stepped up, stepped up because of up, and they conducted the process that made it happen. I also want to just take a moment and acknowledge the commissioners.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I watched most of those meetings from home. And I'll tell you, those commissioners were thoughtful. I saw the process of how they built consensus. I saw how they resolved their disagreements amicably. You know, we learned about the whole city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We watched as they attempted to learn and understand that unique issues and communities all across our city. And they did they, I think, demonstrated grace and and real composure through that process. I also want to just thank the residents.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I learned a lot just listening to the residents about their communities of interest. I'll tell you, you know, I've seen more than one redistricting process in the city. It always is always lively in one way or the other.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I also saw a lot of communities that we haven't heard in the past step up and talk about their communities. North Long Beach in particular, has come a long way. You know, the folks were unified and spoke with one voice about their interest, a little positive framing about our community.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It wasn't all, hey, this is terrible. That's terrible. We heard some, you know, some real pride in the community and in the neighborhoods. And that made me really proud just to see how the neighborhoods stepped up and came together and spoke with one voice.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know, I also thought that the community meetings were really well done. The nine meetings that were out to or however many work that went out to the different communities. I thought that was really well done. I attended two of those personally, the ones in the community, and sat back and listened.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And this was the first time we had had community meetings in a while because because of Coby, it was really inspirational about the conversation in the community. Meetings were really locally focused on those communities and I think that's important.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think as we move forward, you know, the next year, I would hope ten years from now, I would love to just see more of that neighborhood outreach. I think what we saw at City Hall, I think, was a very different tone.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It really took a larger level, higher heightened level of organization to really break through. And I didn't see that in the neighborhood meetings and the neighborhood meetings. I really saw the commissioners taking time and listening to each individual community.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think I think that that helped make the process better. So, you know, again, you did your job. You know, I think our city it was difficult, obviously, but our city reflects its community and our changes were made and the citizens stepped up.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The residents stepped up and did the process. And I think our community's going to be stronger as a result of it, because I tell you, you know, local government, you know, we're great at building things, but it really takes residents to point out what we can do better and dismantle and tell us when we need to reform'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and do things better. And that's really ultimately what I see happen through this process. Again, congratulations to all involved and thank you. Thank you. I'm going to just make a couple a couple of comments to close your any other comment.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I want to make a couple of comments.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I cued up, but I'm not sure if I.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Think you did you didn't hear about it for some reason. I, I, I passed you and Vice Mayor Richardson, which you both cued up. So. Councilman Zoro.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes, I have a queued up case. I don't know if Councilmember Price should go next. Ah.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. I, I'm having a little bit of a Q issues with my, my phone here. So I actually have in this order. You're right. I have Councilman Price and then Councilman Zero.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Great. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I won't take too much time. I appreciate the report. I think it's a it's a really good report. And I did find this to be a fascinating process. It was great to hear about all the different communities and just, you know, what happens when a line moves, you know, just a few blocks'",
        "'speaker_1': 'in one direction or the other. And what kind of impact that has in terms of city assets and recreational facilities and things of that nature and and the familiarity or lack thereof with some of those neighborhoods and impact that was was a fascinating for me for me to watch and observe.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I want to just take a moment to thank, obviously, everyone who was involved in the process for for going through the process and being methodical about it. I think it was very obvious that they were listening. And of course, not everyone is was in agreement that they were listening to what they were able to to listen to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'all everybody. And some of those meetings were very long. But I do want to think just for a moment, I want to just one person that really I thought helped a lot. This was the first time there was a lot of question.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'People who know me know that I ask a lot of questions. And I also like to understand the framework that we're operating in from a legal standpoint. And Taylor Anderson was just a phenomenal asset from the city attorney's office because there were a lot of questions about what does the charter say, what does the charter allow, what'",
        "'speaker_1': 'is allowed by public comment, what's allowed to be considered by the commission? And I just thought that she did a great job as long as well as Amy Webber. On trying to help maneuver all the questions since this was the first time and there were a lot of things that the commissioners had questions about, lot of things'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that the public had questions about, and of course, a lot of things that even officials in the city had questions about since this was our first time. So I want to thank Taylor Anderson for answering questions that me and my staff had every step of the way.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I know that I tried to check with her at every step of the way to make sure that we understood the process and what the charter limitations were. And we had the first meeting in our Council district, and I have to say, I don't think anybody knew what the process was going to be at the time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We were very passive listeners at that meeting and did not understand since it happened, you know, nine months or so before the final, I think it was about nine months or so before the final decisions and so learned a lot in that process.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But at that very first meeting, I kind of wish we had gone first because we really had no idea what what the process was about. When we met, when we had the meeting in our district and had had the opportunity to ask questions, we just didn't know what we didn't know.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And as the process went further, it became clear what this was all about. For those of us who were not part of the city the last time this process happened, it was an eye opening experience because we were new to all of that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Me and a lot of community members. So I want to thank the the commission for the report and specifically again, just Taylor Anderson from the City Attorney's Office for answering the legal clarifying questions that came up throughout the process.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor.'",

And I think that what would have been helpful for us is to figure out what was going on so that we can help inform our constituents, you know, early on that, you know, in the best way possible that this was happening and this is what'",

Because I think that it kind of went from zero one, two miles and then it went into like 50 really quick because of the timeline and waiting for the census and all of that. So I just want to add to that what was said around, you know, I did have concerns about the process and'",

And I know we had some issues with language interpretation that was kind of made maybe a little challenging in the beginning, that I hope that we can take a lot of these lessons learned to smooth it out to ensure that there is inclusive'",
        "'speaker_1': 'engagement because it's already hard enough. I think that we wanted people to be there to share that their concern, but also making sure they're accessible in other languages. So I just want to add to that that, you know, I agree that it made it difficult for the community outreach engagement.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There is a large digital staff, but I'm not quite sure if we did other avenues of outreach. I know that were attempts to be made an event that was impacted by COVID. But Charlie, just to speak, thank you to our staff for figuring out the process with our commissioner.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Redistricting is a very difficult process. There are a lot of interests, of course, across across any large city in a community. I mean, I think the commission took their jobs seriously. I stand by the support that many of us worked on to get this commission actually across the finish line, not just at the county level, which Councilman'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Austin mentioned, but also in the campaign and in the community meetings that led up to a process that was put in front of voters, which we know voters passed by pretty substantial margins to put the commission on the ballot.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The that the commissioners I found did not know. I think most of them I found them to be folks that cared about their city. I found them to be folks that cared about doing a process with integrity and doing and doing the best job that they could.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I and I was really impressed with the staff providing the support to the commission as well. Redistricting processes are very hard and they were they weren't just difficult and hard here at the city level, but they certainly were at the state and federal level as well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'When you have independent commissions and at the county where you have independent commissions, now I'm doing this work in the country, the state. We are moving towards independent commissions are doing redistricting across the across the country. And that's something that I have long supported.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I believe that commissions of people that try to divorce them selves from the the day to day politics of of of bodies are best equipped to make these decisions. And I know that we all don't always end up with with lines as we all would like.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And certainly there's you know, there's things in the map that I think I should have been different. But I think that's kind of the point, right? That things that they are an independent groups that are going to creep into the lines the way they see is best for the community.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I just want to thank the commission, the staff and the community for engaging. I also am grateful for all the recommendations that are being put forward to make improvements. The truth is, is ten years ago, when the state first had their first independent commission, it was very messy and they learned a lot in those few years'",
        "'speaker_2': 'following. And the last commission where we had the second state commission. Ten years later was a vastly improved process from the first one that was held ten years ago. And so I think that for language having in its history the first redistricting commission process, there is a lot to be learned and there's a lot to be learned'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and not just on recommendations that the Commission has provided, but I think the community has provided that you're hearing from the council. There's a lot more focus that should be baked in in the future as it relates to outreach and reaching and reaching communities.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I think all of that is is true. And there's a lot to learn, but also a lot to to be grateful for. I want to thank Mr. Monica, you and the entire redistricting team for really, really difficult work.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And and I just want to echo what the council said is I do want to thank the individual commissioners for your service. You were selected through a process that was independent of any of us selecting selecting the commission and again, to the clerk and to the Ethics Commission, who both played vital roles in that process of selection'",

        "'speaker_2': 'As for an interest in what the city's map overall would look like with regards to this little nonprofit that I wrote. In both regards, I think if you look at pages 5 to 6 of this report, you can see immediately a number of things.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Point one, it's not clear based on the areas of change in the redistricting map. Especially with data and housing construction that was planned prior to 1921. Number two, maybe, maybe not. In fact, you could make an argument that what districts won through six on the map, the final adopted map slept for or for people who voted eight'",
        "'speaker_2': 'for Prop 13 and B supported can limit restrictions at the time. Number three, geographic continuity. You bypass an existing population in the form of seven Memorial Heights to shoehorn it into the six for the first time in its history where your demands are being reinvested.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Number four, check the tape. There's a lot of questions, especially with data that was available after 930, 21. Number five, there are blatant disregard for and cherry picked cop testimony. Number six didn't do that a lot. I actually broke that a lot.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Number seven didn't do that a lot. Number eight, no clear reason for the fifth District to cross over Signal Hill unless it's working for the interest or the space economy's interests or even interest. A lot of questions about that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'What else? Number nine. Uh, yeah. The district really isn't compact in order to six by definition. But more generally, just, you know, there's other problems too with the maps. Haven't yet had the time to even compile a. Compile it all.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But the idea, right, is that we can learn to do it better. We're most likely going to do that in five years. I think this market locally has a lot in common with Alabama's situation in that we had both voting rights and purple.'",

I briefly wanted to publicly thank the city staff for their unwavering and dedicated work to the city and commission itself throughout the process.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'JT, Brad Taylor, Amy and many others, thank you very much. Additionally, it must be noted that Mr. Paul Mitchell from Redistricting Partners was truly an integral asset to this team, and we want to thank him for his patience, his expertize and service, as well as Vice Mayor Rex Richardson mentioned in his comments earlier, the I.R.S. body was'",

        "'speaker_2': 'So we got to finish the design. We have to make our formal request for construction funding and and then we've got to gear up and go through the normal bidding process in order to kick out that construction. But it could be as close to 12 to 15 months as our current estimate.'",

You can still go forward with your change.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It does not conflict with the county moratorium. It'll just be suspended. So because of that, we had originally set this up as an emergency ordinance. I really don't think that it needs to be an urgency ordinance anymore given the recent county extension of its moratorium.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I would if the Council is interested in moving forward with this adoption, I would suggest that maybe the the motion could be to adopt the staff recommendation, but subject to the following, which would be the removal of the emergency declaration.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then related, we need to adjust the effective date of the prohibition on evictions. We need to make sure that those will be effective as of April 1st, because that will be the effective date if you remove the urgency declaration.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Just a couple of minor ministerial changes to the ordinance amending 8.102. Hopefully that was clear enough. That's that's all I have to say. I stand by for any questions. Councilman Allen.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mayor. I just I'm glad to see this ordinance today. I know it's been a long road and I'm pleased to see how far that we have come. And I know that many folks have for their concerns.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But what we have here today are concrete actions that will make a difference for renters at a lower cost to both the city and landlords. I also want to recognize my co-sponsors on the original item Councilwoman Susie Farrow and our Cosigners Vice Governor Richardson and Councilwoman Van de Hoff for their partnership and support on this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sorry about the background noise. I also want to thank all the Senate and property groups and residents who reached out to my office and participated in the process to voice their questions and concerns. The work that we've done is going to actually improve our housing climate in the city, I understand, but still continue to have concerns.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I recognize these perspectives. But increasing relocation benefits, collecting data and establishing a civil fine for both bad landlords are actions that make a difference for renters today and in the city. So I would like to make a motion to adopt that recommendation subject to the following.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'First, due to the renewed L.A. County eviction moratorium. I like to remove the urgency declaration from both ordinances. And second, as a result, I would like to adjust the effective dates referenced in the ordinance amending Chapter 8.1 or two to reflect the actual effective date resulting from the removal of the urgency declaration.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So just a summary. I'd like to move this item forward, but remove the urgency declaration due to the current L.A. County moratorium and take the steps necessary to make that happen.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman Ciro.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I want to also think I want to thank Councilwoman Allen for her leadership on this item. I know that I agree with her that there's been concern raised.

I will just cause confusion since it will be suspended until next year because of the L.A. County eviction moratorium.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If you insist on taking action on this item tonight, I urge you to revisit the staff recommendation to change the construction threshold for a substantial remodel from 30 to 60 days. This item, which came out of meetings with tenants and landlords, was the only item in staff recommendations that actually prevents evictions.'",

Look, as you heard from the city attorney and from the Legal Aid Foundation letter submitted yesterday, the countywide eviction moratorium bans substantial remodel evictions in Long Beach through the end of the year.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Therefore, passing this ordinance tonight will lead to mass public confusion for both tenants and landlords and unfortunately will lead to more evictions. As explained in Lafleur's letter. The county policy is not an actual moratorium on filing eviction cases.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thus, a landlord can still serve an illegal notice, file an illegal eviction, and it would be up to the tenant to know their rights and assert them in court. Most tenants don't know their rights, don't want to go to court, and are understandably terrified when they get an eviction notice.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So most tenants simply move out without knowing they are protected. This is a self eviction because of the awkward timing of this ordinance. It is fundamentally the city's responsibility to prevent mass public confusion and publicize via news media, social media websites and mailers that the countywide eviction moratorium is currently the law of the land and protects Long'",

And I especially want to recognize tonight the tenant leadership and consistent participation over months to try to move this the tenant protection policy forward.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I agree that we need the Council to make a clear statement about the county protections covering all of us who are resident here and the council people, not only the city staff, but the council people need to use your newsletter.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You need to use the area of City Hall where we pay our utility bills. We need to have leadership from the city. If you are going to pass this because as has been said, the evictions have already started, illegal or not.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There are bad actors, as we all know. There are just regular landlords out there. And they are. Escalating their use of evictions. Leverage telephone is ringing off the hook when we are making outreach calls to thousands of tenants here in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We are increasingly hearing about what are illegal evictions. So if you pass this tonight, we are going to look to you and to the city staff for an aggressive public education campaign to make sure the tenants do not get preyed upon by landlords who will attempt to use this public confusion to.'",

LeFlore agrees with city attorney Rich Anthony's assessment that the county moratorium prevents substantial remodel evictions while the county resolution is in place, which is at least until December'",
        "'speaker_1': '31st, 2022. It's important that the city communicate that landlords cannot move forward with these types of evictions until the county resolution known as the moratorium, is over. As I mentioned in my letter to the city yesterday, there's a real risk of tenants self evicting after receiving a notice from their landlord or landlord filing an unlawful detainer action'",
        "'speaker_1': 'as the county resolution is not an actual moratorium on evictions, but a defense a tenant has to assert against an unlawful detainer in court. There needs to be a strong effort from the city to communicate that these notices are invalid until the county resolution ends.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Finally, I have to reiterate that this current substantial remodel item does not go far enough to protect long standing tenants, making a small adjustment of requiring 60 days worth of work other than 30 days for a substantial remodel.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Eviction. Show that the city supports long established tenants. The current substantial remodel ordinance. Just make substantial remodel evictions slightly more expensive. It doesn't protect the long established tenants. Tenants will be displaced for higher paying tenants, and the cost to substantially remodel and evict the previous tenants will be recuperated quickly by the property owner.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I don't know that there's any change that can be made to the language of the ordinance that will help assist with that.
