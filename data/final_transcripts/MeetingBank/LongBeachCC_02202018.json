Whenever we think about our clean air, when I think about our port, I think about what an amazing spectacle it is to drive over the bridge and to see how amazing the goods movement industry is.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I've had the pleasure of also getting to go down there and take a tour and see how everything works. And it is one of the things that I love about Long Beach. I'm originally from Houston, where we also have a large port.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so I want to applaud those businesses, which I think the industry says is or are. Some experts would say that about 10 to 15% of our industry already is doing the right thing. They're already working to make sure that there's an employee status, that people are going home with a paycheck, that they can depend on that'",
        "'speaker_5': 'they're not going through. I encourage all of you to read the USA Today article that outlines some of the fear tactics that have happened, and that's from a third party that's not from a union organizer or from a trucking company, but real stories about what have happened daily in our ports.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so when we think about those stories in our ports, in the spectacle, that is it is an amazing asset for us to have in the city. I'm thankful for the port bringing forward grants to help clean up our air for moving as fast as they can on green technology.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And it's time that we no longer put that green technology on the backs of workers. It's time that we make sure that we're investing in a system that respects you, treat you with dignity, and ensures that our infrastructure is going to be one we can all be very proud of.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so when I think about the last step, I think about all the strikes that have happened at our port and the fact that sometimes it's unsustainable and sometimes it feels like crisis. And sometimes we have ships that are sitting out there waiting for workers that can bring their labor forward in a dignified way.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so outside of the worker issue and what's happening in your home, I think it's really important that we as a city recognize some of the impacts that labor disputes have had. On our local economy. And I hope as we move forward to look at the different areas and I know that we have a lot of people'",
        "'speaker_5': 'playing are going to be hearing from stakeholders through this process. But I hope that we are able to get some data on what's happening today. How has the industry changed since we've started having this conversation and what are policies that not only at the state level and not only at the federal level, but what are we doing'",
        "'speaker_5': 'in Long Beach to say we're protecting our assets and our financial bottom line and that all workers in this city are treated with dignity and respect. So I look forward to the process. I hope that we can work closely and on a tight timeline to make sure that this isn't lingering.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I guess I have a one question for the mayor. Did you see this item after having all the stakeholder meetings coming back to this body with all of our reports?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I do. I mean, I think there's a lot of a lot of pieces to the item. And so I think I think most importantly, I think we need to immediately support the kind of federal and state efforts with our partners.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think most importantly, I think to have both the Harbor Commission, which is where obviously where they have direct authority over over the port and for our title, the Harbor Commission, to meet and then work with our city attorney on some on on ideas and language, but also the opportunity for the for our attorney to work'",
        "'speaker_1': 'directly with the labor commissioner, who has a lot of data that that that department also wants to share with the council.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Great. Thank you so much. And congratulations on this next step in the long journey, guys.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And I wanted to add my voice in support of this motion. And we know that sort of cargo doesn't move. Goods don't move without drivers and profits aren't made without drivers. But it's not fair to put profits on make your profits on the backs of drivers.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This is, you know, across the country, in our state, this is the direction things are heading and now's the right time. So as chair of Federal Legislation Committee, we're going to take this up along with other items, because reality is there may be party change in November.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And if it is, we need to be ready to move an agenda for Long Beach. If there is party change or leadership change in November and a Congress is more favorable to work with Long Beach on some legislation.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I think the timing is timing is is good. I concur with most of the things that my colleague said here, but I think this sends a strong message on behalf of Long Beach that this is where we stand, this is where we are.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And we hope that that Los Angeles and other cities really take note. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Next up is Councilman Orson.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you very much. And I certainly extend the support of this item as well. This this issue of our truckers and their classification as independent contractors versus employees has been a an issue, a contentious issue for many years here in the city.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think this is a great step forward. And I want to thank you, Mr. Mayor, for your leadership. I want to thank my colleagues for their support of this item as well. We have to sit, as our vice mayor, sent a strong message not only to Sacramento but also to Washington, D.C., that the goods movement industry here'",
        "'speaker_8': 'in Long Beach, in this region and nationally is very important to our overall economy. So much comes through our ports but also impacts our freeways. But at the end of the day, this is these are families. These are workers in their families that are that are that are impacted by injustices that are that are currently taking place'",
        "'speaker_8': 'within some some of the companies at the port also want to recognize those that are that are good actors and that are treating their employees well. I think, you know, we need to look at those as a as a model, but we certainly need to send a strong, unified voice that that employees, particularly in this critical industry'",
        "'speaker_8': 'and in our city, should be treated as employees, should be afforded the rights of employees in the protections of employees. And so I'm happy to support this item this evening and encourage my colleagues to do so.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilmember Councilman Ringo. Thank you, Mayor. I think that your report was quite succinct and to the point. I've walked with some of these truckers in. In response to the bad treatment that they get there. They're like indentured servants.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The way they're treated, they're asked to pay for things that the company should be paying. They're asked to work hours that are impossible and difficult to meet and that get them tired. At the end of day, their check is about a paltry sum that can barely sustain their families.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I strongly support this this item, and I'm glad that you brought it forward, Mayor. Thank you. Councilman Price.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. So this is an issue that has been all over the news. In fact, NPR just did a story on it not too long ago. Might. And I support it. I think that's definitely something we need to stay on top of as a city and look at how the legislation is changing and make sure'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that our own efforts are consistent with that legislation. I'm wondering, as a friendly to this item, would it be possible for us to get quarterly briefings maybe at council or at the Titans Commission Committee? I'm open to either from the city attorney's office in terms of any legal updates on this topic, because California is not the only'",
        "'speaker_3': 'state that's dealing with this. This is really a national conversation. So I'm wondering if we could get, you know, a quarterly briefing or as updates become available, if we can get updates from the city attorney in terms of where the law is headed and what the courts have deemed acceptable practice.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We'll add that to the motion. Mr. City Attorney, we're okay with that. Okay. Thank you, Councilwoman. With that, we're going to go into public comment. So please, if you have a comment, please come forward. Good afternoon, Mayor. City Council.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'these people are being mistreated, but you continue to go home every night and still live your life like everything is okay. Yeah. Put out money to sit there and say, Oh yeah, we have civil lawsuits or we have claims of $5 million here or whatever.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But then half the time we get swept under the rug, just like with homeless people. They mistreated they disrespected the courts in a real way that you are talking about. Your building is being filled by the riverbed where you pushed a lot of homeless people, too.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So now the homeless people don't have anywhere to go where they're not being threatened or harassed by the city. These are people that used to be you guys, residents used to work at your offices and everything else, and you still turn a blind eye to it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I've been out here for a year, stressed out dog, had a miscarriage, got pregnant again, is still having got back into my housing. So for you guys to say that you are going to make so much of a big change in airports and everything else and it's just going to be so dramatic.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'So it's bad. But the reason why I so bad, most of the truck drivers in the companies I worked in, it was like three brothers, oh, one white guy and the rest. There are Latinos. But the Latino Americans were outnumbered because it was like 80% couldn't speak English.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'No, I'm not mad at them because if I lived in a nation that wasn't putting out more money, I'd be trying to come here, too. But we have to put Americans first. We got to do that. And it's real.'",

Not all of them, but plenty of them who right now are breaking laws and exploiting those who bring them their profits with an F, their inhumane business practices show the ugly side of human nature.

        "'speaker_1': 'on on that piece of the of the legislation as well. And so thank you. Next, people, please. Good evening, mayor and Council. My name is Holly Stewart. I grew up here in downtown Long Beach. And I think the thing that really strikes me about this whole issue is we call it our port and Los Angeles port, but'",
        "'speaker_1': 'our port of Long Beach, which means we are in many ways all of us responsible for what happens there. We can't blame trucking companies that don't follow the law. We can blame somebody else for this. We have to take the action.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And our port commission and our council have got to say we're not going to run that kind of place in the name of Long Beach. We're going to run a place that is fair to workers, where workers lives are important, where their families can grow up and their children can have education because they can afford to live'",
        "'speaker_1': 'someplace where there is education and where they have the food in their stomach in the morning. So they go there to learn and we can do that. And you can help do it by making sure that this port that is our report, is run in a way so that every worker there can walk with pride, with with'",
        "'speaker_1': 'pride and with their family, knowing that they've now got insurance, that they've got health, they've got care, and they've got wages that pay you a decent amount. Way back when I was 20 years old and I'm now 78, I drove trucks for a while in two different states.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In one state it was there were no unions. There was what was called a right to work state. And I got I think it was $0.65 an hour. Then I was over in another state where there was Union Teamsters and drove there.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And all of a sudden I was getting about three or $4 an hour all the time. Now, $0.65, three or $4 doesn't sound like much now, but in 19 oh 60 or 1958, that was a pretty good amount of wage.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So that's what we need to do here, is give people the opportunity. The people built this country. The companies don't build this country. The workers who do the work, they're the ones who build the country. And that's who we have to protect.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that is our job and your job as citizens and as our elected representatives. So thank you. Let's just get this done. Thank you. Thank you. Speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah. Anna Kristensen And I, while I am not representing the Long Beach Area Peace Network. I am speaking as a member of from the perspective of the Long Beach Area Peace Work Network, which is for peace primarily, but also for social and economic and environmental justice.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Reach. In California, we are on the blacklist, as we know, for being a sanctuary state. And and so they went to workplaces over 100. The response of a local activist was to spend a few hours today at one of those workplaces that happened to be a trucking operation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Just so we're clear here, there's no request on my part or anybody's part to make this issue any more complex or difficult or challenging for our council to be in favor of than it already is. Having had the experience with our Claudius Law issue, where women were not apparently getting this much support, never mind about that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Anyway, more to come. What I will say is that it's important to realize that when we talk about employers that are good employers, we talk about workers that are hard workers, that this is not a fight between the two or between us as a community.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Employers and workers are all part of our community. They all need to be protected. They all need to have the right to operate their businesses and make a living wage. And when when they become separated by a federal government who is on the on the lookout and on the way to divide us as a society and make'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it harder for workers and employers to get the job done, we need to be protective of that, too. So when our city sanctuary bill comes before you and even in terms of this bill, when you're thinking about it, when you're having your your conversations and your work, realize that all workers have the right to work, whether they'",
        "'speaker_4': '. What do I want to say? They had that time, like our like our law enforcement does. They have the time to do the job for our city, for their families and our community. They do not need to do the job that people who seek to divide us have decided they can stop.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we don't we want we want their rights to be known and understood. We hope we can get the city's cooperation in informing everyone in the workplace what their rights are when it comes to protecting their workers and the right to work.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And by the way, I will say that Janine Pearce is is facing a recall funded by disgruntled hotel businesses to the tune of tens of hundreds of thousands of dollars. This is not a grassroots movement and it is she is not in my way.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you for a comment.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much. Next speaker, please. Hello. My name is Matt Houston and I generally. Resort to politics as a very last resort. That being said, I'm here representing Matt Houston for governor, Matt Houston for sheriff and Matt Houston for mayor of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And the reason for that last one, oh, one more is California Dash Republic, not U.S.. California. That republic taught us. One of my ancestors was the president of the Republic of Texas and I believe is represented by that little star on your flag there.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I believe he came over here and recognized y'all as a republic in order to make sure that y'all weren't taken over by slaves like a the next like the president of the the Republic of Texas after that, who was a slave trader anyhow.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So my we need to talk we need to talk to the issue on the. Sure, sure. Yeah, I'm getting to it. Yeah. The what is connected the mayor thing is connected that both my both my bosses, my family are have truck drivers.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So that's one commonality between both sides of the family. One thing is that these guys are pretty good at is organizing. And so I would like to I would like to suggest looking at things from a different point of view.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I have experience working. I stopped an al Qaeda attack from on on the NFL Network. They're trying to get the credit card numbers. And I was there. And in so doing, I realized that the system they're using under underlying that could operate a credit union.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I think maybe a way to deal with it would be to combine something like maybe the the the teachers credit union, the Teamsters credit union, the police credit union, the fire department credit union together link it up with the NFL teams and make sure to take care of the gentrification problem.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we can we have to we have to speak to the truck driving issue, which is the issue in front of us. Well, that's. Yeah, that's what I think. That's so. Improve their working conditions and request work with the Labor Commission.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think improving working conditions if you do it financially by, by, by setting up a credit union network so that they can support themselves and support the city of Long Beach so that you don't have to do things like say we're not going to support, you know, low income housing anymore.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's the reason why I'm run for mayor. And you could do that by bouncing timeshares across the country, would work real well for Teamsters, you know, and then that way it could, you know, when there's an influx of of people from elsewhere, you can finance all that, finance the stadiums, finance the city and all that kind of'",
        "'speaker_1': 'stuff and take care of the Teamsters as well. That's my suggestion. All right. Thank you, sir. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening, honorable council members, mayor and our friends, city staff. I'm actually here to speak on an agenda item later in the agenda. And Councilwoman Pryce asked me we bumped into each other upstairs and she said, Are you here to speak about the trucking issue?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I said, No, what trucking issue? But sitting here and listening to this, I am compelled to speak. So yes, I am sorry that I it took me a while to decide. I wasn't sure. Once again, my name is Vivian Malone, Lulu and I am a very proud port worker.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm a member of ILWU Local 13. And listening to this argument, I would like to thank you for bringing this to the attention certainly of the city and the public. It is long overdue. Longshore workers have for many.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Years been very.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Frustrated at the delays that happen on the ports. We want to help our outside trucking brothers and sisters just as much as you do. And oftentimes our hands are tied. While it would be very easy to blame automation for failures and computers and long delays, that's actually not the problem.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The problem has to do with logistics. The problem has to do with poor Manning, with not ordering enough workers.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'With a 24 hour port.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'System that shuts down while you've got warehouses. And I've written down some notes here as you've.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Got.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Chances independent.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Workers and companies.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Who manipulate the availability.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Their Inland Empire distribution centers who closed Friday night and weekends. And there, you know, our port is open. I'm actually going to be at work later on tonight. I'll be working at the Port of Long Beach tonight. We are discharging thousands of containers, thousands of containers onto our docks.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And yet the yard will only be open from 8 to 5. And sometimes they open on the evening will have dock work that will service truckers at night. But that doesn't happen all the time. And it doesn't happen at all the all the terminals.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So the trucks will wait. Sometimes they do two loads per day.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They get paid by the load. They get paid by the load, not the hour. We can have an outside trucker come into one of the ports at 9:00 in the morning and he might not get service until 2.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'P.m. because the computer.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Will break down because the trans. Taylor Because there's not enough Manning because somebody else bumped him. So the logistics of it is what truly needs to be addressed.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I know that my time is short, but I'd also like to call you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Attention to the beneficial cargo owners gap. Walmart, Old Navy, Nike. They control the costs at the warehouse and distribution centers. They are the ones who manipulate the outside trucking companies, who hire these truck drivers who deserve respect, who deserve to be treated fairly.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And the IOW. We are more.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Than willing and able to service them in a timely fashion. But we've got to work around logistics that are.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Way above our pay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Grade, and the decisions that are being made have nothing to do with us.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'See how God judges the ports specifically. See what He says about that. And the reason is because. If you are that rich and you're making that much money, God would expect you to look out for people who are slaving for you, who are bringing in your revenue.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I noted at the 1933 earthquake, a big part of structure just fell in the ocean. And as I did history on what happened in 1933, I thought, why would God allow something like that to happen? Tonight as I heard this.'",

And if you vote for the wealthy, the counsel of heaven, which yet will make a decision, the counsel of heaven makes a decision irrespective to what you do here.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'doing in this country for the last 500 years. It was wonderful to be a part of something of our history for the last 500 years and for people to recognize it was one of the last museums that was built under the Smithsonian system.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And it was it's one of the most beautiful contributions that you can ever see. So I am in support. I will do everything I can. I have built institutions in Long Beach to make things better, where everybody in Long Beach and this would be a good institution for everyone in Longreach to find out about themselves and everybody'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so they can see how we are all connected together. Africa is a continent where our people came from and we need to make that connection and understand our history and our culture and it's only through a good institutional base.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We will have a way of learning and teaching ourselves and our children what we need to know. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much. Next speaker, please. Hi, Matt. Houston, California Republic. WC. Oh, I just wanted to bring up some points. I kind of grew up as an army brat, bounced around all over the place, and I actually came to California originally from Texas when I was working on a computer graphics project, which was based largely on'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Rosa Parks trying to get, you know, and I was chased, you know, had, you know, the the the secret societies around Texas in the South chased me all over Texas, chased me out here. So I learned a few things along the way.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'One of the things I'd like to bring your attention to is Wired magazine. If you do a search for this best map ever of America's racial segregation. Okay, check that out, if you would. And what they did was they put a different blue dot red on, I can't remember which was for which, but for every person and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the census and where they were located. Now, if you take that and you compare that with Los Angeles County's district maps, it matches almost. Exactly. And then if you compare that and you look at it, the African-Americans in LA County are basically kind of all in the center, not along the beach property, you know, where the it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it seems kind of like what you would look at if you're looking at a military map of somebody that's getting surrounded, you know. So I think that's something that should be considered. I also like to point out a building called Edificio.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I having compared that with the with the city of Long Beach districts yet because well, I know that it's a once city in L.A. County that's split by two different county districts. It's kind of weird. Interesting. So your unique perspective.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So also in Dallas, there was something called a what they did is a pretty neat project called Mockingbird Station. What they did was they put businesses at the bottom and then they put housing at the top. And I would think maybe something like that would be really great.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There's a building called Edificio KOPAN and Sao Paulo, Brazil has a record for the most number of units, and it's been standing since 1960. That might be good. Now, if you could imagine this building as a modular structure, so you could build a base with a cultural center, then have small business development and then housing as well'",
        "'speaker_1': ', and then take that model. And if you multiply that out, you get a few of those, you got the whole homeless problem solved as well. You drive down, you know, keep the housing. Price is reasonable as well and create an economic powerhouse, I think.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I think a comprehensive city and county plan is kind of necessary maybe using. And that's something that may maybe through the African-American organizations, would probably be able to pull that together. But I just wanted to throw that out there for you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Thank you, sir. Next speaker, please.'",

I'm here to speak in support of the African American Cultural Center. Long Beach is a city of diverse peoples and cultures, and we celebrate it in different ways.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We celebrated the Pride Parade, Cinco de Mayo, the Cambodian celebrations. We do that. And to me, it means that the city is celebrating its diversity. And it's also a city that unites behind each other when faced with adversity.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'For the last five years, Dante Street Community Association has sought to educate our residents on the many contributions that African-Americans have made, not only to this community and this city, but to this country. From the brilliant 12 women that was mentioned earlier today to our own Walter Larkin's.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Those women contributed much to the city of Long Beach and beyond. But Walter Larkin's was someone from the city of Long Beach who revolutionized the procedure for heart operation. Instead of having to crack and open up crack, open heart, he revolutionized that method and procedure that allows that to happen.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'And us coming together as a community, all our organizations coming together to make that effort, I think would be worth it. And I urge this this community, this council, to continue to do that. Thank you.'",

I've culter cultivated my craft as a filmmaker and a writer there for nearly 25 years. And it's a place where I met my mentor, Ben Caldwell, at his community center known as Chaos Network.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Coast Network. Yes. Thank you. Here I learn art, filmmaking, the business of art, and establish many strong relationships that still exist present day. We establish the good life. We establish Project Blowed, which is the longest running open mic hip hop workshop in North America.'",

They have forgotten images and we have Eric Von Brinkley who has RG be our brunch were artists come together to'",

When I brought it up to the city council that same day, he was in L.A. and asked him was he getting paid?'",

And I'm here in support of this recommendation for the city manager to work with community stakeholders and identify a site for the African-American Cultural Center.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'As an Arts Council, we advocate for many arts centers in a city. There are many cities around the country that use our libraries. They use armories. They used underutilized parks centers in order to connect residents and visitors to the culture of their city.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And here in Long Beach, we have a very rich culture. Long Beach has a great downtown center, and this would allow for us to take our residents and visitors to another part of our city that's also full of culture and richness and diversity.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'I work for the city for 18 years and I personally served on two teams that worked on ethnically based centers like this was a great experience. Neither of those were African-American. But one of the things that creating this kind of center does and one of the things that doing this kind of effort produces is that people it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'goes beyond the walls. I know you build an edifice, but it goes far beyond the walls of the center itself. Gives people, especially young people, courage. It gives them courage to dispel. If somebody tells them that an apple is a banana, it it gives them power that that that comes from just the not just just knowledge.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And one of the things about these kinds of centers is that they allow people to find their own truth. And that's something that's really important in this world today. I heard somebody mention Jesse Owens, and a lot of people don't know that Jesse Owens was born James Cleveland Owens and his family moved to the north and he'",
        "'speaker_4': 'was enrolled in school and teacher asked him his name, having a heavy Southern accent. He said, Jesse Owens and Digital. He said, Jesse, the rest is history. So those not just Long Beach, but just African-American culture in general is something that.'",

That there are very many there are a lot of African-Americans, black people, colored folk in this city who understand if you feel that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'way. And we forgive you. We're not taking that to heart. Personally, I have long since come to understand that the slave people who hold some of my relatives are not here. They are not my battle. What you white people are having to deal with now is that some of your forefathers left this for you to clean up'",
        "'speaker_4': '. And it's on your plate now. You can't get away from it. You're going to have to bring your children in. You're going to have to invite some black people in to your house. You're going to have to bridge the gaps some more.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'But you do have to make up for the pain and suffering that we have kind of spoke. That's who you're looking at now. But I am an Indian, French, Jewish person by birth. But you're looking at me as a black woman and not having to make up for something that your relatives did and you can't get away'",
        "'speaker_4': 'from it. If you work for the ports, if you work if you work for the upper echelons of the city, I am saying to you by invitation and permission, you need to give in to this thing. You give in to that thing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You will help eliminate and get rid of some of the hatred that sits in our DNA. That being, that would make you turn your back and cross the street just because you saw a black person approaching you and you don't even know who they are.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Send your checks to this thing and let's clean it up.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Assad. Next speaker, please. Wow. The last two speakers. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Good evening. I was here for the nuisance abatement. And now I'm going to speak on this. Lydia. Holly. My address is on file. And I wanted to say thank you, Councilman Andrews and Councilman Austin and Councilman Richardson, for what you're doing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This is certainly an outgrowth of the conversations that took place about four or five years ago, I guess four years ago with the African American convening that we had initiated. And out of that convening was the state of Black Long Beach report that Dr. Alex Norman and myself co-writers of that report and presented to the community.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I pulled it up and I wanted just to share something really quick with you. Black Heritage in Long Beach. The heritage of black people in Long Beach has long has been well documented in a publication by editors Aaron Il de and of the late Indira Hale Tucker in association with the African American Heritage Society of Long'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Beach. In their book, The Heritage of African-Americans in Long Beach, Volume 126 Day In traced the history back to 1900 when the U.S. Census on nonwhites listed 22 African-Americans living in Long Beach. What follows is a chronology of the events they discovered in their research of public records, books, newspaper articles, etc..'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The 22 were listed in our document. So this cultural arts center is in memory of them. The youngest was four years old. The oldest was 56. The earliest came in 1853 and the latest was 1886. So it gives me great pleasure to stand before you city council.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And it's not about the overrepresentation of African-American males in prison. It's not about, well, those cracker box housing seats are long beats that I'm not really happy about. But all of the things that have come since. It gives me great pleasure to stand with a big smile on my face.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That is this? Yes. Finally, we're being able to recognize who we are as a city and as a people. And for you demand and Andrew's mommy knows you forever. Central Long Beach was where I was born. For you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Councilman Austin eighth District represents Bixby, where my great auntie was a live in person with a woman who lived on a Virginia road. And I used to go with her on the weekends and stay the weekends with her.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes. And for you, Councilman Richardson, you represent the neighborhood where my home is located. So each of you bring something to me personally, but it also shows that I, as a resident, a daughter of the city and a resident of the city, bring something to this to this experience, too.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So for the 22 original black residents of Long Beach, thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. And our last speaker.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'I want to first say I got my civic involvement by our ladies here in the audience. We celebrated her 90th birthday, Miss Dale Clinton Kingston, in 1966. She said, elected me to be the president of the mayor's youth council and brought me into this kind of environment.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I am a semi-retired educator from Long Beach Unified School District, and this is my 13th year of taking students abroad to see the kind of facility that we are trying to establish this evening. I take students basically to historical sites and historical colleges as well, and we are embarking upon our trip this spring break, April 4th through'",

        "'speaker_4': 'And we've taken them to Baltimore to the Great Blacks in Wax Museum. We are scheduled to take them to the latest Smithsonian, the African-American History and Culture Museum in Washington, D.C., this spring break. So I am definitely in support of this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I thank you for your efforts. It is something that bailing out many, many others have dreamed about and wanted to see here. We've gone all over the world. Yes, we do want our own physical place where forgotten images don't have to move around and different things.'",

I'd like to respond to a couple of items, some of the comments made at the podium and also to the Andrew's challenge to fund this facility.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Earlier tonight, we honored the first African-American firefighter who was hired in 1962. And it's significant because that was two years prior to the 64 Civil Rights Act. But five years prior to that, the student body at Pauley High School, which I believe at the time was probably 90% non-African-American, elected their very first African-American student body president.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that was our esteemed colleague, the Andrews. And and just a little icing on that cake. I think he was also student.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Elementary and Franklin Junior High.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So when I quote that statistic, I'm very proud of Long Beach and what those students did in the fifties. And here Deandra is 60 years later, pledging $100,000 to this facility. So what I like to do is to pledge my full support and financial support for recognition of Dean Andrews in the facility.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilmember. Councilman Austin. Vice Mayor Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. I just wanted to chime in and just acknowledge two things. So, one, I heard the person recommend the North Library, and if there's a way, I know it's a bunch of North Palm Beach residents here, and I think it makes a lot of sense.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Right now, it's the temporary site of the winter shelter. But we could look, you know, as entire community about, you know, I don't know what the status is today, but if there's a way to make that work as some sort of a local heritage center, I like the idea a lot.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The second thing I would say is that I think I think, look, obviously, from a financial standpoint, I'm going to support this angels in the details. Right. I want to see I want to see where this goes. I want to see that there are people who will step up to operate it, help raise money for this.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So all the challenge that I would say wouldn't be to the council. I think it's a challenge to the community. Step up and help us identify the resources to make this happen. So that's what I would that's what I would say.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Vice mayor of council. Going to go back to some brass analogies. You want me to first go to the.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It's okay. And actually, the vice mayor actually took my point. I was going to also extend the challenge to the community and the stakeholders who who want to see this happen. I want to just say that many I appreciated the public comments.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Many of our elders and people I have a great deal of respect for came forth and spoke this evening and many more at home watching and supporting this this effort, I think, and to to my council colleague, Mr. Andrews, who is a legend in his own right, it is an honor to to serve with him and to'",
        "'speaker_8': 'to to work with him on a daily basis. I want to accept your challenge, but I'm not going to commit to $100,000 quite yet. We're going to I'd like to see this community go big and, you know, to, you know, in terms of development dollars to that that will it will take to get this off the ground'",
        "'speaker_8': 'to sustain it. You know, I think we need to be talking, you know, at least seed money of about $1.5 million in private donations as well as community support moving forward. And so that's the challenge I want to put forward in itself.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Sounds like we got $100,000 started up front. So thank you very much. 505 So and I had a question for the city manager. There is no timeline for this to come back. Would it be possible for a report to come back within 90 days?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Certainly. All right. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilman Austin. Again.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Constable Pearce keeps moving around back here. I also just wanted to echo and clarify my support for the item and also challenging our community to to step up. But that my office as well will follow lead from those that are taking this on from all the elders and those that have committed themselves to this community long before'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I moved here. I look forward to taking your lead and supporting in any way possible. So again, congratulations on tonight.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much. With that, we do have a motion any second on the floor. Thank you all for coming out. Please cast your votes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But vice mayor, which is in motion carries.'",

    "Recommendation to request City Manager to:   \tReceive and file a report from the Long Beach Innovation Team on the Nuisance Motels Pilot Program;   \tExplore the feasibility of a citywide Nuisance Motel Ordinance that would hold property owners accountable for nuisance and criminal related activities, by accelerating administrative penalties and timelines on nuisance, crime-ridden motels throughout the City of Long Beach; and   \tExplore the feasibility of implementing a Motel Amortization Program in order to reduce over concentration and outdated uses along corridors, thus diminishing the use of motels as hubs for illegal activity.": [
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Motion carries unanimously. Next item up. Madam Clerk, please read, which is item 24.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Item 20. Item 24 is communication from Vice Mayor Richardson. Council Member Pierce. Council Member Supernanny. Councilman Andrew's recommendation to receive and file report from the Long Beach Innovation Team on the Newson Motels pilot program explored the feasibility of a citywide news and motel ordinance and explore the feasibility of implementing a motel amortization program.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. So first, I want to thank all the folks who are who are here and waited patiently through our city council meeting. This is ever given Tuesday. So I'm glad you're able to be here and witness our our proceedings.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I want to thank council members Andrews Pearson Supernova for lending their names in support of this conversation. So for decades, North Long Beach neighborhoods all across our city have been facing persistent blight, crime, violence associated with outdated nuisance motels.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'In many cases, human trafficking, drug activity and violent crime has really taken root in these motels. In fact, in the past three years, our police department has gotten 3189 calls for service for violent crime in files 772 crime incident reports on the six worst motels alone.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's just six. Not to mention the continued drain on public resources from police department. Fire code enforcement. Nuisance abatement. Health Department. City Prosecutors. Department. We know that these problem motels are located all across the city. But let's just hone in on one corridor for a moment on Long Beach Boulevard in North Long Beach, between the 17 freeway'",
        "'speaker_6': 'and Forehand Street, or just about Artesia, where the 91 is, that's just a half of a mile stretch. The corridor is lined with five outdated motels. And recently, our innovation team analyzed calls for service and incident report records for all motel and hotel locations in Long Beach over the last three, three and a half years.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And that narrowed it down to some six of the worst motels in the city. And frankly, on this corridor, two of the six worst in the city are adjacent to each other on this corridor. To give you a snapshot, between January 2014 and May 2017, Luxury Inn and the Sierra Motel had 1501 calls for service in that'",
        "'speaker_6': 'three year span and 237 crime reports on Long Beach Boulevard between those two motels, most notably last April. A tragic incident occurred at that luxury in prompting SWAT to evacuate evacuate the residents from Coolidge Triangle neighborhoods for more than 8 hours as police search for a gunman.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Aside from the loss of life, this incident required over 80 police personnel to respond to this crime. I must say that again, 80 police personnel were taken off the streets to address one motel for 8 hours. Could you imagine what those police officers could have been doing if they weren't addressing this one motel?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Immediately following, we pulled together a meeting city manager. Our human trafficking folks are our development services folks to sort out an action plan and a pilot program to hold property owners accountable for that crime, human trafficking and violence that takes place at their establishments.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And as a response to that meeting, staff began a pilot program, a multiple multiply, multiple department effort to address the ongoing blight and nuisances associated with these these high calls for service motels. And so at this time, I'd love to just hear Quick Report on the two from four or how the pilot program is going.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mr. West, I'm going to turn this over to our I-Team director, Traci Conger.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Honorable mayor and city council. Just to give you a brief history, in 2017, the nuisance motel's pilot program was initiated by the city manager. After several discussions with Vice Mayor Richardson about community concerns in North Long Beach. City staff from the prosecutor's office, city attorney's office, development Services, Health Police, Fire, financial management departments and a Long Beach'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Innovation Team have met to address ongoing issues involving nuisance motels in our city. Specifically, staff focused on motels that meet the criteria of a nuisance location as defined by the Long Beach Municipal Code and those experiencing high volume of police related calls for service.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To identify trends and establish baseline averages for police activity at motel locations in the city, staff collected and aggregated calls for service and incident report records for all motel and hotel locations in Long Beach from January 1st, 2014 through May 31st, 2017.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The data sets were analyzed separately and weighted by activity type. Calls for service were weighed by priority level to correspond with response time with priority one calls having the highest weight. Incident reports were weighted by part one and Part two, crimes that correspond with the FBI uniform crime reporting codes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Each motel was then assigned a final index, scored for both datasets and weighted once more by the number of rooms at each location. The final scores provide baseline values to track police activity in Long Beach going forward by location, type of establishment and size, as well as quarterly trends over time, which you can see in these two'",
        "'speaker_3': 'slides. We have both calls for service as well as incidents over each quarter. The results from the police data analysis will go down to the locations with the highest scores from which six locations were selected for a pilot program.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The city has several programs in place as part of its effort to combat nuisance related activity. Between 2005 and 2009 through the redevelopment agency, the city purchased and abated approximately 12 nuisance motels. The current nuisance abatement ordinance and other various code enforcement policies represent other long standing abatement programs in the city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Staff has initiated a pilot program again with the six motels listed. Site visits to pilot locations are focused on interdepartmental collaboration, community support and partnerships with motel owners and managers. This model balances enforcement with support to motel managers provided by city staff.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The city must look to other solutions with minimal fiscal impact to address nuisance motels. Opportunity exists to incorporate zoning and land use changes in the city's existing efforts, including the Uptown Livable Zoning and Investment Plan, also known as Up Plan.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This could incentivize motel owners to convert their properties to more viable uses, such as mixed income and or mixed use housing and commercial centers. Staff recommends continuing the pilot program through the end of fiscal year 18 to further develop recommendations and solutions for these establishments while we search to identify funding opportunities.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This concludes my report. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. And and Tracy, thank you for that. That your hard work. And just so folks know, the city is committed to fighting this issue and addressing this issue when you have a response from eight separate departments working collaboratively to address this.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So, you know, the pilot program is a great first step at addressing the immediate sort of negative impacts. So that's that's that's suppression. That's a response. But as we heard, you know, as you may know, many cities, including Chula Vista, Anaheim and Oakland, are taking more formal action to combat these crime infested motels by looking at both'",
        "'speaker_6': 'short term and long term solutions. People people who have lived on that corridor for 20, 30 years can tell you human trafficking along Beach Boulevard is not new. When the city when the city council, when the city cracks down, it's like a water balloon.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We crack down for a little while and the issues just moved to Compton in Lynwood. And when the Compton sheriffs crack down, they squeeze on the other side of the balloon. It pops right back up in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we've got to not necessarily look at just suppression. When we look at how much resources go into it, we have to look at short term and long term strategies. So based on the success that we learned, we're learning from the pilot motel program along with best practices from other jurisdictions.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Part of the My motion tonight is recommend staff explore the feasibility of implementing a citywide nuisance motel ordinance that will hold motel owners accountable for the things that take place in their property and really ask for a higher standard.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'No matter what era you live in, you live in a higher standard for motels, and so we can use the tools we already have in this ordinance, but really take a look at sort of retooling our fees, our fines to create something that accelerates our administrative process to bring them into compliance.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'An ordinance will give us the leverage we need to set performance standards, impose administrative penalties on property owners, allowing criminal activity to take place on their premises. An ordinance can incorporate existing and expanded standards, including proposed security measures, such as increased lighting and security cameras.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Right now, the city is installing security cameras along Beach Boulevard because of the activity taking place at the motels. The motels should be required to put in security cameras so there's not the taxpayers putting up those resources. Increased environmental regulations to ensure healthy conditions, as well as a visitation requirement that assures accountability enforcement and enforcement at establishments'",
        "'speaker_6': '. Additionally, I will hope to see best practices from other jurisdictions incorporated into the ordinance. For example, in Chula Vista, the city mandated mandated motel go guests show ID and register their plate number, as with the motel as a requirement of checking in.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'These security protocols have been shown, have been proven to reduce crime and to actually assist our vice detectives with investigating when something does happen. You'd have that I.D., you'd have that car registration, you'd have that information. We've we already have a proven track record of implementing successful nuisance abatement ordinances here in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Our award winning alcohol nuisance abatement ordinance has been very effective in decreasing crime and blight associated with liquor stores across our city. It started off again as a pilot and then expanded citywide. This this establishes a steady operational requirements that improve public safety, including the removal of payphones, unauthorized signage, advertisements, exterior, you know, and other catalysts for'",
        "'speaker_6': 'loitering and other unlawful activities. So it's currently and is currently in its fourth phase. Again, it started in North Long Beach in its fourth phase of implementation with near 100% compliance rating from liquor stores. So I would hope that the motel ordinance and the strategy leverages a similar strategy as we took with with the alcohol ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We know that targeting structural conditions and environmental site issues as well as holding property owners accountable for illegal activity is an effective strategy. Not just reducing to not just reduce crime, but also helps set the standard for a long term permanent solution.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So so the third piece of this is really I'm recommending that staff look at the feasibility of implementing some long term permanent solutions as well that address overconcentration. So we're not talking about going after every motel, but if there are two or three of these nuisance motels right next to each other.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Right now there's five along Beach Boulevard. There's not a tourist destination. There's no reason for that. So what can we do to address the overconcentration and address the issue long term and permanently? So changes land use and zoning in order to phase out motels where tourism no longer exists.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's that's a strategy we can utilize. Opportunities explore zoning and land use changes in up plan like as discussed to incentivize motel owners to convert to some other more appropriate use. We can begin the conversation around amortization. That's something that, you know, that essentially deems motels and high crime corridors as legal, non-conforming and sets a timeline to'",
        "'speaker_6': 'bring it into compliance. We should take a look at that. We've used it in other instances, such as with car dealerships and Long Beach Boulevard when it was it was most feasible when applied to over concentrated areas. City of Gardena just used amortization to address two nuisance gentleman clubs in Gardena.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The process started many years ago, but they finally they started. They set the clock and when the clock ended, those two gentlemen's clubs closed down. So they started it when they said, hey, they only need to operate in industrial industrial spaces or they made a land use choice and that started the clock.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If we started this clock 20 years ago, we wouldn't be in the position today. So it doesn't mean that motel would be necessarily shut down, but it actually allows us to think about the vision for the corridor with all this conversation about visioning taking place.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So the conversation is really simple. We know that human trafficking and crime has taken root in many of these motels. I know it resonates. Know it. We know the average human trafficking victim in California is 14 years old and that California harbors three of the FBI's highest sex trafficking areas in the nation L.A., San Francisco and San'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Diego today. Currently, children walking along Beach Boulevard on the way to Colin Powell, Keith Reed School, Colin Powell Academy are being approached by pimps. We know that people in audience know that they've heard these these stories especially. And we know that some motel owners are complicit.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They're working with some of these networks. So if we know these things and Vice is investing in these things, we continue to place a focus on succession. At some point, we are complicit as a city if we don't think about a long term solution.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So, you know, so I'll summarize by saying what we're looking at is three things. The pilot is immediate suppression. Short term is a faster process to respond through an ordinance. And long term, we want to look at some way to update, some way to leverage processes or incentives or updating land use to address the overconcentration.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Those are the three things I want to I want to just acknowledge that there was a letter from the motel association that came out came out today. And so whoever whoever you are, I encourage you to work with city staff.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I've talked with them. They're going to open up the doors and talk with you about what will or will not transpire. But thank you for stepping up. We didn't get where we are with liquor stores, without the liquor store owners stepping up.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we actually welcome that. I want to thank again the co-sponsors, Pearce, Super Norton Andrews, and encourage the city council support tonight. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much. Councilmember Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor, again for your great leadership on this item. And to all of those that have waited to hear this item on a long council night, I absolutely support this item wholeheartedly. I think that it's a step in the right direction.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I do have a couple questions in my district. Some of these top six are actually in my district. And I know that our muni code and I just want to ask staff a question on how we handle the situation.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We have our muni code says that a responsible party shall not be prohibited from knowingly renting or leasing to an individual guestroom in a hotel or motel to one or more sex offenders. Yada, yada, yada. And no sex offenders should reside within 2000 feet from any public or private school.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The walking distance between Franklin Middle School and the Long Beach Motel on Seventh Street is a little over 1000 feet. So I'm wondering, have we done any work with that motel in particular on ensuring that they're following the guidelines per muni code?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Sorry to spring that on you guys.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'No, it's okay. Thank you. Councilmember, at this point, we're working to establish those relationships and be able to provide the appropriate enforcement with code enforcement as well as the police department.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we currently don't have a practice in place to make sure that that's not happening.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. And is that part of this pilot program that's already in place?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We are developing a compliance plan, which is as a series of corrective issues items. And we're meeting with the hoteliers and their managers to go over what we think are the menu items that are applicable for those particular motels.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. I want to recognize the fact that these are hotspots for human trafficking. And I want to applaud the work that the human trafficking task force has done. I know when you first came to this city, a lot of folks said it probably wasn't that big of a deal.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so recognizing this and saying that we really have to chip away at these little bitty pieces, this is, you know, Franklin Middle Schools is a big concern for me. The same issue that the vice mayor raised where you have kids walking down the street and being approached by individuals is alarming.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I want to make sure that that is included in the next report that we get back. I also want to talk about some of the work that's been done in L.A. and I know that this really was an item that was focused on the fact that these were crime zones.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And obviously, these numbers are very shocking to see. But I also want to recognize that we in the city have said that dealing with homelessness is a big challenge. I know that we have vouchers that sometimes we place people in some of these motels.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But I want to really make sure that in a report back that we're looking at things like the City of L.A. did, which was an interim motel conversion ordinance where we would say, if, you know, perhaps if they fall into the amortization and we're saying we have too many of these, that we're working on an incentive program'",
        "'speaker_5': ', working with our county, working with our health department to say let's have transitional housing where we have a connection to wraparound services. That is a need that we desperately need in the city. And it would provide oversight. It would ensure that we have people in those previous motels turned to housing that would have staff making sure that'",
        "'speaker_5': 'we have a safe place for people to get on their feet. And so I want to make sure that that's part of a report back as you guys are doing this work coming out of the health department, if that's okay.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Fantastic. All right. I'm done. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I just want to say thank you, vice Mayor, for bringing this forward. This is very important. I have and the first district, we have a ton of motels along seventh and new new motels looking to come. And I think that we need to address this issue first and abate it first and tackle what we can before moving'",
        "'speaker_3': 'forward with additional options. And so thanks so much. I look forward to, you know, seeing where this ends up. And just thank you so much for the work.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman Austin. Thank you. And I think.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'This is a great item. It's proactive. I know Rex and his residents at the ninth District have been working very hard to to address this this nuisance and this problem. And it is very much it has been an issue up North Long Beach Boulevard.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I've seen it, witnessed it myself. And I think this is a very proactive, strong approach. However, and what I like most about the report is the fact that it identified the most problem motels. Right. It identified those and it didn't necessarily paint all motel operators with a wide brush.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It said, you know, we're going to go after and identify the nuisance sites and work to abate those. I know for a fact that, you know, I have motels in my district as well. Not all of them are the best.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But we actually have some some examples of, I think, very well-run and responsible motel operators who I think in this conversation should be be also stakeholders. When you talk about best practices, because there are some some some good ones.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I think we have some some representatives here from a couple of the motels in a district who who want to be part of the conversation as well. And so as we move forward with staff in terms of looking at feasibility and implementing, you know, an ordinance, I think we should make sure that we're talking to everybody'",
        "'speaker_8': '. And so I would invite that that conversation. I hope you're amenable to that. Vice Mayor Richardson as well. So thank you very much. I'm really looking forward to hearing from the public, though. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman. A. Thank you. I'll just follow up on what Councilmember Austin just said, if I can ask the vice mayor for just a little more clarification. We were contacted at almost 4 p.m. this afternoon by a group, and we had another event to start at 4:04 p.m. that had just heard about this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So if you can explain. And they were asking for a 30 day continuance. Can you reiterate what you said before, that this is a work in progress? We're not making a decision tonight that they will have time to weigh in on this.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Sure. Thank you. So just to be clear, we had a conversation after the letter to make sure that if there is someone is going to step up and sort of represent those interests, they should have a seat at the table.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I'm looking to Oscar. We had this conversation. Oscar's nodding. He's acknowledging, so, yeah, we're going to bring him to the table so there's no need for a continuance. Let's start the process and have the conversation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilmember Ringo. Actually, I'm very happy to see this going forward in the way it is, because I think that there's anything that we need to have. It's more participation from from those affected, from the stakeholders, as well as people who are most affected by it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think that when we finish at the end of the day, that we're going to come up with a better, better solution to dealing with human trafficking and being able to at least minimize it and maybe even benefit from it in terms of being able to transition some of these hotels into, you know, some homeless housing'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and affordable housing and some accommodations of being able to bring people in when they need the the housing the most, especially that we're looking at opportunities for.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Home.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I mean, temporary housing. And this is a good opportunity to look at that. It's a creative way that the city can look at in terms of how to deal with its housing issues. And I'm looking forward to the results of the study at the end of the day.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Thank you very much. With that, we're gonna hear from the public. So please come down and just line up at the podium and.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I feel like I'm out of retirement.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Welcome. Welcome back. Welcome back. I'm going to sing that song for you. Welcome back. Welcome back. Welcome back.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening, Mr. Mayor, and members of the city council. I am standing here in support and strong support of the Citywide Nuisance Motel ordinance. And I have to tell you, as a resident in North Long Beach and in my district and in the Coolidge Triangle area, we greatly appreciate the attention that we believe that has been long'",
        "'speaker_4': 'overdue and that we deserve accountability is the cornerstone of this ordinance. As a taxpayer, I have grown weary of picking up the tab for the property owners of these motels that have been costing us money and adding to our deficit.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'As a 25 year property owner in the Coolidge Triangle neighborhood who has had the privilege of living among some of the finest residents in this city. I am confident in saying Colors Triangle and other North Long Beach homeowners and neighborhoods are deeply concerned about our neighbors, about our neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we are fierce protectors of our neighborhoods. We are hyper vigilant against anyone who does not live in our neighborhood. We really we look after each other in ways that I think would probably be the envy of others.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We have phone trees. We keep in contact with each other. We are always looking out for the children and for our elders. And it's just been a phenomenal place to live. And and we do really kind of get a little sensitive on the fact that because of the demographics, you know, we have the largest population of homeownership'",
        "'speaker_4': 'in North Long Beach, the certainly the largest population of first time people of color who are property owners in North Long Beach. And our homes are worth, you know, quite a bit. We have a major economic investment. So the dubious distinction of being a high crime area, etc., etc., it really kind of rubs against the grain because'",
        "'speaker_4': 'these issues do happen and they are the reason why we're here. But the neighborhoods are quality neighborhoods. This proposal is among the best that the city has advanced in a long time, and we really appreciate it. I want to make the point that when we talk about the children not being able to walk to school, you know'",
        "'speaker_4': 'what? For those of us use the bike to take the bus to work, sitting at that bus stop became very dangerous thing for the person speaking because in the morning there would be individuals trying to, well, proposition you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so it became very problematic, which forced me to have to now, you know, drive to work, taking a walk along Long Beach Boulevard in the in a in a summer evening or, you know, just simply having a stroll to jack in the box becomes a problem because of the neighborhood nuisance of these motels.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So thank you for bringing this forward. Councilman Richardson, you did an outstanding job with your report. And we are here to back this measure 100%. Thank you. Because we appreciate the neighborhoods that we live in and we want them to be better.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you so much. Next speaker, please. Good evening. On an open air vice mayor staff, many of the members from my north Long Beach neighborhood are seated behind me and in line. My name is Dan Press Burg. I'm the president of the DeForest Park Neighborhood Association.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'My information is on file. We in North Long Beach are in support of the pilot program. It addresses nuisance properties and their exorbitant expense in man hours and first responders by police and fire. The expense in human lives.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'From human trafficking and on crime. That is why the focus has been so specific on those six motels tonight. And however, I'm going to just address two corridors. That's the Atlantic corridor and Long Beach Boulevard. I drove those corridors when I was working full time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You could not stop without somebody knocking on your window and saying, Hey, how about a date? That's horrible. A nuisance. Motel pilot program pinpoints the activities on blighted corridors affecting the adjacent neighborhoods. That is why these motels were looked at, and that's why they're most troublesome.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This was a multi departmental program with an effort to address the ongoing issues, and we've had some of these before over on Pacific Coast Highway, where they were converted over to education sources and somehow it disappeared. The pilot program identifies trends and establishes a baseline for police activities at the motels throughout the city.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It monitors calls for service incidents. Reports and records have already been analyzed and the program needs to keep going on. And Rex has already said that he's going to dangle a carrot and put a carrot so we can all be at the table to talk about this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The pilot program will conclude this September three review review of the pilot program established, just like I said, the best practices and many, many cities. We'd like to thank the Vice Mayor for his vision, his vigilance and consistent care of our community and the neighborhoods of North Long Beach that the Forest Park Association.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And also there's a there's an alliance that we have are in full support of the new ordinance as it as it progresses and as it addresses the specific needs of the neighborhoods and the human element involved in human trafficking that focuses into our neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It also addresses some of the issues that lead to drugs, crime and other interdiction, as well as eliminating what has been a blight on our community for many, many years. We are united in full support. Thank you for moving this forward.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And one other thing in the eighth District, I don't know if you remember the chief motel. It's still a vacant lot. We spent ten years working on getting that removed before I became the councilman over there. And it it just about wore all two to nothing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So thank you again. Thank you, Rex. Thank you, Mr. President. Next speaker, please. It evening, Robert. And distinctive council members. The president of Coolidge Triangle Neighborhood Association and the issue of human trafficking has been pervasive for a very long time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's not unique only to Coolidge Triangle. If you represent the corridors of PCH, Anaheim, Long Beach Boulevard, we have the same mutual concerns. If you are by the Travelodge, if you take a look at, you know, men against human trafficking, the message is loud and clear.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Their present, the different parts of our city. Thank you, Rex, for bringing this to the table. This is a long term concern that the residents have spoken about for a very long time. I think that in many, many years you've been the first to actually step up and address this issue.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I hope that you as a council members do support Rex with this measure. The community deeply cares about our growth in many ways. We're very proactive in our community in ways that perhaps city funding cannot fund. We have leaders here who are both alumni from neighborhood leadership programs, have developed leaders in the community from tree plantings and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'corridor improvements. We want to continue improving our neighborhoods because we care deeply about those neighborhoods. If there's anything that you can do tonight is support Rex in his endeavors in improving North Long Beach and in your quarter two.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And what we do look at at the end of the day as well, if somebody had mentioned Rex, you had mentioned the kids also have to see prostitution on their way to school, going on in cars, on their way to school, going through our neighborhoods and as many times as our residents call.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And they keep on coming back. Where is the equity for these kids? So we as a community are going to continue being vocal. We as a community are continuously going to be fighting for what's right for our kids, our communities, our community as homeowners that are vested in this community.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We look to your leadership and your support in the proposition that Rex is presenting. So I do. Thank you. Thank you so much. Good to see you again. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We've always it's funny, right? I know. We all need to laugh.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Mayor. Last year.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Council members. Public in general. My name is Hilda Guyton. I am the co-chair of the Coalition for Katrina Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I'm here to support this item. I don't need to describe the atrocities that human.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Trafficking brings to the people.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Involved.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And to the community as a whole. With all my respect.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I urge you to please support this item and to help end the exploitation, especially of kids or children's children, and make.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Our city and.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Neighborhoods safer for all. Thank you very much. And thank you, Mr. Garcia, to bring this item to the table.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Thank you, Vice Mayor. Next speaker. Next speaker, please. And that was very the time on. That was wonderful. Thank you. Said so much in 45 seconds. I loved it. My name is Dennis Patel, and I'm here with the Long Beach Hotel Motel Association.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening, your honorable mayor. The Long Beach Council members and the staff. You are doing great work and we sincerely want to thank all of you for your service. I'm here this evening with our Long Beach Hotel Motel Association to give comments on the feasibility of a citywide nuisance motel ordinance that, for some unknown reason, is just'",
        "'speaker_1': 'applicable to motel and not hotel property owners. Today is the first time that we are all hearing about this ordinance through tonight's agenda. No one from the 14th floor has contacted us. Today we are just kindly asking for a 30 day continuance or extension during this 30 day continuance period.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We would like to meet our council members to mutually discuss and understand the details of the ordinance. Today we contacted the Office of All Language City Council members. However, we haven't heard back from their office yet, as I understand that we had to send the the letter out at a short notice as well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Your honorable mayor and council members. We think it's very fair to all sides to allow a 30 day continuance to meet and put our thoughts together to come up with more acceptable situation. Please kindly allow us this opportunity to work with our council members.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Thank you, sir. Next week, release. 3 million council members and mayor. My name is Roswell Lopez, and I am here on behalf of Ana Soto, who couldn't join us tonight. So she wrote a letter which I began to read.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Dear City Council, my name is Ana Soto, and I'm and I'm a resident of the Ninth Council District. This letter is in lieu of my personally attending tonight's meeting to speak in support of your proposal to evaluate and expand short and long term solutions to address the nuisance motels.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'These specific motels have become a hub of illegal activity over the years, causing much blight and crime in the surrounding areas, most notably human trafficking. I work as an analyst for human trafficking. I work as an analyst and human trafficking coordinator for the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But tonight, I speak as a resident who has much experience in the fight against human trafficking. I am a member of the Lambert Human Trafficking Task Force and see the devastation human trafficking is wreaking in our communities morally, financially and emotionally.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I request the City Council support Vice Mayor Richardson's proposal. So Long Beach can continue its project towards a safe and caring city in the state of California. I make myself available to lend political, personal and community support towards a successful implementation of the short and long term solutions being proposed.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Blessings Signed. ANAM Soto, Chair of the 63rd District, Los Angeles County Democratic Party. Thank you. Thank you very much. And thanks to Mrs. Soto as well. Speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, mayor. Council persons and allow me to speak today.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'My name is G2 Patel, 50 Atlantic Avenue, Long Beach. I'm not I was not aware of what you are considering today, especially as this will affect our livelihood. If it wasn't for the press telegram.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I would have known that this item was being presented.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Today. I think it's unfair to pass an item without the input from hoteliers. Hoteliers. We would like to review staff reports as well and to discuss the.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. Excuse me. I'm Robert Bergman. I am. Thank you for allowing me to speak here. I've been here working in Long Beach for ten years, and I've been in school here in Long Beach. I'm a graduate from Long Beach State.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm also a U.S. veteran, disabled American. All right. This is about time we have something like this. Because this has been going on for a long, long time. And I want to be I'm I'm also the founder of a clean up Sapp area coalition.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And if you didn't hear, the Grace Motel should be added to the list. And it also burned. It went up in flames. I say take it all down now. Take it away. Because it's nothing but a cesspool of drugs violence.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And. Prostitution. All kinds of illegal activity goes in and out of there and not one of your police officers will go in and do anything about it. They take a blind eye to what is right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'For the homeless population. The landlords. This should also be this should cover the landlords of apartment buildings as well, because they are too at fault. And for the homeless crisis. Have each landowner. Have a division of percentage of units available for homeless vets.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Homeless? Anybody? Anybody. Homeless? There should be. A percentage of their apartments ready to rent to the homeless. Thank you for your service.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That's your phone.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'Of the Neighborhood Association. In that area, we have 1100 homes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I want to say that I took the opportunity to stand with men standing against trafficking.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'On Long Beach Boulevard Friday night. It was an awesome opportunity to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Look at that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Strip.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I drive.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Past there five, six, seven times a month.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Most of the hope motels.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You wouldn't even know.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'They are there unless you happen to frequent them. There's only one multi-story motel in that little strip there. But I want to say this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Holding that sign up there, I could not help but.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Cars with men coming to Victoria and then making a U-turn.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I thought.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Did they see us with those signs? Were they out hunting and turned around and went the other way? That's what went through my mind. I said, get rid of those hotels, motels that are causing problems.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Jim. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening, council members. My name is Virginia's Art and I'm a founding member of the Long Beach Human Trafficking Task Force. And as we were talking about the motels and as vice mayor, you were talking about their location and such.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I remember before knowing anything about human trafficking, so many times you would ride down a street and you'd see a hotel, and in your mind you're thinking, this is kind of a strange place for a motel to be.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's not like it's in the center of anything, any kind of tourist area or anything like that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I often.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Wondered, how do these businesses stay in business? And then once I learned about human trafficking, it kind of raised a red flag for me that as you see these motels, they are actually used for exploitation for for the young for the young children, for men and women as well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I don't want to insinuate that exploitation only happens in these motels. It doesn't it can really happen anywhere. But what is so hard to take is that it happens here in our own city. And as you hear the residents who live in the neighborhoods of these hotels and motels where all the crime is happening and all'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the calls for service, the numbers that you shared earlier were just outstanding. And to know that that happens in our city, just. Breaks my heart in so many ways and so many of our task force members are here to support.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we've been working on this issue for six years now and Long Beach, and we're here and we're ready to support you, and we appreciate you bringing this forward. I also wanted to.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Comment that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'One of our partners here was in court today with three young women who had actually been trafficked through motels. So it does happen in these motels. So thank you so much. I appreciate you bringing this forward.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much for having this discussion. My name is Patrick Erlandson and I work at the Long Beach Human Trafficking Task Force for a number of years on the prevention side of this issue. I'm also the head of the men's standing against trafficking, which you've heard about.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I'm also an English teacher and the father of two daughters, one of whom was approached by a recruiter for human trafficking when she was in high school. I really want to applaud Vice Mayor Richardson for bringing this in, his consistency and really and really caring about this issue and bringing this to the forefront in the community'",
        "'speaker_1': ', and especially for bringing this this forward. I think we can't arrest our way out of this problem. It's it's too big. And it requires the community to stand. It requires legislation and it requires law enforcement. I think we've been doing as men standing, it's trafficking.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We take these signs and we take over an intersection once a month, the third Friday of each month, and demonstrate to to the victims of human trafficking that not all men are customers, that we care about them, that there's a better life for them.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We stand to demonstrate to the men who are on their way to buy someone's body that there's something better, that actually this is life or death. This is actually not a victimless crime that Lynette Washington paid the price with her life in one of those hotels.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think that we want to also send a message to the traffickers that they're seen and that this is not acceptable in our communities. We've been doing this at different intersections for over two years. We've been taking a stand.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And when we moved to Victoria Street in Long Beach Boulevard, the response from the community was so profound, so strong and so wholehearted that it was just really it was such a moving experience. We had so many people turn out.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Many of the people that are here today, people hug, people, stop it, grab signs from us. And they wanted to stand with us because they love their community. And I think what this proposal really means and what what Vice Mayor Richardson is proposing here, as well as the other council members, is that there's a vacuum, and that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'vacuum is being filled by pimps and traffickers. There are empty beds and those empty beds are being filled by somebody daughter, by somebody who's been victimized, by someone who's being exploited for someone else, for some slave master to make their money.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think this vacuum, what this proposal does is it takes that vacuum there, takes the people the people who love their community. It takes their love for their community, their homes and their children. And it stuffs that vacuum and closes it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think this is really critical and really important that the community really stands, stands up and supports this proposal. One of the thing, as a teacher, kids always have these cute ways of texting their messages and things that are important to them, whether it's lol, which everyone knows.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But there's one FOMO. I don't know if you remember that FOMO, but some kids use that and it's a fear of missing out. And it really struck me that that's really appropriate for this right now, that we should be afraid of missing out on the opportunity to do something about this problem that's gone on for years.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think waiting 30 more days, how many how many more mornings do people have to wake up and find condoms in there? Thank you, sir. I mean, we're at one time. This is this is a chance for.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The most vulnerable. Thank you. Nice to be with you.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. My name is Alfred Hayes Senior. I'm the I live in North Long.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Beach, right next door to the Luxury Inn. And I had moved out two years ago to housing.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Use my home for homeless women and children.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I did that for two years and I spent my own money to help them.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Get off the street. A couple of them went back to the street, but most of them got their life together and they went on to become productive members of the community. I moved back.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'January of 2016, but ever since I've moved.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Back, I realized that my this area has.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Gotten worse.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Than when I had moved out. I've found people on top of my roof.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Two nights ago, a guy was sitting in my yard, peering into my 13 year old girl's bedroom. It was a blessing to see them come.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'On the corner and try to to bring bring interest to this problem that's getting continuously worse. It has dragged the community down to total drug deals. My bills, my cars.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'My remote control have been hijacked. I've been I've been out watching my cars. They locked my car. They open my car. They put trackers on my. My vehicles. They broke in my house, put listening devices in my home.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I'm afraid that sometimes they hear me and my wife of 32 years and our most intimate moments.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Do you really realize what's really happening here?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This place.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'North Long Beach, the coolest part district has gone to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The docks. It has gone to the dogs. And I live there. I experience it. If you don't live there and have not experienced it, I'm telling you what has happened. Trackers on my car, listening devices in my home.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They park in front of my home every day to walk around to the hotel to buy drugs. So I know I see it and I'm fed up with it. I was just on the verge of calling the FBI to make a report with them before I sing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank God, Rex, you know, do what they did on the corner. And I went out there and I held the sign with him. So just just to let you know.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm really fed up with it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I put my life on the line to serve this country. I volunteered willingly to die for this country if need be. So I'm asking this city to stand up, to do something now for me. Give back to someone who put their life on the line for this country.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Now, I have two children, twins. Now that's two. Just turned 13. My daughter. Two months ago in Lawrence, Kansas, we have the fastest time in the 400 meter, which was a 5712 in a 12 year old group. I'm trying to raise my children to be decent children in the city of Long Beach to bring a good life'",
        "'speaker_1': 'to this city.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So, please, if you can do anything.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Please don't wait 30 days.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It's been too long. It's been years.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But my name's Matt Houston. I just mentioned short term and long, long term solutions. But something that occurred to me is also a holistic approach that's important. Being from different parts of the country. Notice things are a little bit different here in L.A. County.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'One of the things that I've noticed is a lack of public restrooms. So one of the things that I've been trying to work on is an idea for for creating a company that all day that say all we do is as public restrooms and, you know, some of them self-cleaning, but then have access to Lifeline phones right'",
        "'speaker_1': 'there and maybe have some Lifeline phones with the apps built in right into it, right inside the hotels, you know, maybe have some, you know, touch screens, maybe figure out a way to use grant money to make sure that those are there.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So people always have access, you know, find some people who have gotten out of the sex trade industry and maybe have them come together, create a nonprofit, private organization that creates a secure webcam, you know, for for girls that that want to do that stuff on online and make money whatever but not but do it in a'",
        "'speaker_1': 'safe way at least if that's if that's the way that's going to go, you know. And I mean, because people do that and a lot of a lot of sex trafficking ends up there, you know, and it ends up that, you know, people are sitting there watching and paying money online for people they don't realize are sex'",
        "'speaker_1': ', sex slaves, stuff like that. So I think it's important to have security in those things as well. So the stick approach is important, but a care approach is important as well. So job placement opportunity, vocational aptitude test, maybe having one of the ideas I'm trying to toss around is having a separate kind of command structure for the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'sheriff's department. If I get if I get elected there and have a separate one with different leadership and have people that can volunteer one side or the other, but it's not so much aggressive enforcement, but, you know, completely different, you know, kind of like the Peace Corps versus Marine Corps type of thing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So you have you know, you can have some officers with crossover, but the leadership is different. And then you it opens up opportunities to be able to reach people that wouldn't come up to you in another capacity with a gun on the hip kind of thing, you know.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And it creates, you know, if you have a sex slave in a pimp situation and then you have a different code and this command structure, then that might create some opportunities that aren't available right now. Also creating increasing communication, creating a special cable channel, marketing apps, outreach to the periphery of crime.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Try to reach all the people that you can. Scholarships for new ideas reached out to the schools. How can we solve this from inside of schools? Different visa programs, you know, disrupt the, you know, the the networks of of the traffickers and that sort of thing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And even, you know, reach people on the periphery of that and pull them in and do some more on honest run work. And I just recommend against too much of a fortress mentality, some carrot, some stick, but in the right balance.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Houston. Next speaker, please. Good evening, Mr. Garcia. Vice Mayor Richardson. Council members. My name's Cam Patel. I'm here to represent my family. We owned the property at 1657. Atlantic Avenue. Was on the list settling in in the ninth District.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have had that property for about 30 years now. We've never had any accusations that we were a nuisance to the community we like. My management often attends the Uptown Business meetings, which is right across the street. We got a letter in November from the city staff pretty much blindsided by it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You know, we right away turned around and worked with Carl Wegman in the planning department with the city to address some of the concerns he had. We met with a Long Beach PD right away as well. I emailed him the next day that we got the letter and also gave him a few phone calls.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we want to work with the city, but also there needs to be a little bit more dialog. We felt like we just got this call called our in our hands and we were actually we haven't even seen a call log, so just a little bit of dialog going on.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Giving us the opportunity to have a seat at the table is is a definitely a good thing and I just look forward to working with the city and the community. You know, we work with DPS to help people find a place to stay in between homes or even homeless people.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So sometimes that give us a situation where some people have some mental health issues that can also cause an increase in call log activity. So to be sensitive to those things as well, I think is you need to have opening to an open mind as well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So thank you very much next week.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening, City Council.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'My name is Dr..'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Johnny Rex O.D. and I'm a member. I'm actually vice president.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Of the Forth Park Neighborhood Association, which is actually just across the river from the Coolidge Triangle and along with neighborhood associations that are most affected by the issue with human trafficking. And I'm in complete support of this agenda tonight.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Agenda item tonight. We currently have an unacceptable situation occurring among many of the motels in my community along these boulevard. We have had several we have several daycares and two schools in the in the vicinity where our children are subject is not only see this activity back to be accosted and propositioned by traffickers, which is absolutely egregious'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and the situation has been allowed to fester for too long. So I implore the city to take the situation seriously and take the issue of crafting this ordinance seriously for the sake of the men, women and children being exploited every day in the community, face to force to have to endure it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Let us no longer be complicit by turning a blind eye to one of our most pressing modern day social ills. And with that, I say thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Hello. Good evening again. Good evening, Mayor Garcia and our councilwoman strikes again. I have lived in North Long Beach for the past three years and again, we've been having problems. Oh, my. Not not until I think about two years.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'From that point on, we've been complaining to the police because we have a neighborhood watch, neighborhood association meetings. And the police, they always tell us, okay, when I should please call and report them. I've been doing that for months and months and months in a year, right where I live, we got to 2 to 3 schools.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And again, parents are afraid to even enroll their children in there because they see all these prostitutes I'm sorry, all these people with very I could say the way they dress so provocative. And again, some of these kids that are walk to Colin Powers, they used to be walking in the mornings about two years about himself, but'",
        "'speaker_7': 'now they're accompanied by their parents because they're afraid of especially young girls showing young kids. They're afraid to leave them alone because, again, a well, they see the activity, they see the crime in the area. So again, when these gentlemen are saying that give us 30 days, we never heard about it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I'm sorry, sir, but we never saw you there before. All of a sudden you're here because again, we're here. But we peaceful are newsletters once a month from the neighborhood association informing everybody about the crime in the area.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'These people never come to the meetings. There never were. We never have seen them coming to the meetings. We never have seen them. They don't even approach us to to see if they can improve the community. So there's the reason I'm here.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So please, please. When you help.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Thank you so much. Thanks, speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Hi. My name is Ron at Mesa. I'm with the Hamilton Neighborhood Association. I'm a managing board member. Honorable Mayor Council members. Rex, I really I just want to thank you for.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, bringing this to the attention and the awareness that you've brought.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I had the honor of.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Being at a demonstration.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Last Friday with a number of.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'People here, men against sex trafficking. And there was a.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Lot of community support, people giving.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Us the thumbs up and honking. But there's also pimps that came.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Out and threatened us and we had to cut our demonstration short. So that showed me and I guess I didn't.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Understand that this problem is going on because I live in a in a couple.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Of neighborhoods over. I do find used condoms and things on our streets. But I didn't.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Realize that pimps.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Would come out and threaten us and scare everybody off.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I hope we do it again really soon. But I would have.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'To ask you guys as a group to ask the hotel owners that are saying they had.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'No idea this was going.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'On. Where are they? They have bad employees that aren't reporting.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'All these police, all this police activity, illegal activity that are going on in their.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hotels. They don't live around here.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Because it's obvious what's happening. If you drive up and down the street or you live in the area.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Or they just don't care or they're profiting from it. Yeah. And if they're profiting from it, so is.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The hotel alliance that came out and spoke.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Because I'm sure they're paying money to be in this group. And I just have to say, I didn't.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Got very educated since Friday. I didn't know there was 14 year olds out there. I didn't know that 98% of these people in servitude were basically slaves.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They have guns held to their head. They're scared. They can't get out of this situation. And these hotel owners are giving them a place to.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Perpetuate these crimes. So thank you again for bringing this to the attention of everybody, Vice Mayor And thank you for the protection you're offering these young ladies and young men that are in these situations. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening. Council member and mayor council members and Mayor Robert Garcia. My name is Renee Wheels and I'm a resident of the ninth District. I stand before you as an advocate for my community and a support for this motel ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And thank you, Rex. I really appreciate this. And you took my 3 minutes, so I'm going to get this short. I just really.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Want you guys to understand that between Long Beach Boulevard, between the 17 and new one, it's only a thousand steps for these children to take every day to go to school and come go home.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Every day. It's a thousand steps.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They are walking. They see the women.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And the pimps waiting. So just.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Imagine. Just take a moment for you guys, council members to take take a moment in your life when you're a.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Child and you have this fear, these feelings of being uncomfortable and just the fear.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Which is imagine you're a fifth grade student coming from Colin Powell walking down Amish Boulevard and he see a woman. What kind of feeling are they feeling now? They see a man standing by, just watching. What kind of feeling are they feeling?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Then they have.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Another time where they're walking and they're standing. There's a man following.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Them home.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And whispering in their ears.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This has been done, as has happened to our students in Colin Powell.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So please. This time's up on.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Human trafficking and prostitution. But how many other how many more names do you want to add to hashtag MeToo?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'How many more names.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So please support this ordinance. And thank you, Rex.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much. Next speaker, please. And we have our last four speakers and they were closing our actual you'll be the last five speakers and the speakers list is closed. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening, mayor, vice mayor and council members. My name is Clyde ASADA. I'm a member of the ninth district lifetime member. And this has been something that has just waited too long. How do I know? Because when I was a child, I was that child that Renee spoke.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I was a child in the Longwood neighborhood. And that is exactly the experiences that that I, I encountered. I'm an adult now, and I see it. It continues. 30 years later, nothing has changed or very little has changed.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If anything, it's getting worse. I remember when the luxury and was built as the Days, Days Inn Motel or Days Inn Inn Suites and you know, it was really shiny, pretty and new. And at that time we had we would have, you know, quinceaneras, weddings, whatever.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And none of my family was going to stay there. Nobody was going to support these businesses as hotels are motels because we knew exactly what kind of activity was going on there. Now we have, you know, freshly painted luxury end, but it's still the same thing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You put a lipstick on a pig. It's still a pig. So what we want to do is change the the policy change, change the use of it. What we need are restaurants, coffee shops, banks that is reflective of the neighborhoods that are immediately surrounding that strip.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The Coolidge neighborhood in the Longwood neighborhood are not reflected by what is on the street. The businesses that are there do not reflect our interests. They reflect their pocketbook interests. So thank you for the time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. That's bigger council members. My name is Peter McBride. I've been part of an organization that rescues girls that are being sex trafficked. Somebody said something about Snoop Dogg. I'd like to point out that he was a pimp.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'These pimps are taking these girls. They're they raped them several times. They beat them daily. That's that's just the beginning of what they do to these women. I could go into deep detail, which is not part of what's going on today, but this is the violence that's going on.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we all know that violence breeds violence. I pointed out I was at the stand over at East Croydon Street and Long Beach Boulevard Boulevard. And I was pointing out to the people, because I've been involved with the rescues.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The extent of security that goes on there. I was pointing out how the security was walking around the different levels, how the security of the pimps, men were driving around. If you if you own that place or you work at that place and you can't see that type of security, then something's going on.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You're missing out. Oh.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'For the police officers.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Long Beach is setting the standard for handling human trafficking. They're setting the standards. So somebody is saying something about the police force here in Long Beach. You need to take a step back and regroup. And the problem that they're having with these hotels really needs to something needs to happen with the hotel.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm not from Long Beach, but I've been down here with men stand against trafficking and you have a problem. And I appreciate what you're trying to do with that. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Next speaker, the last three speakers.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hi, I'm Juanita Parrish. I'm a member of the Coolidge Triangle Neighborhood Association. I've met a lot of you. I was I had an opportunity to meet our mayor and of course, our vice mayor, Rex Richardson is my councilman.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'What I'd like to say, there are three things I'd like to address. One is every month we have our neighborhood association meeting. Every month we complain to the police department. We've had our chief of police come to our meetings, we've had our commander come to our meetings, we've had vice come to our meetings.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we've we regularly have officers come to our meeting. They give us updates. They're not the problem. The problem is the system. And we're trying to correct that system now and we're asking for your help. We can we can take a reactive approach to everything.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Every time something happens, we react. But tonight we have an opportunity to take a proactive approach to something. All of you have an opportunity to take a proactive approach. And like the gentleman said, we become we become the the everyone looks to us as the example, just an example of set.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I understand those three gentlemen from the motels. If tonight we were voting on something, it was becoming ironclad. They would have a right to say 30 days, but they don't have a right to say 30 days. All they want us to do is to put it on the back burner so that we have to come and try'",
        "'speaker_4': 'again. We're not making something ironclad. What we're saying is, after the pilot program, let's explore this, let's explore this. Let's change the laws. If they're not working, we've got to change them. So all we're asking you to do is to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Support.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This program.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Thank you very much. Next week, speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I remember.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Distinguished counsel. Thank you. My name's Dave San Jose. I was born in Long Beach Area Community Hospital in 1940. So I've seen the good, the bad, and I guess I'm seeing the ugly.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The house. I live in North Long Beach. I've been there 40 years. I really love my home, I love my neighbors. I got some great neighbors and they all feel the same way about our community. I ran a youth center for 18 years as a volunteer in this city and probably for at least 15 of those years'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I had kids. Tell me about the motel, the luxury. They told me all the things went on in there and I had to deal with gang members. Your average everyday kid, boys and girls. I couldn't believe the stories they told me.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I found them all come true.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And the situation that's happening now, it's I just heard the other day is this teacher is going to teach a class. About how to walk home safely.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm Colin Powell.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In middle school. God, I never had a class like that when I was a kid. I mean, how many your kids have to do that? But these kids really have to do that because they walk by and through this situation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's really gotten there. But you've heard all the horror stories. These are stories made up by this guy or that guy. This guy is their one day, get in your car and drive down lobby. Well, bar during these hours.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I got a guy that goes to work at 4:00 in the morning and he sees trucker stop and pick up girls. They're. Another neighbor told me somebody else died in the hotel there somehow or another the other day they put flowers and candles there.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We don't even know all the things that happened in there. There's always asking is, there's nine of you. Every one of you should pass this bill. There should be nine councilman here. I guess the mayor can't. Nobody should vote for two.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But then when do people leave the city? Because you're only going to be here four years. Five years, whatever it happens to be. Are you going to leave the city better than you found it? Now you have an opportunity to do that because what these people are saying, what these people are feeling is real.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Last week, 17 people got shot in Miami. Uh huh. Things like that are happening. This is real. We live in different times. We need to do something about it. You need to do it now. And don't worry. The kids are going to be alive for a while because they're taking a class.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'How to walk home. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. And our last speaker.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is a.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And council member.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'My name is Yogesh Patel. I own.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Colonial motels, which is one of the listed property.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I've been running the place for 37 years. I repeat 37 years. When I came to Long Beach in 1981.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And only eighties, police used to do sting rings. Last 15 years. There is no such thing as ten years because the.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hostages are gone. Most of the complaint we heard from people on northside, i suggested you guys host September Stinger. These are the other thing. If you want to stop oh, stop renting rooms to people who don't have a place to go, where would they go?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Do you want to have people living in huts, you know, Cambodia on.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Pacific Coast Highway like we have in downtown Long Beach under a bed. So this is all we have to make.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And as far as this clothes are concerned, I believe in the motels have a private security. We have private security. So I don't know where all these calls come from. If there a noise tick issue.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'If the.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Boyfriend and girlfriend.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Fight the call, the police.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Are you going to hold us responsible for that?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You know?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If you think that's right? I don't think that's right. Also, we have a contract with the city. We work with the city to house the veterans. We are contracted mental health association. We work to help them. Now, if we did exist, where would these people go?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's our obligation to all walks of life to work together. And I'm urging you guys to come to the table and find a solution.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Fix the problem rather than just building without, you know, getting what's real inside. So we are asking you to sit down and talk it out and solve the problem, not create more problems. Thank you. Thank you. That concludes public comment.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Appreciate that. I want to go ahead and go back. We're going to go back to the council, have a couple a couple comments, and then I'm going to turn it back to the makers of the motion. First, I want to just thank everyone that came out.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think that particularly for the neighbors that came out, I know how important of an issue this is to all of you. I know how important this issue is to Vice Mayor Richardson. I think we spent about 15, 20 minutes this last weekend over a beverage talking about this very issue and how important this is to him'",
        "'speaker_1': 'to get this done for the community. For those that aren't familiar with the neighborhood. I think some someone said it earlier that the neighborhoods have it's a community of homeowners that whose community and homes are really beautiful and the neighborhood has well certainly has needs is a great collection of property owners that are working to improve their'",
        "'speaker_1': 'greater area. And so to say that one major boulevard isn't a good reflection of Coolidge or of the neighborhood is true. It isn't a good reflection. And I think that Long Beach Boulevard could be well, hopefully one day rise to the level of where the actual neighborhoods are.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think that's I think obviously a lot of the interest. I think it's important. You know, I appreciate that the owners of the of the motels that are here, I do think that data is important. And I think when data is presented by the police department, those are facts.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think that we have to look at data and understand that the data is telling us something. And when calls are being made, it is the responsibility of the property owner, sir, to ensure that those issues are being mitigated.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Now I want to ensure I want to make sure that as we move forward on this, I appreciate the vice mayor wanting to work and bring everyone to the table. I think that's responsible and obviously it's very appropriate.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I will say that I completely support the motion in front of us today and the and I know that we will adopt this tonight. I also want to just make sure, Mr. City Manager, that one thing was brought up tonight that was of interest to me is if if we are and if the city I understand'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that the city has a serious issue with homelessness. That is a statewide crisis, and I appreciate that. But I also want to ensure that when we work with property owners or motels or others in a partnership to house, that this is that looking at those contracts is part of this motion.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If the vice mayor is is open to that because I'm I am not okay with regardless of who they are whether they're someone that's homeless or someone with a mental illness or a veteran. I want to ensure that we're also in there being placed in locations that are also safe and that are.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That are appropriate.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'For for them. And so if the vice mayor's okay, if we can take take a look at the contracts and I'd be interested in any information back as to what what motels do we actually are under contract for for these services.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And if they where they are and if they're actually on these lists and that would be just something for us, I think, to explore it as well. And and I will say also that what's impressive to me about this agenda item, besides all the work that went into it, which I know that the District 19 did, is'",
        "'speaker_1': 'there is actually the the the liquor store ordinance has had really great success. And it's really impressive to me that and listen, there's still a lot of bad liquor stores and particularly in the area where we first looked at the issue in the north.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But there has been some real success stories out of that ordinance as well. And so I have a lot of hope for this. I would encourage staff to be very serious about the amortization program. I mean, that has worked in a lot of places.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Now that we don't have redevelopment, think we need to be serious. I know there are legal hurdles and I think we need to be responsible about that as as a as a as a city. But I think that that should be looked at very seriously.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we should absolutely put in place an ordinance that looks at everything listed here. And and as we look at that and as a community engages if it needs to go beyond that and and look at ensuring that we have appropriate standards there for those that are also working there, that is within this council's preview purview as'",
        "'speaker_1': 'well. So I support this vice mayor, but most importantly to the community, you guys are doing a great job looking out for your neighborhood and for the city of Long Beach. So thank you and. And with that, we take it back to Councilmember Pearce and then Vice Mayor Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mayor. And I definitely was going to follow up on many of the points that that the mayor made. I wanted to ask a couple of questions of staff. When police calls. Calls to service are done for these locations.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'How are the owners of these locations notified? And I know our police chief is not here, but I was wondering if anybody could answer that question.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Will communicate that to the police department and get back to you as soon as possible.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So it would be my request that as part of this program that the owners of any location where there are police calls, particularly hotels or motels that were I were mailing them a notification or reaching out to them.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's I could understand if an owner is not there operating it every day, their employees are dealing with it. Maybe there's a gap. Let's make sure there's not an excuse for saying that they didn't know these calls were being made.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so I would hope to see that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Understood.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'My other comment is in regards to, you know, the fact that we do use vouchers for some of these places and we do have standards in our continuum of care that might not be reflected in the contracts that we have with our health department.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so I'm curious, I know that we've been doing work for about a year on trauma informed care, and I know that we're about to do even more work on that and making sure that any location where we have a contract that might be out of the norm, that there be some part of trauma informed care or'",
        "'speaker_5': 'not trauma informed care, but trauma informed lens that not only would they be able to identify human trafficking, but also if it was a boyfriend and girlfriend that were having a fight. What's the best way to deal with that?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'How do you reach out to PD and not assuming that everybody that works in one of these motels might know best practices, but that if we are having a contract with them, we need to make sure that that's the bare minimum that we're doing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We'll make sure we engage health department in that. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. And then just recap one more time and making sure that the, you know, exploring transitional housing options after amortization in funds with the county is included as well. So thank you and thank you, everybody, for your passion and your commitment.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I definitely got goosebumps a few times while you guys were talking and it hits home. And that's not often that we have a council meeting with something that could be so visceral. If you actually, while we're talking logistics about a program, knowing that this ruins lives not only for the individuals that are being trafficked, for those dealing'",
        "'speaker_5': 'with them, for their family that miss them. And so thank you so very much for caring and thank you so much to this council for taking the leadership.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. So, first of all, Mayor, I want to thank you for your strong support on this item. I think that message came across really clearly, all the council members who spoke. Thank you so much for those comments.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I just want to just acknowledge a few things. So, first of all, thanks for having the courage to share your stories. A lot of people may not believe believe some of that stuff, but the truth is, you were being modest.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You were being very modest. I was there Friday when someone said a pimp rolled up and threatened us. I was there. Right. I think I think if people did see that experience or see what you're dealing with, I think we would have a lot more support publicly around this issue.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This is a you know, I have to say this. You know, there's been a lot of meetings organizing. I have to acknowledge that you, the neighbors, we've done maybe five meetings in the last few months, specifically on this issue, in addition to the neighborhood association meetings that meet monthly.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So this is this is sort of community empowerment. And it's best you stepped up, made this issue a priority. City Council acknowledges it. Right. We're going to cast a vote and set ourselves on course to hopefully fix this issue because frankly is fixable.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It is fixed, but we can't fix every we can be on the right side of the human trafficking argument. We can't fix human trafficking forever and everywhere in the short term, but we can't fix Long Beach Boulevard. We know where they're rooted and the data justifies it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I just want to want to want to acknowledge that to the city council. I want to thank you for your indulgence. You know, sometimes there are issues that mean, you know, I have no doubt that the city council acknowledges and values.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'When a resident steps up and says, this is important, we do it all the time. When issues come up, I may not be able to personally commit to it or understand it, but I take a step back because I know that that's 100% true to that council member in their district and it's 100% true to the people'",
        "'speaker_6': 'that are there. So thank you for that indulgence. These are the moments that these residents are never going to forget. When the city council listened to them and heard them out because they felt ignored for a long time.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So whether you hear me or not, I acknowledge I acknowledge you guys indulging. And I really thank you for that. So the final thing I say is, you know, I have no doubt that we're going to get where we need to get to.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We have to remain vigilant, continue to have meetings. But I have no doubt that there is light at the end of the tunnel on this issue. There are policy changes that can make a difference. So thank you all again and again.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Encourage City Council support.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. With and with that, there's a there's a motion and a second. Please cast your votes.'",

    "Recommendation to receive and file a report on Park Equity in the City of Long Beach.  (Citywide)": [
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Thank you all for. Thank you all for coming out. Thank you. We we will go back to the item on on parks and so per the the other motion. Thank you, guys. Thank you, Dave. Yeah. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. Thank you, guys all. So we will go ahead and go back to, I believe it was item C 21. No, I'm sorry. Yes, that item. I just lost it. Madam Court, can you read the item?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Item 37 Report from Parks and Recreation and Marine Recommendations to receive and five Report on Park Equity in the city of Long Beach Citywide.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Thank you. I think we've we've had folks have discussed the item. So we are going to hear a staff report. Mr. West. Maybe that maybe not the 30 minute version one, but somewhere in between, I think. But we do want a staff report.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I know you guys worked hard on this, so. Mr. West, merry night.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So thank you, Mayor, and members of the council. We will try and get through this as fast as possible. And I apologize if some of the information is disjointed as we're going to skip around a little bit. Before I start, I do want to thank the members of the team that have stayed, the members of our commission'",
        "'speaker_5': 'that have stayed because they did put a lot of work into this item. And I really appreciate it, especially those who are woken up at the middle of the night to open a shelter for victims of a motel fire, a long term living motel fire in the middle of the night.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So the staff is very tired and I appreciate them staying tonight. We're here to have the opportunity to present an overview of what we do. There was a report that was given on July 18th of last year that included a focus on one area of our programing tonight.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'As we began to gather the data needed to respond to the many questions and requests made that evening, it became very apparent that before a plan is to be proposed, it is critical that we first provide information that tells the entire story.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Then you as a policy body can decide if change is needed. If so, what direction you would like to see that change take place and what kind of a plan you would like to be brought back based on the information provided tonight?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There were a number of requests made on July 18th, and I recognize that our report that responded to each and every one of those requests also begs more questions before a final plan can take place. So our task was to respond to the requests that were posed, to look at the big picture research.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Other agencies looking through an equity lens. Compare our current programing. And I believe the report that we submitted answered all those questions. That report also included input from four of our committees that from the Parks and Recreation Commission.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We'll touch very briefly on Park Equity and what that actually means. And according to the National Recreation and Parks Association, it's ensuring all people have access to the benefits of local parks and recreation, no matter the color of their skin, age, income level or ability, and have access to programs, facilities, places and spaces that make their lives'",
        "'speaker_5': 'and communities great. Although equity is different from equality, both aim to promote fairness and justice. But equality only works when everyone is starting at the same point and needs the same things to succeed. And as we know, that's not the case in our very diverse community.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So before we can establish where we are offering programs, it's important to look at a baseline of needs. So the map that you see is our 2017 Social Needs Socio Needs Index shown here as an aggregate of six indicators at the zip code level, which include poverty, income, unemployment, occupation, education and language.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The darker the color, the greater the need for services. And it could also be said that those areas are also areas in our community where there's a lower ability potentially to pay for programs and services and where transportation and access may be a barrier.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Throughout this presentation, then we will look at our programing and its distribution to those areas of highest need. The south, southwest, central and northern areas of Long Beach, as we've talked about, the majority of our programing falls into two categories free and fee based.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The July 18th Report only addressed our fee based programs, which is largely our contract classes. It did not include any information on free programing, which is the vast majority of what we do and where the city's financial investment is placed.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'These contract classes are essentially individuals and small business operators utilizing our parks and facilities to offer programs and services to the community in lieu of operating a brick and mortar shop. So tonight, we're going to focus on those two programs.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'First, a little bit, though, about what we do. This last year, we served close to 1.4 million individuals in our programs and services. We offer a large variety of and a robust array of programs and services. From youth sports to afterschool, adult sports and enrichment for seniors.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We take care of basic needs, such as our free summer lunch program, our year round meals for seniors, after school care during the most vulnerable time for children. Our enrichment activities and sports at home promote health excuse me, healthy lifestyles.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So here are the free programs that we offer. Many of these are year round. A comment was made earlier that we only program three months of the year and that is actually incorrect. Our adaptive program is year round.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We have afterschool programs, we have free aquatic programing that is running year round. We have our senior programs, year round. Teen programs are sites that are enrichment afterschool programs and our youth sports sets year round. These are not just drop in sites, but they are heavily programed activity sites.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We have homework help, field trips, arts, music, dance enrichment and fitness programs for our youth. Our seniors have mobility and fitness programs, music, dance and arts, cultural arts, safety workshops, meals, financial assistance workshops, social clubs. Our teens get life skills, job readiness and mentorship programs just to name a few things.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'As we look at our free programs, part of the story that needs to be told is the locations where we have available for these programs. Our neighborhood, community and regional centers are the main fixed assets that we have at our disposal for programing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And as you'll see, there is not necessarily an even distribution of these assets. And as a city that is greatly developed without a funding stream for either construction or operation of new facilities, this is one factor that directs our program locations.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'One note that is important to make is that we have five regional centers that host a variety of activities. We also have one senior center which is focused solely on senior programing during the daytime hours. Some of these specialty facilities we also have in our community, in addition to the senior center, is our nature center, our homeland'",
        "'speaker_5': 'cultural center. And. And like without the specialty facilities, though, our distribution of fixed assets square footage is shown in the graph above. 64% of our facility space is in the southwest, west, central and northern areas of our city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Those same areas that have been identified by multiple studies and plans in our city as areas of need. For this report, there are four facilities located in Council District four. Two of those are included in what we call the central part of the city and the other two in the east part.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In addition to our city owned and operated facilities, we also work very closely with the Long Beach School District and offer many programs in their facilities as well as local churches in the community. We've made a concerted effort to be creative, especially in areas where we are lacking our own facilities, to use other options and expand our'",
        "'speaker_5': 'abilities to serve the community. This is a breakdown of where we offer our free programing. Recall that we have about 64% of our facility space in the southwest, west, central and northern areas of the city. And we also have close to 65% of our free programing in those same areas.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We also need to be sure to tell the whole story. We have many more recreational assets in our city besides community centers. And although these assets and amenities are often only located in one area of the city, they serve all of our residents.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We have our beaches, bays, lagoons, marinas that offer unlimited hours of free recreational opportunities. And as mentioned earlier, our homeland cultural center that offers both free and fee based programs from cultural arts and performance activities to classes and events that celebrate our diverse community.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Our nature center is also a beautiful oasis in a large urban setting that allows our residents to get away and unplug and connect with nature for free all together. In 2017, Primm offered over 111000 hours of free programing to our community.'",
        "'speaker_5': '65% of the hours of free programing were offered in the southwest, west, central and northern areas of the city, as those areas have the highest need for those services. In 2017, over $6 million of the general fund was invested in our preview, sorry, in our free programing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And that is the breakdown by Council District. So last year, 75% of our general fund resources on free program were spent in the southwest, west, central and northern areas of the city. So as you can see, the facility assets that we have directly correlate to our ability to offer programs and services and line up with our investments'",
        "'speaker_5': 'and hours of free programs. Skip a few slides. Here's a map of where our. Facilities. Our community centers and our regional sites are located. As we were asked on July 18th to overlay our programing with some of the current programs or plans we have the West, Liverpool, West, Long Beach plan, the downtown pedestrian masterplan and the six'",
        "'speaker_5': 'three plan. And again, if we overlay with the 2017 Social Needs Index, which again is income, population, health issues and other social indicators of need, you can see again that we're leveraging the city's resources greatly in the areas that are of need.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we're gonna look at our fee based programs, which is our contract classes, individuals and small business operators, and 51% of them are Long Beach residents. As with any business, they are driven by supply and demand. The operators want to operate where there's a demand and customers who will pay for their services, not unlike any brick and'",
        "'speaker_5': 'mortar business. A little bit of history and background during the 2007 and oh eight economic downturn, as well as the budget reductions of 2011 and 2012. A lot of our programing was discontinued and we regionalized some of our free programing so that we would have an economy of scale.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Our regional centers have multiple rooms, and so it takes less staff to operate those facilities and we can get more activities in those facilities. As we looked to economize and move through a concerted effort, our programs and services to the areas of most need.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We also looked at then how do we supply recreational opportunities throughout the city? A concerted effort at that time was made to offer additional contract classes in the east and southeast portion of the city so that there were recreational opportunities throughout the city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Oftentimes then we use the facilities for our contract classes where we do not have free programing because in the majority of our regional centers, the hours are taken up by free programing and we do not want to eliminate those programs.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Here's just one comparison. During the July 18th Report, a comparison was made between fee based programing offered at the Small College Estates Park and Council District three and the large regional community center in Council District one. As was accurately pointed out, there were 50 hours of a week of fee based programs offered at colleges, states and none'",
        "'speaker_5': 'at Cesar Chavez. However, if we look at the free programing at those sites in 2017, there were only 810 hours of free programs at colleges, states and almost 4000 hours of free programing at Cesar Chavez. So when we look at the opportunities of the future to bring more fee based programs or contract classes to some of our'",
        "'speaker_5': 'regional sites, opportunities would generally be in the evenings or weekends as the weekday time periods are often filled with our free programing. The July 18th report asks that we and the Commission take a deeper look at leveraging our limited city resources and community assets so that we obtain a fair and equitable system that guarantees every resident the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'same opportunity to thrive regardless of zip code. As you'll see, our general fund investment for free programing, which is concentrated in our highest areas of needs, is almost 17 times what we devote to our fee based programs. The city's resources towards fee programs includes 65 full time and 661 part time staff supplies, marketing and program related costs'",
        "'speaker_5': '. And this does not even include the substantial investment to clean and maintain these facilities. On the other hand, the investment towards fee based contract class programs covers the costs for one and a half dedicated staff and the printing and mailing of the Recreation Connection brochure and the $294,000 cost is completely offset by revenue.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We were also asked to look at the capital investment by districts. So we looked at the last five years of major capital investment, and this includes facility upgrades, refurbishments, playgrounds, sports fields, enhancements and investments to the ranchos. And 70, 70% of that CHP investment has been in the southwest, west, central and northern areas of the city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This does not include Tidelands investments because Tidelands are restricted and can't be used throughout the city. However, most of the Tidelands funds go towards our specialty areas such as the beaches, Pier's Marinas, Lagoons, harbors and seawalls. And very little of tidelands goes towards park and park facilities.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'A lot of discussion centered around the way we activate our parks. So in addition to what PRM does, we have many community organizations and residents who pull permits on an annual basis each week to activate our parks. Last year, over 2200 permits were pulled for different types of activities.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In addition, we continue to work with our community and our organic community based organizations, and we have over 100 current partnerships that also positively activate our parks. Last year alone, our youth sports organizations activated our parks over 142000 hours with positive play activities and opportunities from youth from all over the city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We do want to activate our parks. And as such, we work with our commission, and our commission has a fee waiver process that is an incentive for community based organizations to utilize our parks. The City Council has given the authority to review, set and waive park fees to the Parks and Recreation Commission.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Last year, 70 requests for fee waivers were received and only 12 were denied. Those 12 were denied because they were unable to provide an access to the Long Beach community. There are several. Also, we were asked to look at the use of underutilized parks by waiving all or a significant portion of fees for community programing and events'",
        "'speaker_5': '. The Commission felt very strongly that there really isn't a definition for underutilized parks that they could apply to the fee waiver process. There are several categories of parks within our system, some sort of large bordered geographic, broader geographic areas by design.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Others are active with sports fields and facilities and restrooms and have parking, while some parks are meant to be passive and serve just the immediate neighborhood needs. So accordingly, our parks are utilized and activated in different ways. And as such, the Commission did not feel that there would be a logical way to make the determination of what'",
        "'speaker_5': 'would constitute an underutilized or low programed park. Taking a deeper dove. Deeper dove, though, into the question of fee based programing, which is one component of what we do. And again, these are generally small businesses, and the instructors often desire locations where there is an ability to pay PR and does recognize that there's a desire to move'",
        "'speaker_5': 'more of these programs into areas of the city that have not traditionally been successful in the past. And we have continued to look at ways to do that. Although the majority of the contract classes are offered in the east and southeast area, that does not mean we have not tried to offer them in other areas.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Over the years, multiple classes have been offered, particularly in the Southwest and western areas, and have been canceled due to lack of registration, participation and interest. However, we continue to look for ways to focus offerings in these areas.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'First, we will continue our longtime practice of incentivizing instructors who provide activities in these parks by waiving the six or $8 administration fee per participant. This incentive means greater revenue directly to the instructor, and the instructor can use to directly benefit from that or potentially lower their participation fee, which is often the barrier for some residents in'",
        "'speaker_5': 'these areas. Also, all new contract class instructors are asked to start their relationship with the city by offering their classes in these areas. Some have been successful, successful doing this and some have not. As we keep exploring options, we have also conducted targeted outreach to our current instructors who live in some of the areas that have less'",
        "'speaker_5': 'offerings, hoping that they would be enticed by the convenience of offering their business activities closer to home. Another option to consider if the Council would like is to lower the city versus the business partner. Split of revenue. Currently, the city retains 35% of the participant fee to cover the cost of advertisement registration insurance.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We could lower that to 30%. Understanding this would decrease the city's overall revenue by approximately $46,000. And ask the instructor then to lower their fees by 5%. Funding could also be added if the Council would like during the upcoming budget season to transition some of these fee based programs to free programing in lower income areas where the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'fee might be the barrier to participation. If this is the direction the Council wants to go in, additional staff would be needed to coordinate this new form of programing, including targeted marketing and outreach that is needed for the success of this type of programing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Finally, as was mentioned earlier, we have created in our testing an online survey that is going to provide greater data to us from our constituents as to the types of programs desired, as well as the willingness to pay, how far folks are willing to travel, and the threshold for cost of fee based programing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'How we are testing this survey to make sure that the responses that we are getting give us good data and then we are going to be rolling that out citywide very shortly. Prem does have a very robust marketing program that includes all facets of social media, as well as the publications that you see here.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And last year, over 700,000 pieces of marketing materials were distributed to the community marketing our programs. If more targeted marketing is desired, additionally, funding and resources would most likely be necessary to accomplish that goal. Finally, we were asked to look at program through an equity lens, and so we have done extensive research in this area.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'As you may know, the city is in the process of creating community wellness equity indicators through the Office of Equity and Evaluation of Programs and Services Citywide. This work will be finalized this spring through the city's newly trained 40 member community facility cohort, several of whom are from PRM and will engage the community in the development of'",
        "'speaker_5': 'policies and programs. Once completed, the Office of Equity and would look at the areas where disparities exist and work with city leadership departments and the community to design policies, practices and programs to address these disparities. Staff has worked with the Office in Equity and also done additional research to find other models where an equity lens has been'",
        "'speaker_5': 'used for programing and CIP resource distribution. We have only uncovered a few cities who have been doing work in this area. Minnesota and Portland and Seattle are doing some of this early work. However, they have very little data so far on outcomes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But for example, here is a minnesota model that could be something we use here in Long Beach. As you can see, funding is distributed based on community indicators. So it is again best to wait until those are finalized here in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Of note is that also funding is distributed based on facility space and amenity location. As you have seen in tonight's very quick presentation. There are definitely some inequities related to our distribution of programing facilities in the city. However, changing the location of our facility assets is certainly not a short term option, and that's why we have outreach'",
        "'speaker_5': 'to the school district and other facility sites. So in summary, I want to thank the Commission for their dedication to the department and for staying and for their time and input on this presentation. I also, since this is my last opportunity, I want to publicly thank the women and men of the PRM team for their many hours'",
        "'speaker_5': 'of work on this report, but more importantly, their dedication every day to the members of this community and for the service that they provide. I believed it was important that you were provided a solid foundation of information from which to build upon your future recommendations to the department.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The data in many areas speaks for itself and demonstrates that we have been on a good path. Obviously there's room for improvement and with greater investment in some areas, more can be done and the conversation does need to continue from here.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Pierre M will continue to be part of the great work being done through the Office of Equity, and we will bring forth recommendations that may be necessary as a result of those outcomes. I do believe that an investment of over $6 million and over 111 hours of free programing is much to be celebrated.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This has been a great opportunity to show the true magnitude of what we are doing. And although I cannot take credit for this great path as these accomplishments and these decisions were made before I joined the team, I have been proud to serve with the men and women who are making this happen every day in this community'",
        "'speaker_5': '. That concludes my report.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Where and I know that the the the the makes the motion of absolutely go to the public purse which will do but I just wanted to just you know to Marie, I know I've already told you separately, but I just want to again wish you the very, very best.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we're very fortunate to have had you. And you're just a fantastic addition and a great leader for the team. And just thank you. And we will we know you're not gonna go too far, but just appreciate the service that you did to the city.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So thank you. So, please, if we can have the the public, please come forward and then we'll go back to the motion. Mayor Garcia and city council members. My name is Randy Zorn and I am the executive director of Partners of Parks.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Partners and Parks is the 33 year old nonprofit that supports the Parks Recreation Marine by raising money for programs and facilities in the parks. Recently, the Park Partners of Parks Board approved a new strategic plan that has a heavy emphasis on supporting equity in the parks, including emphasizing programs for youth, teens and seniors.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'One of those programs that supports our mission is through the Youth Scholarship Program. Over the past several years, Poppe or Partners of Parks has helped low income families with registration fees for classes in summer and summer camps that are offered in the Recreation Connection catalog in order to be eligible.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Families need to meet specific annual income guidelines of 125% of the federal poverty level. One year ago, we received a donation of $3,200 from the Long Beach Judicial Partners, and they are the management group that operates the Superior Court building.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In addition, we received a grant from the Rudy and Daphne Monsour Foundation for $10,000. With these funds, we are able to provide scholarships to 52 low income children, with 13 of them taking multiple classes and or camps for summer 2018.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We will be working with the ramp program in the parks to identify families in need and will support and fund nearly 100 children, doubling the number served from the previous year. Partners in Parks is working closely with Parks Recreation Marine on securing additional grants for teens and senior programs.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The grants will target those community members with the greatest need by working closely with Parks, Recreation, Marine staff to meet the need for the safe after school activities and reduce social, social isolation of seniors. In addition to our focus on youth and seniors, Partners of Parks receives annually financial support of $38,000 from Signal Hill Petroleum for movies'",
        "'speaker_1': 'in the parks. The movies are held in every council district's parks, and there were 27 parks where the movies were shown last summer. Pop strength comes from the long lasting partnership we have established with Parks, Recreation and Marine.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We will strive to augment city resources to serve all communities using the parks, but will continue to focus on those who clearly have a higher need. We believe that our efforts will continue to increase equity and access to all long beach parks.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much. Thank you, Randi and Randi, thank you, of course, for everything that you guys do. I remember when I met you when I was 17 years old, coming into Cal State, Long Beach, and you were in charge of my orientation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I thank you for that and for everything you do now. Yes. Next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes, thank you. My name is Kathleen Irvine, 539 Daisy First District. Thank you, council members and mayor. I do want to say that I recognize that there have been a great improvements in the park since we first moved to the first District.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'When I first went to Cesar Chavez, it was basically a lot of kids rolling around on skateboards inside and scratching graffiti on the windows. And there has certainly been an effort by parks. I appreciate the data that has been submitted.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I think that as Councilmember Lina said, that we need a little bit more definition because programing is one thing. But if you are in the parks and see what's going on, it's really not enough to say there are free hours because what the children are doing or what the seniors are doing is not necessarily what I'",
        "'speaker_4': 'personally would call programing. One of the issues I had was a yoga class that was supposed to be for seniors this summer at Cesar Chavez. So a number of our seniors were very excited about the yoga program, and we went only to find that it was actually had been turned into a small children's yoga program.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And the yoga instructor.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Herself on her first day was told that this was what it was going to be, even though she'd been hired as a senior. So there's a big difference. And because of that, she wasn't happy and then the seniors weren't happy, and we had to walk across the lawn and do it over by the freeway instead of inside'",
        "'speaker_4': 'where the seniors were. So it was really a very bad experience, and she did not want to work anymore, even though she was getting paid. So that kind of thing, maybe it's going to take like more time or more programing or something.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But that kind of thing is very discouraging to people who want to contribute, who want to teach. So I think that I would like to see a lot more definition about what exactly those many thousands of hours of programing entail.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I appreciate the hard work that went into just gathering the data, and I appreciate all that the Commission has done for us in the past. They certainly supported many of our programs and we do appreciate what they've done so far.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much. Next speaker, please. Good evening. My name is Jim Dan. I live in the first district also. A couple of issues I'd like to address is one, again, going with the hours that are actually in the park and how you're counting those hours.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Let's just take Cesar Chavez, for instance. There is any number of day. There's probably 15, 20 big guys working out maybe six, 7 hours a day. Are you counting each of those guys for every hour that they're pumping iron?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That tends to be a little intimidating for the senior program when they try to go into the facility and then they're not really accosted. But there's definitely some intimidation factor there. A couple of issues with it would be is that that park, for instance, should be opened on weekends.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Families in that area are working hard, certainly five days a week, six, sometimes seven days a week. If the park were open on the weekends when the family needs it the most, it'll eliminate a lot of the homeless situation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There's camped out on the back side. That might be something that could also be addressed. Mayor, you started the idea of a gateway garden. That was a fantastic garden. It still is to this day. It's the first complete ADA garden.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yet the park system has not addressed that and has not encouraged the use or programing with that facility at that park. And I don't want to keep bagging on, you know, that park. I think that the staff there does a good job with what they're told to do and the limitations of that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Case in point, there's been the cell shed improvements. The enlargement of the AMPITHEATER. We're trying to activate that through Shakespeare in the park. The symphony has partners with us, but yet a year later, we're still waiting for six sprinkler heads to be placed so that the grass that was provided by grants, not by parks from the district'",
        "'speaker_1': ', can flourish. It's struggling. It's a year later. And, you know, we're not you know, we're drought still. So that would be something my note that should have been addressed a long time ago. Going to Drake Park. Drake Park can be so much better than it is.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think that the staff that's there does a great job. It's what it is. Again, I don't see how the numbers from the money applied to that facility. Councilmember Price, I know is surrounded by wetlands. Beautiful part. I work for the city.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm in your area all the time. Not as much as Mr. Super Nice, but your area quite a bit. I'd like to see that if the money from the city is also going for that district park and tidelands money because it's surrounded by Tidelands also is it's kind of double dipping.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Maybe some of that money can be pulled away from there. Since time the moneys would be applied only to Tidelands, which basically we're talking new restrooms and everything else as he built over there and could be diverted over to less fortunate.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'PARKS Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. D.A.. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hi. My name's Mariella and I live in District one. I originally actually this topic came to mind from Kathleen about last summer. It had to do with the municipal band, and I remember looking at why we didn't have the municipal band play in our district, and that's how it all started for me at least.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And what I ended up finding out was even though I.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Just learned that there's.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Programing year round, I was more of a participant during the summer. And from my experience, we as a mother of two toddlers, I was constantly driving to the east side for programing, for movies, at the park, for concerts and so on, so forth.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And what I ended up doing was tallying up all the the calendar by district and so on, and found that three of the districts had 52% of all of those events on the 100 days of summer calendar. And so for me, I look at that data and it's really difficult to sort of reconcile how that data really'",
        "'speaker_3': 'shows what the experience is from this perspective of a district one mother or child or District nine or or any of the other districts that maybe don't see that the kind of programing that might be at Eldorado Park, Ride, Whaley Park, or that the concerts that you see in other parks, because from my perspective, I see that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the numbers that map may have shown more like I think I saw in the youth programing district one had 4000 hours and then District five had or district I think.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It was five had 10000 hours of youth youth park.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hour. So for me it's like those are the kinds of numbers that matter because it's impacting our children, it's impacting how whether a kids are playing. So, yes, we might have access at Travis Park. Was it 3000 or 3000 free hours?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I can assure you that if from a experiential point of view that those kids are not get they're more like babysitting than they're actually taking a class that I would take my child to and learn and have a regular recreational activity that's of use and of purpose.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So when we talk about equity, it's not just in the numbers, but it's also on the experience that you're providing this children's. From my experience, I take my children all the time, my two daughters all the time to the parks, museums and so on.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I can assure you that in my district, District one, those 3000 hours or whatever was a child says Cesar Chavez, aren't actual.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Program hours.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Of that provide the same equal type or I don't even know the words at this point but the same recreational and educational opportunities that I would see at a park on the east side. So I would challenge the the Council and Parks and Rec and I really appreciate all the work that's been put into that report, but'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I would challenge them to find creative ways to make it more equitable for children across all of Long Beach as opposed to just a handful that it feels like it is. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. And we have three speakers left and then we'll close the speakers list. Yes. I just want to share a few things that I had seen from. First of all, the park system is one of my favorite things about this area.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I love it. I've rehabbed my shoulder on some of the outdoor exercise equipment that's there and everything, but something I wanted to just share is that something that I'd notice was really good for community engagement with Park Systems and in other places that I've lived had to do with like a chili cook off or a or a'",
        "'speaker_1': 'barbecue type thing, obviously coming from Texas to kind of lean that way. But one of the things I would do is like have a have the police department have one, and they would kind of judge between the fire department, the police department's barbecue or chili cook off where that kind of a fun competition kind of thing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then another thing that I had was in Austin was something called ERs birthday party and it was, you know, you were from the from Winnie the Pooh. It was like depressed and all that kind of stuff. Like another way for community engagement.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I know if this is feasible economically, but maybe they have something toward the end of the month, a birthday party for everybody that maybe didn't get a chance to have their birthday celebrated and that kind of thing. You can engage with people, make sure everybody's connected and all that kind of stuff.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Just some thoughts. Thank you. Next speaker, please. Honorable Mayor and city council members. My name's Kirk Davis. I'm a ninth District Council resident. I'm also finished serving a two year term as the co-chair of the Coalition for Healthy North One Beach.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Working together with the Health Department in the Heal Zone and the Kaiser Foundation, we were able to put exercise equipment in and out and park. We also give free classes and yoga Zumba and we totally support the park program.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'When I first saw the report on Park Equity and I noticed you talked more about classes and programing, I live in an area of the city, a Hamilton neighborhood that has no greenspace. That is the area between Atlantic Cherry, Artesia and 72nd Street.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There's no open space. There's no green space in that area. I've worked with Steve Neal and we've been working with residents in. And identifying areas that can be used for green space in our area, even just for our little for walking places, places where we can go out and walk your dog feel safe.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We've also been looking at options and I hope the City Council can also consider it as joint use parks in with the school district in the schools for after school is out of session and on the weekends people will use some of the green space on the schools and it just shows that being able to sit in'",
        "'speaker_1': 'a green space, an open space that's not your house is healthy for you and have the fresh air, have the ability to exercise close to your house and really enjoy those kind of things are things that can really help us to be happy and to live longer.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And thank you. Thank you so much. And our last speaker. Hello. My name is Angela on the piano. I was in the office working on this item with the wonderful staff of Councilwoman Gonzalez. And the reason I.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Enjoyed it so much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Wasn't just because all of us.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Were together working hours on this this item.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But because it hits home for me. My six nieces and nephews have lived in central Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They've lived in North Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And they currently live in West Long Beach and they have never received any information regarding whether there were programs that were free at the parks or if there was any fee based programing at those parks. And it wasn't until I started working here where I actually connected them to these things.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And the fact of the matter is the free programing that is offered, it is not really adding value to their lives. It's free movies, it's it's coloring, it's it's these things. It's not it's not.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'In.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The east side of Long Beach, I saw I saw resume development. I saw a math development. I saw I saw reading like.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Root.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Things that would actually add value to their lives. And if it's if it's the fact that it's limited resources that's affecting that, then this city council needs to finally switch funding over to library services and parks. The time is over.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You know, the police department receives 48% of the city's budget in I think it is 4.2% for library services and parks. That is unacceptable. Um, I wish and I hope for my nieces and nephews to one day live in a city where they can go to Admiral Kidd Park and receive help with their resume, receive help with'",
        "'speaker_1': 'math because I know they truly need it and but think thank you for all the work that you have done. Honestly, you are an amazing individual and I want to thank you for that. But there is disproportionally disproportionate.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Funding.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In this city, and we really do need to look at the way that we fund the parks and libraries.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much. That concludes the public comment. Thank you, everyone that spoke and returned back to Councilwoman Gonzales.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. So I'm going to hit the refresh button here and I want to say thank you as well to Marie. And I know it doesn't seem like I'm grateful, but I am absolutely grateful to Marie and her staff.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I worked alongside them even before being elected. And I know what a hard working group and team that you have on so many different levels, management all the way down to our park staff, whether part time or full time.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I know that the work that they do, they love it and we are going to continue to support them. But what I'm asking here is just for support and I'm asking us to challenge ourselves because I don't want to put this out and everyone sort of roll their eyes and laugh and think, it's just us complaining because'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it's not complaining. It really is something that many of us are passionate about. You know, we have I've talked to you know, I see David here from the Park Commission. I appreciate it. And Randy and Karen and our residents from, you know, various areas.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And what resonated with me in talking about, you know, the need for more park programing was that they said, you know, that's what we need. We need more programing. We need more opportunities for our kids to engage. You know, these are neighborhoods that many of you know, some of the students are eligible for, for gang activity.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They're going to be either in a gang or they need some somewhere to go after school to support them. And this is what it does. But I think it can go a bit further. So I think what we need to do first, before talking about a plan to come back, I would like something to come back in'",
        "'speaker_3': 'about, you know, that six month time frame regardless. But I think first and foremost is we need to provide we need more data even more than we currently have, because what we have is just a current flat data of what we're existing, what is existing in what we're currently doing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I would like data on that survey that we're that is online right now. It's a survey that basically asked questions to residents on what they want to see in their neighborhood. I know oftentimes, you know, we say, well, there's high unemployment in this area.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We need resume workshops. Well, I don't know if our residents actually want that. They might need it, but I don't know what they actually want. So I think our, the, the data on the survey that we have would be good.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I also think just some other touch points I talked about maybe a roundtable that we can sit and discuss, maybe a part commission meeting that we can take outside of a normal part commission location and take it to the communities that really want to see these programs and talk about, you know, what we can do to formulate'",
        "'speaker_3': 'a better plan for park program and activities. But, you know, many of our residents as well, you know, the ones that are actually activating the parks like Willmore and building healthy communities, they've been denied permits, they've been denied waivers for their permit fees.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think that that's not a really good and inclusive and welcoming environment when they have to go to the Park Commission multiple times throughout the year for many of their events that they do on an annual basis.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I know the Parks Commission is just doing their job, but it's very cumbersome. These individuals are not just volunteers. They're working 8 hours a day like we are, and then they're activating our parks on top of that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So they're really the ones I can speak to my neighborhood. They're really the ones that are doing the work and activating our parks the way we really want to see them, you know, putting in summer concerts. Winton Willmore I saw the Willmore Group this past year.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Welcome over. I want to say we had thousands of kids at Drake Park, thousands, not only the lighting was put up, you know, but the programed area was, you know, had snow. There were music elements for the kids.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'My kids went out and enjoyed. You don't get that. Otherwise, if we didn't if Willmore didn't do that, we wouldn't have had anything during the holiday season for these kids to go and just have a good time and enjoy their neighbors.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I give a lot of my gratitude to these community members. And if we can ease it a little bit better and make it a little more streamlined on the Park Commission side, if there's some barriers that we can, you know, lessen to be able to create a better environment, that would be great.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'One of them, I think, was included in here, and I really like to see that I had suggested originally a multiyear contract, you know, but I know that that might be a little difficult because there's so many different nuances that might take place.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But we have community groups that I feel that have been vetted, that we know they've been in place for 20, 30 years. I think maybe we can give them a break in that sense in creating a multi-year contract and then also providing waivers to these individuals.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, as much as we can, I don't know how that will affect our bottom line, but I think that there's room there to to explore what we can do with these specific groups. We also talked about promoting existing programing, and we need to push even more so in this in this equity lens, because right now we're'",
        "'speaker_3': 'printing and we're mailing out an awesome booklet. And when you look through this booklet, it's all Eastside activities, you know, and I have a child too, and I have to go to, you know, storytime or wherever. I have to go all the way to the Eastside, which I have a car.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I can do that. That's no problem. But it makes it very cumbersome for for many of our residents to do that as well. And I think just being able to have other mediums in different languages, you know, of course we talked about that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But social media, there's awesome things you can do on Facebook to target certain zip codes so they receive information. And I think we can just do better on that side. And then I talked about the survey results. But if there's any other way to obtain information, as I mentioned before, I think, Maria, you mentioned or you gave'",
        "'speaker_3': 'us a report about a year and a half ago. It's in 2016, and it basically showcased all of the residents in our zip codes 90802 and 90813 that were attending some of these classes. And when you when we say that there's low interest in areas in some of these programs, I would have to disagree because a lot'",
        "'speaker_3': 'of these, if I'm looking at it over 63,000 90813 years and 9080 tours will say we're attending classes in 2016, which is great. That means that there is interest. We just have to sort of reassess to see where we can bring the classes and programs in our neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And as we mentioned to just a close up, you know, the contract classes are just pulling the numbers. You know, we have in the Southwest and in uptown, we have the most facilities. We've said that in this in this in this report, we have the most facilities because the open space plan dictate dictates that our areas of'",
        "'speaker_3': 'need should have more facilities. And we do. But even with more facilities, we don't have park programing. And that's that's the issue here. Out of the contract classes, there are 41.7 districts. 41.3% versus 58.6% for two districts. I just think that there's, you know, something wrong there, considering we have the most facilities and our summer programing, our'",
        "'speaker_3': 'free programs, a lot of them are are a lot of them are in the summer. So that's three months. And so, again, I know that's I'm dumping a lot. I'm sort of saying everything, but I think I know where we need to reassess.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm going to ask that in that six months, we obtain as much data as possible, survey results going out to the community. I'll I'll engage. Absolutely. Our partner of parks. I'll engage our community groups. I'll engage, you know, the Park Commission to sort of look outside the box, go to other areas, obtain that data, and then come'",
        "'speaker_3': 'back in six months and come back with a really good policy and plan where we can sort of reassess and shift. That is it. And I thank you very much again for all of your work. Murray, we do certainly appreciate you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I know it's probably been my office that's given you the hardest time. But again, I just I really appreciate you engaging us and having the chance to sit down with you personally. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you so much, Councilmember Pierce.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I yes, I want to thank everybody that's stayed tonight and those that have stayed for other items. I really appreciate your efforts. And again, Maria said it earlier, but I know that you have put a lot of time and energy into this and just short term and Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so I appreciate that and all the staff that are here that make our park so great. Thank you. You know, I I want to say I appreciate the data. I think that one of the challenges that's here is that, yes, it's not a one size fits all.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And, you know, I want to take the responsibility and I'll ask, you know, my colleagues to do the same in meeting with my neighborhood associations. I you know, I've knocked on almost all the doors in my district probably four times now.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Just as we do turn out for our budget meetings, we always make sure that we're going door to door, making sure that we're doing the survey with all of those constituents that might not know that it's out there.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so I you know, I have to say, I just had my briefing this week and the survey wasn't brought up. And so it's not a tool that we're using to push out. And I think it would be helpful to have that as a tool for the office outside of just city staff.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I do want to ask, how are we working with the schools and getting that survey out as well? So as I said, right now we're testing the survey. It's out limited because we want to see what comes back and to make sure that we are asking the right questions.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so once we have that data back, that's when we will push that out. We will be asking all the council offices to distribute the survey via your emails, your listserv, your websites through the schools. So we'll be using all of our marketing avenues once the surveys are ready.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. I just thank you for that. It's helpful to to know that it is just a pilot survey. I also want to make sure that we're you know, at my next community meeting, when we have a roundtable of folks that we're identifying, this is a topic that we're talking about.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I know that when you look at the resources in my district, we have underutilized parks, which I'm assuming in my district would be the arts park that's consistently locked Miracle on Fourth Street, which we took away programs. And so it has it listed as a community, not a community center, but something similar is also listed as a'",
        "'speaker_5': 'site because we do still do youth sports programs at Miracle. And Fourth, we do. Okay, so we've got Miracle on fourth and then it's not in my district, but it's next to my district, Crossman village. And so looking at those places, I know that I, Bixby sometimes were booked to the to the max and it's hard to'",
        "'speaker_5': 'get other classes in there. And we have high participation. And I know that we've had a challenge with getting programing in our passive parks or underutilized parks. I hope that out of this process, through the survey and through community building, that we can identify what programs that neighborhood needs because a kid can't walk from Fourth Street, where'",
        "'speaker_5': 'a miracle on Fourth Street is over to Bixby Park. And I think that's a challenge. And some of the equity piece is that you have families in these higher poverty areas that are working two and three jobs and don't have the luxury of driving their kids to the park for the day or don't have the luxury of'",
        "'speaker_5': 'paying somebody to drive their kids to the park for the day. And so it it does mean that kids might not go to the park if it's not something that's right next door. And so these neighborhoods serving parks, while it looks like there's no programing and that's fine from the outside, it's not okay for having our youth'",
        "'speaker_5': 'get the skills and the tools that they need. And so I'll take on the challenge on myself as well as on staff on how are we really engaging with residents and getting them meaningfully engaged so that it's not just about spending money on the West Side or central Long Beach, but it's identifying the right programs for that'",
        "'speaker_5': 'community in particular. And so I look forward to seeing this come back. I think that looking the studies that you guys are the cities, Minnesota, Seattle, I think it's a good place to start, which is what I was referencing earlier.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so I do appreciate that. I do want to echo the comments around. The fee waiver denials. I know I've had a couple folks come to us. And so having a real clear understanding, the statement that you made that they don't have a nexus to the Long Beach community was not true for those that came forward.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Maybe it's because we thought they had enough money and they could pay for it. But these are a lot of groups that invest in our communities, that invest in our youth, and they're trying to do a service for us.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so I know that there's a balance in between covering the costs and making sure that services are available. And so any new opportunities that we can identify to make that more accessible for folks is really important. Again, I really, really appreciate you and all the team.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think that your programs are so wonderful in Bixby Park and I want to make sure that we have that same quality at the other parks in my district as well. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. Thank you to the staff. I really appreciate you. To get to the meat of it. Some of the things that I think would be valuable in the next version would be a separation between adult and youth programs, and then also a comparison to where the youth in the city live.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In the nineties, when I was in Long Beach Unified School District, there were over 90,000.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Participants and students in.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Our schools. Today it's somewhere under 70,000. And so when you have a 20% drop in students, you also probably have a migration of where those students are. And I would also be surprised if we had any less programing considering the volume we have today.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I'd be interested in seeing that. I'm really proud that 65% of our free hours are offered at non specialty facilities. I think that's remarkable. And if the communities that have the programing want to provide input on the types of programing, I think that that's really valuable because when free programing is offered and not utilized and I'm'",
        "'speaker_5': 'not just saying on one part of town, but on my side of town as well, it could be better programs for the things that are important to the students. And so we definitely need that feedback. With 100 Days of Summer, I think it shows a skewed outcome because a lot of our council offices use one time funds'",
        "'speaker_5': 'to supplement that. And so I think it's important. Well, I can understand the perception that some areas have significantly more programing than others. Part of it is because our council offices have put up that money, whether it's for a snow day, whether it's for an additional concert in the park.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So keeping that in mind, I think it's important that on Slide seven, it's a lot about being served. But I don't know that this could represent duplicated numbers.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'd be really interested to.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Know our high utilization, and I've said this a lot about Eldorado Park. It's one thing to say we have 400,000 visits to Eldorado Park a year. It's completely different to say we.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Have.'",
        "'speaker_5': '300,000 visits of people who come for one day and 100,000 visits that are broken out by monthly visitors, weekly visitors. And now with the dog park.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We have some people that are there every single day.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so we need to know and understand our high.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Utilizers of the system.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then better adjust for that. And then also what percentage of our utilization of the system is non Long Beach residents? Our sales tax and property tax dollars supplement these programs. And so I appreciate that some of our contract programs have a different price for a resident and a nonresident.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But as we look at fee changes for the fall that come into this next budget cycle, maybe the same should be said of our entrance fees to.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Eldorado Park and the Nature Center that those that are Long Beach residents should not be experiencing a fee increase.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Where those that are coming to our park for a single day are feeling that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'More. On Slide eight.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I noticed that you addressed.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The wrap.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Program. Is that in.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Partnership with the schools or do we apply as our own grants section?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So that is in partnership. We utilize school district facilities and we put some general fund money into that, but it is largely grant funded. Thank you. I knew that it was a grant funded program for the school district, but I wasn't sure if we applied separately and were competing with the school district or not.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'On Slide.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Nine, I think that it would be very valuable to see the number of participants by these areas. And I think it's great that you talked about facilities where free programs are offered, but a lot of programing is also offered in open space.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And one of the things that I think that this definitely under under represents is.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The amount.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Of open space available for free programing and program programing as.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well. I see that. My district doesn't have the most space.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think that it's very telling to see that District six actually has the most square footage of available space. I think that that is a testament to the work that Mr. Andrews has done over the last 10 to 12 years to add additional space.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But I think that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'When you see this.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And add on another set of sections for acreage or square footage of. Open grassed space or fields.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Then you'll really see how underfunded the infrastructure of the fifth District is.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Why a third of our trees in our parks are dead. Why all of the roads in Eldorado Park.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Are in ill repair, while the facilities in our park system in the fifth.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'District are at an all time low. Because as infrastructure money was separated across nine districts, we were each getting approximately 12%. But that's not really fair. When 35 to 40%.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Of the streets in the city and the trees in the.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'City and a lot of the parkland in the city is in one district. So then you wonder why in that district.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'When I was elected, it was so far behind in infrastructure repairs.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And when you look at the $200 million infrastructure need plan that was presented in all of our first year of of of election in 2014.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You'll see that because of the expanse of space, it costs more to repair. And it has.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Been longer since it was repaired. So I think that it's important to also add that in because. Our side of town doesn't only serve.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The east side. The east side goes all.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The way up to the center. And when you look at the city, really, that the airport kind of.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Serves as the hub of the wheel. And there services over at Wardlow Park and Pan-Am Park and.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Others that are easily accessible from North or central Long Beach. And I think that goes to be said. And then I think that for the last component of my last question, it would be what free programs are currently being offered at the schools.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think that it's time we do an evaluation of the amount of programing. The Parks and Rec program and the tax dollars of the City of Long Beach provide on the school campuses versus the amount of programing that the schools provide in partnership to us.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I say that because we have done.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'When I say we, I mean you really it's all of you and the staff that have taken the brunt of.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Of the reprograming of our park space for our sports leagues. And since we don't have the same types of reservation systems available, what you have is an equity not based on what the city is doing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We're equity.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We're applying park rental availability equitably. However, when I read the reports on how many fields some of these leagues have, they are in a reservation system that is not fair and equitable.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's an online system through Long Beach Unified that's really based on your availability to be at a computer at the moment that the field's become available.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Which then puts some of our our schools and our teams and a lot of our parents that are working parents at a disadvantage when they're also the coaches of these teams. So we need a better system. I'd love to see.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'A.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'An opportunity for us to put together a public private partnership or maybe it's just a public public private partnership where we would be able to manage.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Those facilities and or throw them into the same system.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That we're using to distribute parks, but ensure that they're.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Maintained appropriately because they've made some investments.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And finally, I think that. It wasn't mentioned here, but when I look at the infrastructure opportunities. I think that it's often important to know that when we talk about the capital improvement budget and you see where the money has gone and come from, and when you compare this project list to where a majority of the land is'",
        "'speaker_5': ', I think that it just.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Shows how underfunded the Fifth District has been.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I think that we need to have a plan to fix that immediately.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. And I'm glad we were able to continue this this conversation. I want to just say thank you to Parks and Recreation and Marie for for the great work. Marie Knight, you've been great to work with during your your tenure here.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And has your department has been completely responsive to my office. And so I just want to thank you again publicly for for your work, but also for your amazing team. The numbers don't I mean, I think I think the data here is is very clear, at least from my perspective, and has given me an opportunity to assess'",
        "'speaker_8': 'what we need to do to improve programing through programing or for programing in in my district. I try to try to come to this this council dais week after week and for the last five and a half years or so with a citywide view, not just, you know, what's best for my district, but what's best for the'",
        "'speaker_8': 'entire city. And oftentimes that makes that means making sacrifices and concessions because, you know, it may not make sense. I can recall just a few weeks ago, Parks and Recreation Marine brought forth recommendations to even cut afterschool programs in my district.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I'm looking at the data here and the free programs here. You know, it's I have zero afterschool programs in a district now. Had I known that had this information a few weeks ago, I may not have been so readily and willingly.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I may not have been willing to to to to concede at that point. But I understood I looked at the data and the usage and the utilization, and it wasn't there because we have other amenities. I think also this this this looking at this from an equity lens and made it very clear that that some areas of'",
        "'speaker_8': 'the city were woefully unrepresented under programed in and in some cases underdeveloped. Over the last several years. I know I have focused on developing green space in my district and that has been the focus. And because of that, you know, I think we're we're looking at at least almost eight acres of new recreational or active green space'",
        "'speaker_8': 'available at Davenport Park and then Molina Park. I think we're going to have to have a real hard conversation if we're looking at being equitable, at how we program those parks moving forward. Because the data here shows that, you know, the kids in eighth District are or are last in all in every category.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so I thank you all for for bringing this this this this report forward, because it's going to really, really reinvigorate me in terms of making sure that we have equity for my district, we programs. And I want to also mention that, you know, we have parks where, you know, my my predecessor once brought forth a an'",
        "'speaker_8': 'idea to put a skate park because it was more equitable to put a skate park in and in an area of the district and, you know, ran into a buzzsaw because the residents didn't want that type of programing in the district.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so I think it's also important to understand that, you know, we assess and understand and have a good understanding of where our residents are and how parks are utilized because not every park is necessarily going to be utilized or wants to be utilized for for active recreation or programing.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You know, they certain areas of the city that are that are that that would prefer quality of life and serenity. And I know we're doing a lot of work to to do that is particularly with our wetlands restoration project with the forest.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And that brings me to exhibit E in the staff report the comparison when we look at major projects from FY 13, FY 18. Just can you can you help me discern how. We how? District eight in district nine, the first women's project is actually allocated or counted.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we took the total for that project and we allocated it evenly between the two exhibit E.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So you allocate it evenly between the two? Yes, that's not right. It's because about like 90% of that project is in District eight. I mean, I'm just trying to help you balance the numbers a little bit so that that, you know, I have some questions with how we reach that, because if it's it's not a 5050 project'",
        "'speaker_8': ', it's if you look at that, you know, I'm sorry, geography and it's late of the project. Most of it is is district eight before as well as project. So I was I had some questions about that. And then lastly, again, you know, I'm going to be reinvigorated.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm I'm happy to to see more data come forward in the coming months. I don't know that that's going to tell us anything differently than what we have in front of us here today. This is very comprehensive, in my opinion, and gives me all that I need to to understand where we're going.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I would just just implore upon my my colleagues, you know, we do know that we are and maybe we're moving forward with some some some tough budgetary times.

        "'speaker_8': 'just think we're we're not going to going to agree. A lot of what I see here from this data has been played out in over many years. You know, and I don't I don't see necessarily that it's it's our Parks and Recreation Department has has work to to be equity an equitable in terms of the distribution of'",
        "'speaker_8': 'resources. I think it just kind of plays out the way it plays out with Greenspaces. But we do have some challenges. And when I look at senior programing, District eight has zero senior programs. Right. But District eight is actually programing senior programs through our district budget and through private donations.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And we will be addressing that moving forward in budget cycles in, in conversations with our city manager in Parks Recreation Marine Department because, you know, where is my staff? Actually, my, my, my city council district staff is actually being utilized to, to to help run these programs several hours a week.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Right. I'm starting to wonder whether or not that should be a park recreation Marine staff actually doing that. This is this is it's an area that we do need to address. And so it's late. My eyesight is going.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'So. So I'll. I'll just say, Murray has been great working with you, and I think we didn't want to see you go. That's why we asked you to. We all hold you as long as we can tonight. But it really has been a pleasure working with you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I wish you all the success. And Steve, you're going to have to pick up this conversation and keep it going because I don't think it's going to go anywhere. Lena, thank you for for staying on top of this issue.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's an issue that does impact all of us. And I like a lot of the comments because we're all learning tonight, and that's why data is important, you know, but Rome wasn't built in a day. So I want to acknowledge the progress here that the progress behind the dias and the progress that I do see in this'",
        "'speaker_6': 'report, you know, equity is making resource decisions based on need. And so, you know, when you see a zero, whether it's in this space of a contract class or afterschool programing, whenever you see a zero, no matter what district it is, we it should raise a red flag because there are people in that community need to be'",
        "'speaker_6': 'served. So in general, people with the least resources in terms of people, the least resources, in my opinion, should not have to travel the farthest for contract classes. So I do think we need to do more to make sure contract cases are rooted in the community, in communities that really, really need that one.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Just bring attention a few things. So slide number 14. So you got on slide 14. Let's see what I'm there. Okay. Now I see pools as three, five, six, seven, nine. Are we talking about. Or we thought.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Were pool were pools and.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So those are city and school pools.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'So you do.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'All right. So, Jordan, you mean the Jordan high pool. Gotcha. Okay, now, what about this map on slide 19? I don't know if this is supposed to be a district boundary or not, but district nine doesn't go in.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And Bixby Knolls that color?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'No, those.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Are by zip codes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. All right. That was a little confusing. Just wanted to clarify if all the numbers are skewed that way or what. Then slide 23. Okay. Actually, Councilman Austin brought this up. I was just curious how the 12 million was calculated.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, correct that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah, yeah. There's no problem because it doesn't. I mean, 16% isn't really an accurate reflection of the investment. I mean, you know, there's been a lot of. Yeah, we're very happy, very pleased with Highland Park Community Center, the investments that we're making.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But this number just seemed a little bit skewed. So thank you for acknowledging that. And then what I'd like to see, you know, I didn't think I saw it, but just access to open space in general. I know that my district has 1.7 acres per thousand residents, whereas we have, you know, some dishes with ten.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Right. And so Kirk, who spoke earlier, dressed like the need to place focus on the open space as for in terms of like park development. So as long as we can continue an equity conversation there and then I acknowledge the the conversation in the last few pages looking at equity based models, you know, obviously the angels in'",
        "'speaker_6': 'the details. But I like I like the fact that you, you know, you were brave enough to actually throw it in there that some people do program their parks based on equity 50%, you know, by one metric, 30% by another metric, 20% by another metric.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I'm okay with exploring something like that. And then finally, one thing that I think we should talk about should be a part of Park Equity is the.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Way that our.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Parks Commission is actually structured. It should at least have one district representative on each district should be on the park commission. That's something we should we should look at. We don't it's not based on district. We should have at least some voice from every single district on that commission.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilman lingo. Thank you, Mayor. The angel is in the details. Hmm. Never thought about that one before. Anyway, the devil's in the details. I mean, the devil manages. It's all the details are always tough to deal with anyway.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that's neither here nor there. It's getting late. That actually one of the things that that I look at in terms of programing is and it was mentioned somewhat by my I remember Gonzalez is is getting the word out it's getting that communication is letting people know about what programs are available at each of the parks.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah, I know I have a few of them in my part. Admiral Kid and Silverado, which are the two largest ones that have a lot of activities going on in here. But I think that there's also they're underutilized to a certain extent because there's not enough people there.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I mean, there's there's a language barrier there. And that's why I'm always pushing the language access programs that we need to get off the board and start really implementing as an institutional wide type of program for everything that the city does.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Because communication is is one of the most important things that we're about. And we don't get the word out to people about what we're doing for the city. They're not going to understand what's taking place, and people are going to misunderstand what we're doing and think that we're trying to be, you know, pull the wool over their'",

But if we had the right form of communication with them, the word is not going to get out. So I would love to see more of an opportunity about getting them getting the word out to our residents, especially in those'",
        "'speaker_1': 'parks that have a lot of programs that that they can be utilize, including those that are for a fee and making those also available in in areas where maybe the contractors may not want to go to, but they need to go to, because that's where the probably the need is.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And whether it's the poor store or that's part of the contract, so be it. I know when reading some of these evaluations about why we have fee programs more towards the says because people pay well you know maybe sometimes we should look at a waiver or wait at the parks and recreation park and make the same classes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'available like the yoga class that we talked about earlier for poor seniors and making it more affordable for them so that they can continue. You to receive that type of service? Yes, a couple of questions. There were I was looking at the the slides here and nowhere in any of these slides that I see, Tanaka Park is'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Tanaka Park deactivated is not working anymore. Is it closed up with what's what's what's not the park or do you know where it's at.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I do. In Tanaka Park is a passive park, so we don't have programing at that park that's intended. We have multiple passive parks that did not show up in this report. Throughout the city we have 170 parks in the city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So many of them are intended to be passive and they're not programed.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. So that that would also explain then what the definition of a park with the the Christmas tree lane, daisy the day parade.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I could see that. Okay. I mean, that's basically it. I my my big peeve would be making sure that that survey that you got going out there is readable, that it's easy to use, and that it's also includes language access issues such as being able to have it in to garlic and mountain Hmong and.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'QMI The major languages that are that are present in Long Beach so that we could get a more accurate picture as to what communities of interest would have in it.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'And in the shortened presentation tonight, if it were.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They longer.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Presentation, you would have heard that we are working with our language access coordinator, city staff and looking at opportunities and options for the greater promotion of our programs and activities.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then finally, I do want to lend my voice to your congratulations and your and your new in your career change from Long Beach to Huntington Beach. So you're still on the beach somewhere.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Staying at the beach.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good for you. And I wish you well and much success. Thank you. Thank you, Councilmember Spinner. Thank you. And let me echo my colleague's sentiments, Marie, thank you for your service to our community. You've done a great job.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'd also like to say to my earlier comments, this isn't the first stint Steve Smith has said, I'm sorry that everybody calls you Steve Smith at one point. Okay, I just made the mistake. He never told me that, Mr. Scott, is that this is not his first stint.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I want to remind the audience that it's 1120, so I'm sorry if I'm stammering, but we worked with him as an interim before and he did a great job then. And I have all.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The confidence in the.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'World in him doing this. My idea behind let's get this wrapped. Part of it is what I think Sir Winston called perfectionism leading to procrastination. I'm looking at the 100 days of summer. Come on, let's get it together before we hit this thing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So that was part of my motivation for saying, let's bring this back quickly, deal with it, work it out. I'd like to commend Parks and Rec staff. Just I just think you do a great job. I have a unique district in that I do go from the east side to the west side.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I think the way staff works at out, for instance, I'll tell you, Whaley Park was mentioned, we have exactly two municipal band concerts in Whaley every year. One of them is on a council meeting night, so I can't even attended.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But we bring about the equity I'm sorry, equality in this and that. Stearns Park has a movie night and the Long Beach Community Band plays at that or is a part park the same? We just work it out and maybe my office funds a little bit of it, but I just think there are a lot of practical'",
        "'speaker_1': 'fixes we can bring to this. Also to Councilwoman Mango and her point about infrastructure, this is huge. Can you imagine if the fifth District still had the nature center, which is the fourth District now? She would have all that funding to worry about, too.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we put a lot of effort into that, and I don't think you can separate infrastructure from programing. I think I see the Supervisor Stearns Park up there.
