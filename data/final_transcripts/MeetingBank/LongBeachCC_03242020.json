        "'speaker_0': 'Meeting can proceed. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Mr. Mayor, thank you very much. We will have John Keiser and Teresa Chandler available to give a short staff report. Essentially, as we all know, during this COVID 19 crisis. One of the things we are also looking at is how we can shelter additional individuals.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We are looking at social distancing our homeless individuals, too, as they come into the shelter. So this will allow us to do that. I really want to thank Duncan Bryson for the support and using the North Library and we essentially would be contracting to do beds out at the North Library and the approval of this is recommended'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so that we can move forward with that. So that's the short snap report. If you'd like anything further, John and Teresa can answer questions. Thank you. Before I go down the road, I know Councilman Austin is in your district.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So did you have motion?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, first of all, I like to say a lot about my personal property to be able to accommodate the homeless population, global financial crisis or external crisis. And so I think my sense is, of course, we will hopefully with nominal support.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I will just say that I certainly support the the efforts to. Expand more broadly and speak for those who are on the environment and social justice dealing with this. That will certainly help us in that regard. I know there are some differences in terms of how this has been traditionally used, and I think that will.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The salt was welcome to the shelter for the past two years. No, no. We understand how the operation will work. But we will run this operation and we have experience doing so. And they have been remarkable partnering with the city for the last couple of years, particularly working out of the old library, running the shelter there, and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'confident in that partnership. The only difference in this is that this will, I understand, be run 24 hours. And so I'm taking the motion. But I would love for you to also talk a little bit about how these operations are going to be different and what considerations we've given to public safety as well, because the model lives'",
        "'speaker_2': 'in the community and the impact in a residential area as well. So again, I make the motion, I absolutely support that. I would love to have some dialog with the House and quite the commission on how operations are to operate moving forward.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Can I get a second please?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Councilmember Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Refer to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It by the second, by councilor appears. Everyone else put their phone on mute. Mr. Modica, can you answer Councilman Alston's questions? Thank you. Yes, council on behalf. And we take that very seriously. We realize these are in neighborhoods and that they have to be very well-run and well managed, and we've had a lot of experience with that'",
        "'speaker_1': '. So I'd like to turn it over to Theresa Chandler, our interim deputy city manager, to talk a little bit about those provisions. Teresa.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hi. Thank you. This is Teresa Chandler. First of all, I want to thank Councilmember Austin for your support in allowing this opportunity for the winter shelter to move or relocate to the north facility. We are working with the provider us that's and the funder Lizer to ensure that the neighborhood stays safe and our community members who are'",
        "'speaker_3': 'utilizing the shelter stay safe. There's 24 seven security guards who are onsite, as well as a full staff of case managers and folks who are doing triage and intake throughout the day who will be managing the site. We will also be working with our partners in the community.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Are the quality of life officers in that area and all of the the other supports that we have available to ensure that everyone stays safe at that time. Also, in light of of COVID 19, just making sure that social distancing is practice.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So during the day, we do encourage people to go to the multi-service center for showers and there's, you know, space in place there as well. So not everybody will be staying at the shelter all day. They have opportunity to go to the multi-service center for showers and in case management and things of that sort.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Let me let me go ahead and move down to our government option. These are questions get answered.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, y'all. Appreciate it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Different one.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mayor. I think that this is very important. Obviously, with social distancing, that's something that I was really worried about because it's even more scary to see how it could be spread through our homeless population. And like I said, that's really scary.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Me son, glad to see that we're making, you know, moves and in an effort to really respect this social distancing again, which is what is needed of us right now. So I'm totally in support of both of them.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Dr. Pierce?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. Thank you, Mayor. I was happy to second this item. I wanted to thank North Long Beach and also the first District and the seventh District for always really being the location where we're able to find either shelters or resources places for people to keep their belongings.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The multi-service center and recognize that you guys continue to have the majority of those services in your district. So I wanted to thank you guys for that. I wanted to take a moment just to ask staff in the second District and putting up close to the third.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We obviously have a strong homeless population. Echo Park have been a bit challenging lately and recognizing sometimes it's difficult to get folks to move from Bixby up to North Long Beach. Can you just take a moment on this item to speak to how we are looking at new facilities or locations during this crisis?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I'm particularly asking I know Tom and I spoke this morning about this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. Councilmember So we also have some resources coming in from the state. This has become a statewide priority to fund continuum of care, just like Long Beach and large cities too, with funding to be able to open up additional shelters.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We are working on that right now. We hope to have another shelter open up later this week. And that's something that we've been putting a lot of priority on. And we are still looking for other opportunities as well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we're trying to be creative and not just looking at the typical sites, but with a number of sites that are out there now that do not have the public in them. What can we be using to expand sheltering opportunities?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So that is a priority for us. And as we identify sites will be, we'll be rolling those out as we can.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Right. Thank you. And I just, you know, a comment to some of our small businesses that might have bigger properties. You know, I know we've got school facilities, but this is a time whenever we should be opening up as many facilities as possible.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So if folks can think of locations, we should definitely be communicating that with our city staff. And I welcome whatever resources we can have in the Second District. But thank you, Councilmember Austin, for partnering, obviously, with the city to make sure that we have another site provided.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Think about this for three.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I do want to echo the comments of my colleagues and thank city staff for working on the winter shelter and extending the winter shelter. I will say that Councilman Austin Kaplan, Mungo and I had an opportunity, I think it was last year, to do a site visit at the winter shelter.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And it was it was a really great opportunity for us to see the operation and see the work of us, that very, very impressive work that's taking place there. I also want to echo the comments of Council on that morning course.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I do know that every single council member, every single one, whether they have facilities or not, is certainly open to and having communications all the time with city managers regarding how we as council members representing a specific district can be part of the solution.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so I want to thank all my colleagues for that because I know that to the extent that we're offered opportunities to be part of the solution, we're usually very amenable to doing so, at least this council. AS And one example of that is for this winter shelter.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Councilwoman Pearson I actually added a pick up and drop off location for the winter shelter in Bexley Park, which borders our two districts. So I think that's been, you know, really the first time we've had a pick up drop off location for homeless in the third district.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I want to continue to look at opportunities to incorporate different types of solutions in every district so that we can work together on our common goals. And again, I want to thank Theresa Chandler and her team for getting us to this point.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Just before. Thank you. I'd like to thank.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'City staff also. And a special thank you to Councilman Al Austin for stepping up once again. And I yield the floor.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I just also want to thank Alfa's work. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'With respect.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So thank you for stepping up to the plate. You know, the winning shot has been a success before two years. And so I'm thankful that we are joining us now and I'm excited for the energy to open on the scoreboard soon.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So you guys get ready. Thank you again. Our great job.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. District seven.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I want to extend my appreciation to the staff working on this. I know that they're looking at other sites as well around the city so that we can ensure that those resources are vulnerable. I will try to help.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you very much and thank you all.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. District nine. I'm sorry. District eight. Anything else out?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No. Let's think of votes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. And then finally, Katherine Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Sure. Thanks, Councilman Austin and Seth, one thing I want to I want to read up. So if I understand that there are some additional costs associated with the way that we do social distancing and all those things always happen into those $80 for that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Or we going back to the funder.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Those. I've checked in with us based and others about this and I know that this is a concern.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Do.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilman.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah. That was a question for Sam.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I know, I know. I stop answering that. That's your. Yes, Theresa.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'My apologies. The question is, are we looking at you directly? Accuse me utilizing other funding? Yes, we are working with the state and they have sent down the emergency funding. We received the award letter today and we're working with our internal team to figure out how to best allocate those funds.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The funding is specifically for sheltering in place and isolation as needed and also looking at shelter opportunities. And so we just literally just received the funding awards and we'll be working through that this week.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. And just to be clear, we could connect offline. My understanding is that there is a gap with the winter shelter, given some of the new considerations on COVID and social distancing. And I just want to make sure that those that us that and others know that we have their back that will be a backstop because'",
        "'speaker_2': 'they're deploying our resources right now to make sure that they just get it up and open. We want to make sure that the funding that funding is available to help close that gap so we can connect. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Yes, we are having those conversations and also with the latter, who is funding the winter shelter programing? The PUP shelters are funded differently. So we can definitely talk offline about that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Perfect. Thank you. Thank.'",
