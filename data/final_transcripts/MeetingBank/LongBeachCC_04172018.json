    "Recommendation to declare ordinance amending the Long Beach Municipal Code by amending and restating Chapter 21.56; and by adding Chapter 15.34, all relating to wireless telecommunications facilities, read and adopted as read. (Citywide)": [
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. So that concludes our presentations. Thank you all for participating. Will now move on to item number one hearing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Number one report from Public Works and Development Services. Recommendation to receive supporting documentation into the record, conclude the public hearing and adopt negative declaration and the 1117 Declare Ordinance amending Chapter 21.56 and Title 15 of the Long Beach Municipal Code read for the first time and laid over to the next regular meeting for final reading.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Adopt a resolution directing the Director of Development Services to submit a request to the California Coastal Commission to certify an amendment to the Certified Local Coastal Program and adopt a resolution authorizing the City Manager to execute license agreements with wireless telecommunication providers and carriers for wireless telecommunication facilities for ten year terms citywide.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. And I see that there's no oath required. Is that correct? That's correct. Okay, so I'll hand it off to Mr. Modica. Thank you, Vice Mayor. The presentation tonight for staff will be given by Craig Beck, our director of Public Works, and Eric Lopez, our project management officer.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor Members, City Council. We appreciate the opportunity tonight to come before you and have a discussion about small cell and some of the work that's been done, not only between city staff and with our technology partners.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'If we give me a minute to get this thing working. There we go. Okay. So just as background information, we wanted to kind of clarify why we're here tonight and where we started. The city currently does have ordinances and rules in place that govern the implementation and placement of macro cell sites.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That requires a conditional use permit and is heard typically by our planning commission. But there's a lot of new technology upgrades and the telecom industry has been evolving and what they're looking for is an opportunity for more localized distribution and placement, and that is generally called small cell or micro cell sites.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So why proposed regulations? What we're finding is the small cell infrastructure that the telecom industry is requesting to be placed really doesn't fit within that typical process that we use for the macro cell sites requiring a conditional use permit.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And that whole process that goes along with issuance of a copy doesn't seem to quite fit again for small cell. So we're here before you to really try to clarify the difference between a macro installation and a small cell installation and have really tailored an ordinance for council's consideration around streamlining that process.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So what we've seen in our due diligence in bringing this ordinance forward to you this evening is there are many locations where small cell is happening without any regulations. And what we're finding is that it is adding to some of the urban visual blight.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'What we believe is important for a city like Lamberts that's investing in its public right of way in its neighborhoods and the esthetics thereof, is that it's appropriate to ensure that these installation meet some of our new standards.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So what you see on the screen are some examples of where that technology can work, where you can hide a lot of the infrastructure needed for small cell within a either new light street light pole or affixed to an existing street light pole, as you see in these images.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The technology is getting smaller and smaller, and therefore the intrusion into the public roadway environment is becoming less and less. So what is before you this evening? So I just wanted to make sure that we illustrate what this ordinance would do.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And the ordinance is really intended to do a couple of things. A streamline the process. So instead of going through a copy which can typically take somewhere between six, nine, sometimes 12 months, we want to make sure that we are fast tracking applications that are coming in.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We are seeing continued interest in placement of small cell in our city and those applications are increasing in the number and the different type of carriers interested in and placement in Long Beach. So we would have two tiers, essentially.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'One is Tier A and that's intended to say if a carrier comes in, meets all the standards, it's something we would call an over the counter approval and we could get that done very quickly. Certainly within 20 days.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We think it would be even less than that, likely two weeks. But then there would be a tier B, which is there are some requests to go outside of kind of the normal standards, which would take a little bit more deliberate deliberation and discussions with the applicant about what they're proposing and how it fits within the city's'",
        "'speaker_7': 'goals. So we want to make sure that we understand that our goal here is to make is to limit visual blight and to really work with the companies to address that. So where appropriate, we think undergrounding of equipment is important.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We would like to explore co-location of equipment. We want to minimize the look of the antennas on street lights. And certainly if an applicant is coming in and wanting to use some of the city assets like a streetlight pole, that there would be some lease revenue generated from the use of that pole.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And then that lease revenue we could negotiate if there was other consideration provided by the applicant. So just to kind of give some background of of the process that we've engaged in thus far, this ordinance was taken to the Planning Commission for review and discussion.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There was some comments that were made and we further deliberated and made additional considerations. For example, in our initial proposal to the Planning Commission, we had a prohibition against placement of wood poles. Certainly we we believe that wood poles are outdated and we should move towards a different material type than the old wood telephone poles.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But we do recognize that there may be situations within our city where it may be appropriate for a wood pole placement. And we didn't want an outright prohibition, but we wanted to have an opportunity to have a discussion with the applicant and and have some discretionary approval over wood poles.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So we made that adjustment. Some of the undergrounding. We do stress that undergrounding is our preferred method, but there may be situations where that isn't possible at the particular location. So again, we wanted to add some discretion and some oversight to to give flexibility to the applicants as they come forward.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We had a prohibition in parks and schools. We understand that those are areas where it might be important to provide public access to Wi-Fi. And so we we softened that approach as well. So we believe we have detailed is an ordinance that addresses both the city goals, where we've listened to the telecom industry, we've taken many of'",
        "'speaker_7': 'their comments and woven that into the ordinance and made some adjustments. So we've we've taken a balanced approach that not only gives us the ability to regulate what happens in our city, but also promotes the expansion of small cell and ultimately 5G, which is typically associated with small cell.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So that concludes staff presentation and we are available for questions. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. So at this point, we'll ask for a public comment on the staff presentation. Now be the time. Give us your name. You have 3.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Minutes. Angela meyer I'm here on behalf of my neighborhood today to talk about 5G.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This is the first time I've done this. I'm nervous.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. 5G was vetoed by the state of California. Okay. So every city has the ability to choose where and how it's placed. The fire department in L.A. banned it. It was getting them sick, so they got rid of it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The state of Michigan banned it. They chose fiber optics, broadband for a safer way.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'To install it.'",
        "'speaker_3': '5G is a military weapon being used by the military right now at 95 gigahertz. So hours will be up to 90 gigahertz and we won't have any control over it. Okay. So it would be 100 feet from our homes, which is really scary if they let them do that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Now, I've been a realtor for 20 years and I can tell you that at least 93% of my buyers will not buy a home or a business that's at least 400 feet from a cell tower. Okay. So this will definitely have an impact on the property values, 20 to 30%.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And you can ask any realtor right now, they'll tell you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That it will lower the property, value, the cost of the home. So there's already some lawsuits out there. Okay. People are suing cities because they didn't put a public outreach out about 5G. And I was going to ask you, if you did that, did you tell the people put a public outreach out so they can see it'",
        "'speaker_3': '? So that might be a future lawsuit for you. Okay. So now we have proof from lab rats. Okay. Tested that. Do they get cancer? Leukemia, among other things. So we know that it does cause cancer. The EMFs. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And close to cell towers. Now, the phone company needs to prove to us that it doesn't cause cancer. They have done nothing to prove to us that it's not going to cause cancer in ten years, which is what they're saying.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'What about our children in ten years? Are they going to die from cancer? I mean, they need to prove to us before they put this on our homes. So there's alternatives, too, for 5G to be safe. You can do fiber optic broadband technology.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's feasible and safer.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think, for everybody.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. So please read the information. I put it up for you. I spent all day printing.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It and a ton of.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Ink.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So please read the paperwork. It's very crucial.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And this is a really.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Important matter.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, alex. Speaker, please. I'm going to romanized this podium here.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Make it a small peoples.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Whatever you want to call it. Small guys think big. Okay? It's going to be little bit shorter than I'm going to use the whole 3 minutes. I just wanted to let you know that the.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That this 5G stuff.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is is a big deal in some of the state. States have decided not to go forward with it. One of the states is Michigan, and that's in some of the documentation that was presented to you by Angela. The reasons they have the pros and the cons, some of the stuff that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think Pat West put out.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Saying that it's safe has been refuted in some of the the information that's there. I hope you guys will take a look at it. The state of California also had a 5G bill that was. Sent packing, basically it was defeated.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So the the state is struggling to, I guess, develop a standard of some sort. So even our own state is having difficulty dealing with this and in how it works. I'm an electrical elect. I'm an electrical engineer. And this does have some some far reaching concerns for me.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Certainly, I don't want to have it in my house that that's the main thing that I'm going to say. There's there's Bernie. There's there's safety issues associated with that. And I'm just going to leave it at that. I don't have a lot of material to put forward to you today.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I haven't had enough time to really put together a coherent process, but I certainly wouldn't want to see this in a residential neighborhood. No way, shape or form, he thinks. Thank you. Next speaker, please. Good evening, Vice Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Council Members. My name is Damian Huggett. I'm a senior manager for engineering with T Mobile and wanted to speak to just for a moment about this proposed ordinance. We love what the ordinance is doing, streamlining the process that's associated with the installation of telecommunications infrastructure.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We believe it does help accomplish the goals of both providing excellent coverage, capacity and capabilities to our customers and your constituents, while at the same time looking out for the esthetic issues that are associated with installations like this in the city of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'T-Mobile is committed to providing additional extraordinary capacity and capabilities for the city of Long Beach. That being said, one of those tools that we do use to provide this additional capacity is indeed small cells. The specific portion of the sources that I want to address specifically related to the ordinance are the strand amounts.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'These amounts allow us to provide a small form factor installation, utilizing the existing infrastructure that's there, maximizing the utility associated with that existing infrastructure without really having to provide anything additional. The fiber and the power that's required for those installations is already on site and it allows us to quickly target areas where capacity is a concern for'",
        "'speaker_1': 'our customers. The the small form factor associated with the Strand mounts is about the size of a small laptop. We know that this technology works and doesn't need to provide this targeted coverage and capacity. So our request for this evening is that the portion of the telecommunications ordinance that specifically prohibits the installation of the strand mounts be'",
        "'speaker_1': 'reviewed. We would like to request a motion that this go back to staff to take a look at that portion of the ordinance and see if we can't work out something that would better provide for these small cell strand mount installations on the existing infrastructure.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We also do recognize that there's a initiative by the city to try to promote undergrounding of the existing utilities. And we do understand that should a small cell be permitted on existing IT pole somewhere and that portion of the pole was moved toward the undergrounding initiative that we would indeed have to remove it and we do acknowledge'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that. And so that we were hoping that you would understand that that wouldn't prohibit the undergrounding initiatives that are going before the city. So if you guys have any questions, I can thank you. Is there any further public comment?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Now would be the time. Okay. Our final public comment. Speaker, will you do? I have no electrical back. I have trouble screwing and a light bulb. But I would suggest, given what we've heard from a number of people, that you take the requisite steps to make sure that the.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Whoever is responsible for building these has the financial backing and will pledge a bond to cover any health. Issues or damage. Done to a structure or particularly a. Human beings, period. And if they're that confident, if they're that confident in their product.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And their system. They should have no problem if they have a problem with it. Hopefully your olfactory senses will kick in. Thank you. Thank you. Next for please. Mr. Chair, members of the Commission. Good evening. My name is John Lee.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm a consultant for T-Mobile. I work closely with Damian as well and just wanted to add a couple of more points to make clear about two issues that came up in the meetings that we have with staff as well as the staff to your offices was the esthetics and the undergrounding and as it is, stacks, I think'",
        "'speaker_1': 'there there was a letter sent to all of the all of you as members and your staffs about just exactly what the small cell looks like on the street amount. And it's no bigger than a laptop. And there was a photo that I saw in the presentation which so the little loops, the, the the mechanism that T-Mobile'",
        "'speaker_1': 'puts up, this is a cut and splice on it and an overhead wiring where Crown has existing power and fiber. So it doesn't look quite like that. The other issue that came up in our meetings was the concern about undergrounding.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So let's assume that this council was so inclined to ask the staff to amend the ordinance to lift the express prohibition, and we were allowed on to do the strand mounts. If, if, if that particular strand mount that pole location was slated for some type of citywide policy to underground.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We recognized and acknowledged we wouldn't have any kind of reserve right now like any other public utility. We would, of course, find alternative locations. And so the point I'm trying to drive home is that we're not in any in any way trying to thwart the city's current policy and goal to underground to eliminate visual blight.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you for your consideration. And I hope that you would do a motion to direct staff to make some changes to that particular express prohibition. Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker, please. Thank you. Vice Vice Mayor Richardson, appreciate the opportunity.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Council members and staff. I'm John Heffernan, AT&T External Affairs Manager for the region. AT&T appreciates that staff efforts to consider our comments as it seeks to develop this this ordinance to regulate regulate the wireless network upgrades in the public rights of way.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think you know, I think Eric Lopez the lead lead program manager for the public works departments, done a great job. He's been responsive and he's been considerate when discussing our concerns. And for us, you know, it's important right now to consider not only the pace of the usage of these connected devices, but also the advancing wireless'",
        "'speaker_1': 'equipment technologies such as small cells. So we think a city like Long Beach, you know, it's it's important, AT&T, that's why we're investing in our wireless network here, not only for the residents, but for the businesses. AT&T small cells will also foster public safety.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'AT&T was selected, as many of you may know, by the federal first responder network authority, FirstNet, as the wireless services provider to build and manage the first ever nationwide public safety wireless network. So each of our new small cell sites, as well as modifications to our existing sites, are going to enhance our capability to improve your first'",
        "'speaker_1': 'responder communications in a crisis. Regarding the ordinance specifically, as a reminder, AT&T has a statewide franchise right to install facilities in the public right away. And we feel like some additional work needs to be done on the ordinance so that it is a smooth and seamless process.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And for example, right now, applications must be coupled with when appropriate prop maps, feasibility studies as well as alternate site analysis. And we're confident that we'll be able to work with the state public works staff to work things out.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But, you know, frankly, Eric did such a good job. I have a feeling he might get recruited way to be promoted to another city. So we just we'd like it if the ordinance language was was real solid. And there's there's a 500 foot separation requirement in residential zones that continues there.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There's also language regarding requiring the the carriers to install street trees or public art and also just, you know, city owned assets. A lot of these small cell antennas will go on city owned streetlights. And we think that the the negotiations for those license fees shouldn't shouldn't begin at $3,000 per attachment.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's high in all circumstances, but especially for small cells. Again, AT&T recognizes all the work that's been done. We appreciate it. And we think we would support a motion to have the ordinance fine tuned just a little bit.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we're all on the same page. Thank you. Thank you for the next speaker, please. Good evening, Vice Mayor. Members of the City Council. My name's Scott Longhurst. I'm the government relations manager for Crown Castle in Southern California.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I'd just like to echo some of the comments made by my cohorts here from the carriers. We appreciate the efforts put forth by your staff, in particular, Eric Lopez. He's done a fantastic job as well as your staff as well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Those of you that took the time to meet with us and listen to our concerns again, I'd like to just reiterate that the need for this technology is based on the consumer demand, and the ever increasing demand for additional bandwidth is driving the need for the wireless carriers to build this type of infrastructure in your city.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Crown Castle is not a wireless carrier itself. We are a fiber optic and telecommunications infrastructure company. What that basically means is we own wireless facilities and we own and operate fiber optic network. So we partner with the carriers and they access our networks in order to backhaul all the data and voice calls on their networks to their'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hub sites. So we're close partner with them. We also provide fiber optic networks to cities like Long Beach and other school districts, hospitals, large businesses that transport a lot of data. So these air interfaces or small cell nodes, as they're called, are really important because they allow the consumer to access it's an access point, if you will'",
        "'speaker_1': ', to the Internet. And so as these 5G technologies that you've heard about are rolled out, it's important that this infrastructure is in place to support that. Now, the 5G standards themselves are going to be approved later this year.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Once that occurs at the federal level and at the Standards Committee level, then the manufacturers, the content producers and the service providers will start adopting those and inserting those 5G chips into their products. And once the next generation of cell phones come out, they'll be able to utilize those higher speeds.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And what we're looking at is download speeds of up to 100 times faster than what we're employing today. So, you know, the paradigm shift in the way that we've communicated over the last ten years since the advent of the smartphone, the iPhone in particular has radically changed how we all communicate as a society.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And this next leap to 5G will be similar. It's going to be a real paradigm shift in how the public and business and everybody communicates with each other. And this infrastructure that we're proposing and building here in your city will support those services.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So again, we look forward to working with the city in the future. We applaud the efforts put forth by your staff. You've taken monumental steps forward. There are, as I mentioned, a few little things, like we'd like some flexibility on the small cell design to be able to utilize that where it truly is the least intrusive means'",
        "'speaker_1': '. So rather than have an outright prohibition, we ask that you consider treating that the same way that you've treated the wood pulse. So thank you very much. Again, we look forward to working with you down the road. Thank for your testimony.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You bet. Max Baker. Police.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening and Cantrell. And I'm not interested in the esthetics of these small cells and where they're placed. I'm interested in the health of the community. I understand there was question about whether to put these in parks and near schools.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I'm wondering what the questions were. Is it because there still is unknown about how these cells affect human health, whether they cause cancer? My husband died of a brain tumor 25 years ago. And at the time, it was suspected that it was caused by his using one of the first car phones constantly.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This has never been located by anybody but scientists at Caltech. Some of them were very suspicious of the effects of not only cell phones, but any kind of a microwave or any of these kinds of waves that are going through the air that how they affect our health.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And until there are studies that are done on this, I think we should slow down on the amount of cells that we put in our community. It seems like you have talked to the people who are wanting to put these up, T-Mobile and the other AT&T.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think it was asked tonight whether you have talked to the public about this. And as far as I know, there has been no public outreach on this. And before you make any decisions on this, I think there should be public outreach and you should know more about the possibilities of health effects.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Hello. My name is Dr. Linda Scholl and I am.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The former.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Vice president of Employee Public.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Affairs and government affairs for Sprint. When Sprint was first being started, we were five people at the time it started. We hired all the RF engineers and we talked to all the RF engineers at that time. And based on that, I would just.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Give the same advice that you've heard already. Please look at the technology.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Understand the placement, and make it a public, transparent process. If you you're going to approve this so that the citizens and residents know what's happening and.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That they can.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Address any issues that they may have.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's serious. The technologies are changing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They may be fine.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm not familiar with the new ones.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I don't know about you. If you are holding your phones.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'These days, I.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Can feel the phone in my hand and I have to set it down. I can't put it in my head, so I don't know what the next technology is going to be like. I know I wouldn't want to be around it if it's going to be by my house and I can't get away from it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So where it's placed and what kind of influence that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Has upon the human health and the public.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Health, I think is really important to know before we make something become an invisible process. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Our last speaker.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I wasn't planning on this, but I was thinking what to say in Europe as opposed to United States of America. A very different approach is taken to something new, whether it's new kinds of seeds, whether it's antibiotics in meat, and the approach is make sure it's safe before you do it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I don't find that much of a problem, but I guess if I were a developer of a new product, it would be one more thing to have to leap over. We do have some FDA testing. We don't and interestingly enough, we don't even test herbal teas or a natural stuff.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So so what I would say is, let's look at who's bringing this product to us. It's Southern California Edison, for one. Well, gee, what else have they brought us in California, our nuclear power plant down the coast. And now they're going to continue to want they apparently have gotten even the approval of the Coastal Commission to bury'",
        "'speaker_3': 'nuclear waste, you know, on site. So people are going to be living with the consequences of that choice, even though the plant shut down. I mean, we're fortunate because of public outcry, public outrage and public outcry, we didn't have 22 or more nuclear power plants in California.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think we don't regret that. I don't regret it. I don't know about anybody else, but it seems to have been the case that maybe nuclear power has a lot more risk than people, the people who brought it to us imagined it possibly could.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I would say, use your imagination, think about all the benefits and all the best case scenarios, and then, you know, use that other part of your imagination, the part that gives you nightmares, you know, and decide because you're choosing for all of us.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And personally, I have no idea. I know you did approve liquefied natural gas. I look right now the lithium battery storage. Now that has something futuristic about it. And you didn't even as a city, feel it was necessary to do an environmental impact report.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I don't know what to say about that. I mean, I know I've come up here a lot and I basically end up just kind of whining around like, please keep us safe. But, you know, it's a risky world.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I guess if we get these cell phone towers, we'll we'll survive somehow. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that concludes public comment. Thank you all. We're going to close public comment now and begin council deliberation. We'll start with Councilwoman Price.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. So I support this this ordinance. However, I do want to. And by the way, Eric Lopez is not going anywhere. We can we can't afford to lose him. He's amazing. So thank you for your work on this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But the question I have for staff is, is there an opportunity to go back, as has been suggested, and further refine some of the issues regarding strand mounts and other nuances of the proposed ordinance that would make the process more efficient in its rollout and come up with something that's a little bit more suited to the concerns'",
        "'speaker_0': 'that were raised.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Councilmember Price. We believe as staff that we've done that, that we've not only met and worked with the telecom industry to make some modifications, but the items that that are remaining from from staff's opinion are items that we're recommending council approve.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And we we put a prohibition against strand mounts because we believe that they add to the visual blight in our community. If council were to take a direction that they wanted to not just pull completely prohibit that opportunity, but to make that approval discretionary, that's something that we believe we could accomplish tonight if that is council's direction'",
        "'speaker_7': '. But I think staff's recommendation is there for a reason. The other item that I.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Heard really related.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'To fees, we understand that we are not the lowest fee structure, but we're also not the highest fee structure. We are recommending a fee for use of our assets at $3,000. But I would would say that that is a a negotiation point that we've we've structured that within the ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So if a telecom provider came and had a public benefit that they wanted to provide in exchange to reduce that fee that is already afforded within the ordinance that we have before council this evening. So from our position, we have streamlined the ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We have addressed the items that have been brought forward by the telecom industry. But we are down to these kind of last two sticking points, and we're moving forward tonight with those recommendations for council's consideration.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you for that. My my motion is going to be to support the ordinance, with the exception that in regards to the use of strand mounts that it be a discretionary approval process and for the development services and public works divisions to jointly come up with a protocol for how a decision would be made in regards'",
        "'speaker_0': 'to the use of those such that esthetic considerations are taken into account. Mr. Mays has something to say.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Councilwoman Price If that were to be your motion tonight, I would be glad to assist you with the precise language to insert in the ordinance so we could have that done tonight, and it could come back as a complete ordinance for second reading next week.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So if we move in that direction and you do make the motion, I would be glad to help you with that language.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So I know I have a few other comments cued up, a few other colleagues cued up to speak. So I am moving in that direction. So if you want to give me some language, I can read that into the record.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I do want to say.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That that prior blight.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Has been a major issue for us as a city. I'm not sure how many of my colleagues have been dealing with this, but this is something that I deal with all the time, and I'm grateful that we're taking steps to be proactive.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'About future.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Installations, but I am concerned about what's currently there. Is it possible and if Sapp is prepared, can you cover just briefly, kind of where we're at with existing wire brite and what what jurisdiction we have as a city to move that issue forward, if any?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Sure. Councilmember So there is something called Rule 20, and it is essentially funding that that we receive through Edison that allows us to underground some of our electrical utilities. And what we find and is typical in many cities and certainly typical in Long Beach, that many utilities will co-locate along the Edison Poles.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So we're not only running, say, electrical wires along poles above ground, but we're also running cable or other utilities. And I think that this discussion about adding this strand, Mount Small Cell, would be above ground on those wires.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And that's one of the reasons that that staff is recommending that we not do that. One of the complications when you move forward with any undergrounding project isn't only the cost of undergrounding, but also coordination with all utilities to ensure that they are aligned with that undergrounding process.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think the gentleman representing one of the telecom companies said that they would be willing to relocate that. I think our hesitation is staff is, well, what does that mean from a process perspective? I would rather have more discretion to to address that if we did move forward with an undergrounding project versus looking at coordinating with yet'",
        "'speaker_7': 'one more utility when we move forward with that process. The utilities do have the right to place them in our right of way. So certainly Edison has done that over the years. But as we find in many new communities, those utilities are now underground in both from.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'An esthetic perspective, but also for safety.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Great.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. I have a number of questions. I'll just add them here. So regarding the questions about health impacts, what is the agency that regulates or evaluates whether technology is safe to be deployed in the public? Vice mayor, the FCC, the Federal Communications Commission is the entity that regulates that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And do we have do we have are we comfortable from a staff position that, you know, the issues raised around the technology, it is safe for us to get behind as a community.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Mr. Vice Mayor, if I could weigh in on this question. The city, as were pointed out in the staff report, does have the ability to regulate in areas such as esthetics, which is primarily what this ordinance is directed to in the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996, specifically prohibits the city from imposing new regulations related to radio emissions'",
        "'speaker_3': '. So this is one of those areas where the federal government has taken the lead and pretty much preempted a city's ability to regulate. And they asked cities to rely on the fact that they have tested this technology and that, in their view, it is safe for to be around residents and humans.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So so it's not even something that the city can the the health issue can't be the basis for a decision on whether or not to allow this technology.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's correct. And that is correct. As to small cell and actually it's correct as to the larger cell sites that were.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Pictured in the initial photos that were shown. Thank you. So my next question. So if the city were not to take any action whatsoever, could this technology still be deployed in our community?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It could. And many of the telecommunications companies take a position that a lot of this they can do as a matter of right. And so that's the reason the city tried to get out in front of this back in I think it was March or April of last year when we adopted and the Council adopted at the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Planning Commission recommendation, what we call the patch ordinance, so that we would have some form of regulation. So this wouldn't get out of control visually from an esthetic standpoint.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So and I asked that just to be clear to the public. Passing a local ordinance actually allows us the ability to limit the technology and control how it's deployed. So it's important that we do sort of engage on this issue before sort of it gets out of hand.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So the next question that I have, our next thought. So, Mr. Beck, you mentioned the ability. So the $3,000 is really a negotiation point and you're able to, you know, sort of negotiate the rate with carriers in exchange for a public benefit.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I like that. So I want to take this opportunity just to toss out some technology or some ideas that I think we should be leveraging that amount for. So first, I would say expand expansion of publicly available access to Wi-Fi parks, you know, public corridors, things like that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then secondly, I would say a few years ago, maybe five years ago, the city did entertain ShotSpotter technology. And at that point, it was too expensive. There was really only one or two companies doing it, and there was a subscription.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But we could potentially leverage this, leverage this in order to sort of see if we can bring that technology. And is that something we can we can discuss or toss on the table? Mr.. Beck.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Vice Mayor. Certainly. Again, we are looking at public benefit options. So we certainly value access to technology in our public spaces. And ShotSpotter technology, from my perspective, is a public benefit.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay, great. Okay. So I want to talk about the SRAM issue. So what is the cost difference between Strand Mount or undergrounding the small cell? What is is there a major cost difference? Why is there such a demand for strand?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think you would have to direct those questions to the telecom industry. I would imagine a strand mount option is cheaper than to. Achieve an undergrounding of a power source and a small scale integration into a new light pole, as an example.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hmm. Yeah. I'm not satisfied with that. With that answer. Well, I'd like to understand better is if we choose to limit and completely sort of exclude stranmillis. Does that mean that that sort of 5G will not be deployed whatsoever because it's not feasible, cost feasible?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Or does it mean that it's just going to cost more and we'll ultimately get there? That's what I'm trying to understand.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Well, I can give you an example. So Crown Castle is here this evening. They did speak on this item. The city actually worked with Crown Castle to move forward with a master license agreement for deployment of small cell down in our waterfront.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'They have roughly 25 to 30 locations of small cell. Those have been in operation for over a year. All of those were placed in New Paltz and almost all of them underground and the utilities as well. I would imagine that Crown Castle didn't do that for free and they aren't losing money on that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You would have to talk to them specifically about the economics, but that is one example of where this is working with the standards that we've shared with you this evening.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. So is Crown Crown Castle still here? Hi. Good evening. Scott Longhurst, government relations manager with Crown Castle. Thank you, sir. Happy to answer any. So my question. My question is the reality of strained mt. financially. If the city were to outright ban strain mount, does that make it financially and feasible to expand 5G or would it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'just. What would be the impact? The actual expansion of 5G, as was referenced by staff, really are the manufacturers of the technology. The Ericsson's, the Nokias of the world are always working to try and make this technology smaller.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that's evidenced by the fact that we are here before you and I talking about small cell. So that was a technology that was really not available to the industry up until about three years ago. So we deployed the traditional macro cells.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Now we basically have taken that and we boiled it down to a small eight by eight by four inch box that has all the technology in it. So there are our recommendation is because we work with all the carriers and they all deploy slightly different equipment because of who their vendors are and what frequencies they transmit and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and other factors. But rather than outright prohibit it because it may be a solution in certain instances, we would like to see the city at least have give the industry an opportunity to propose that it may be in an industrial area where you have lots of overhead, you know, utilities, and we can just integrate it into the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'existing fiber strands. It looks, you know, it's not much different than a splice box that are up there now for fiber optics. You know, cable companies are deploying wi fi nodes throughout the city. These particular units are about the same size as a Wi-Fi cloud.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So rather than prohibit it, allow yourself the flexibility to choose that if it is the best option. Thank you. And then the cost difference between the cost difference is it's not significant. It really is. The cost is in the equipment itself.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Thank you. Certainly. All right. So, Mr. City attorney and we're going to come back with some language of the second reading about the discretionary approval. I would suggest if we're going to do it, we're going to hit that route.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I like how we do. Sometimes we have standard conditions that allow like on liquor store cups, for example, the city council sort of would be able to give direction that could stand up in all different all the different sort of conditions of approval.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So, for example, if new technology comes out or there's a new standard and it's smaller, we'd like to be able to insert across the board a condition through this process that says this is the esthetic requirement. And then the other thing I would say is I would like to, you know, sometimes with the conditional process, certain areas'",
        "'speaker_1': 'of towns are just less engaged than other areas of town. And I would hate to, you know, to say that a conditional process to approve this technology, you know, under you know, in the years to come, you know, someone else say it's a different city council there and they may not be on top of making sure that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'we don't have this technology, this or that. So what I'd like to do is see if there is a way to sort of called carve out like major corridors and say, you know, we still want to if ideas blight, I don't want to see this on Artesia Boulevard.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I want to see this on the major corridors, on strands or behind someone's house. If there's this esthetic and it makes sense, in my opinion, I think we can go through a process. So I like the idea of still creating a path for technology to improve and for us to address the esthetic issue and the blight issue'",
        "'speaker_1': '. But I sort of also want to sort of protect the major our major corridors from having this visual blight. Is there a way that we can do both?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Mr. Vice Mayor, members of the City Council, if I could read to you the language that we would.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Propose to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To insert tonight that would.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Solve the problem. I think we could do that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If you could adopt this language, we could do it tonight as a first reading, because it's actually a very simple, straightforward change to the existing draft ordinance. But if we get into a situation where we try to articulate on a quarter by quarter basis, there's no way we could do that tonight.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we would have to bring this back for first reading some other time. So what we would propose in regard to Stranmillis is if you have the draft ordinance in front of you at page 41.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That small Roman numeral number four, we would.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Change the existing language to add the word stranmillis basically two times, and the new language would read.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'New word poles.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And strand mouths may be allowed by.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The director of Public.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Works if the applicant demonstrates that a wooden pole or strand mount is less and.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Less impact or tactful.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'From public safety, visual and logistic. Standpoints at a specific location.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we did the director of Public Works.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The ability on a case by case basis to make an evaluation and come to a determination in an appropriate situation if a strand mount would be or would fall is appropriate.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So the public works director could.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Take into consideration, as you mentioned, things such as, you know.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'A.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Corridor that is highly visible where you might not want to strand mount and maybe they would use their discretion not to allow it there. But in an area, in an industrial area where there's already a lot of overhead and it didn't visually add to the impact they could grant it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But again, it would be a case by case.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm comfortable with that. If the maker of the motion likes that language, I'm comfortable with that language.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sure.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I still have discretion for grand mal.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's to the discretion of the public works director. And so we would work with the public works director to make sure that discretion is well defined. And it would go in the ordinance where.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We've already given the director discretion on a case by case basis to permit.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'New would poles so.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They would have the same type of discretion to evaluate either one.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good. And then the final thing that I have is I want to I want to do we have the ability, Mr. Beck? You know, if the the technology is going to be deployed, I'd love for it to be deployed more like the LED lights than the bikeshare.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. Let's let's have let's sort of have randomize it across the city map sort of a market based model that has something we can monitor.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I believe that's a dig at Bikeshare. But no, the applications come in from the telecom industries and they're driving the locations, and I'm assuming they're basing that on some client service needs.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. I would say if there is an ability somehow and I know it's hard to figure out at the dice, but there's an ability to say you've already installed 20 of them over here. You need to get over to the other side of town before you approve any of the other ones on this site.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have ability to still do that. See the attorney saying no. We're really limited on on.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The types of regulations. So if they come to us and demonstrate that there's a need in a particular location and they otherwise meet the criteria, the statute or the ordinance, then we would have to let that go in.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And if their choices to deploy it first in one part of town and not the other.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Trying to get to a cap and trade wi fi situation. But I guess we won't get there. Thank you. That's all my questions, Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. And thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor, you asked a lot of questions on a lot of the questions, actually, that I had prepared already. I do think and I want to thank Councilmember Price for.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Her her.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Her thought to add discretion and flexibility to our ordinance. I think it's very important that we have local control. Last year, the city council opposed SB 689, which was a a a bill that was mentioned, but in public comment that had overwhelming legislative support, by the way.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And if it weren't for the governor vetoing the bill, it would be law today. Today we're talking about having the ability to negotiate up to and what is recommended here is $3,000 per site. Had that bill been passed last year, it would have been $250 per site across the board.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'One size fits all for every city in the state of California. And so to to the point raised earlier, I think it's important for us to to move on something today, because today we have local control and we have the ability to to do that, for our inability to to have a say where these sites are placed'",
        "'speaker_8': ', how they're placed, and how much we charge for them to be placed there. So with that, I like the the amended motions and I will be supporting. So thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Quick, quick question. What is market rate on that on these clearly very high low. What do we set in the market at 3000?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So, vice mayor, as I mentioned earlier, we are not the highest. We are not the lowest in our review of other cities. An example is Lakewood, which is about 2000, San Francisco, which is 4000. So we're in between both of those.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Thank you, Councilmember Stabler. Thank you. I, too, can support the motion. And in partial answer to the vice mayor's question, there are instances where it is physically impossible to underground. So I think this would be another application that's probably covered in your language that you gave us.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Also, I think the language in a perfect world would have come from the telecom industry. I'm not sure if our assistant city attorney got it from that direction, but it did. It might have. It just didn't come to me.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I don't know if this suits them, but I'll support this. Thank you. Councilmember Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes, I want to thank my colleague, Councilmember Price for her amendment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I thank you guys for coming out and educating us. Definitely. It's exciting days whenever you have.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'A variety of issues, including small cell towers. So I did have a couple of questions for staff. Could you just remind us, when was the first time we.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Heard discussion that this was going to be happening for some of those residents that feel like today was their first time?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So Councilmember, this initially came up last year. We've been working on this ordinance for over 12 months. I believe it was February, earlier this year when it went to Planning Commission. It was scheduled to be read by council in March, and there was a request to spend some more time addressing some of the telecom industry's ideas about'",
        "'speaker_7': 'how to amend the ordinance. We've been doing that and we're before you tonight as councilman or excuse me, as city attorney Mays indicated, we did bring forward to council a patch ordinance, and that was, again, to try to ensure that as best as we can.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Long Beach maintains some local control over the deployment and esthetics of how small cell expands in our city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Great. Thank you. And I just have two more questions because, yes, the vice mayor did a great job of covering everything in that conversation around basically.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Having equitable distribution of.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'New small cells. Could the city at its discretion, since.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We've listed 3000 as that revenue, could we reduce.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That to say, 15.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In areas where we see.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The digital divide as the greatest.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To try to incentivize.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Putting them in? Yes, I want to amend my earlier answer because there is some hope as far as the city having the ability to control somewhat the deployment of these. And that is and what I forgot to mention, but Craig covered in his staff report.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The city is actually the landlord on a number of these poles. So and that's a different situation than when they want to put their own poles in or they want to utilize an existing pool. So we're we're the landlord.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If they come to us and say they would like to use a pole at a particular location. The city always has the ability to, as part of that negotiation process, to see if we can get them to say, okay, we'll let you put it in on these four poles that belong to the city in this area.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But what we'd also like you to do is consider adding two poles in another location. So we do have that ability as part of the back and forth negotiation, being a landlord. That's great. So that's good. I don't think we were supposed to be able to recover cost recovery, so to reduce the amount would not necessarily be'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the correct thing to do. But we are.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Leveraging.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Ourselves as a landlord would be the better way to approach deployment on an equitable base. And that's already. And you're saying we already have that ability right now? Yes. As a landlord, we have that ability as a landlord.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Great. Because I know.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That from talking to some folks, I know there's an interest.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In the industry to make sure that we're closing the digital.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Divide. So I would ask that staff, when you guys are working on this, really try to identify I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Know that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Councilmember Gonzalez is cued up next and she's done a lot of.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Work on the digital divide. So whatever information we have in the city, if we could use that as an opportunity.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To try to close that gap, I think it would be really helpful. I think you guys covered all the rest of the questions. I would.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Say in.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In conversation around the Strand Towers. I mean, you guys gave us staff, gave us for photos, and then I have a photo.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'From the industry, which is a very different photo with a lot less wires. That definitely looks something that's more appealing. So as we're talking about installing those.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Recognizing that we're not installing things from.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You know, 20, 30 years ago, that this will be more esthetically pleasing than what we currently have. So with that, I support the amendment and the item. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. Thanks for the work as well. I just want to ask if we can receive report back basically quantifying the amount of small strand mounts. Is that something that's easy to do if we're able to do that and see where there?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I know I'm giving you extra work, but the reason being is because and we've talked about it, but just to put it out there again and reinforce the message, we know that these are concentrated over concentrated in certain areas.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And from what I understand, new places like the western portion of the city, many T-Mobile users and many T-Mobile users, of course, because of the technology, require the small strand. But perhaps there's a way that we can quantify that and see if we can lessen that load, you know, for those areas with that with that blight.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I can't remember the exact question.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think what I would add is that right now we don't have any strand mounts that we've approved. So through the application process, I anticipate some will come forward if council takes the action that they're contemplating this evening.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And we can certainly track that and be able to report to council where those requests are coming in. The locations of those requests, which request were approved and which requests were denied.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'It is an issue and it affects a lot of residents. And the what we're trying to do is not to actually stop the events, but try to find mitigation methods, try to PowerPoint speakers out to sea, or to try to find other ways to mitigate the sound levels.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And there's a lot of different tactical ways that that can be done. And one of the best ways to find out what the actual impact is, is to actually get a study done by the city so we can get actual real measurements.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that's why I'm in support of this particular agenda item, and I encourage you all to vote for it. Thank you very much. Thank you. And next speaker, please. Good evening, Vice Mayor and city council members. I'm Robert Fox.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm the executive director of the Council of Neighborhood Organizations. You may have met me before. The Council of Neighborhood Organizations has outreach to our leaders and find that we all agree that the noise level and continued lack of mitigation or abatement in the downtown sector is unacceptable.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The impact on the health and well-being of citizens is severe, especially as our population ages. As a side note, I know when I was 22 I probably enjoyed louder music than I to as I've aged, and I think maybe my ears have changed, but I just, I don't know, I can't even go into a bar, you know'",
        "'speaker_1': ', and it intolerable for me because I can't talk to people and you know, I love to talk. So we are concerned about the the municipalities laws as recently tweaked by staff because they seem to be in in contradiction to the laws of the state of California regarding noise.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Just because a staff wants to change a word or rewrite a definition does not mean the issue has gone away. Ultimately, in a contest between the city and the state, the state will prevail. One cannot just define something as temporary and exist and exempt it, which is in our statute right now.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'One can't use the word occasional and exempt it occasional. Now, in real terms is every week in the city of Long Beach. It is time now to address noise as a continuing factor as a city develops its tourism and attraction businesses in the downtown and shoreline areas.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Our Special Events Director. Our suggestion is should not be the point person in defining new noise ordinance suggestions. Perfect. However, there's a conflict of interest here between her position as an advocate for the role of tourism and business activity in the city and the possible negative report that may come out of this particular request.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we'd like to see some outside agency perhaps selected to be in charge of this process. This has been a difficult time for the citizens of Long Beach regarding the process. They've it's been a stop stop thing a long time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we'd like to see it go forward. And we hope that, you know, Council Member Pearce's project is going to work very well, hopefully as quickly as possible. And we hope we don't get to a place where we're having to deal with that conflict between state law and our city's law.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'You may not be able to see much of me, but I hope you can hear me. And I'll give us your name. I am begging you to please approve this recommendation. The noise level is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So bad.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That it's very difficult to live with because it's frequent and it intrudes our homes. I put in earplugs. I use a sound canceling mops. And I've invested very heavily and I'm trying to get some form of soundproofing in my unit.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I've bought heavy curtains that cost me a lot of money. I have now tripled paying windows to try to deaden sounds and the sounds still come through. It's mainly bass type vibration. There's nothing that seems to stop it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I would like.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Very much to have some peace or a peaceful environment in my home. And yes, I do believe the city should have a lot of events. I enjoy music and I also enjoy the, you know, going to events. But I will tell you, the sound level is so unreasonable and we need to address it.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'We love events, but not the unacceptable noise and smoke which affects our health. Even the animals, like dogs and cats, get restless, disturbed. I have seen that myself. I understand what the health issue is because I am a registered nurse.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'we enjoy music, all kinds of music. But there are three components. It's not. Its first one is the sound pressure level. Anything above 55 hertz but DB in most cases that we have been measuring, the noise can reach above 85 DB and that is harmful.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That last weekend, for example, I measured from my balcony hundred and ten DB two days in a row, all day long. Prolonged exposure. This is the second thing. So it's not just the level we have to measure the time we are exposed to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If you're exposed to 65 DB for half an hour or an hour or two, you might be okay. But if you're exposed to all day long, you will have harm, will be oh, it will be close to you.'",

They have information and educational fact sheets for event planners, so they are going to the tee on all of their noise levels and environmental impacts and health impacts to residents.

Where a permit that we're allowing in one part of the city is impacting a part of the city that's two miles away from the next county. I mean, that that just just should never happen because my residents didn't have any notice whatsoever that that was going to happen.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Good afternoon, Vice Mayor Richardson, members of the council. I'd like to present to you a brief overview of this request for an amendment to an existing development agreement for the River Dale Development Project. I like to just summarize this.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The site location here at the very north of your screen, the the vertical I'm sorry, the horizontal street there is the Alamo Boulevard. To the west is the Los Angeles River. That's the westerly boundary of the project. To the easterly boundary, it's Long Beach Boulevard.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Into the south is the Union Pacific Drive. The site there that you see outlined is the Riverdale, the location of the Riverdale Project. And the Oregon Park Project is the site of the formerly named Oregon Park, but it's now been renamed to Molina Park.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And those are the two projects that are the subject of this development agreement, which I'll be going into briefly. So just a really brief overview of the Riverdale Development Project. It's a new 131 unit, subdivision project, detached single family homes, and they sit on a 10.5 acre site.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It is, as many of you know, it is the former will J. Read Boy Scout camp in the The Riverdale Project. The subdivision was approved by Planning Commission and by the City Council back in 2015, and it was approved in conjunction with the development agreement.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'neighborhood and to the west there, if you look to the left of your screen, that's the location of of the Los Angeles River. And you can see there the the vertical area going down into the project is the main entry the project has.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's a gated community with private streets and they have on site park area within the project of these 131 units. Okay. So here's a just a an image of the three different product types within the project. So I'll go directly into the development agreement and the request.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Essentially, the development agreement that was approved by the city provides an obligation for the developer to construct the Molina Park, formerly Oregon Park, and the construction in addition of of onsite improvements throughout the and on the site itself, but also several of the streets surrounding the park.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We know that the approximate cost of the improvements to the Molina Park are approximately $3.4 million, and that is in addition to the costs for the upgraded streets that are in the surrounding area. And there are other infrastructure improvements and I won't go into those in detail.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But essentially the terms of the development agreement called for a partnership between the city and the developer for those infrastructure improvements, the construction of the park in exchange for the development approvals on the project and one of the other requirements for annual review of the developers compliance with the terms of the development agreement.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I would just note that they have received a 2016 and 2017 approval of their annual compliance through the Planning Commission. So the subject of the request for tonight's consideration is that essentially the most significant term of this development agreement is the construction of the Molina Park and the associated improvements, the offsite improvements.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I would just note that in discussions with the Parks Department staff, they have noted that the the process for the improvement of the park have been moving along generally according to schedule, and they're on track for completion for mid-May.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So sometime next month the developer anticipates being completed with the project. Following completion of the project, there would be a 90 day period during which the city makes a determination as to whether or not all of the improvements on the site are acceptable to the city, in which case the the park would then be turned over to'",

        "'speaker_6': 'conducted. So the way that that was addressed in the development agreement initially was for to require that the developer, prior to issuance of the 33rd certificate of occupancy for the homes that the city have accepted the Molina Park improvements by the city and to accept those improvements prior to the issuance of the 67th certificate of occupancy for'",
        "'speaker_6': 'the homes that they constructed. The other provision was that, or I should note that to date 48 building permits have been issued for 48 of the homes. 36 permits are pending for the homes, and a total of 20 certificates of occupancy for the homes have been issued.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So essentially 84 of the of the total 131 units or somewhere in the building permit process. So specifically, the request of the developer in the way of amending the current development agreement is to change the requirement so that rather than completing the part prior to the issuance of the the 33rd certificate of occupancy, they be allowed to'",
        "'speaker_6': 'complete the park prior to the issuance of the 49th certificate of occupancy the second. So the cities in negotiating those provisions or that request with the the developer, the city has proposes that they would actually halt building inspections at the rough framing stage.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That is prior to the completion of the framing of the project after the 48th certificate of occupancy until the park is complete. Essentially, it assures that the city has complete control of the project and that we can assure that the improvements that are outlined in the development agreement are completed prior to the developer being able to get'",
        "'speaker_6': 'any building permit. So that's really essentially the city's it's essentially a carrot and a stick. That's the city stick to make sure that those improvements are completed.

The other component of this project, aside from those two components which change when the park has to be improved and when they could be issued, their final certificates of occupancy is a strip of land that's immediately to the west of the project site that's currently owned by the County of Los Angeles Flood Control District.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I'd like to show you a brief sketch that shows you this property. This piece of property is immediately adjacent to the river. It is actually owned by the L.A. County Flood Control District. And initially when the development agreement was being crafted, because that that strip of land was immediately adjacent to the park property and it was'",
        "'speaker_6': 'already landscaped and fairly well maintained, there was some perception that maybe we could just incorporate that as a part of the park. However, the developer just advised the city that since it is owned by the Los Angeles County, it's not really practical for the city to own it and incorporate it as a part of the project or'",
        "'speaker_6': 'as a part of the park. So the request as a part of the other request for the amendment is to to detach and to remove the requirement for the the park to include this strip of land that the city doesn't own, nor does the city maintain it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Currently, this property, because it is owned by the county, is actually maintained by the Los Angeles County Parks and Recreation Department. And further, the city's Park Department weighed in and indicated that there is no reason or it would just be additional cost for the city's Parks Department to maintain this strip.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So they are in full agreement with eliminating or removing this strip from the from the description of the park or the requirement in the development agreement to maintain this as a part of the city's park. So that's essentially the background of this request for the those two amendments to the part inclusive of the strip being removed.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Staff supports the requested amendment because these amendments allow continued accountability of the developer and compliance with all of the terms of the development agreements obligations. The developer has to date operated in good faith in terms of over the first two years of the project.'",

And we would just note that the Planning Commission held a public hearing on this item back in March, March 20th of 2018, and they recommended that the City Council support and adopt an ordinance amending the'",
        "'speaker_6': 'development agreement. This is a public hearing. So public notice was required and the notice has been mailed out to property owners within a 1000 foot radius of the park site. And we've also published notifications in the local newspaper.'",

In addition to staff responding to any questions. And I'd also like to acknowledge Scott Kinsey, who is the project planner on this project, and he is also available.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Has been.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Impacted. It's a it's a dust bowl, aside from the recent winds that the lot is, you know, just unpaved. It's it's a dirt park. They they removed five mature trees.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we're getting.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'A lot of dust. We're getting a lot of traffic from the construction. And also since the the park is they finished the the playground and they finished the the restrooms, but there's no fencing to speak of around the park.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Other than temporary fencing. If they were to stop.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Working on it now.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I shudder to think what would become of that park.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so I just feel that, you know, the the the neighborhood's kind of gone through a a difficult process with all of this construction.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And the sooner that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We can complete at least the park, I think the neighborhood would feel a lot better about putting up with the rest of the inconvenience. Thank you very.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. My question is, is that I think.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Let's start with your name for the record.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. This way, Marsha. I'm sorry. My question is, is there building a gated community? But they're saying you're going to have access to the park or whatever and it's along the riverbed. What they're not saying is that is homeless people that live in these different areas closer to the riverbed that are being pushed out, being threatened'",
        "'speaker_3': ', being harassed, stabbed, being thrown away, you know, and it's like, yeah, regardless of the person is human, is that living inside of the house or outside of the home? You still post the respect the person, treat them with humane, you know, humanity and respect.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And it's not being done. A lot of these developers come in and they start building or whatever the case would be. You have officers dispatched like, okay, well these people are a nuisance, are just in our way, so we need to move them by any means necessary.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But you guys are telling the developers, okay, we'll give us $3 million, give us the park, and we allow you to do certain things or whatever the case would be. Every time I come here, every meeting I have, I hear about how you guys turn around and say how you want to help the community, the city, the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'residents or whatever. But you guys continue to have the residents and the community and the developers and the retailers at each other's throats. All the money that these guys put in, you have them attacking each other is never one group that is agreeing with the other.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'A got to be some kind of mutual agreement for something to get along. But as you guys know that, hey, this is going to mess with these people, oh, we're going to accept it. But they are we're going to turn it over to these people, whatever.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I mean, that's just biting at each other. And you guys supposed to be here to, like, eliminate that, but it seems like got more and more fuel to the fire as you go along. Then other people that are, you know, resonates.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They're like, well, when did this come into play or when was this at the hearing or why you guys didn't answer this or why you guys didn't answer that? And you are so quick to pass a bill or say, Yeah, let's agree to this, they got to retract it or bring it back or whatever.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'When you guys already don't take these people money, $3 million or whatever. So if people weren't agreeing, it is you're building gated communities. Why is homeless people where you are getting millions for. I don't see no homeless building is going out.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There's 21 stories in the air or seven stories or whatever the case would be which opposed the got all this money to help with homelessness. Okay. And nothing is being done. Guys, have a good night.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hi. My name's Abby. I'm a resident of the Dominguez Gap neighborhood, where the Riverdale Riverdale Riverwalk are going to be interchangeable, is being developed. And I'm here to ask you to reject the amendment to the development agreement submitted by Riverdale and Brandywine.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'When this development was first proposed, there was quite a bit of neighborhood resistance. One of the selling points made by Brandywine at several town hall meetings was their plan to build a park and soccer pitch on the corner of Oregon and Alamo, which would benefit the entire community.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Riverdale is now requesting that the city increase the number of certificates of occupancy to 49 homes prior to the park's completion rather than the contractually agreed upon 33, which is an additional 16 homes. And then also to quote, they want to halt the building permit issuance after the 117th home until Molina Park is accepted by the city'",
        "'speaker_3': 'instead of the original requirement of park acceptance prior to the issuance of the 67th Certificate of Occupancy. If I'm interpreting this quote correctly, this seems to be semantics. Basically requesting permission to delay completion of the park until 67 homes have received certificates of occupancy, which equals a total of 34 more homes than they originally agreed to initially'",
        "'speaker_3': 'agreed to, which is double the amount, almost with the caveat that they would be punished severely. No more building permits if they fail. I suspect they have locked down plans to finish the park before the 67th certificate of occupancy.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think the important question here is why are they so far ahead with the villa construction and so far behind with a park? I think I know the answer. There's no investment return on the park, but I believe a contract is a contract.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I see no reason for the city to allow delays on the agreed upon completion of the Molina Park. The completed park will benefit countless residents consenting to this amendment will only maximize profits for a private developer. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Our next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hi, my name is Gabrielle Weekes. I live in the second district but represent all of South L.A. County for the Sierra Club. This gated development, I feel, is a real lost opportunity for the city. And I know I said this back when all the permits and the project were being allowed.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think this gated development could have had a local hire requirement, maybe some union workers. I know it's a little late, but as we move forward with new development, union electricians and carpenters, union plumbers, this would be a good opportunity for some for to make stronger buildings and with, you know, good jobs locally and there's no affordable'",
        "'speaker_3': 'units. And this is I understand I'm hoping that going forward, we could do a little better. And maybe even for a city that wants to be green, have some green components required. Next, big development, you all green light, maybe some increased insulation.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we're not using so much HVAC and energy, maybe solar panels on the roof. A friend of mine bought a townhouse in Signal Hill and they made the whole development with a lot of environmental attributes. He's got low flow showerheads, beautiful solar panels.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They put down tile in a lot of places because it's easier to upkeep than carpet, and the whole thing is really green and well-insulated. And I asked him if he paid extra for his his unit to be like that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'He said, no, they're all like that because it's upscale, because people pay more for it, because it's the way of the future. If Signal Hill can do that, I'd like to think we can do. And his wasn't gated as if the neighbors can't be trusted.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I think that's kind of more of a that's how I sort of feel we might want to go for in the future. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Let's pick be complete. Good evening Vice Mayor Council members. I'm here on behalf of Indigo, who was the original firm that got the entitlements for the River Walk project, now named River Dale. Joan behind me is from Brandywine.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'He'll be speaking in a minute. I want to point out the positive news. A lot of times we come down here and there's the negatives. Let me point out some positive news for the city to take into account here.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Every single phase that was proposed so far is sold out. You think about that for a minute. How many single family homes have been built in Long Beach in the last, say, five, six years? Single family homes, not apartments?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Every single phase has been sold out. We're talking up there by Delamar. What, the 710 do you want the value of those homes are the sold out? The minimum is over 600,000. Some of them are 700,000. Now, the fact that there's interest in getting these homes, that's what's amazing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's what Lambie should be talking about, is you're taking brand new homes in a community, you're improving the surrounding community. I live up in the eighth, you're surrounding the community around there with property tax increment. Their benefit of their homes, their value of their homes is going to go up.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Where do you see 600, $700,000 homes being built in Long Beach these days? You don't. I think the developer should be commended for building a project like that. The part will be done shortly. You'll have that finished and you're going to have a terrific community up there.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's a testament to what you guys approved. Thank you very much. Thank you. Next week, a police vice-chair, member of the city council, Alex Hernandez, representing the ownership of the Riverdale development. I want to thank you for taking this opportunity to listen to us on the positive news.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'A guest update, more on those facts. We have actually moved in 20 new families into Riverdale and we have sold 80 homes to this point. So basically, people are waiting for these homes to be finished at this point for construction.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's been very well received in the community and we've done everything we can to be a good neighbor. With regards to the delays on the park. There was no, you know, strategy or anything of that nature. It's just a matter of thinking about the different agencies and coordinating the different efforts between the city parks departments, building departments'",
        "'speaker_1': ', public works departments, Edison, and then even the county. As we were reaching out to them to try to get agreement, agreements on easements and things of that nature took a lot longer than we expected. We're underway. We're moving this thing that this park will be completed probably in the next month or so.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hopefully you've seen some of the progress we've made out there in the community. We will turn that park over when it's accepted to 100% to the city satisfaction. We have already contracted the $3 million worth of work out there and we will can then continue to finish up all of our improvements per the original agreement.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we're satisfying all the original requirements all. Unfortunately, we got hit with an unfortunate delays. And that's all this amendment is addressing is giving us more time to finish those improvements. Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Anna Kristensen. Well, I have to disagree with the prior speaker in saying that's all the amendment is asking for is more time. Because what the amendment is also asking for is for the city parks department to be released from the strip of public land.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's the county land. Now, this was not a surprise when the city entered into this agreement or the developer entered into it. It wasn't like they didn't know it was county land. And I think that when you're looking at the tradeoff here, which, of course, is a tremendous sacrifice of public space that we could have had, I'",
        "'speaker_3': 'mean, as a swimming pool person, you know, that could have been the actual forest public pool in Long Beach. But those that's chance slipped away. So what I would say is, you know, let's look at this strip of county land.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If the developer and the city aren't interested in that open space, then let's have some more open space, maybe a couple less houses, a little more park space or some more amenities for the park, but or maybe even contributing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Here's an idea to the upkeep and maintenance of the Dominguez Gap wetlands, which on one minute are beautiful. And the next minute when you take your friend there from San Francisco, are filled with dead fish. So there's there's an issue, even there, of maintenance.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So let's get something other than a, you know, more upscale housing in a gated community. Let's let's get something natural. Thank you and thank you for listening and not, you know, being more preoccupied with candy than with public speaking.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's really disheartening. I got to say, I know I'm over it line, but at least I didn't yell it. Please, people, if you don't want to listen, have public comment, don't have it. Let's cut it for one minute.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But if you if you agree to for public comment, then at least try to stay off your cell phones. It's like being back a teacher in high school, man. Come on.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please. Hello. My name is Andrew Carroll. I live in the second district. Thank you for listening.

        "'speaker_1': 'Also, I'm not sure why we need a park for people who up front in backyards, but that's a different question too. There's a lot of privilege in this conversation and not a lot of narrative about some of the other sides of these issues.'",

I was very, very steadfast in and heart with the and was was proud of the development agreement that was negotiated because it held the developers feet to the fire to build homes, but also to develop and deliver a park.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But what we did not foresee in for forecast is the construction delays that come with the entitlement process. This was a multi-agency endeavor. They had to deal with the Army Corps of Engineers, L.A. County, several city departments, departments.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'This is a good project. And to the point that this is going to delay anything. I don't see that happening and I don't see that that is in anybody's interest that the park is going to be delayed. I think if anything, it'll be fast tracked.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But what what I understand from the changes that that have come forth, this is just an insurance policy to make sure that that that that everything falls together in line. As you can see, the park is close to being complete as is.'",

By this material, we have the effluent of the Los Angeles River and the San Gabriel River servicing upwards of 15'",
        "'speaker_1': 'million people, delivering their throwaways to our ocean and beaches. And maybe that's why I got into this. Maybe I saw it before other people saw it. I saw it in the middle of the ocean before other people realized what was going on.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Now that term ubiquitous is getting no pushback. It's proven it is everywhere. It's in the air we breathe now. So we need to take steps to eliminate this threat. And eliminating Styrofoam is a step in that direction. Now, I collected some plastic from the gyre, sent it to China.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They invited me to their first plastic conference at the mouth of the Yangtze River, which is the dirtiest river in China. That's the parallel to Long Beach. So I'm now going to China to do the very same thing or raise that awareness that you now are acting on.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you all for the hard work on this. It was very comprehensive, the outline and the ordinance, so thank you for reading that. That was excellent. I support the ban wholeheartedly. We need less plastic pollution. Plastic straws should be next, please.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'And they came back up with samples from every death and every living creature had plastic in a system, which means we have terminated a whole food chain. There is no safe place, no more the ocean where there is no plastic anymore.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then we talk about being a tourism city. What do you think people will say when they see this stuff on the beach? They take pictures and send it back home and their families. This hurts tourism, which hurts jobs.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then to our children, they've got to play in this stuff. What does it do to them? I think it's time we start to practice what we preach and actually clean up our city. Because a captain said won't be harbor in the city is now one big trash can.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We are the worst. I've heard it more than once and I see it every day. And I would like to ask you to go down there and walk every day for a whole week and tell you what you see down there and take pictures of it.'",

Because of the great discussion that you all had in October, I think there were a lot of improvements made to the original, original proposal, including a phased in approach, education, having exemptions for businesses that might be impacted with an undue burden, having utensils and straws only provided upon request, which is a win win solution'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that improves the environment but also reduces costs for businesses in going beyond just Styrofoam, looking at the impact of the materials themselves and focusing on products that are recyclable and compostable, which will mean that we're improving the environment and making it easier for the city and for our businesses to comply with state environmental mandates and to improve'",
        "'speaker_1': 'our environment. I just want to say that I support the ordinance as is with no amendments. I think that as previously discussed, we are in a crisis due to plastics impacting the environment and it is a particular burden on the city of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And all the more reason for us to be leaders in developing an ordinance that I think will be a model for other jurisdictions to adopt. Stopping these plastics at the source and reducing that pollution is the most effective way to reduce the impact on our beaches.'",

And I just want to thank you for all for bringing this proposal forth, and especially Dr. Charles Moore and Gabrielle Weeks and Kirby Skyfire for your endless commitment to banning plastic and protecting our environment.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I guess I haven't heard any other Indigenous people get up, so I guess I'll speak to that perspective that, you know, the earth is sacred. And I have read Dr. Moore's book and I'm big fan of your work, and he also I'm a founder of Protect Beach Wetlands.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we've got a youth group that's really been committed to cleaning up some of the trash on the highways, along the wetlands in Los Cerritos in an effort to get to know the land better. And we go out maybe every every second, Sunday of the month, every second and fourth Sunday.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We've been collecting trash in giant ten gallon bags. And there's so much plastic and Styrofoam along the highways, we fill up usually like five or six bags. And so we just really need to get rid of this in in our environment.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And from what I know, it's already part becoming part of our molecular structure. So, you know, it's it's like in everything we eat in the fish, in the ocean and the garbage patch is like twice the size of Texas and it's just sitting there waiting to come ashore.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So anything you guys do to get rid of plastic, I don't think the small restaurant business is going to suffer that much. There's plenty of alternatives in terms of other materials you can use. I'm very familiar with Kirsten Bowman and she uses bamboo containers or she is this continues to take home that are like cardboard.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And, you know, they're pretty durable. Even if you get like a big juicy burger or whatever, it doesn't even leak through. So, you know, we need to get rid of the Styrofoam and the plastic. And thank you very much for your support on that.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'And I thought that the council very.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thoughtfully stretched out the implementation phase, which I thought made a lot of sense. And the other thing that really struck me was you querying.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'This is a pretty.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Easy issue to get your head around and to implement. It's merely swapping out a polluting and toxic product for something that's more sustainable. And I really do think about what this ocean will look.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Like and what this world will.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Look like five, ten, 2000 years. And the oceans.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Full of.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'Shukla. Councilwoman Gonzalez, Mayor Garcia, thank you for your leadership on this issue. As someone who grew up at the mouth of the San Gabriel River, this is something that would be very welcome, very much support the measure. As you know, toxicity is an issue across many different forms of product and attribution.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Some of the other issues associated with it are going to be issues for us.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Thank you very much. Next speaker, please. All right. Hello. My name is Seamus Ennis. I'm with the Long Beach chapter of the Surfrider Foundation. Hey, guys. Thanks for having us. Good job. City council and staff, we really appreciate the effort and the time that you put into this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'When I joined the Surfrider Foundation in 1999, it was kind of on the radar. But by 26, we started sending residents along. We started sending thousands of postcards to you, the mayor and the city council. And so you've been aware of this position from lots of our residents for many, many years.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so we then the city itself has been working on it for about 13 years, and now we're looking at the implementation schedule of about 18 months. So we think that's pretty modest. You know, we think 18 months isn't too fast because we already been working on it for 13 years.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So the Long Beach chapter, Surfrider Foundation fully supports this ordinance as written, and we think you should just go ahead, go forward with it. And the final point is, we think it's pretty business friendly as well, because we've looked at a lot of restaurants that have already transitioned over from Styrofoam to other products.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And it's been modest changes from a few percentage points up to about equal. And we have 40, at least 40 ocean friendly restaurants that we've already awarded and given them attaboys. And it has been no big deal for them and their customers actually appreciate it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we think you can do it with the 18 month schedule as written is fine and it's not it doesn't hurt businesses at all. So thank you for your time. Thank you. Next speaker, please. Hello, everybody. Mayor, city council members.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'My name is Michael Doshi. Thank you so much for having me here this evening. Over the years, I've been a volunteer with five Gyres Institute, a member of Heal the Bay Speakers Bureau up in Santa monica, the rise of plastics manager for Los Angeles's Surfrider chapter.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And right now I am a staff member with Al Goleta, Marine Research and Education as their education coordinator and project manager, also on the global plastic pollution movement. I am known as the Gnarly Beach Cleaner and my mission is to spread awareness of plastic pollution through fun and positivity.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So what I'm really here to do tonight is to let you guys know that you're the best looking group of council members I've ever seen at any council meeting I've ever spoken to. And that's not much just talking about how good you look.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I can just see the intelligence radiating out of your bodies. All right? And I can see your intelligence when it comes to dealing with plastic pollution. And I can see that you're smart enough to know that even if you're not down at the beach or in the ocean seeing what's going on, you know it's happening.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You know that it's an issue. I like to look at single use plastic pollution as this big tree, this big rotting tree that's decimating the local population by dropping the single use plastic fruit all over the place, US activists, US organizations that are working to fight plastic pollution.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We're that small ax that is trying to chop that tree down. What we need you to be is that sharpening stone to help our ax chop it down. And that's what we're trying to do on a global movement here.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So with that said, I think it's a smart decision to be the change makers, to be that stone that can help inspire the youth, inspire people to continue to want to make changes here in the state of California, and hopefully translate that to other places in the country and around the world.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You have an opportunity right now that might not be presented to you again, so why not take it and be leaders in regards to the small businesses? That's exactly why your hardship clause exists. And I read through the draft of previous ordinances and I saw that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And there's organizations such as Surfrider that has the Ocean Friendly Restaurants program, and they have done the work and they have done the research to work with small businesses to make sure that they don't even need to apply for that hardship clause.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So utilize the research and the tools that are already out there and exist. Thank you so much for your time. I hope I can make you stoked. I hope I can make you smile and I hope to see you soon.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please. Good evening, Mayor Garcia and members of the council. My name is Rob Northup and I'm the director of the Don't Waste Long Beach Coalition. And first of all, I'd just like to say thank you to Councilwoman Gonzales for bringing this forward.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We've all heard the debates. You guys all know the facts behind this stuff. We've been talking about this for almost ten years now within this city in terms of trying to push forward with constant revisits and studies and delays and the like.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we know the facts. We've already heard from everybody here. We've heard from a restaurant owner who said, let's move forward with this thing. So what I'm here to do is just ask you all to please move forward with this stuff.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Because I do recall also at that last October hearing where another excuse that came forward was if we you know, we need to study this stuff. And if we did this here, it still won't have any impact because other cities are going to continue to have this and haven't banned it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we'll still see Styrofoam on our beaches. And while that may be true, that's not an excuse to not move forward with this. Particular thing, right? I think things change when individuals are in this case, cities and councils like you are.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Move forward with courage and leadership to actually move this thing and changing, doing what we can to change our little corner of the universe and making sure that we're making life a little bit easier and a little more environmentally free for everybody else that's here.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right. So again, I ask that you all move forward with this tonight, as is there's also, again, extending the 12 month phase in 18 months for businesses in a hardship clause. So we've done the study, we've done the analysis.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And let's move forward tonight. Thank you very much. Thank you, Max Baker.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Good evening, city mayor and council members.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'My name's Jennifer Granholm. I actually migrated down from Los.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Angeles just for this meeting. I came down because I considered.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Long Beach as a pinnacle of.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Progress with a green room and sustainability. And just as this previous speaker said, I'm not.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Going to harp on that actual.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Notion too much at this point in time, because I think it's been abundantly.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Clear how everybody feels more. So it's regardless of where you started.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The reason I'm coming up to the podium is to ask you a question about what brought you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Here to the city council. What made you want to be a leader?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'What brought you to want to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Make a change in.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The world? I think we all actually have.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'More in common.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Than we think.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That we do. If we take a look, regardless of what your status is, you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Have a desire to protect your loved ones or protect your family to provide to progress. I think it's all about a balance. And regardless of this one or any of.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The other policies that come up on the floor, just take that into consideration.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Whenever you have another environmental thing that's coming up on the floor, particularly about small cells or whatever it is, that's it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thanks so much. And we have a last four speakers and then we're close. We're close. Okay. We have we're going to last five speakers and closing the speakers list next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Good evening, mayor and council. I am Melissa Bean Hyson and I'm here last minute on prepared remarks on behalf of my sister Julie Darrell, who is a small business owner in Long Beach. She has been working for about a year trying to promote awareness about single, single use plastics and how to avoid them.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I've just seen the first Sunday of every month at the Alamitos Bay Farmers Market. The community has really responded positively. They are. They laugh about, you know, taking your own containers to restaurants, but they do it. And it's every straw that isn't used or every piece of Styrofoam that isn't used is just one way that we'",
        "'speaker_0': 'are moving forward to the community to keep Long Beach Green or to move it towards being green. My five year old nephew is having a hard time not picking up trash. So we're working on that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But if we can get him in the right direction and kind.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Of real bad in a little bit, then I think a.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes vote in this area would also help the city move.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Forward. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Speaker Evening there. Members of the city council. My name is Mark Coleman. I live in the peninsula. I'm here tonight on behalf of the Peninsula Neighborhood Group Association. So for many of us neighborhood associations, this is a huge issue.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think I'm the only neighborhood association here. I'm not sure, but certainly in Belmont Heights, Belmont Shore and the Peninsula and our board six months ago notified Council Woman Price that we wanted her to support this ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The beach. Those of you who have independence, the beach know it's ground zero for plastics, pollution and the documentation by our Goleta Marine Research has documented the depth of pollution. It's extensive. When and if the city really wants to use that beach for any purpose other than as something to pass by on the boardwalk, it will take'",
        "'speaker_1': 'major efforts just to clean up the plastic out of the sand. We cannot go any further like this. Every day that beach is inundated with plastics from the L.A. River and the San Gabriel Channel. We need your help.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The city needs your help to pass this ordinance. Let's be at the forefront. We thank you for your support. Excellent report from staff that really is going to move this forward. Not just this issue, but the whole issue of bringing containers, eliminating any containers whatsoever.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we eliminate trash, which is a major problem. Thank you all so much. Please pass the ordinance. Thank you, Mark. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Anna Christensen, protect the Long Beach. Slow, serious wetlands, obviously in support of this ordinance. I do want to direct everybody's attention to the screen behind you. However, council apparently regulating the use of sin.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If you look at the board here.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So that's a real challenge. And and speaking of which, since plastic comes from oil, I think one of the great benefits of this project will be to ah to maybe be forgiven for the sin of continuing to drill for oil which Long Beach does.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we can regulate our own sinning by not producing more plastic or using more plastic. Styrofoam made from oil means that if we use less Styrofoam, if we consume less Styrofoam as a city and as a community, then we will not be making more in our oil refineries to the west.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So it's a it's a step. And it's also really kind of surreal to have everyone on the same page as environmentalists in Long Beach, which we all were before. Beach Oil Mineral Partners Divided US. So sad, but still on a positive note.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Let's regulate that use of sin.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Thank you. And our last two speakers control.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And Cantrell. Good evening, counsel and honorable mayor. I have gotten used to bringing my own flask for water and kicking the plastic bottle habit. I take my own reusable bags to the grocery store instead of using plastic or paper bags, and I am sure that I and many other people can get used to bringing our own reusable'",
        "'speaker_3': 'takeout utensils to a restaurant. Habits are hard to change, but we can do it. And I don't think that this is going to cause the small restaurants to lose any business if they don't provide a Styrofoam takeout container.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I've trained all my family now to say no straws when we go into a restaurant. And I think I can train them to take, take, take out. And I hope that you will pass this tonight as is and not extend it any further.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Good evening, Mr. Mayor and City Council. My name is Sona Coffey and I'm a resident of the fourth District and also serve as your vice chair on the Sustainable City Commission. Pardon my grand.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Entrance on the thing, but thank you for.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Letting me speak here tonight. I will add my voice in support of adoption of this ordinance. I know there's a lot of supporters tonight, and there was also some concern about protecting small business. And I do want to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Help the public.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Relies on the groups realize I know our Surfrider member mentioned we have 40 businesses and small businesses that are certified under our ocean friendly restaurant program. The city has a green business certification program. Small businesses are doing this already.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They're making that switch voluntarily. I think what this ordinance will do is really help solidify the city's stance on this issue and really help us become take that next step in becoming stewards of our environment here. I know many of you believe that we have that responsibility and I do as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So thank you for bringing this forward. And I encourage your vote and support tonight.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you so much. Thank you, everyone that spoke. I'm going to turn this over to Councilman Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. So I want to thank you just for being so patient with tonight, but also for the incredible showing of support for this item. I've only been on this item for two years, and I want to thank my chief of staff, Corey, for being very involved in this and my office.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We had a ton of interns who also were at Cal State Long Beach and really turned to more environmentally or environmental majors because of this, because they were so fascinated. So I want to thank you all again. We should give you a big round of applause.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You've been at it for so long. And we have a representation of, of course, community advocates, people in the food industry. Captain Moore, who's here, who's been doing this for many decades, academic institutions who've been a part of this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So let's give all of you a big round of applause, because I really appreciate the support of that. And I'd like to thank my co-sponsors on here, Councilwoman Pierce and Councilmember Urunga, who joined me on this item. And I appreciate their support in this as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I want to thank everybody for coming out tonight. I know these nights are never easy, but I really appreciate it. And as many of you know, this material is one of the most prolific materials found on our beaches.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think we haven't said it enough. Right. Our beaches, waterways and our streets. I'm now a member of the Master Plan Committee for the L.A. River. And that was the one thing that all of the 710 cities talked about.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The very first thing was pollution. And it absolutely was brought to my attention multiple times that Styrofoam was one of those main polluters, not just here in the city of Long Beach, but along the 710 corridor, which we know is a is a big deal for many people.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And because we know it's nearly impossible to recycle, it ends up spending over 500 years in our streets. So unfortunately, long before any of us will, we'll see that biodegrade. The ordinance before us is actually very generous, and I want to thank my council colleagues from last meeting back in December of 2016, actually, when we proposed a'",
        "'speaker_0': 'few things, we talked about moving the phase plan from 12 months to 18 months, and that was proposed by Councilman Price. And I appreciate that the polystyrene ice chests as proposed by Councilwoman Mongeau and I appreciate that. And then the recommendation to include as a voluntary option for straws by Council Member Pier.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I really appreciate those as we implemented those in the ordinance. My team and I, as many of you know, we've been working on this for nearly two years, but the city of Long Beach has been working on this for nearly 13 years.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have studied this, I would say, ad nauseum, and I hate to say that, but we absolutely have been studying this quite some time. In addition to the great work that our city staff did, obviously there was a categorical exemption report, and that includes a technical documentation of an environmental analysis, which in essence is another study.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And it also includes a lot of information about Long Beach specifically and the impacts that we're seeing because of single use. It also validates a lot of the questions that we've had here about what it's actually doing to our waterways and what it's doing to our streets and litter and pollution.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I also would like to thank there's a ton of people, but our public works department, Environmental Services, DeKoe and Craig Beck. We really appreciate your work in this. I know we went through this similarly with the plastic bag ban, although this is a bit different, you all did a tremendous job of going to our business community'",
        "'speaker_0': '. You talked to many of our community advocates that you've already known. So we appreciate that. And Amy Weber from the city attorney's office, thank you for your support and help in this and getting the language just right. And Mike Mays as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And what I'll say is we have a lot of groups here, as I mentioned, a lot of good knowledge here from very many decades that have provided good information. And I think this is very fair. Three months for city facilities and city sponsored events, nine months for large businesses and 18 months for small businesses.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Less than 100 employees. My office personally reached out to every single business improvement district district. We talked to the Business Journal as well and talked about that everyone from Naples to Coba, which is an assortment of many business improvement districts, to include downtown and Bixby Knolls.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If I wasn't personally there, my chief of staff was there talking to them about the specifics of this ordinance. So they understood and I would say that, you know, a lot of them will welcome this. A lot of them, as we've mentioned, and I am one that does not cook, if you can believe that I have two'",
        "'speaker_0': 'jobs and my three kids. So I eat out a lot. And so I'm noticing and I'm seeing a lot of the businesses that I would have seen have Styrofoam maybe two years ago that don't have Styrofoam anymore. And I'm really proud of these businesses for taking the leap to do that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we want to make sure that they're recognized. So in that, I will say I hope we do not delay this. We don't, I believe, need another study. We've studied this quite some time, quite a bit. We have a lot of great people that we've been working with that have ventured, you know, on this great item with'",
        "'speaker_0': 'us. And I think delaying this would just be a disservice to our community. We know many of our communities, we've invested in the Long Beach Clean team, we've invested in the Aquarium for Wildlife Restoration and expansion. MLB must program.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'A lot of these initiatives are what are the truly the values of Long Beach, and I hope we can continue that by solidifying this ordinance tonight. And then lastly, a few other people I must thank as well, Sierra Club, Surfrider Foundation, don't waste Long Beach with the Teamsters 396 as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'll Goleta Marine Research heal the bay Long Beach and Bar. A mental alliance. And so many of you that have been by our side to help us in the Long Beach Area Peace Network as well. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I will leave it there. And I really ask for my colleagues support. Thank you so much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Catherine Pierce.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think my colleague, Councilmember Gonzales kind of said.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The majority of what we need to hear tonight, that we've been here for 13 years with a lot of hours, a lot of sweat equity and a lot of process. Sometimes local government and bureaucracy, we get called out for not doing enough process, for not having everybody at the table, for not hearing all the voices.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And this was not a dog and pony show of process. This was real.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Engagement with small businesses, with big businesses.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'With DART, the people that make a lot of these products to small restauranteurs that might not have understood some of the benefits of going this route. And so I want to say that tonight, not only am I proud for everybody that's in the audience that's been working on this, like Surfrider Sierra Club residents, but I'm really proud'",
        "'speaker_0': 'of the city for taking the time and I'm proud of my colleague for saying, yes, we could try to push something through very quickly, but instead let's do a phased approach.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And as she recapped.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'For us, that last meeting that we had really did take apart from everybody, and it felt like we were all on that same page. And so I'm honored tonight to be here with everybody. And I like to always share with folks know, my first action of being a rabble rouser was not on a picket line.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It was actually picking up trash door to door when I was in fourth grade.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Going door to door to my.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Neighbors and collecting cans and trying to do recycling. And my mom was like, recycle what?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, she could not.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Comprehend that I now had five bags of of cans.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In our yard that I needed her to drive to take me to go recycle. And so from that being.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'My very first activism to being a part of this council where we are really taking the actions necessary, it's a proud day. And I hope that everybody can walk away tonight feeling proud and like we've put forth our best effort.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So, again, congratulations.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Councilmember Gonzalez, for your great leadership. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. I know we have some folks cued up to speak. I want to just I wanted to speak after the makers of the motion on this issue tonight. And I want to just say a few things. The first is I strongly support the ordinance as presented by staff.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I supported this since the conversation started by Councilwoman Gonzales, and I really want to thank her for her leadership on this issue. And I want to say a few things that I think are important to note. So in 2011, when I was on the council, I just got on the council and at the time we had an'",
        "'speaker_1': 'ordinance, a ban, single use, plastic bags. And when we did that in 2011, there's a lot of the same similar type of conversation. In fact, a lot of you that are here on this issue, we're also here on the conversation on the single use plastic bag issue.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And it was difficult and we implemented a lot of this of of the similar kinds of measure to support small businesses and the phased in approach. And some things happened which were significant. The first is we saw an immediate reduction of plastic bags and the single use bags and the litter that they created all across the city'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and our beaches. And that was reported pretty heavily through the work of city staff. So there was an immediate impact to the city. The second thing that happened, more importantly, was Long Beach became one of the largest cities in the state of California to actually ban single use plastic bags, which led then the state legislature just two'",
        "'speaker_1': 'years later banning single use plastic bags up and down across the state of California. And so it is important for big cities to take initiative on issues that affect the environment so deeply, which is why I believe it's so important for Long Beach to do the same thing on on this issue.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But we now have a state that moved forward on an ordinance at Long Beach, led on when it came to single use plastic bags. And on this issue, we can't expect as a community to ask our neighbors to not put their runoff and their pollution into the river if we're not willing to step up ourselves and eliminate'",
        "'speaker_1': 'from our own community the single source of pollution that we have in our river and into our coastline, which is polystyrene and Styrofoam products. It is it is causing incredible damage to our coastline. It's causing incredible damage to marine life here.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I know that. Yes, it is. I understand that it is a burden to some small businesses. I think that is a reality that that I think is true. But it is also true that there is no single, larger polluter and cause of devastation to our marine life and to our ecosystem in the San Pedro Bay than'",
        "'speaker_1': 'polystyrene. And so I'm hopeful that we move forward on this in a in a way that is strong and send a signal to the other. Is that this is a direction that they need to go as well in order to truly clean the San Pedro Bay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have to lead for the other cities north of us to do the same thing and hopefully for the state of California to do the same thing. And that's how we get our local beaches here in the community clean.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I think for for a city that has led on issues around solar and LEDs, conversion, multimodal transit, urban farming, plastic bags, I think this is a natural step in that process. And I want to uplift not just the work of staff, but the work of the sustainable the Sustainable City Commission.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think it's important for us also to understand that the work that the Commission has done on this issue has been extensive. They've been discussing this issue for years, and I'm really proud of them. A couple of those members of those that have been involved are here, including one member of our council, and that was also'",
        "'speaker_1': 'a member of that group. And so I think that we owe that commission, but also the community to move forward and to ban Styrofoam in Long Beach. So thank you very much. And with that, let me turn it over to the speakers that are cued up, starting with Councilwoman Price.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Okay. So a few things. First of all, I support this item very much, and I think the credit really needs to go first and foremost to those who came before us on this body who really laid these efforts, the foundation for these efforts.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I remember talking with Councilwoman Lowenthal and Councilman O'Donnell when they were on this council with me about this item. And I know that Councilwoman Lowenthal was really working on this item and developing it. And we we had a lot of conversations about it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And as someone who represents the coastline and the bay, I think this is definitely a step in the right direction, although there's a lot more work to be done. So I do support the item. I will say, though, that when the item came forward in October, we had a very healthy and robust discussion involving the roll out'",
        "'speaker_0': 'as it related to our small businesses. And I think that a little bit of that has been lost in tonight's discussion. Jack and I Jack Cunningham is my chief of staff. That that meeting I don't know how many of you guys were there that night, but it was a very long meeting and the motions that went back'",
        "'speaker_0': 'and forth were very complicated. So Jack and I had a chance to watch the video the day after the meeting and circle back with the city attorney. Just to get clarification on what we had actually voted on. And because it was important for us to message to our residents and our business community what it is that we'",
        "'speaker_0': 'had voted on. We sent out an email after council meeting to our constituents, letting them know what has been voted on. And for that clarification, we reached out to the city attorney. I've also had the chance to read the transcripts of that night.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This morning in preparation for tonight, because I don't believe that the staff report adequately addresses what was passed. And I know Amy Webber from the city attorney's office is here so she can step in and correct me if she thinks I'm wrong on any of this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But we've also talked with Charlie Parker on this. So I think I think we're accurate on this, the intent of the. Okay, so noticing tonight, there's a major gap in attendance by members of the small business community who were present in October.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I know for a fact the reason for that is because assurances were made to them by me and others that what we voted on in October involved us reviewing a study or a reporter data and being able to tweak it and modify it before we rolled out Phase three, that specifically what we had approved.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think that that's what they relied on. So when we got calls from people saying, do we have to show up to council, we thought there was going to be an opportunity to modify or tweak before it rolled out to us.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We said absolutely. That's absolutely what was agreed to. That's absolutely what we we committed to. And that was what was voted on. And I didn't hear that tonight. So I want to make sure, to the extent that it's clarified and I don't know if I need a friendly, I would refer to the maker of the motion on'",
        "'speaker_0': 'this, because I think the intent should be clear. And if a friendly is necessary or a substitute motion is necessary, I'm happy to make it. But the intent of the legislation that we passed in October was to give the council some data, some analysis of impacts before Phase three began so that we could have the opportunity to'",
        "'speaker_0': 'make changes if we needed to, for the small business rollout, specifically the motion that was made. By me was my friendly is specifically saying before we roll out the implementation of the small business portion, we as a body together would receive information on the data so that we could move forward with that implementation phase.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Because you are right, if a TFF comes back and outlines the study, a council member may want to put it on the agenda, may not want to put it on the agenda. It may get lost in the mix.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I wanted to actually come back so that we can hear the data and we can report to our small businesses that this is the data your rollout is about to start, and it's based on this great positive data.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The city attorney then clarified, So if I can understand the friendly correct, then the 18 months wouldn't be a hard date. You wouldn't determine that date until you receive the study? I said yes. Then the vice mayor asked Councilwoman Gonzales, Do you need to respond to the friendly councilwoman?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Gonzales said, Sure, that's fine. We can do a study session, but I would really advise this council to stick to the 18 months. I really would do that. The city attorney then asked for clarification and said, I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I didn't hear the acceptance. I heard that the 18 month stayed in. Councilwoman Gonzalez hesitantly said, You're making me do it again. Yes. So the city attorney then said, and I didn't hear, is it the study session? Now that's the study session.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And Vice Mayor Richardson said a report at council, she just referred to it as a study session. Councilwoman Gonzales said, and I agree with it can be a meeting, a study session, just some sort of a report back to council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then Councilwoman Gonzales said an opportunity for us to review that. So I want to make sure that what we're voting on tonight allows phase one and phase to be implemented in the timeline that we've we've outlined. I think that's great.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Phase three should not be implemented until we have a report back and an opportunity to make adjustments. We may not want to make any adjustments at all, but we may want to make a few tweaks here and there that make the rollout of this easier for our small businesses.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I completely understand that sometimes we make hard decisions and the businesses feel it's going to be an impact on them. They feel they're going to lose businesses business. They feel that they're they might lose customers. We hear it all the time from small business owners who don't like legislation that we are going to be forcing upon them'",
        "'speaker_0': '. I understand that sometimes those fears are founded, sometimes they're unfounded. What I'm trying to do is soften the blow for a lot of these small businesses who are genuinely concerned about what the rollout will impact them, in what ways it may not impact them at all and may impact them in positive ways.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But the goal of this is for us to work collaboratively to identify possible changes to the roll out that we can make before Phase three is implemented. So I don't know if that's the understanding of the maker of this motion or if that needs to come in the form of an amendment or if it needs to come'",
        "'speaker_0': 'in the form of a substitute motion. But I'm just putting it out there and I look forward to hearing from my colleagues. I will also say just because I think I have a duty to because Councilman Andrews reached out to me and asked me to read this letter into the record I am currently sick from this is'",
        "'speaker_0': 'from Councilman Andrews. I am currently sick from severe allergies and unable to participate in tonight's meeting. And I feel that a small delay on this item is reasonable to ask to make sure my constituents interests are represented, to best represent my constituents, and to make sure this ordinance is done in the best way we can.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Please postpone the first reading of this ordinance regarding polystyrene to the May 1st council meeting. I understand this email comes at the last minute, but I wasn't expecting until this morning to be able. I was expecting until this morning to be able to participate this evening.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I do know that he had some health issues early this morning and so it prevented him from being here tonight. Again, I look forward to hearing from my colleagues on both of those issues. One, whether we postpone for Councilman Andrews at Councilman Andrew's request, and if we don't, whether or not the intent of the legislation we passed'",
        "'speaker_0': 'in October is included in what we're passing tonight, because I think that will determine whether or not I will be making a substitute. So thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Let me have Councilwoman Gonzalez maybe respond to the councilman's questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. So I would have to clarify the motion, because from what I understand and we've spoken to the city attorney as well as that the ordinance would move through and 18 months would be included. However, there would be, as a study simultaneously included with that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we asked for a variety of things applicable to all small food establishments 18 months after City Council adopts. Yeah. So applicable after. After adopts the ordinance. We we basically included everything. We also included bean bags, crafts, straws upon request.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We also looked at big belly type trash cans. So just to clarify this, because I'm from I'm then I'm in the understanding that it was in everything we have in this ordinance is going to be moving forward tonight.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that was the discussion I believe we had back in when we we had the previous meeting, but that the study would would simultaneously go forward. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The way the ordinance is currently drafted, where the staff report is drafted, that is correct. So if you move forward tonight, clearly the ordinance that is passed would have a provision that allows for the roll out for the small businesses in an 18 month period.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But there would be a study session sometime before then. And obviously, as with any ordinance the council passes, you have the ability to amend anything that you pass tonight. So if a year down the road after you have some good solid data on the larger businesses and you have a study session and you feel that it's not'",
        "'speaker_3': 'appropriate for whatever reason to impose those same criteria on the smaller businesses. You could simply amend any ordinance you'd adopted tonight.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, but the ordinance does include the 18 months act for small businesses.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It currently does, yes. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'As long as we're clear with that, I'm good with that. Of course, more information will never hurt. Of course, I think we have all the studies we need, but absolutely, if we need to do some more studies prior to that so we can have more information to go forward, I'd be happy to do that as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But thank you for the clarification. I hope that clears it up with my council colleague, but I'd like to move forward tonight with the motion on the floor.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Thank you. Council member, you ring up. Thank you, Mayor. And I want to thank Councilmember Gonzalez for bringing this forward. I was one of the cosigners back in October on this because I thought it was very important.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I was the one, I think, that brought up the the Great Pacific Garbage Patch back and that that that meeting because I had seen the, the film a few months before at the Coastal Commission and it was very compelling story to see all the plastic out there in the deep ocean, if I can also make a pitch'",
        "'speaker_1': '. I also have a license plate that will tell my loyalty to help protect our oceans. But anyway, I diverge. One of the other things that happened since that last meeting in October, the Coastal Commission also adopted a motion to ban plastic straws in the oceans.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we are. We are. I definitely support this motion. I support the the ordinance that we're putting forward today. I don't think we need to change it much. Inclusion of a study is part of that. So I think that we're moving in the right direction.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And when we are able to change how the behavior of our of our restaurant attending people which are bringing in their own plastic containers or plastic bags or other items for them to take home, I think we're making a hell of a lot of progress in that direction.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think it would it would only help our communities and it would only help our earth. And I think that it's a great opportunity to make a change in our world. Thank you. Thank you. Councilmember Cipriano, I'm going to defer to Councilwoman Pryce because it's her motion.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I think the point here that is so important for us is that we adhere to what took place in our last meeting. And it was very clear from the transcript that we asked for feedback prior to this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And it's interesting because that I was part of that whole piece, that discussion, I guess a lot of us were, because it lasted a long time, but it came before the utensils piece. So I don't think we can cherry pick what we decided on at the last meeting.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have to incorporate it all. So that's my point. Thank you. Best move, Richardson. Just want to I just want to be clear, because it seems like there's two accounts of what happened at the last meeting. I want to hear from the city attorney.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'What is what is before us in terms of the 18 months and the the study session?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Vice Mayor Richardson, what is before you tonight and I apologize. I was not here when this came for the first time when you gave staff direction. So I can't really comment on the and I have not read the transcript, as Councilwoman Pryce just did.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I haven't looked at them closely. But what's on the agenda tonight is, as it has previously been described, it's basically as far as the small businesses go, it would require the small businesses to comply after an 18 month roll out period.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It would.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Require.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The larger businesses to comply sooner than that. It would require that there be a study session at some point in time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Before.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The 18 months. And I was just talking with Mr. Beck and he indicated that that study session would definitely take place before the 18 months kick in, and it would if council wanted to change course at that time.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Assuming you pass the ordinance tonight, you would have to amend the ordinance to make changes to it. So if you were dealing with small the small businesses, you could amend it to delete that requirement, extend it out further.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Or do anything else that was reasonable. Thank you. That's consistent with what I remember. There was a lot of debate and, you know, both sides came together. I think we got a unanimous vote. And I think it was sort of, you know, we were concurrently evaluate as we were going.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then when the 18 month kicked in, there was a study session. Any given Tuesday, you can amend or place it on the agenda to amend the ordinance. So there wasn't a a stop or two, so to speak.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There was a deadline for staff to present a study session on the findings before that third phase, third phase commenced. That's what I understood. That's what I understood. And I think that's what's presented today. So I'm I'm sticking with staff's recommendation and the motion on the floor.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think that I mean, that honors what we did in the past. You know, there's a lot of negotiation that took place, but I thought we did a good job that night. So that's what I'm gonna support tonight.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thanks. Thank you, Councilwoman Brice.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So if I can just jump back in for a second if one possible solution and it isn't clear from the staff report, but if you wanted to make sure that that study session took place without amending the ordinance that's before you, you could set a time certain tonight as part of a motion to have that study session'",
        "'speaker_3': '. I mean, you could pick a date, but it could be no later than three months before the 18 month period would kick in or whatever date would be appropriate to give you enough time to later amend the ordinance if it was necessary to do that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And that way we'll all be assured. No question we're going to have a study session will be at a time certain.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So let me let me go and go back to Councilman Pryce now has the floor. So, Councilman Pryce, thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that's exactly what I was going to suggest, is that we have a time certain or a date certain. I do want to check with Amy Webber, who's here, because I know that she hasn't had a chance to review the transcripts in our correspondence with Charlie in October.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If you can clarify really what the intent of the pass I mean, this is what happens when we make sausage. It's really hard to identify the individual ingredients. So if Ms.. Webber, if you can please tell us what your legal interpretation of what we approve that night was in terms of our intent.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'My understanding of what what was approved that night. And I do have a copy of the.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Transcript that you and Mr. Murchison have referred to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is, as Mike stated earlier, that that that the study session or the the the study was intended to occur concurrently and but that the Council was to be informed.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Prior to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The effectiveness of the 18 month phase.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'In period.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'For small businesses. I would also note that in the transcript, the city attorney on the night of the event said, I'm not sure if your friendly is necessary. You can get the study back on any Tuesday and do an.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Amendment to the ordinance or change.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The implementation date of Phase three at that time. You could do that on any Tuesday. So I think the intent all along was that once you had the information, whether it was earlier or later or on a precise date, the council would be able to make any changes that they felt were necessary.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'To the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Ordinance. And that's and that's great. And that's my understanding of what we passed as well. I will say I don't believe the staff report clarifies that in terms of the study session preceding the implementation of Phase three and as having the opportunity to opine on the roll out of Phase three.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But that's fine. We're clarifying it now. So what I would request, and this really would be up to the maker of the motion if she, she and the second are okay with it. Is that the and also it's not a really.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, we're having a study session but the the point of the study session is to study the impacts and the implementation of phase one and phase two. So we would be getting a report back of what the impacts, the benefits and all and such were.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So my my hope would be that two months before the implementation of phase three, so that would be six months from the passage of this ordinance, we would receive no later than 16 months. We would receive information regarding the the rollout and what's been successful opportunities for improvement, recommendations for future implementation that will give us as a'",
        "'speaker_0': 'council about two months to make tweaks, if we want to, to any of the policies, procedures, incentives, etc.. So I don't know if that's okay with my council colleagues. Yes. And just so we're clear, October 2019, if I'm getting my math correctly, is about 18 months.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So that would be based on what Councilmember Price mentioned would take us to about August of 2019. Do you want we can select a date now if we'd like to. We have August 6th, 13th, 20th. I'm I'm going to put it all out there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I don't want any confusion going forward. And I appreciate the clarification. And just so we know, just so I'm clear as well, you want to talk about the successes and that's just the whole ordinance. Not specific just for small business.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's for the whole ordinance and how the impacts are. Okay, perfect. We won't have implemented it on small businesses, but there might be lessons learned that we can't deploy. Perfect. So can we say I'm just going to pick lucky number 13, August 13th, 2019.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is that okay? It can be lucky.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We can do the second, second week of August, second, Tuesday, August, me and Roberto's birthday that week next.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, happy.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Birthday. You're going to have to be okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So why don't we just clarify, Mr. Mayor, if we can, to say, August 2019 and let us come back. That's in the middle of budget as well. So we'd like a chance either August? I think that's correct. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. So I think that that hopefully clarifies that issue. Moving on to Councilmember Super now, just one last point, and this was back to that discussion in the past was who conducts the study are data gathering? There was a little we didn't want to put this all on city staff if it was too much of a burden'",
        "'speaker_1': '. So can we just add to that will make that decision moving forward also so it makes sense in terms of of of who's actually collecting the data. And I would imagine that we would just we would do that study like we do every study.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And oftentimes we contract we would contract that work out or we would work with our internal folks. And if we need additional support, we do that. Is that right, Mr. Modica? Yeah, that's correct. We would see what we could provide if we needed consultant expert experience on that or if we need budget.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we would have to come back and say, here's what we can do with what we've got or we'd need more money. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. There is a motion to second on the floor. Members, please.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Gwen Casher votes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Motion carries.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Thank you very much.'",

It's going to create a bottleneck of traffic. And what you're going to get is empty parking spots in front of facility with no revenue whatsoever, very little.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The other thing is our reputation as a small business. We're trying to do a lot for the community, clean it up. This proposed parking is going to be in front of our facility on Ocean Boulevard and then also on Olympic and not in front of Apple's lot, in front of Vons or any of those other commercial businesses'",
        "'speaker_1': 'just in front of the Olympics. So our member is going to look at that and say, okay, to join or be a member, you're going to pay for parking or a park across the street. The other thing is that we've had a diverse group, just like our community, that's talking to a young member that signed up.'",

I generally park on the east side of the Belmont Pool and walk to the gym primarily, so I don't take a parking space on the ocean or Olympic Plaza that could be used by someone who does not have an annual past based on what I've been able'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to determine in the past two days. It appears that there are really only two points for you to consider. One public works would have you believe that approval of this item will allow for more rapid turnover of cars using those estimated 80 parking spaces, claiming that faster turnover will benefit the customers of the five businesses affected.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There's only five businesses in that section.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And she made.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The discussion per the first paragraph under discussion on your council letter. That's the claim that it'll help with the better get better access to customers of those businesses. However, the area is already posted with signs limiting parking in those spaces to 2 hours.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The meters would have the same time limit. How would that increase turnover in those spaces? Which brings me to the second point. What will this really accomplish other than to add minimal additional revenue to the city's general fund at the expense of the patrons of those five businesses?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please. Hi. My name is Josiah Whipkey. I live in Beaumont Shaw, so I live in the third district. I used to work with Postmates, which is a delivery service, and they actually let all their local managers go a year ago.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So it's been kind of a struggle for me this last year. But thankfully with me joining the gym, I've been able to get a great job and a sales job and also just making ends meet and I know obviously live in I'm sure.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So rent's not cheap, but I think for me, the struggle with parking now at the gym is it's it's kind of going to take my wind out of my sails because I just know that getting to the gym can be a big kind of stress relief for relief.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I can just get in there and get a workout in and leave and not, you know, just be overwhelmed with everything else that's going on. So I think just for me to to see the meters going into play, you know, I obviously will just park in the neighborhood and I just don't think that's going to help'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the residents in that area. So I just just request that this get pushed out for for further discussion later down the road. And like Curt said, you know, I think in the years to come, possibly put in meters is going to be smarter.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But right now, with the parking situation at hand, I don't think putting meters just around the block is going to solve anything. Thank you. See no other public comment. I'll take this back to Councilman Price.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Okay. So a couple of comments here. I appreciate everyone who stayed as late as you all did. I have a tremendous amount of respect for all of you personally and professionally. And I know that sitting through a council meeting where you had no idea when your item was going to come up was terribly'",
        "'speaker_0': 'frustrating. And I appreciate you being here. I am listening and I am hearing you. First of all, let me start by saying the business owners of the particular business that was represented tonight have done amazing work, wonderful improvements to the area.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No quarrel whatsoever in my mind that that has happened. We have not as good but other business leaders throughout the city that have done amazing things for the community. And we try to be very consistent in our application of our our our efforts.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You know, we don't we don't pick and choose what business owners we like more or how much more they've contributed to the community. You know, certainly none have contributed as much to the local area as the business owners in this situation have.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I'm grateful for it. But we're talking about a commercial area. And in the four years that I've been in office, I've never once had a business owner call me and say, can you please help me charge my patients for parking?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Can you please help me figure out a way to put a meter in front of my business so that people will have. To pay to come and visit my business. That's just that's just not a conversation that we ever have, because, as any business owner would do, they're going to want to advocate for their customers to have'",
        "'speaker_0': 'free access to parking. So as. As unpopular as the statement may be, we don't impose fees, taxes and other assessments based on democracy because no one would ever raise their hands and say, I would like to be charged extra for things.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It just doesn't work that way. Having said that, I work.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Very closely with our public works.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Department. I've talked with our public works director, Craig Beck, about Ocean Boulevard and the reconfiguration of that road.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I've been very clear.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In public meetings that I would not support putting meters in the residential areas, but that I would be open to considering meters in the commercial zones, much like we have in every other part of the city. I do think that it's important for us as a city council to support efforts by staff to create revenue generating opportunities'",
        "'speaker_0': '. While I understand that to the folks who spoke at the podium, a $100,000 possible revenue opportunity is insignificant to this council. That may be a significant revenue generating opportunity when we look at it around the whole city. Certainly if the director came forward and offered us or recommended to us $900,000 different, $100,000 revenue generating opportunities, and each'",
        "'speaker_0': 'of us were to pick a business owner that we really like and say, you know what, we're going to reject that because we really like the business owner. The city would lose out on potential opportunities to collect revenue, and we're not going to do that and we shouldn't do that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think it's important when we're talking about this particular zone in this area to highlight a few things which, you know, we sent an email out to 5000 people and we got 19 responses in opposition. Over half of them either worked at the gym or were contacted by the gym owner to contact our office.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So the fact that you received 400 posts is interesting to me or 400 replies because when I reviewed the messaging, I think there are a few things that were misleading. One, there's no implementation timeline whatsoever on this program yet.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Two, as I've indicated to the business owner and was not reflected in any of the marketing and advocacy, is that we're completely open to setting a fee that is reasonable and something that we can all agree is mitigated, and that the hours of operation for the meters are something that we're open to discussing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'None of that was really mentioned in any of the marketing that went out, and I understand advocacy and wanting to get a big turnout at a council meeting, but I think it's important that we highlight that those are offers that were made that I think make the situation a much more mitigated.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I choose to focus on how we mitigate concerns that a business owner has regarding impacts to their business. So with that in mind, there's a couple of amendments I'd like to make to this. I'd like to reduce the rate of parking in this commercial area to $0.50 for an hour, as opposed to the proposed $0.75 an'",
        "'speaker_0': 'hour for the first year and one year after implementation. I'd like us to look at the data, see what the costs of operating the meters was, and whether that 50 cent amount is something we can continue doing because as the report indicates, there are some operating costs associated with this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And if the fee that we're charging is too low to justify the operating costs that we have to commit to, then, then we might have to consider raising it. But I agree, and this is something the business owner pointed out to me, that it's not as robust as a commercial zone yet as Second Street is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'However, this is an area that was recently slotted for additional opportunities pursuant to the land use element. So this this is, we hope, an area that will continue to become more and more frequented and thriving. But I agree that right now it's not at the place where Second Street is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So $0.50 per hour, I think is justified. I think we should keep the hours as is, because my offer to adjust the hours wasn't met with any sort of positive response. So if there is an opportunity to adjust the hours in the future, I'd like to hear about it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But that offer didn't really go anywhere. I'd like to ensure that a significant portion of the revenue that's collected from this area will be spent in the immediate area for cleanup and beautification efforts. I know we talk a lot.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I mean, we sit here at council meetings and we'll, you know, we'll allocate $100,000 for this or $200,000 for that. I can tell you that $50,000 a year, $60,000 a year spent in this area will make a difference, whether it's us purchasing big bellied trash cans, whether it's us repainting dilapidated areas, whether it's as fixing potholes, whatever'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the case is, I think that we should be able to spend this money back in this area to continue the work that the property owners have done, which has been very beneficial for the city. And then the final thing that I'd like to suggest is I know that our smart meters have courtesy chimes on them that allow'",
        "'speaker_0': 'for 5 minutes courtesy time. I'd like to explore the feasibility of allowing a 15 minute courtesy time for this area, because I know at least one of the businesses there has a smoothie shop or coffee shop and people can run in and purchase items on the go or there's a daycare center there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If parents want to drop their kids off, we certainly don't want them to pay $0.50 to drop their kids off. They should have a little bit more than 5 minutes. So those are some of the changes that I have that I'd like staff to make.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mr. Beck, do you want to respond to those or any response to that?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Certainly. I think part of what we're here tonight is to have a conversation about the hours of operation and certainly the raid. So if it is the desire of the council to set that at $0.50, we can move that forward without problem and then we can look at it in a year.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think that's a good idea and really evaluate what the costs are for the operation and what revenue is being generated. With regard to utilizing revenue generated from that parking area to do infrastructure improvements in those areas, that is a policy that the Council has adopted previously.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's something we do in the downtown and we installed our downtown smart meters. So I do believe that that is good policy to utilize that revenue to beautify and or put back into the district. And in reality, that is how we were able to fund the improvements of the Second Street median project that came out of parking'",
        "'speaker_7': 'revenues that were generated in Belmont Shore. So it is something that that does provide a benefit for those that are that are paying to park there. I think one of the challenges I would ask council to strongly consider is is the courtesy time.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So currently we are doing 5 minutes. I think consistency is important that no matter where you are as a resident of the city and you're utilizing our parking meters, consistency in in how you experience those meters is what I would recommend.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So if it is the desire to move from 5 minutes and extend that time, I think we should consider that across the board. That would have a revenue impact. I would caution Council to consider that revenue impact and we can provide more data on that if that's a policy direction you'd like to go.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. I think if we could study that, I'd appreciate that because I just have no idea what the impact would be. Maybe it's not 15 minutes, maybe it's ten, and maybe that is something that we across we apply citywide.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But obviously I want to hear from my colleagues on that because it's not just my district that would be impacted by that, but I think residents might use that courtesy feature more if they had a little bit more time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. And just also, I'm assuming that that's all, is that if you change the most the staff recommendation yet, or are you waiting to hear more feedback first before?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'No, those.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Would be my recommended changes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. As part of the. As part of the motion.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. And so. Councilman Austin. Thank you. I just had a few questions.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'How many parking spots are we talking about?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Roughly 80.'",
        "'speaker_8': '880800. Okay. And to the to the point about the grace period, the 5 minutes, we don't have any parking meters and my my area of town, and I'm sure we may explore doing that at some point in the future.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But in terms of the revenue impact that I guess you wouldn't have anything off your off the top of your head, but. In terms of grace periods. Two other cities offer that. And have we studied that chasm?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We don't have that data now, whether cities have studied that or not. It in my experience, there is some level of grace period that can be 3 minutes, 5 minutes. I think it depends on the jurisdiction, but certainly staff can do research on that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Pull together information and provide counsel an update to inform you on how to move forward.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I had a little bit here that was something pretty unique that we did. We had looked around and people had thought about it, but it was really kind of a Long Beach thing. We haven't seen it in too many other areas.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sometimes it's just a courtesy, but you actually get 5 minutes when you press the green button here. So we can certainly look at the data. It was, if I remember, around 100,000 or something back then, but that was just an estimate.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we need to look at it now to see, you know, what is it actually costing us, how much is getting used and can we move that up to 10 minutes or something? Yeah, I thought that was pretty.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Unique to it. To us. I want to commend our Councilmember Price for her for her flexibility on this and working with the businesses and weighing out all of the the different challenges that that that have come with this issue.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I certainly support this, but I would ask that that, you know, I'm interested for four reasons related to my district as to how this will play out. I think this is an important issue. And yes, revenue is important.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We need to look at ways to generate revenue. I think this is a creative way to do so, particularly in a area that that is a parking challenge. I understand the business owners of their interest here as well, protecting their their interest in their investments.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But I think there's a balance here, and I think a good compromise has been been struck here. So I'll be supporting this item.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Thank you. Next up is Councilmember Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I yes. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'll support my council colleagues. These are eight meters in her district.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I do have a lot of comments and questions. So in my district, to your comment that nobody's going to say yes, put a meter up. I want to thank Craig back and his team for working with the Fourth Street bid.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And really we have had probably four or five meetings with our bid members with residents. We do an online survey. We really engaged everybody from a place where they were divided and not wanting to do meters to a place where we are now on track to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Install meters on Fourth Street.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so that we were able to get to that place because we did that work with them, we set the rates with them, we set the hours with them, we set a timeline for when we would reevaluate those.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I think that, you know, in certain areas, you can.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Definitely.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Get that into the point of the different rates. I'm curious, what are the various rates that we have across the city? Are we as a pretty standard, are each are the bed setting a different rate like Dubay versus Fourth Street versus second Street councilmember?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We are working to try to standardize what those rates are, but currently they do vary. I mean, they even vary in in the same parking districts. A good example of that is Belmont Shore, where you have on street rates that are different than the off the parking lots off the street.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We're working to standardize that many times when we we do try to work with the business districts. It's a lot of times the business districts that will bring forward a recommendation to to install parking meters. And I think a lot of that depends on the business districts desire for rates.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I think if you look at some of the parking studies that we've done recently, there's a new trend in how you move forward with setting parking rates, and that is time of use. So while we haven't implemented time abuse rates in our city, that is something that staff has been looking at and strongly considering and we'",
        "'speaker_7': 'think would would be an important next step for us to consider.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Great.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. I just was thinking about the fact that we have some meters, I believe, like around central Long Beach and outside of the downtown area that aren't tied to a bed, but their rates might be higher. And just trying to think of that, again, that equity issue, whereas if you're visiting a nice place, I like to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'eat breakfast right next to your place. I am probably once a week visiting a nice part of town by the beach versus needing to run an errand at a courthouse. Just trying to think equitably about how our how we are deciding those rates across the board.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So, you know, I'll support this item. I just ask that we definitely talk about process as you guys move forward so that we can include a process. Across the board that our residents can can look forward to as we make these decisions.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilman Ringa. Well, I have to look at this from a different perspective. And one question that I have about this is, is this within the coastal zone? And what should we have addressed this issue with the Coastal Commission in regards to changing parking because of the fact that if it was a free before and now you're going'",
        "'speaker_1': 'to be putting in meters, that changes a person's experience going to the beach. So has that come into play at all? The staff consider that and they do.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Councilmember To my knowledge, I think the city manages on street parking and has the ability to set the rates and the times for enforcement. The Coastal Commission is involved in our beach lots and the cost and timing for parking rates in our beach lots.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, the the issue that I have it is that it's removing 80 parking spots that people have pre access to, to not only visit the businesses there, but also go to the beach. And that would have a negative effect for individuals who want to park there, who might not necessarily go to the business or might even go'",
        "'speaker_1': 'to a business and then go to the beach and take their food and go out, go have a nice day in the beach and and the other activities such as that. So I'm having I'm conflicted with this because of that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's removing well, it's it's dealing with access access to the beach that I think is is very important and very important for me, especially in my role as a Coastal Commissioner, when we're looking at increasing access and not removing access.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I'm having an issue with this in regards to whether we should proceed with putting in meters. And I can see the city's need to raise revenue. And I'm not you know, I'm not against raising revenue, of course, but I am concerned about the impact it would have on the public who want to enjoy the beach.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So, Councilmember.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'One of the things that I would like to point out is that we we kind of look at this as an overall project where we recently had completed a road diet on ocean that has added in excess well over 100 additional spaces that are right adjacent to our growing out of parking lot.'",
        "'speaker_7': '156 Thank you, Councilmember for the accurate number. So I think we are conscious about creating new parking opportunities. I think in many districts that are parking challenged, you can all attest that we've looked at diagonal parking, we've looked at beyond diagonal parking to maximize parking opportunities, including our coastal zones.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, again, like I'm saying, this is the removal of 83 slots into creating some revenue for the city. So I'm conflicted with this. I'm not I'm not I'm not in total agreement with it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And if I could, Mayor, just add one more thing. I probably should have done this in my opening remarks, but one of the things that we have moved towards are smart meters. And the one of the benefits of our smart meter technology is it ties into our Easy Park LP application and that Easy Park will be app'",
        "'speaker_7': 'will give you indications of where there are parking opportunities and where there aren't parking opportunities. So anybody that utilizes that app can see where there's open spaces to park.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Thank you, Mr. Beck. And next up is Councilwoman Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, thank you. I you know, I think I just want to reiterate a lot of what the my colleagues had mentioned and being a councilmember for downtown, we've been through this quite some time and a lot of outreach, I will say, has had been done.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We increased, I believe, you know, we're up to a dollar 50 per hour in downtown and we don't even have all of our storefronts. You know, we're doing a good job a lot better than we were seven years ago.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But we're you know, we're pretty impacted with high rates. But we did a ton of outreach prior to to ensure that employees and also businesses understood where the parking meter rate would go to and just the adjustment from going to traditional meters to smart meters.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I know, Tom, you were there at many of her meetings and, you know, sometimes they weren't happy meetings, but at least it gave the opportunity for businesses, small businesses especially, to talk through some of these issues. So I would just say, you know, and I know Council Member Price has done a lot of work on this'",
        "'speaker_0': ', but I would say outreach definitely needs to be consistent to all of our business improvement areas all over the city. And then knowing the 15 minute I should mention, the 15 minute kind of grace period, I would just ask that we keep that consistent as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have 5 minutes in downtown. I think that worked very well. Gives you 5 minutes to go in and out of the dry cleaner. Kind of dropped something off what have you. But that also just I would just ask because that will create a big drama in downtown if that I'm not sure is going to give in'",
        "'speaker_0': '15 minutes and we're given 5 minutes and not to pin anything against each other, but I just think we should be consistent across the board. But perhaps and I don't know if there's additional, because I also have sort of the concern of the going from free parking to parking that will now you will have to pay for'",
        "'speaker_0': 'in this sort of beach community. And I'm wondering, is there going to be additional I don't know if there's an additional outreach that we will do. I mean, we can certainly pass this tonight, but what does that mean for additional outreach for people other than who we're seeing here?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And it's already 1030. Are we planning for additional outreach?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mr.. Mr.. MARKER Someone. Mr.. BECK So.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Council member certainly we can do additional outreach. I think the.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Idea would be.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'How we enforce the parking. And typically whenever we install a new zone, we provide a grace period similar to some of the policy decisions that the council's made. For example, an RV ban that will move forward from an enforcement perspective with a grace period when we did street sweeping time changes that moved forward with a grace period'",
        "'speaker_7': '. So for X number of weeks we provide warning notices to advise anybody that are not following the particular policy. They aren't ticketed during that grace period.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So what would the grace period be?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We can set that typically two weeks is what we utilize.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Two weeks and then are the adjacent businesses. I'm just really I mean, we know that parking is a major issue and no matter what part of the area it is, it's just a huge issue. So I just want to make sure we get the process right as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Will everyone be notified or how will they understand that this is going to be changing? Will they receive something in the mail or will there be signs posted in addition to that?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Certainly whenever we do any new parking meter installation, you have to install the meter, post the meter heads, signage, talking about the fact that it is a metered area, what the times of the the enforcement periods are. We can certainly, in addition to that, do a mailer if that's the desire of the council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And I know this is mundane stuff, but it needs to be said on the dais because we've you know, it's very important. So. Okay. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I thank you, Councilwoman Pryce.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So a couple of things in response to Councilman Urunga. So one of the things that we that we've been told from Coastal Commission is they actually like right now, our residents can't park in the beach lots for free.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The Coastal Commission requires us to pay for parking, to encourage turnover and the availability of spaces. So we actually wanted to do free parking along the coast in the parking lots, and we were told that Coastal Commission was requiring us to charge a fee to encourage those spots turning over so that residents don't.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Pakenham Because there's a whole bunch of apartment complexes there. So by adding these new 156 new spots, we've created 156 new spots for residents to park and the commitment that I made.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'At multiple.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Meetings. So I appreciate the suggestions my colleagues have given regarding outreach. I'm always open to hearing how I could do a better job, but I will tell you, we've communicated repeatedly at community meetings that we wouldn't charge the residents, we wouldn't put meters in front of the residential spots.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But this is actually a commercial. You know, we just went through the land use element. This is actually a commercial zone. And so we've told people that we wouldn't charge the residents, but when the residents park in the commercial zone, then we don't get the turnover because they can stay there for hours.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we've even had situations where residents have said that. And I don't I don't really want to get into the back and forth, but that that people were removing chalk lines off of tire so that they can park longer and just not having as much turnover.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I know Director Beck knows about that because we have.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Fielded a.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Lot of complaints about that. So we're trying to strike a balance because it's a very sensitive commercial zone and that's abuts a residential neighborhood. And so, you know, I get it and I appreciate the comments. I really take them to heart.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I appreciate the suggestions from my colleagues on better outreach, just so you know, in terms of the outreach that's going to come with us, we have a newsletter and an email system, so we did send a notice to about 5000 residents on Sunday night, letting them know this item was coming with a link to the agenda item'",
        "'speaker_0': '. We've notified the presidents of the residents the two residential associations that cover Belmont Shore. We'll be talking about it at our monthly community meeting and we will talk about it before, at their meetings, before it's rolled out. We do that regularly.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have a staff member or I attend the community association meetings every month. And so we'll be talking about this before.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We roll.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Out. I think it's really, really important that we highlight that what we're doing tonight is just setting the zone where meters would go. We have no implementation schedule, so there's really nothing to outreach at this time in regards to when it will happen.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But according to what Public Works has told me and really this is something that was brought to me by public works, I know they feel strongly that this will produce better turnover in the area and provide better access to the beach.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have a commercial zone that's located within blocks, within steps to the beach. $0.50 an hour for a commercial zone that's located this close to the sand is a really reasonable amount of money, considering how much every other community charges for their commercial zones on the water.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilmember Shoup and I thank you. Like the eighth District, we don't have any parking meters in the fourth district, so I'll have to defer to my colleagues expertize in that area. But one of the speakers mentioned transferring the problem to the neighborhood, and that's because I represent the area north of Cal State, Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's where my expertize lies. So I'll ask staff, do we have any plan in place where this won't happen? To put it in perspective, the area on the north side of the pyramid, along Atherton, every single street, 15 streets between Palo Verde and Bellflower require preferential parking.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So how do we stop that from happening on the north side of ocean?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Councilmember. I think similar to areas in the city that have parking impacts. We evaluate the situation in that given neighborhood and we try to address an appropriate response to that particular challenge. As you mentioned, in the Los Altos neighborhood in city of Long Beach, there's had to be a number of different preferential parking streets implemented that in'",
        "'speaker_7': 'concert with looking to the university to add some additional parking. They did add a couple structures. It is not adequate enough for the number of students that utilize the university. I think from a mobility perspective, from a from a city perspective, we've been trying to enhance bicycle connectivity to the university.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We've implemented a bike share program in the university, and we're trying to encourage students to look at alternatives other than driving a vehicle.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Adam, thanks for that. And I realize this is not a fair comparison because the numbers just aren't the same and not even close. We have a lot of students going to the university every day. But still, if it's 80 spots, I would just think Public Works would want to keep an eye on that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If that is a phenomenon that happens, it's my residents wouldn't forgive me for not bringing that up because it's a tremendous impact to them. Thank you. Thank you. Councilmember Constable Dillingham. Thank you. And I, in response to my colleague from the third district, I appreciate all comments that she made.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'She makes a compelling argument and no distress in the aspirations met. But like I think I would like to see a letter because I've dealt with parking issues up and down the coast in different beaches and in different communities where this is an issue where parking is either being removed or where parking is being addressed in terms'",
        "'speaker_1': 'of charging parking for people to to visit the beach. And they're being charged. And in my experience with the Coastal Commission, they they frown upon that. So if you're saying that the Coastal Commission has already said that they're encouraging meters to have turnover, I'd like to direct staff to maybe address that with the Coastal Commission and maybe'",
        "'speaker_1': 'get a formal response from them that that in fact, is what they what they want to recommend for that area. Because like I say, in my experience in other areas up and down the coast, this is not that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In fact, it's it's the opposite is to make it more accessible and more accommodating for people to visit the beach. Mr. Beck as a response to that council member.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Certainly we will confirm jurisdiction on this. As I mentioned earlier, I believe this is under city's jurisdiction for review.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. So there is a public comment, there's a motion and a second. And as a reminder, the up. Now, let me actually go back, Councilwoman Pryce.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Definitely the city's jurisdiction, but I'm wondering if Mr. Mays or someone else could comment on the idea of charging for parking in the lots that they actually have jurisdiction in and the public access.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Being.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Encouraged because there's turnover.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah, that's always been my understanding in the coastal jurisdictions. I know in Huntington Beach, SEAL Beach, they have pretty hefty parking meter.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Charges right on. I mean.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Immediately adjacent to their ocean areas. And it's always been my understanding that the Coastal Commission encourages that because it encourages turnover and basically prohibits, as you said, people that maybe live in adjacent neighborhoods or people that are working at adjacent businesses from kind of locking up those parking places all day long at no cost.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I may be wrong. Commissioner or council member you Ranga, but I don't know. We could check with cost of it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is that something that following tonight's item that staff could directly provide to Councilman Urunga, so that if he wants to reevaluate the item tonight, he can in light of what he hears from coastal, in terms of just the philosophy of charging for parking to increase turnover.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Certainly that's something that we can follow up with the staff on. We'll have that high level discussion. I think both the attorney I think a lot of a lot of things have said at the dias are true and that their main goal is to have the ability for people to come down and enjoy the beach.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so there's a number of strategies to do that. If you had all the parking in the world and you had free parking, that's one way to do it. They definitely encourage us to put in policies and practices, to not allow residents to basically be in spots that are available for people to come down to the beach'",
        "'speaker_1': '. And so that's where the charges come in so that we make sure that we do have it available for people coming down. And meters have been an acceptable use to be able to manage some of that. So we can certainly have that discussion with Coastal and we'll follow up with the commissioner and his.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Staff and mayor before we vote on the motion, I need clarification on the 15 minute grace period because I'm not sure if that is still on the table or.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No, I'm going to take it off the table. In light of Councilwoman Gonzales, his comments, I think she makes a really good point. Perhaps at some point in the future, staff can come back and let us know what the impact would be if we changed it citywide.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I'm certainly not asking for any sort of exception in the third district that wouldn't be open for other districts.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So 5 minutes is part of the motion then?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, I believe that's a consistent measure. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Great. But the other parts of Councilman Price's motion would be included in there in that in this original motion.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. Which is to basically establish the amount of $0.50 per hour as opposed to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right. Okay, great. Let me go. I will add Councilwoman Price back to Councilmember Ranga on one more thing. I mean, at this point, we're looking at a two hour maximum length of time. I'd also like to if we're looking at we're comparing ourselves to other cities like Manhattan Beach and Beach, what is their maximum hours that they'",
        "'speaker_1': 'have when they charge meters? They might charge more than we do, but that might be because they have more hours. So I would like to see that with that comparison as well in terms of encouraging turnover. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman. I think we did, Councilman Price. So did you call you up again or.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, I just wanted to make.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think that's why Councilman Price.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I didn't.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Councilwoman Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I just wanted to make sure that the information from Coastal because I myself and I don't know, I know Councilmember Arango is interested in it if it came back to the full council, if that was okay. Because I think that's an important.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Note that we should all be privy to councilmembers.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Certainly any data we pull together will share with the entire council.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. I think that's all the speakers here. So we have a motion in a second on the motion by Councilwoman Price. Members, please go ahead and cast your vote.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Council member, Your Honor. Motion carries.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Motion carries six one. We'll move on to the next item, which is item 35. I'm sorry. Item 33.'"
