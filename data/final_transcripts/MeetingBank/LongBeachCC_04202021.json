        "'speaker_0': 'But I do want to broadly add that I wanted to pool this because this is this is an initiative that we've been working on now for for a few years. When I was serving on the Metro Board, we noticed that the as the Metro trains were going to be replaced, they were going to scrap the old car'",
        "'speaker_0': '102, which of course, for those that know car 100, it was actually named after our city. It's called the Long Beach Car 100 and is the very first metro car in the history of the L.A. County rail system.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And it traveled from downtown Los Angeles to downtown Long Beach decades ago and kicked off. It was the very first metro ride in the region. And on that on that train, it was actually then Janice Hahn, who was a young girl at the time, who was with her dad, Kenneth, then supervisor Kenneth Hahn, who actually inaugurated the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'line. There's a lot of history to that train. I began some efforts and with Supervisor Hahn support to restore and preserve the train. We worked with our staff. I want to thank our entire team. This became much more complex, of course, than you can imagine.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But we were able to get Metro to donate the train to help us restore it to its original look and in the way that it was a service. And now being able to actually accept the train now that it's complete and we can now store it here in the city on that train, there is a plan to'",
        "'speaker_0': 'install it in downtown Long Beach in the East Village, right adjacent to where the train actually went right through when it came from downtown L.A. And we have a great team working on that. I do want to thank Supervisor Horne for her work and continued partnership and fact.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have a strong partnership in the future and how we're going to actually restore this train. Mr. Mark, is there anything that you want to add to that?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think you said that very well. This is an exciting project and thank you for your time on the Metro Board and helping to make this a reality. We have cobbled together a number of different funding sources from federal, state and regional.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We don't have any general fund in this project. This is all grant funded and it's a great opportunity to activate a space that is currently not all that active over on the first street behind the Westin and bring a piece of Long Beach history.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So, Eric Lopez, if you want to add anything else as the project manager, I will turn it to you. Thanks, Tom. I would just add that we're really excited to move forward. This is an exciting project that our team is has been working hard on.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The next step is to continue with the planning and design, and there will be more opportunities for the public to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Get involved and engage in this and this in this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Great effort. So that that's what I'd like to add.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Lopez. And I think for the council also, the kind of original proposal was to bring the original train. It would be installed onto the street and affixed to the street, and it could hopefully really create a as a museum of sorts and to honor the history of rail across the county and honor the history'",
        "'speaker_0': 'of that car, particularly being called the Long Beach Car 100. But then also look at ways of activating that same space. And maybe there is a way of bringing a cafe or a food service adjacent to the train that could provide and activate the space around the train as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so that really becomes an experience for people as they as they visit downtown or riding the blue line. They can come back, come right off the bat station, their one on one boulevard in a first, and the train will be visible from that station.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So it's a very exciting project. I have a motion by Councilwoman Allen and a second by Councilmember Durango. Councilwoman Allen.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mayor. Before I continue, I want to thank you for the statement you made for opening our opening our city council meeting. It's very appropriate that we recognize and condolences and congratulations to the Floyd family. Thank you for preserving part of Lambert's history.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think it's going to be a wonderful addition to our downtown and I looking forward to it being activated as either an active museum and or a restaurant.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Carlton Brosnan.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. I was queuing up the second the motion, but I will just say that this is a good news for our downtown preserving the airline. I believe I was with you or Mr. Mayor when they actually retired that car a few years ago, maybe three years ago.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And it was discussed that we would actually get to this point. And so I'm happy to support the item, and I think I'm really excited about the opportunity to honor rail on the blue line now. Now, the A-line is is synonymous with with Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And Vice Mayor Richardson. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Just wanted to chime in. I think projects like this are great. It's very exciting. Whenever we get to recognize a piece of history now about hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people, we're able to write them on the on the Long Beach 100.'",

So we don't have a date certain that we can identify for you and we'd have to report back on the precise date.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'These are the options as as outlined in the memo with pros and cons city clerk Lenny Villegas.

But the con on this is that for the 2022 elections, it would be physically impossible to have district lines drawn in time to comply with state and county deadlines.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The County of Los Angeles has already informed the city clerk's office that it would be unable to conduct an April primary for us. So that option is is not a terribly practical one under our current circumstances. The second option would be to use current district boundaries for the 2022 election, and this is permitted in the charter that'",
        "'speaker_5': 'governs the Independent Redistricting Commission. However, we have been advised that any districts would have to be confirmed as meeting the requirements of the Voting Rights Act before they were used in an election. So it. And to do this would be likely to raise legal concerns, and for that reason is not recommended.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We could follow the March primary election and November general election dates, which were the ones that were used in the most recent election statewide. These dates may also be familiar to voters as they were required by the state when we changed our election dates in 2017.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And according to the clerk and the Los Angeles County Elections Division. Voter turnout increased on these dates as a result of the fact that they were statewide. The downside to this option, to this third option is that beginning in 22, 2022, the state primary may be changed to alternate a march primary with a June primary so that'",
        "'speaker_5': 'the state of California can take advantage of a prominent position in the presidential election years. So this may end up being confusing to people. And the final option, which is the one that we recommend, is the one where we have a June 2022 primary election date, if it's possible.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And the caveat there is that if there are further delays in the distribution of census data, even a June date may not be possible.

        "'speaker_5': 'And that is a change since it's charter change that would require a charter amendment and it would require an action on the ballot. And that would also. I'm sorry. So it would it would be required to be referred to the Charter Amendment Committee as well.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'The one thing that has been very clear and why even long before I was a member of this body, have always supported the consolidation of elections is because we know that when you align elections, you increase the turnout of your voting population and just as important, you within the spirit of the Voting Rights Act and the spirit'",
        "'speaker_0': 'of ensuring that communities that are typically disenfranchized at the ballot box, those numbers always, almost always increase every time. And I was asking the clerk, what were our kind of our pre when we didn't have aligned elections versus what happened to our turnout after we aligned them?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Madam Court, can you can you share with us kind of the pre 2018 number for first for the primary to then the post a consolidation number on the primary that we just had? And then the general numbers for the council, please.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, mayor and council members. So to compare apples to apples, I'm going to give you the numbers for the 2016 election, which is the most closely related to the 2020 election that just passed. So in our primary election in 2016, we had a 13.5% voter turnout in the city of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In the primary for 2020, which was this past March, we had a 40.10% turnout for the city of Long Beach. So that is more than doubled our voter turnout in our primary election for the general election in 2016.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We had a voter turnout of 40.12%. And in our general election, which is this past November, we had a 74.81% voter turnout. Again, this is a 34% jump in voter turnout from the general and 2016 to the general in 2020.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If you want to look at the 2018 results, which were a nonpresidential election cycle for the primary, we had a 15.8% voter turnout. And for the general, we had a 28.73% voter turnout. Again, in 2020, we surpassed voter turnout by leaps and bounds in both the primary and the general.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you, Madam Clerk. I think obviously from from a I mean, personally, this is to me, this is a civil rights issue. And just I'm so proud of what the council took, the steps it took for it to get us to this point.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I know you don't you may not have the data in front of you, Monique, but just as striking was when I had a chance to review the turnout numbers for our disenfranchized communities. When you look at like AAPI voters, black voters, Latino voters, voters that typically have had lower turnouts, the numbers all dramatically increase when we'",
        "'speaker_0': 'went to the consolidated elections. And so I think being able to have more folks in our city vote and increased turnout and increased turnout, by the way, for everyone was was really significant. I think you accounts I'm sure for not for the motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I want to just reiterate, Charlie, I know you and I talked about what the motion would look like. So I want to just read what you and I discussed it to confirm that we're all on the same page.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that would be the resolution would move Lombard one which is municipal election dates to align with the state of California for 2022 and then also request the city attorney to prepare a ballot measure to be placed on the ballot in 2022 to permanently make this municipal election alignment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that would be referred to the Charter Amendment Committee for a future date. So that would be the language that that would be in front of us council for super or not if you're. Well, first of all, its message to the attorney.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is that language correct? Is that capture what you needed?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Mayor, you did capture what we needed. The motion, in essence, would ask us to prepare the resolution, and that would come back to the city council to establish and align our elections in 2022 to the state dates. And then the preparation of any proposed charter amendment would be referred to a charter meant to the Charter Amendment Committee'",
        "'speaker_4': ', which is a committee of the whole of the Council for a future date, because there is time to discuss and continue that. So with that, you are correct, Mayor. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Now, I made sure that that was the recommended you know, I know that you had mentioned it, but I wanted to clarify. It's referred to for the record. So Councilman Super. I just want to just to confirm that's the motion through the city of the recommendation, correct?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Correct. And I did have a couple of other questions that I well, just first of all, just a statement. So on on November four, just the con there, it says Holding an election in June, November could result in uneven campaigning cycle between 2020 and 2022 candidates.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I guess the statement I'd like to make there is we have an inherent. I want to say issue with the election cycles in that in one one election you have only four council districts up for grabs and the other you have five council districts plus four citywide candidates.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So that's a conversation for a different day, probably if we ever want to try to fix that. I'm not sure how we go about just just saying that that that concept that it could be lead to uneven campaigning.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, we have an inherent unevenness, I would say, on that. And the other point I'd just like to finalize with our city clerk, if Monique is still there, could you go over some of the items if in fact, we ever wanted to do a Long Beach City election again, besides not having the election equipment anymore, can can'",
        "'speaker_0': 'you kind of list some of those obstacles to doing that?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilmember Superhot. Yes. So we do not have the equipment. That is one aspect of not being able to have our own elections or run our own elections. We also don't have the space and the new city hall that we had in the previous city hall in order to increase our staff.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'During election cycles, we would increase our staff size by 20 to 30 people, depending on if it was a citywide election year or a non citywide election year. And so finding that space would be very expensive, I think, and we would have to find a location that would also be secure enough to follow Secretary of State requirements'",
        "'speaker_1': 'to House live ballots. That would be one of the things that would be challenging to figure out how we would staff all those people and keep them close enough to current staff to keep dual operations, legislative and election operations going.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'At the same time, we would also be competing with the county for poll workers and polling locations if we were to keep our traditional charter election dates of April and June. This is something called to vote Tuesday. And we've we've worked in the past with the county, and it's always challenging when we have an election on the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'same date as a county, when we're again competing for poll workers and polling locations. So there are some some things that I think would be very difficult and challenging for us going forward if we were to try and run our own elections again at this time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. That's all I have. Thank you. Second on the motion, I have Vice Mayor Richardson. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. You know, if we just think back to the discussions around voter participation in years past. You know, there's always the conversation about why do we have such low voter turnout?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And what we saw with the 74% turnout last last year during the consolidated elections. I think it's clear that Long Beach, as a large city, needs to be aligned with the state now. SB 415 is what triggered this effort.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It was a voter participation bill, while other states are making it more difficult to participate in elections in California. This bill intention was to make it easier. Specifically, where you see a big disparity between low turnout on off cycle and high turnout during a consolidated elections in Long Beach fell into that category.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We had such a wide difference that this qualify for SB 415. And so the idea here is just make it easier for people who are planning to vote to know when and where the election is because everything's on one ballot and it's just easier process for working people.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I'm happy to I'm happy to second this motion. Thank you, councilmember supervisor, for your your your your vision to bring this to the full council because it's a really important discussion. And I'm happy to support recommendation number four.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Council member, Austin.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. I'll be supporting the recommendation. But I just want to get in a couple of comments from someone who has recently, you know, gone through a pretty long election with the consolidation with the state and having the county run our elections.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So under as I understand it, and please correct me if I'm wrong, but under the resolution that's being proposed, this will basically ensure that all of our municipal elections moving forward will be administered by the county, as I understand it, and into two councilmember supernovas point.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, I do see that there is just a it's built into our charter and our system. There is an imbalance between on even numbers districts when it comes to elections. There's a lot more emphasis when there's citywide candidates.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Of course the mayor's race that that affect the dynamics. I'm moving in this direction. I would just say that it will end it no matter what. It will change the dynamics of campaigns and elections in our city because the runoff period is much longer.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This this last election cycle, a runoff period was literally eight months, which which is dramatically different from a two month election runoff cycle where we would have elections in April and runoffs in June. So eight months and like I said, changes, dynamics.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It makes campaigns far more expensive. I would just just say for the council and anybody listening and understanding the realities of campaigns and elections, we may need to look at our campaign finance limits as well because of this this longer election period that will be required in moving in this decision.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Now, I do support this decision because the the the voter turnout, it to me makes it worth it. You know, if there's a longer period of time for voters to get to know and understand candidates or clarify, you know, campaigns and understand what's really going on in their community, that that's a that's a added value.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And if we can get more people to turn out to vote, it's worth it, in my opinion. And so for that, I'll be supporting it. But I do. I do so with caveats and in understanding that we may have to tweak other areas of our campaign finance and election processes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Godfrey Ringa. Yeah. Just for clarification. So this is going to be a two step process.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We're voting for now is like for.'",
        "'speaker_0': '2022.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then we'll.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Have another discussion or maybe a ballot.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Measure that will go for.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'How to handle the 2024.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Election, which.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Would be a a presidential.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Election or maybe a march November election. Yeah. And it would be 20, 24 and beyond. Actually the ballot measure would would link up or kind of permanently in the charter.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Is the the. Would it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Be.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Possible maybe to avoid being somewhat pigeonholed into a into significant dates that maybe could have a broader language that would say that we would just be aligned with with county elections because of our inability to step up and handle the elections internally within the city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They're throwing it out there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I mean, Mr.. Mr. Parkin or Monique can answer, but the county elections are they follow the state. It's the same it's the same thing, I believe.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right. That that's correct. And I totally support the fact that, you know, we need to increase voter turnout. And if the proof is in the pudding. We're having a lot of it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Councilmember. This is Attorney Park and that to answer your question, yes, it is a two step process that we would be coming back to. If this motion is successful, a resolution will be coming back to you to align the 22 2022 election specifically.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then the bigger issue would come to the Charter Amendment Committee for discussion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next. Next up I have is Councilman Price.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Mr. Mayor. Just so I have clarity, the motion on the floor is for item number or the proposal number four. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes, that's correct. Item number four.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Thank you very much. And then I just have a question. Do we have any idea how other cities are approaching their elections when they are not aligned with the state? Is everyone kind of going in this direction because the census data has been delayed and they continue to be delayed and impact redistricting in the region for'",
        "'speaker_3': 'other cities? Is that information we even have?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I can tell up first. I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This is Amy Webber.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Councilwoman Pryce. I was just going to say that we do have some information from our redistricting consultants that this has become a statewide issue because of the because of the delay in the release of the census data. And that's the reason that we're recommending this option.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We actually expect that the state will take some action to address this, since most of the other cities in the state are in the same position that we are. I'm sorry, Monique. Now over to you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Pryce, I can tell you that most cities have already changed their election dates to align with the county due to as 415. We are one of the few cities that did not have a charter city that did not do a charter amendment and we did an ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So most cities are a little bit ahead of us in that they've already addressed the issue with their charter. There are some cities out there that are general law cities and they are already consolidated with the county, so they did not have to make that change.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I do have a representative from the county on the meeting, Mr. Jeff Klein. If we have any specific questions for the county, he might be able to address those for us. Jeff, is there anything you'd like to to say on this topic?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No, I think it's been covered pretty thoroughly. But if anyone does have specific questions, we are happy to answer.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Thank you. I don't think I have any specific questions on that, but can I just get a little bit more explanation and clarity on the con of the holding? The elections in June? November could result in uneven campaigning cycle between 2020 and 2022 candidates I know been super not asked about that, but is that limited to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'only 2020 and 2022? Or are we going to have an even campaign cycles every two years as a result? So I.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Always only read.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This. This is city attorney parking. I think the answer and someone may have just said it, it will always be uneven as to the months if the state maintains their current cycle in which in the presidential election year they have the primary in March and the general in November and then in gubernatorial elections they have the primary'",
        "'speaker_4': 'in June and the general election in November. So you would always have that timing, which would be different for the even council districts versus the odd council districts. And as Councilmember Sabrina mentioned, the citywide are in the gubernatorial years.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. And so that difference would be two months. Basically.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes. Made three months, April through March versus June. Right. Two months.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. Okay. All right. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman Allen.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mayor. I will definitely be supporting this. Just going through a recent election, it might be way harder on the candidate, but it's way easier for the voter. And that's why it's worth it. And I think it's just.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Important.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That we keep our elections aligned with the state. A voter.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Participation or turnout at 75%.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is just incredible, and that speaks for itself. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Sara, please.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mayor. I support the the option number four and similar. I think building off of my colleague here council member Austin comment about the gap between March and November. The primary of 2020 to November was long. It was also unprecedented because between the primary and the general was the pandemic as well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I'm not quite sure what it would normally be like anyways, but I do know that decreasing the gap between primary and general from eight months to six months I think will help people in general. Remember that there's going to be another election in November.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I think, you know, it's also helpful for the candidate and I think for the public as well. And I think the other concern I have is just ongoing confusion for voters around when election dates are. But I think that it's in general confusing anyway because of what happened with the pandemic.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I thought that there was a lot of education done by county and the city to ensure that people knew about the election and that at least the county is running it. And I feel that this would just go on to what was done back in 2020.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I think it's always going to be education. And I'm just, you know, impressed that we had such a high voter turnout in 2020 and the general election because it was also during the pandemic as well. So I can't imagine how much higher would even be if people are able to even vote also in person.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I really support it in the sense that it really the alignment really helps with voter turnout and engagement, especially people who do not generally vote. So those are kind of my thoughts. And I think that, you know, regardless of, you know, I think the alignment always helps in just pulling our resources around education stuff.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thanks again.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilwoman. Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I want to echo the comments specifically of councilman sorrow and Councilman Allen. I do think there was a lot of confusion, and I think this year was very unique. I have heard and again, I don't have my Ph.D. and I was not in the class that did the study, but I had heard that the biggest correlation and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'sorry that there is a correlation between. The state elections and local election turn out. But that that is not the causation, that the actual causation is something that Councilmember Austin so poignantly mentioned, which is are campaign funding issues.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Some of the reasons that more people turn out at the statewide is because there's more people that are out there campaigning, connecting with people. And when they're doing that, obviously through mailers and all those things, more people are connected and aware.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think that that's a very interesting alignment. I remember when I had originally heard this, it was more than a year ago, I want to say it was two or three years ago because at the time I was undergoing an election and.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'While technically there were opponents two, one, three and nine, really, they didn't have campaigns. They didn't have candidates that were funded. Like Councilmember Aranda and I and my district in a march, June election cycle and I don't know Councilmember Odinga's numbers, we were at voter turnout over 40%.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But why was that? It was because we had five candidates that were all heavily funded. There was a lot of PAC money coming into the city because there were a lot less contested races, there was a lot more money spent in a lot smaller area.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so potentially that could have been the actual causation. When we talk about what's the future of our city wide offices, I would love to see some way worked into the city charter change that. We move two of our citywide elections on to the even cycle so that it gives additional interest in the even districts.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So if we currently have four citywide elected city attorneys, city prosecutor, city auditor and mayor, pick two of them and put them on even put two of them, put them on on. And then now you're you're really even in that playing field and you're bringing in additional interest at the citywide level.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In the past, we did not do that because from what I had heard and maybe Councilmember Super and I can comment on this because he seems to be the council historian, it had to do with costs in the even years we only ran precincts in those districts that were even and the rest of the city didn't even'",
        "'speaker_3': 'necessarily know there was an election. And so it was a cost saving measure. But if we are going to align with the state, there's some significant value in potentially moving those over. I would also say that I find significant value.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I've had always contested races. I find considerable value in a good, hotly contested race. I think it's great for the constituents to know and understand what's been done. I think that it's great for candidates to get out there and tell their story.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think that an eight month period between I does two things. It does probably reduce advantages of incumbents because there's more time for the new candidate to get their name out there. But it also creates voter fatigue. I mean, the number of people who get really frustrated and overwhelmed with the amount of campaign materials can be overwhelming'",
        "'speaker_3': '. And so I've heard a lot of that. The other concern I have, and this is something that I was uniquely able to participate in the county wide voter system testing is the same complaint that anyone who tested it had done and it was on the wall as a viable, valid complaint.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That is the same complaint I've heard from so many people who participated in this election that you are so far down ballot. Sometimes by the time you're getting to your local city elections, there's no mixing up of the races on the electronic system, which is a possibility within the programing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But you could potentially have to vote on 25 things before you get to your local city council race and then that they within the state guidelines currently they draw letters of the alphabet in order and candidates are listed in the order that their letter of the alphabet was in the order.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so now with this countywide system, the first three candidates are on the first page. But if you're one of those other candidates, you have to put first next to go to the next page, which we did not have that disadvantage when we ran our own elections, when we ran on elections.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'All the candidates were right there, clear as crystal. There were many people that I had heard in this race who had gone to the voting place and called me and said, I didn't see so-and-so on the ballot, so I voted for so-and-so.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I'm like, you had to push next to go to the next page because there were multiple candidates. And those are some concerns that I have that I hope that now that all of this is coming to the forefront, I know many of my colleagues on the council have a lot of dialog with people who are making'",
        "'speaker_3': 'these decisions at the state level. I hope that some of these things are discussed and I hope that at this time we really do address campaign finance. I see the value of what the residents said, which is they wanted the amount of money in campaigns to be lower and therefore we had low campaign contribution limits.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But the issue is that on both sides, it doesn't matter what your political belief system is. Outside money is easier to be raised because they don't have those same limits. And so therefore, what I saw in this last election is a ton of independent expenditures really making significant influence on our local city council races.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think I read multiple times in the paper that there were candidates where large quantities of their money were from outside the city and from big dollar amounts. And I don't know that that's what Long Beach residents want.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think Long Beach residents really want. The local person who they know and understand, knows their issues and is here to listen and thoughtfully provide input to be able to really. Make the changes to the status quo that they feel are necessary to to live in a vibrant city like we do here in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I know that each of us have and gone through that process, and it is a daunting one. But for newcomers to not have an infrastructure and be viable is really difficult with the the influence that money has on elections all over the country.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I'll be supporting the item on the floor tonight. But I think it's it's it's a step in the right direction. I think there's a lot more steps that need to take place. And I would.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilman, your 5 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So you think. I'd like to thank Daryl. Thank you. Good idea.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I got councilman's in house.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. I just wanted to say how supportive I am of this item. I think it's going to be great for our voters, especially in the in the communities where we see the least amount of voters. And I live in a district where we don't have a big voter turnout.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So aligning with the state really does make sense so we can get as many voters out there as possible. I do share some of the concerns that have been raised here today through my colleagues and I, and I'm hopeful that we can be able to address them as we move forward.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. I just wanted to follow up on my point related to the a very long runoff period. Right. Election, though, that the other part of that is that, you know, at some point, a challenger may may win an election in March.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Right. They're going to have to wait eight months to take office. And that's a dynamic that I just couldn't imagine. A lot can happen in an eight month period. And then the second thing that I want us to think about also is maybe the clerk can give some clarification on this is our current matching funds process.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Right. And most people don't accept that matching funds and don't utilize it. But we do have a provision in our our to our our election process that allows for it. But it was set up on the two month run off period.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Right. And so you can get matching funds for a primary, but the general is actually much less because it is factored in for a much smaller period. And so when I talk about, you know, us addressing other aspects that may not have been thought about, that is one area that we are definitely going to have to address'",
        "'speaker_2': '. Should we we support this this motion. We're going to have to make provisions in our matching funds process that allow for individuals that don't necessarily have, you know, the ability to raise a lot, lots of money. The intent for matching funds is to allow individuals who don't have a lot of money to participate in the process.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so these are these are factors that we are going to have to build in to everything that we are we're discussing here. In an ideal world, I will just tell you, I would prefer to have a set June and November election cycle so that we can we can we can base it off that the March primary'",
        "'speaker_2': 'is is a little difficult and. And perhaps I would like to to consult with L.A. County just to see if June elections are happening in any way. And if we could tag in to that, that would make a lot of sense as well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And it's because of the other factors that I'm bringing up. And again, I do like Councilmember Munoz. Thought to potentially look at, you know, adding a couple of the citywide charter elections positions to to the even number election cycle that would balance things out and make for more robust participation, in my opinion.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I just wanted to get those points out because.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman. Councilman Price.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I wanted to follow up on Councilwoman Mondo's comments regarding finance reform. Is that is it possible? And perhaps I can offer this is a friendly to ask city staff, and I assume it would be the city attorney's office to come back with a report that covers what our current campaign financing structure is and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'what options we might have in terms of campaign contribution limits, limitations on outside money and things of that nature. Just an educational piece in terms of what's even possible for a legislative body to consider in the area of campaign reform, for those for those of us who may not be plugged into it from prior employment in the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'political arena. Just an educational report.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Councilmember Price We could certainly prepare a memo for for the council on the on those issues, one of which is the campaign contribution limits, which is which was established by the voters. And so that would also require a voter initiative.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we can cover that in the memo for you. Absolutely.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah, I would. It just. I'm just looking for some education and a better understanding of the issue, because this is all very other than me running for office in 2014. I don't have any personal experience with any of this, and I'd love to learn a little bit more about it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is that a that's a friendly amendment. I'm not sure if Councilman Superdog accepts that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, that friendly is accepted. And if I'm okay. Espino Mayor Garcia in Agua. Absolutely. Okay. So first, you know, thanks for all the great comments from everyone on council. I think this kind of proves the point that this was the right venue to bring this item to because the comments have been very productive.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I would in particular like to acknowledge Councilman Austin's comments, probably because I made the same comments a few years ago when this idea came here. I'm coming from the side that it is a tough thing to deal with these on runoffs.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think a couple of years ago, I made the statement that council was I was in a six week runoff one time, and one reporter described myself and my challenger as up to two heavyweight prizefighters in the 12th round.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I mean, it took a toll on us just during that six weeks, not to mention the toll that it takes on on the voters that Councilman Mongo mentioned in voter fatigue on these issues. So I approach this issue on that basis as zero.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is there a way to keep this old system we have? And I think what's been shown here tonight is that we have the increased voter turnout. Turnout. We have the increased. Well, just I'll just say that just the practical nature of things that we probably don't have a practical way to approach this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I just wanted to acknowledge Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'For bringing up the point.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And Councilwoman Price. Yeah, let's let's do this. I probably should should bring this back to our committee, the elections committee, so we can look at all these things there. But I think, Mr. Parkin, you said this this would come back to council as as part of the package.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Councilmember the as I understand the motion, if approved this evening, a resolution would come back to the City Council for approval establishing the election dates for the 2022 election to align with the state. And then at a future date to be determined the A we would draft a for your consideration a proposal for a ballot initiative for'",
        "'speaker_4': 'for the 2022 election to establish the election dates on a go forward basis consistent with a for our charter, which would amend our charter and we could before that comes back, obviously we would get a memo separate to the council as requested by Councilmember Price and accepted as a friendly.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'OC with the overall goal of mitigating this issue of these long runoff elections.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We could certainly look at that. I think that the right now we are dependent on the state election dates and that cycle of the different long runoff cycle on the presidential elections is has been a matter of the state concern.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so if we follow the state, it would still be a long election cycle for presidential and then the June November for gubernatorial. We will certainly talk to the county.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Would be I wasn't speaking of the dates to set the fact that we have these dates. What is the best way to deal with that? And the starting point is campaign finance.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Absolutely. And we heard from council member Austin loud and clear on those issues. And I think we'll address those in the memo on what the options for the council would be.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. Thank you. I got two more folks cued up and then we'll we'll go to the vote, Councilman Mongo and then Vice Mayor Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. So I was listening to that. But and I'm the only one where the city attorney's microphone is very, very muffled. So am I understanding that. We are currently moving to the state, but the city attorney is bringing back information on the possibility that since the county runs many June elections, that they're also going to bring'",
        "'speaker_3': 'back data related to potentially doing June, November 2022.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'For 2022, we are going to bring back a resolution that aligns with the states election cycle, which may change with state legislation because of the delay of the census data. So we're not bringing back fixed dates at this time or in the resolution.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It'll be to align with whatever the state determines their primary and general election will be for 2022. The ballot initiative could come back with various options for the Council to consider.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And did I hear that? The data from the census won't be back in time for March, but if we were to have the election in June, we potentially could have the correct lines.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The hope is we could have a June election if we receive the census data in time and the redistricting commission finishes their process in time to have it in place for 180 days prior to the June election. But that's where we're thinking we may receive state legislation changing those dates to make sure that there's sufficient time to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'hold the election.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Wonderful. To add to Susie's friendly, I'll just make a comment that to really understand the context of whatever recommendation the city attorney brings back related to campaign finance, and it might be valuable to also bring back the correlating data related to spending in each of the elections.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Say for a five year or ten year, probably a ten year period, to be able to correlate multiple years and be able to see here's how much money generally was spent. The election. I'm not saying here as much money was spent on behalf of one candidate versus another.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But here's that number, because when you look at the total amount spent and you'd correlate that to voter turnout, and it's it's pretty striking. And I would be interested to see if it aligns with language the way that it was presented on the national level and then how we as a city could improve that to our own'",
        "'speaker_3': 'benefit of getting more voters right. We always want the most voters. We'd love to take money out of elections, but it doesn't seem like that's happening any time soon. So I'm open to any suggestions that this benefits the voters.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Okay. I had another customer queue up again. Let's try to hopefully wrap this up soon. Vice Mayor Richardson and then councilman's in the house and then we'll go with the governor. Right. Thank you. So just just a few comments.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So by aligning with the state, the amount of voters quadruple doubles quadruples. Our limits are very low. The amount of money it would take to communicate with more voters would mean without addressing campaign finance reform, essentially, it makes our campaigns more dependent on outside spending, independent expenditure campaigns.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And those typically have there's no control that a candidate has over these campaigns. A lot of times it's divisive. A lot of times the facts aren't correct. And if some of the worst types of campaign we have to if we're going to look at campaign finance reform, we have to also look at public financing campaigns.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's something we have to look at as a big city and major cities are looking at not just matching, but actual public finance campaign. We should look at as a part of those options because what it does is limit the dependency on outside spending and allows the candidate to demonstrate more respect over the nature of the topics'",
        "'speaker_0': 'and more command over it. It allows them to have a level playing field in how in how they they campaign. Some cities are doing this also by looking at a public engagement element in their general plan that specifically speaks to voters saying election requirements, election laws, all of those sort of being a part of a vision document'",
        "'speaker_0': 'for the city that has come up in the past. And perhaps this is something when we get to the charter committee as a whole, we think about what that measure may look like. It may be election, maybe more comprehensive around public engagement, all of those things.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So just some food for thought for the council to think about. But in general, I think the comments Councilman Austin made about the campaign finance were right on. I think Councilman Mungo's comments typically about how the city guides a Prius are going to be apples to apples now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think splitting the city wide, that's something you got to look at. And so these are also all very good, very good items. But I think the purpose here, we need to just remember that it's about making it easier for people to get access, to make it make decisions, engaging their government and, you know.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Turn out makers and turn out takers. Unfortunately, city council races are not turnout makers. The school board races are not real turnout because the turnout makers are city wide elections or gubernatorial elections. Your your your presidential elections. So aligning with the state does have benefits.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But there isn't a president on every ballot. Right. There is an open governor's seat, every ballot. So I think mix it up some of the citywide. It isn't a terrible idea. Okay. Thank you. Customers in Dallas.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mayor. I just wanted to say that I also had a lot of questions about the financing for for the elections back when I started, because as you all my record, I ran in a special election. And in those special elections, the finance contribution was bigger.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so I knew that it would be definitely hard to to to run on a smaller or smaller finances limit. But I one of the things that I did do as a as the chair of the Elections Oversight Committee is that I also wanted information, just and educational information on what it was that needed to be done'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to to look into the possibility of increasing the limits of of the finance contributions. And as my colleagues on that committee might recall, we did get information back, which was that it would have to go to the voters.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I think we're all in this on the same wavelength right now. So I you know, that's something that a lot of other cities are doing. But I'm I'm happy that this is that we're supporting this item moving forward.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I, like everyone here on the council, has said aligning the elections, I hope, is going to bring a lot more turnout, voter turnout to, ah, not only either state or citywide, I should say, not only our citywide elections, but our district elections as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And before we go to a vote, I just want to just add one thing I think has been mentioned. This is a great discussion, by the way. I think the one thing that keeps coming up so that it's interesting is California.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Of course, the reason why there's those different dates is because California wants to have a bigger they move their primary are dependent on the presidential to influence that primary process. And so there's right now a conversation in the state legislature about not doing that by just picking one date and keeping it know, keeping it the same every'",
        "'speaker_0': 'other year so that there isn't the, you know, the back and forth. So we'll see where that conversation goes and it may impact our conversations here in the future as well. Madam Clerk, please go and call the vote.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'District one if. A district to. I District three.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'District four.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mayor Garcia. First of all, I want to thank the council colleagues who signed on to the item with me. I really appreciate it. Parking has always been a significant issue in many parts of our city, and Belmont sure has not been immune to that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This item asks the city staff to look at what opportunities may be available to alleviate some of the parking pressures felt by the businesses and the residents. The parking regulations in the Shaw are constrained by a number of factors.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'One is access to the coastal area is important because of the proximity of Belmont Shore to the ocean. And so we want to make sure that people that are coming to visit the ocean and have access to the coast have ample parking.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But also we have a business corridor that also takes up some of those that competition for parking spaces. Meanwhile, we have residential neighborhoods that are in very close proximity within 50 to 100 yards of these that the business corridor.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so we want to make sure that we're alleviating pressure for the residents as well. There are other areas of Long Beach. And before I go one, I want to thank our planning department, who they're getting a lot of the requests for commercial tenants and they're realizing that the parking regulations in the shore have been updated.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And there are creative things that we can do within our current footwork and footprint in order to make some some parking mitigation changes. And so there's other areas of Long Beach and many other cities that have looked at creative solutions like shared parking, employee offsite parking and streamlined changes for new businesses so that there are practices in'",
        "'speaker_3': 'line to help the businesses and improve parking in Shaw without having too much of an impact on residents. The focus of improving parking in the past and since I've taken office have been evaluation of necessary red curbs or reevaluate where you should have those.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We've tried to reduce streets we think impacts to parking. We did a comprehensive study in 2016 of parking. We added 150 new diagonal parking spots, which I disagree with one of the callers. I don't believe that that has resulted in any traffic or parking impacts in the in the area that the 150 diagonal spots were added.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think that's been an added benefit for people who are trying to visit the coast. And we are now exploring the possibility of a pilot program that would allow for electric shuttles to help transport transport people to and from the shore and around the shore.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think there are some creative and practical ways that we can look at managing the parking issue in Belmont Shore. And I know that in 2014, when I came into office, there was a raging debate about purchasing a private home in the shore and trying to get into a parking lot that is absolutely dead on arrival idea'",
        "'speaker_3': 'for me. That's not what this item is about. So this item is about exploring creative things like shared parking or tandem parking and looking at ways that we can help businesses work together to utilize parking in areas or businesses that aren't utilizing them at certain times.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so I'd ask staff to please work with our office as part of this item so that we can do a resident focus group meeting and then a business focus group meeting so that we can take all of that input into the final recommendations.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I'm hoping that that that's part of the motion. I'm hoping staff is agreeable to that, and our office will obviously coordinate both of those. But with that, I ask my colleagues to support this item.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. I have a second. Councilman Zendejas. I just want to add, you know, I. I have to tell you, like Councilman, I'm very. Excited about this item, to be honest, because I think it's absolutely the right thing to look at.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I'm not sure. And I was just checking. I think any time that we can rethink anything, we can rethink what the major businesses are today and make it more walkable. So I really I really think this is really great.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I was curious. I don't know. Mr. Morgan knows, but how long has it been since we've actually look, I imagine that we haven't looked at the government. You're kind of broken standards for for for businesses, for for properties in a long time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I know, I know. We recently went through process for downtown and some other places, but how long has it been?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Approximately 20 years.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah, a little bit longer.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So the regulations. This is Christopher Coombs, Deputy Director Development Services. The regulations were adopted in 1988. There were some very minor changes in 94 and 95, but there hasn't been a comprehensive update since 88. The city did a study in 2015 really dealing with this, the public street and the public right away.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But there hasn't been a look at the private parking regulations comprehensively since 88.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Do we still require all businesses properties to actually have parking spots or parking adjacent to the business or behind? Is that a requirement? And the SHA still.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes and no. So all businesses are required to have parking and part of what we're trying to do is look at what makes sense and what doesn't make sense. So you see some empty storefronts in the store and then you also see some businesses that are doing really well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And if I'm an entrepreneur and I want to open up a business, if I find a place that is the same kind of business as me that went out of business, I can just open up. There is no change.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But if where I'm going to be a clothing store and now I want to do a tapas bar, that's a change of use, then you have to make up the difference in parking, which obviously is difficult to do because you can't.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There's nowhere to build new parking, so you can use offsite parking, but it's a very limited distance. So those are all things we'd be looking at. Can you share parking further away if the bank is open during the day and at different businesses open at night, why can't they be sharing that same parking?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we don't know the solutions because we have to do the work. So but but those are all topic areas that we're looking at.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, great. Well, before I turn this over, I just want to add, I've been talking about parking minimums and requirements to businesses. I mean, across the city. I think I've talked about it with folks and in the department and with Mr. Modica and Ms..'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Tatum as well. And so I know this item is specific to Beaumont. Sure. And I obviously support that. But I just want to encourage the staff that we have got to move faster. I'm looking at the city wide.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This is there is so much of the city that needs this type of work. And so I'm very thankful that Councilman Price brought this forward. It's important to do investment. Sure. And once we get Belmont Shore off the ground and focus there, I mean, this is this is a big issue and it's a big problem.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we've taken way too long to address parking minimums. And I think you guys know what my position is on this. I've mentioned it to you, but it'll be dramatically the burden to be dramatically reduced on on businesses and developments as it relates to those parking requirements.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So the mayor the second on the motion is councilman's in the house. And so obviously I really strongly support this. And thank you, Councilman Price. Customers in the house.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor, for that. And a big thank you to Councilmember Price for bringing this forward. And I do note that this is Belmont Ward concentrator, but it really does affect the whole city as a whole because this is this gets the conversation started for all of our bids.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Right. And so one of the things that I, I also would like to encourage staff to start thinking about in other other areas in the city, especially in the downtown area, which I represent along with Councilwoman Allen, is, you know, it's let's start looking at that also.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And also, you know, right now we're living in unprecedented times and our businesses need our help more than ever before.

        "'speaker_3': 'The Cosigners Council members, Van de Haas and Austin. I absolutely welcome review of any policies that can improve our park or any of our parking options that are similar. We have some of the same problems in District two that I know that Belmont Shaw has with limited parking parking.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And these residents and businesses need our help with this more than ever. So I am just extremely grateful that this was brought forward, that we are having these conversations. I look forward to seeing the solutions that are found and seeing if they'll be applicable in District two or citywide.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So thank you so much.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'What which which elements of this did we test in uptown?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So Councilmember, because of the grant you helped us secure and support from Councilmember Orson during the uptown process, we had a phase one which is done and a Phase two, which we're in now.

        "'speaker_4': 'how we can kind of bring new life to vacant storefronts. So we'll be able to use some of those lessons learned. But obviously what we're talking about in Councilmember Price's district is a smaller, more targeted effort to look at some policy interventions that can help us right now with the businesses and parking roles and the economic recovery'",
        "'speaker_4': 'in Uptown, we did a top to bottom review, so we did a whole visioning process with the community. We looked at uses, we looked at building form and what are buildings going to look like. We looked at housing related issues, so it's a very broad.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We looked at mobility on the streets and and that was fantastic. That's. A great model. That's that's not what we're talking about today with this particular council item. You know, the goal is to work with the council member in an expedient manner to look at some lower hanging fruit in terms of parking and some lessons already learned'",
        "'speaker_4': 'up in North Long Beach and elsewhere and other cities like Santa monica, Pasadena or West Hollywood and and apply that to the Belmokhtar situation. So so that's that's what we're looking at. And that's where we are today.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I would just offer something. So, one, you know, when we applied to the grant, this guy for the grant, we talked about testing things that will make it easier to deploy city wide because we already tested it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right. So you can pick it up. It should make it easy to drop in any other area of town. Some of those elements, that's the first thing I would offer. And then the second thing I would say is Skaggs just engaged in a curve management study last year and it's incredible.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We use our curve completely differently now than we did before because of Ride, Share and Micro-Mobility and all of those things. And I think I would ask, have we done a curve study in Long Beach Curve Management study in Long Beach?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And if not, I think we should we should think about that, how the how the management, the curve can actually create more parking opportunities, particularly in business areas. So I'd like to see a curve management study, particularly in business areas of the city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So have we done that already? Mr. Coombs.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, that would be done in concert with our public works department, and they have looked at aspects of curb usage, including very recently. So looking at how we do overlap zones, how we accommodate scooters and bikes and other micromobility mobility that we didn't have in the past.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So they have addressed many of those issues, but they haven't done the big comprehensive study that I think you're you're referring to. So certainly we can as as resources are available, keep that in mind for the future.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. That's a that's an offer I just think is a big you know, we can certainly target, say, Belmont Shore. But there's I could tell you the curve management is going to be something we have to look at downtown, every business district.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have to think about that because the you know, everything has changed so much from the time that we established parking standards, all of those things. And we just have to think about it completely differently, I think. And it doesn't have to be a part of that part of this motion, or maybe it could be.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I think we have to really look at either pilot piloting a few areas of town to do a park and do a port management study and see what the impact is or some city wide study. But we we certainly need to do that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We could probably just pick up and learn from Wasco what did last year with with its current crop management study just wanted to offer off those. I'm hearing a lot of this across the region is really good stuff.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thanks, Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thanks. And I obviously support this with the business districts in my district. We have very similar challenges with Bixby knows Bixby knows was not in the plan. I want to be clear on that. And we are watching and waiting for the results of that plan to be adopted and implemented so that we can look at it and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'implement it in other areas of the district. That was always the plan. And so, you know, when it comes to how city staff is focused in terms of resources, I believe that they're always looking at a city wide view and always looking to focus in all areas of the city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We were just fortunate to have a grant in North Long Beach to kind of kick things off. And so, yeah, when those results are ready to be implemented, I certainly believe that they will be implemented citywide. I'm happy to sign on to this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I know Councilmember Price has some unique challenges in third district, along particularly with our Belmont Shore. And honestly, I believe that, you know, the the 2020 may may have exacerbated some of our challenges with the parklets that are now in place.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I don't know that they are going to go away. And so, you know, those are dark spots in many respects that we need to consider. And so I do like the idea of a curb management study, but also with in mind in mind that the that we were looking at more outdoor dining and possibly looking at having'",
        "'speaker_2': 'parklets year round in many of our business districts as well. So it's offer that I'm happy to support.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, councilman and House. And then we'll go to Councilman Price and then a vote.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I just have a quick question for city staff. I'm wondering if this could possibly lead to a change in the definition of r r r turnout streets north north claim was not recommended to have diagonal parking.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And but if we are seeing more walkable solutions, if we're thinking about, you know, more people using bikes and more micro mobility, can can those possibilities of those streets be reevaluated?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So, Councilmember I. Hesitate to give you the bureaucratic answer, but that falls within Public Works Minister Eric Lopez, and he's not at the table with us right this moment. So we'd be glad to connect you and I'll work on those important issues.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I think that would be a separate, discrete item from from what we're talking about today. And the city manager, Tom. Okay. I wanted to weigh in a little bit here because we've kind of talked about two different issues tonight.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So the item in front of you is really dealing with some of the private parking requirements that users are required for their part for their businesses. So we're seeing a challenge when someone comes in and they want to take over a new space.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The code says you have to provide X amount of parking if that parking doesn't wasn't already provided on your site. So that's kind of the issue there. In the past, we've really focused a lot on public spaces. So there's been studies in Belmont.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Shaw Pretty intense ones about, you know, how many more spaces can we give up for public looking at meter rates, looking at all kinds of different options? And we've done that in Belmont. Sure. And spent a lot of time there.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we've been investing in some of those solutions. We also did that pretty intensely in in downtown and in Alameda Beach through the through a parking study there. So those are kind of the public side. And then we can look at the options for how you provide public parking.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This is more focused on relaxing and some of those parking requirements that we're placing on private business. So those two kind of work in concert with each other. But they are they are unique and different.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you so much for that levitation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. I just want to say how deeply we need this. I've met with business owners multiple times related to some of the uses that we have and some of the challenges with the uses. I mean, we had a play center that wanted to go in in the seventh District and then in the fifth District.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And they were being moved around their development services to facilities that might meet their parking needs because they were classified as a gym, but they were not a gym. They were a little group of people who have 5 to 6 preschoolers come in and play with musical instruments and play with balls.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But that was the only classification. And so we have to come up with something that also gives our planning department some jurisdictional value to bring forward a recommendation that's within some parameters as an exception, because I would say that that business would have been one of those exemptions that the planning department would have supported or it could'",
        "'speaker_3': 'have gone to the Planning Commission. But I recognize they don't want to do one offs, but there are times where the code just doesn't explain the new types of businesses and quite frankly, these codes that are only updated every ten, 15 years.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And even if we updated them every three years, there's a rapidly changing. A commercial market right now, and we need to be available to respond to that. Thank you. Great item.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And and then Councilwoman Price to conclude.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you very much. So a couple of things. I just I appreciate the city manager's comments, but I just I want to make my intent very clear. It's not to relax any parking standards for businesses. It's to think creatively about how they can provide the parking that is required so as to not put more pressure on the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'residents and the residential streets. So I think that we have the same intent, but I just wanted to make sure that that that soundbite isn't misconstrued because I don't think that's anyone's intent. Councilman Richardson or Vice Mayor Richardson's comment about the curb study.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I love that idea. In fact, I love it so much. I brought an item about three years ago that you all supported called the Read Curb Audit for parking impacted areas. And I think that we haven't received a report back on it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's been a couple of years, if I'm not mistaken, but that's exactly what we were thinking, because just by shortening some of the red curbs, we're able to squeeze in two or three more spots. And that's huge. I know it doesn't sound like a lot, but if we can pick up 20 or 30 spots along the business'",
        "'speaker_3': 'corridor at Belmont, sure, that's huge for us. Our parklets right now take up at least two spaces each, which is why the PARKLET program, one of the reasons the PARKLET program probably will not become a permanent program in Belmont.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sure, it's also a traffic safety issue, but it's also an issue with parking. And the Belmont short area is is we have some constraints that other districts may not have, council districts one and two may, but we have our coastal access constraints.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We those are you know, we can't make exceptions because we're we're in that coastal zone and it providing access to the public is our most important function for. So we don't have a lot of movement there. And so for us, if we can pick up a couple of spots through a curb audit where we don't need something'",
        "'speaker_3': ', that's a huge deal for us, we can get two spots back that were previously a temporary parklet. That's huge for us. So, so I look forward to that. I mean, maybe I can ask the city manager, do you know what the status is on the red carpet audit item that we brought for parking impacted areas?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes. So we reported back on that in December 2019. We did some quick estimates of what it would take to do that. That's a pretty intense study. At the time, it was estimated about six months and about 170,000.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we provide that back to the council. That's one that was not funded. And so when there's funding to move forward or if the council wants to reconsider that or reprioritize something else, then we could get started on that effort.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah, I appreciate that. You're right. We did we did get a report back that said thank you, but we don't have the money to do that right now. So so it really hasn't gone anywhere. So that might be something if the council's interested, but we can look at as a city because I think that would be really'",
        "'speaker_3': 'valuable. And I agree with Vice Mayor Richardson and Councilman Austin that this curb management issues is huge. And if we can pick up a lot of parking and parking impacted areas, and that could be the pilot, the parking impacted districts could be the pilot.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So that could work. And then I'm open to any updating of parking regulations in any other district. I didn't want anyone to think that it was limited to Belmont. Sure. It's just we have a very specific need right now, and I'm trying to stay in my lane and not dictate what everyone else should be doing in their'",
        "'speaker_3': 'districts, which is why this item was narrowly tailored to address a need that we have in our district. But any other district that wants an update like this for your own district, I'm going to obviously very much support.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I just left it off of my item because I don't want to get involved in everyone else's business through my own issues in my district that I'm trying to resolve. So thank you very much for your support.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And this is time, if I can add real quick, we do do these red curb evaluations all the time, so the item asks us to really look holistically and go and bring someone on to look at every red curb.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Our traffic team definitely works with council offices. If you say in this street, can you come out and take a look? We go through, we do those parking counts. We picked up a number of street or a number of parking spots in District two that way in the last couple of years.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so we've done some of that work, but we do it more on a case by case basis. That's easier for us to manage with internal staff. But you know, we certainly could do it citywide, but that does require us to bring on some more.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I just want make sure, you know, that is an option on some areas if you do have requests for those.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Roll call vote, please.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Mr. Mayor. I also killed after Councilman Price.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, that was after I had seen that. So you're right. Go ahead, Councilman. Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. I'm sorry. Something that Mr. Modica stated brought a question to my eye. So Councilman Pryce brought forward an item asking for a citywide red curb audit in 2019. City manager brought back a report that said it would be very expensive to do citywide.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Mr. MODICA Did you provide a price that it would be just to do parking impacted areas of the city?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The request at the time was to look at citywide. And so that's the estimate that we provided was 170.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The when is it that you determine that items brought forward during the year that say we would need this amount of money to do it, get folded into your budget proposal. So sometimes that happens.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah. So we consider those as part of the budget when one kind of innovation that we've done in the recent past is to create a section called unfunded needs so that we are reporting back during the budget process whether those items made it in or made it or did not.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so we do our best to go through all the two from fours and the ones that we have a funding source or a grant or others or or we feel just we that is at the top of the priority list.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We can fund those in the budget and then we like to identify those for you to say so that you know when you're going through your budget, whether or not it was funded, I'd have to check on this one specifically, but we do try to include that as a list of items.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So if this item was passed with unanimous vote of the council and several other items were passed by the unanimous vote of the council, and I was the budget chair at that time and. It wasn't mentioned, and I guess I just don't know.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Like there were lots of things included in the in the city manager's proposed budget. I guess I would like to understand. What? Just to better understand, when is it that the city manager determines that one thing is the higher priority?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They're all I mean, most of us support each others items with the unanimous vote, even if we may not agree in in principle for the funding component, we may agree in principle, but might not agree that it should be funded.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But sometimes you still fold those into your city manager recommendations. And then on the flip side, we might agree or disagree in principle, but since it's not been funded at this time, maybe you will be supportive at this time and see what it does cost and what comes of it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'What is it that we could do to kind of. Flesh out what that looks like or that process is there. I mean, I'm not budgetary anymore, so maybe it's a better question for Mr. Austin if he wants to maybe collaborate on an earlier phase of the budget.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But some of these items do get put into your budget recommendation and many do not. What do you determine to be the differentiator of the highest priority of the city?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think it's just.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That residents would say parking.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think it's just the amount of money that we have. Normally, when we get a amount to do one time dollars, we get to do a fraction of our overall needs. So we start first with the requirements like legal requirements, mandated requirements.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You know, I'll give an example. You know, we need water in our parks and we never have enough water for our parks. And so we try to take a small amount of that because we know that that's a priority.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If we were to fund all of that, we wouldn't have enough money for anything else. So I do wish we had when we get those big one time dollars, we go back and look at those priorities. But the process is there.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We provide the reports throughout the year. We now include it in the budget, which we didn't before, to make sure that people know. We can also highlight that with the Budget Oversight Committee moving forward and certainly if you have a different priority, then, you know when kind of what staff brings forward as were most urgent needs, that's'",
        "'speaker_4': 'what the budget process is for.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, I appreciate that. I just know that. And I could I could be wrong. But I thought I had heard Councilwoman Allen once comment that one of the major things that she hears from residents is their concerns about parking.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And if it's a number one priority in her district, then maybe we should look at and it's a high priority for residents and the third district, maybe we should look at and potentially what just the parking impacted areas.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Having a red card, albeit a red curb audit would cost because if it's a really high priority to a lot of residents and it enables people from different parts of the city to drive to work, they know that there was a lot of communication about I'm a patron and I Uber or I'm a patron, but but really'",
        "'speaker_3': 'we also need people from different parts of the city who need jobs to be able to get to the job centers, wherever those are. So I'd have to I wouldn't be able to take that pulse and see if it's still a concern of residents in certain areas.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But. I have consistently heard from people in the store downtown all over the place that parking is a top priority for them. So I would be interested in parking impacted areas, having that red curb steady number and be supportive of those districts while I don't have them in my side of town unless you're around Long Beach City'",
        "'speaker_3': 'College when they're in session. I would say that that's probably a high priority for those residents and I would want to be supportive. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Price.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I won't take long. I just. I did want to correct Mr. Mota. I know it's been. It was December, October of 2019 when I brought the item. And it did specifically ask for parking impacted areas. It was not for a citywide audit.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It was specific to parking impacted areas. And then within two months, we got basically the report back, which I just looked at that said, you know, this is going to cost, it's not feasible, it's going to cost us a lot of money.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I get it. I understand we have restraints in terms of what we can and can't spend and what the priorities are. But I agree with Councilwoman Mongo that we we really I do ask city staff to think about the individual priorities of each district, you know, instead of global priorities that may be, you know, more advocated'",
        "'speaker_3': 'for or more championed. I think it's important to look at the different districts because here we are two years later talking about an item that is a major issue and the cost associated with it is high, but it's certainly not that high.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I understand it's not a priority for the city management team, but some of the issues that might be a priority for the city management team may come at a higher cost. They may not be serving the needs of every district.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So if we could find ways to try to address the priorities, especially when they're not a huge number in all the districts in some way, I think that would be ideal because sometimes the major priority issues that cost a lot of money are really great priority issues for the city, but may not address a need that's much'",
        "'speaker_3': 'lower cost than in one of the districts. And so I'm trying to say a little bit of money could go a long way in some districts so I appreciate it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thinks thank you, Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I guess I'd like to just maybe reference a friendly or offer friendly to include in the staff work to identify or look to identify any sort of planning grants that may be available to assist with the this sort of separate in these parking impacted areas of our city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think I mean, obviously, the up plan was was referenced and that was staff resources were where were were have they actually been paid for by bye bye through a grant? And so I would just ask that we we look at doing the same in terms of identifying resources to help address these problems.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So that that would be a friendly just just a recommendation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There's a I'm assuming, Councilman Price, that you agree with that friendly.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Absolutely.'",

Over the last four years, I have discovered that there are so many different tree replacement programs that residents are often confused and misinformed about the pathway to get a pathway tree.

Today, Councilman Allen hosted an amazing Climate Action Committee meeting of the subcommittee of the City Council, and we talked about one component of tree replacement. But I also mentioned at that meeting and I'll add it here, two things that residents brought to my attention.'",

This council has been very active over the past eight, nine months, really focusing on violence prevention. Before we get into the presentations, I kind of want to reiterate, you know, why we're here tonight.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It started back in July. There was a request from this council to really look at a violence interruption strategy. Had a number of ideas and things that we could find if we get some future dollars and asked for some information back, which we kind of took as our base.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We then got the CARES Act and we funded a number of those items that we were able to kind of squeeze into the Cares Act money. Then we got a request back in February to really put together a strategy as we started to see some gun violence happening in our communities, which is happening throughout the nation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we'll talk some about that today. We reported back with a with a written document on all the things that PD was doing and then wanted to make sure we present that tonight. And then we also got a request in February to look at how do we fund additional violence prevention work kind of going forward.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then a lot of that got wrapped into the Recovery Act. So there's a lot that this council has asked for on violence prevention. Tonight, we're going to try to pull it all together and show you what's been happening and what we've already done, what we're working on now and what's coming in the future.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we'll have a presentation from our police chief about the kind of immediate intervention steps that we've been taking and the results there in the past couple of months. Also, kind of give you a reminder of where we are historically in crime and where we are right now as well with some of that with some of the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'uptick in shootings that the nation's experiencing. And then we'll go into a discussion with the health department on some of the upstream prevention, the downstream prevention, the things that we were working on longer term to really impact the cycle of violence in communities.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I will turn it and then we'll take questions at the end. I will turn it over to our police chief, Robert Luna.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mr. Modica. Good evening, Honorable Mayor and members of the City Council. I will be focusing on these three topics tonight. Violent crime trends in our community. Our response to those trends with an emphasis on gun violence and the importance of partnerships with other city departments and our community.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'As a reminder, we strive to align our department's vision, mission and core values with dealing with the law enforcement code of ethics. We seek to transform community relationships so that both our community and our police officers feel supported when addressing crime.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We have accomplished so much over the years as it relates to violent crime. As you will see here in the slide, that's up. We have less violent crime now than we have had in decades. But I want to make it clear we have a lot of work to do.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The increase in shootings is extremely concerning, and I will be discussing some of the ways in which we are addressing this challenge. In 2020. Most major cities throughout the country experience increases in murder and gun violence. Although in 2020, the murder rate in Long Beach increased by 5.9%, the overall crime rate decreased by 1.4% compared to 2019'",
        "'speaker_7': '. Currently, total citywide violent crime is up nearly 15% through March 31st of 2021, and that's driven by shootings. However, murder is down year to date, 22%. And I want to say and I want to make this clear, whether it's one murder five or whatever.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This is unacceptable. And I really do want to remind everyone that every victim absolutely matters. These are family members and friends and neighbors that are significantly traumatized. Every time somebody is killed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Chief, can you go back to that slide just 1/2? And I was just having this conversation with the group of a group of folks. And I just want to re-emphasize something. I know it's it's not on the slide, per se, but something you said that that's not reflected there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The group of folks I was chatting with were mentioning to me that that murders have dramatically increased this year and more people are falling victim to homicide, which obviously is the most serious of crime. I will use what you've shared with us is that year to date, the most serious of crime, which of course, is homicide, is'",
        "'speaker_0': 'actually down year to date this year to last year, is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That's correct. The Long Beach, the city of Long Beach's murder rate is down 22% in 2021 year to date. And if I'm assuming that the people who are approaching you, people get their information in so many different ways and there's a lot of media attention and there should be on other cities around us and really other cities'",
        "'speaker_7': 'in the country that are experiencing a very high rate of murder this year. But fortunately, Long Beach is not in that category.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then and then on this slide, just before we continue going again, I think we oftentimes read or I think rightly so in the media, you know, what's going on with with crime and violent crime. And I think you address the shooting piece, which is so important.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But the the overall trend as far as Long Beach, I know that historically today, the violent crime rate in Long Beach is still lower than it was 20, 30, 40 or 50 years ago. Is that right?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That is correct. The previous slide, if we can go back to the previous slide, if you look at this slide here, it's it goes back to 1970. And you see that in 1991, Long Beach cataloged 9567 violent crimes.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Again, that was in 1991. In 2020, if you compare it to 1991, there's a 75% decrease down to 2340 violent crimes. Again, that was last year in 2020. So although we had an overall decrease, if you're comparing it back to 91, there has been a significant decrease.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And I just wanted to point that out. I know that you have a lengthy presentation, but I think obviously we read so much about what happens day to day, which again is really important, but it's oftentimes in what we read, what's not obviously included in that is, of course, is about how that what's going on'",
        "'speaker_0': 'today actually relates to what happened, you know, ten or 30 or 40 years ago. And certainly the issue around homicide, every time you read someone that loses their life and everyone has a story, I obviously I think we are somewhat heartened that the numbers haven't spiked from this year to last year, and we're not seeing the increases'",
        "'speaker_0': 'that that other cities have. And of course, the year, of course, there's still a lot a long way for the year to go and that certainly can change. But it is heartening to know where that is at this moment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So sorry to stop you there, Chief. I just thought you kind of went through that pretty quick, and I wanted to clarify some of that for some of the folks I've been talking to as well. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You're welcome. So moving ahead from this led. There we go. Just catching up here. You see a map here on your screen. And here you will see citywide shootings that include hit and no hit shootings and firearm arrests through April 15th.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Our police officers have made 177 firearm related arrest year to date. 60% have been prohibitive possessors and 18% have been previously arrested with firearms. If we were to overlay this map with the poverty and unemployment rates and the level of education in these areas, we believe that you would find a direct correlation between violent crimes and these'",
        "'speaker_7': 'socio economic factors. 2020 was a bad year for many reasons. We've talked about this for several meetings. We believe that the possible possible causes for these crime increases are related to a series to the serious impacts on the criminal justice system in our community resulting from the COVID 19 pandemic.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In May of 2020, our city hit the highest level of unemployment at 20.8%. The California Department of Corrections and the Los Angeles County Jail have released over 111,000 inmates. Due to the risk of COVID exposure. Repeat offender arrest.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Meaning somebody who was arrested three or more times are up 27%. From 2019. Trials and other court proceedings have experienced significant delays. School closures, the lack of programing have negatively impacted youth engagement. And and something pretty stunning. And it's at the bottom of of this specific slide.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In 2020, recorded gun sales were up 64% nationwide when compared to 2019. Which means there are many more guns on our street. And if you see at the bottom of that slide, specifically in California, there were 110,000 firearms purchased in our state.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Firearm related arrests are up 58% in 2021 compared to the same timeframe in 2020. Similarly, prohibited firearm possessor arrests are up 55%, and our officers have recovered 50% more firearms. 40 of those firearms were ghost guns. An important fact that this light does not capture is that the total number of arrests made by our officers in 2021'",
        "'speaker_7': 'is down 20% compared to the same time last year. Now, let me repeat that our arrest in 2020 were down over 20%. The fact that our total arrests are down 20% and our firearm related arrests are up 58%, indicate that our officers are more focused on violent crime than lower level offenses.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Related to that fact is that we are seeing a shift in recidivists data. In the past, most of our recidivists arrests were for relatively minor nonviolent offenses. Today, we are seeing an increase in recidivist arrest for violent offenses.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We would welcome the I-Team to examine current data, as they have done in the past, to identify more opportunities for prevention and intervention. This slide here indicates one example of many subjects that our police officers encounter on the street.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Here you will see an arrest timeline for a prohibitive possessor who has repeatedly been arrested over the past five years. All but one arrest was for illegally possessing a firearm. I would also like to point out the discrepancy between the person's sentence and actual time spent incarcerated.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It appears that this person hasn't been held to the full term of any sentence. This is just one example of an individual who has been repeatedly arrested for illegally possessing a firearm. Year to date, our officers have arrested 32 repeat firearm offenders.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Now we're going to get to our strategies. Our department is committed to reducing violent crime by implementing a data driven plan. Our plan provides short term strategies to address immediate crime concerns, as well as long term strategies to ensure sustainable reductions.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Our plan focuses on key individuals and neighborhoods that are negatively impacted by violent crime. To ensure continuous progress. Our plan also includes key performance metrics and accountability measures to gauge our progress, which I will share with you in a moment.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'As part of this plan, we have several strategies we are currently using to deter violent crime. You see them here? I would like to highlight two pilot programs that have been effective in reducing crime, in particular gun crimes.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Our Coordinated Response team and our Neighborhood Walks program. Our community. Ah. I'm sorry. Our coordinated response team. In February of this year, we reassigned employees away from their primary assignments to create a temporary, coordinated response team comprised of detectives, patrol officers, a divisional crime analyst and a public information officer.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This team meets daily to discuss strategies for impacting violent crime with the focus on gun violence, prohibitive possessors, ghost guns and and attempting to identify the contributing factors to violent crime. In addition, they work closely with our federal law enforcement partners, including the FBI, the ATF and the U.S. Marshal's office.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The Coordinated Response Team is also responsible for conducting community engagement and neighborhood awareness related to our public safety efforts. Engaging our community is a critical part of this program, and I do want to emphasize that in the past, when we're having challenges with violent crime, specifically shootings, we introduce a lot of uniformed presence that usually slows down'",
        "'speaker_7': 'or stops the shooting activity. What we're doing differently this time is we're very focused on individuals and places, and ahead of time we're communicating with those neighborhoods so that people know what we're doing there and more importantly, why we're there.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I think that is helpful. Since it sits. Since its inception, this team has made several arrest of violent offenders prohibited from possessing firearms and has confiscated 38 firearms. Here you will see the result of their efforts. Of the total arrest, 22 were prohibitive possessors.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Also, please note that of all these firearm arrest, only one of them required any use of any type of force. And I also want to point out that zero, because I think there's a perception that when our officers encounter people with weapons, that there's automatically an officer involved shooting.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That is absolutely not true. And you see just in this slide, just with this team. 38 arrests. 22 with firearms. Zero officer involved. Shootings at only one use of force. And yes, one is too many. From what I understand from the body worn camera footage, this individual had a gun in his waistband, was trying to pull it'",
        "'speaker_7': 'out. And instead of anybody firing upon him, you had several officers who grabbed on to him and were able to disarm him. This slide shows you the shooting before the coordinated response team was assembled and after, which equates to a 36% decrease in citywide shooting incidents.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Our police officers are absolutely making a difference. When you put more on the street, it will prevent shootings from occurring. I'm really excited to also talk about another pilot program that we've been running. A very innovative approach that we are taking to reduce violence in our community.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Is the Neighborhood Walk's Pilot Program. We are currently focusing resources in the Washington Middle School neighborhood in response to shootings in that area. Historically, this has been one of the most violent reporting districts in our city. The Neighborhood Walks pilot program, which we hope to deploy in other parts of the city in the future, is supported through'",
        "'speaker_7': 'you, the council's approved Neighborhood Safe Streets funding. It allows officers assigned to specific geographical beats to walk and to interact with community members, giving them a chance to really get to know the people who are living and working in the area while additional officers answer calls for service.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Officers have spent 186 hours walking in the neighborhood and have made over 300 recorded community contacts since beginning the program on February 27th of this year. I'm happy to report that since the program's implementation, there has been a 40% decrease in reported shooting incidents in that area.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This program has proven to be a true prevention and intervention tool. The next slide, I'll leave up there for just a second, or at least a minute, I should say. Here you will see some testimonials from members of our community about this program.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'As you can see, our community is grateful for our efforts. Engaging our community in a non-enforcement environment has proven to be very, very positive. And as I said earlier, it's really something special when you're able to get police officers out of the cars and in on foot, actually engaging with neighborhood residents.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And it really shows that having officers out there in that manner really is making a huge difference, specifically in crime in that neighborhood. Our department is working with our community and other city partners to provide a safe city for all people and reduce violence in our neighborhoods through crime trend analysis, proactive community policing and community engagement.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Our city team is committed to preventing violence before it starts. To be successful, we must have a three pronged approach of prevention intervention. And enforcement. We strive to build positive partnerships within our community. This is embodied in our department's mission of public safety through partnerships.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In seeking to address crime alongside our city family. We continue to work with numerous community organizations like the Guidance Center, the Los Angeles County Human Relations Commission, the Long Beach Interfaith Council, our police policy community advisory group, and numerous neighborhood and business groups throughout Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And to summarize, our department is modifying management practices while analyzing available data in a manner that helps identify the root causes of crime in our impacted neighborhoods. With the focus on providing fair, just and equitable public safety in Long Beach, we are confident that the partnerships we are strengthening and the changes we have made and are continuing'",
        "'speaker_7': 'to make will help us achieve our vision of a safe city for all people. And with that, I'll turn it over to my partner, the health director, Kelly Colby.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Chief. Good evening, honorable mayor and council members. Thank you for this opportunity to share the public health approach to violence prevention in the city of Long Beach. I'd like to acknowledge Anna Lopez, our community impact officer who is leading the health efforts.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'll discuss today. I'd also like to acknowledge Deputy Chief Deputy City Manager Theresa Chandler for ongoing support of these efforts, as well as the partnership of the Police Department, Parks, Recreation and Marine Workforce Development Libraries, and the many community based organizations and community members as we move forward in our work together to ensure a safer future for'",
        "'speaker_8': 'the city of Long Beach. And preventions have been underway for over 30 years in our city. The slide shows some of the many efforts. You'll notice that almost all focus on grant funding. The city has done some great work in violence and gang prevention.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yet each effort is an unfunded mandate or grant funded, and when the funding ends, the program ended. It's so very difficult to build a movement for safety who starts and stops based on funding. The most recent plan that we've been working off of the current work underway stems from the safe Long Beach violence prevention plan approved by'",
        "'speaker_8': 'City Council in 2014. With various grant funding, this plan hosted trainings and trauma informed approaches. Bullying, prevention and implicit bias training for the police department. It's supported six community policing sessions and funded the all in campaign to address chronic truancy.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'In 2017, the safe Long Beach Plan was moved to the Health Department, where it's been focused on a place based effort and community building to support safety in their communities. It was recently awarded $1.1 million to address gun violence.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We in public health talk a lot about upstream prevention. And this this graphic captures the approach. We often spend our time and resources working to intervene when people are already struggling in the downstream. It's the life vest, right?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The safety vest. This is costly. It doesn't address the underlying reasons they exist. So it keeps on happening and it keeps on growing. Very difficult to change. The bridge that is toward the top represents upstream prevention. This bridge keeps people from falling into difficult situations.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'They're in some cases of the city. These bridges are weak and broken. So it doesn't surprise you that people are falling through into the river. Those that live near or travel across the strong bridges are protected, while those who live and cross their bridges often fall in.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Of course, all bridges need reinforcement, but it's easy to see which need the most urgent attention. And our role in public health and as the city, is to address disparities, inequities by identifying and repairing the bridges that have lacked resources and maintenance, promote safe passage across for all the social and physical environments where we live, work, learn'",
        "'speaker_8': ', play and age are our bridges to opportunity. Our goal by going upstream is to build the strong bridges needed for success across the city. This graphic, while busy, highlights the key focus areas that we talk about. When we talk about upstream, we focus on building the individual and community strengths needed to support success.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'These include healthy birth outcomes, strong families, safe housing, financial stability, education and health and communities. We focus on building community power toward collective vision for the community. As we move toward adulthood, we focus on building social capital for youth, workforce development, health and safe places to be together.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And then often we move past prevention to intervention, where we focus on efforts to halt what's going on, the pulling of people out of the water at they start to fall. These include things like violence, interruption, opportunity, youth programing, use diversion and some of the police interventions.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'When we look at this next chart, you the actual programs that we operate in health department and across other departments. So currently programs such as Black Infant Health, the Women, Infants and Children's Program, the Nurse, Family Partnership, Family Planning, All Children Thrive, early childhood Strengthening Families Fatherhood, our housing authority, healthy, active, Long Beach and medical outreach.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Those are all considered upstream preventions because we're working to build strong individuals and families. We also look at the the work, the Long Beach Collaborative, which is a focus that you'll be hearing about tonight around really building community strength.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We include the Office of Youth Development in both upstream and downstream, because really, youth development is a life lifelong experience. My Brother's Keeper is included in here, as well as Neighborhood Services that operates and development services. And then our downstream again is the Office of Youth Development.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You see internships, mentorships raised to be healthy places to gather. Our trauma and resiliency work and also the Long Beach Police Department Walks program, Community Walks program is a downstream prevention. When we look at our intervention, we look at our new our gun violence prevention program, our reentry services, My Sister's Keeper and the Neighborhood Safe Streets initiatives'",
        "'speaker_8': '. Across all of that, our mental health supports and substance use treatment that are so important, as well as investments and policies to support the work that we are doing.

Between the mid 1980s and 1990s, this problem became particularly acute as we face the implications of the policies such as war, drugs, the institutionalization of mental health services, changes in prison, prison sentencing guidelines, economic stagnation and social pressures of poverty and systemic racism that adversely affected black people and communities of color.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It must be considered as part of an upstream approach to our policy and resourcing design. So I start discussing the different programs that we're currently operating in the Health Department. The first upstream prevention is our Long Beach Collaborative.'",

Next intervention is our reentry program, which is home to system impacted persons seeking to integrate into their local community and families upon release.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Many formerly incarcerated persons face multiple life challenges as they strive to reintegrate into their communities and families. The newest this is the newest work of the of the Division Community Impact Division's efforts.

This pilot will be supported by cross dependent by a cross-departmental effort with funds allocated from a Long Beach recovery effort. In the last program we share is a human trafficking program. The city has been engaged in human trafficking survivor supports for many years through various grant opportunities.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'As close as my presentation, I'm available to respond to questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you for that. We have to Mark, I think those were the two the two major reports, correct? Do you have anything else to add before I turn to council?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'No, just. I think you'll see. We take this very seriously. I think there's been a lot of great work. There's obviously more we can do. And you know this we take it incredibly seriously when there's violence in our community.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we're prepared to answer questions and really be able to also answer some of the short term things that we're working on right now, but also some of the longer term efforts to try to break the cycle. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Do you think you have a have folks are cued up, Vice Mayor Richardson. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Just a few points. First, Chief, thank you so much for the presentation. Last time we had a presentation, I asked you for data.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You definitely showed up with the data tonight, and that's what I love most about the presentation. Next, I'm incredibly proud to see the partnership with the Health Department demonstrating the comprehensive approach. That's important. Violence is a public health issue.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We've proclaimed that as a city, and I believe it requires a holistic approach. I appreciate it, particularly the upstream downstream graphic and the bridge and the acknowledgment that some of those bridges have cracks in it. And unless we work on those cracks to keep people from falling into the stream in the first place, we'll continue doing downstream'",
        "'speaker_0': 'suppression. And that's not where we want to be. We want to be upstream, investing in opportunity, invest in people. I want to thank the chief for including the map and making the connection to the other determinants, the social determinants that also overlap with the areas that have violent crime.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We've talked about this and these are the same areas that are overlaid with high incidences of COVID 19 is the same areas that have unemployment, elevated unemployment due to COVID 19, the same areas that have air quality issues, lack open space, public investment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There is a direct correlation. These are social determinants of health, and we're also seeing a number of our departments and strategy looking at this place based response from the recovery plan, looking at the collective impact model, the proposed economic empowerment zone, emphasizing that there is a direct economic issue within the same areas that have this violence.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so the more that we focus on these place based issues, I think the better. I want to thank the chief for calling out specifically the point that the resettlement received of recidivism. Arrests are arrests with guns. And that's important to note.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So so I know we've heard I know Councilman Austin's talked about the prohibited possessor, but this is the first time that we've seen a presentation that makes the connection. How significant of an issue this is. And I think that's that that's particularly a game changer.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think we need to continue on that message points. I want to thank you also for bringing up and acknowledging the impact, the benefits of the coordinated response team. That's what I'm going to be looking for investment in.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'When we get to budget conversations. It's you're showing that is proven that's what I want to see a 40% reduction in and since the neighborhood walks program that's huge. We want to see how we are leveraging recovery funds to develop some of the same pilots in Washington in some of the other areas impacted by shooting.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So that's that's incredibly important. So I want to I'm glad to see that the Washington neighborhood was able to pilot these things and is poised to go into north orbit. And one thing I would also state is I would I would love to see more information.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I saw community intervention workers referenced as a part of I think it was the the the grant that we got from the one the $1 million grant focused on Washington neighborhood. That was the only place where I actually saw reference to community innovation and maybe intervention.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Worker So I'm going to ask Kelly or whoever can speak to this, what's the plan for community intervention workers beyond that $1 million grant? Because when we came to council, we talked about identifying through recovery funds or whatever else is available, the opportunity to expand some of those strategies into north and other areas that have had shooting'",
        "'speaker_0': '. So I'm curious more specifically to know, is that the plan for how we're are we going to utilize some of those recovery dollars from for violence prevention or some of those same strategies?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yeah. Uh, Vice Mayor, the through the Long Beach Recovery Act, we did identify additional resources, a half million dollars to be able to expand the interventionist opportunity beyond the Washington neighborhood. So we'll begin that pilot there and then work to expand it as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, I would just say, with the funds that we've already identified, I want to see more. I want to see the next level of planning here on what specifically you're going to be able to commit to with the resources that we have available now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And communities, I think, deserve to know that. So in the next iteration or the report that comes back, we'd like to know which strategies I'm interested in, particularly in the neighborhood watch, community intervention workers, the things that the chief is standing up and saying, that's working.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I want to make sure that that's being deployed. So all the issues that are impacted by shootings. And so I would love to see more specific more specific details there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Oh.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes, Vice Mayor. So that is the next effort of the work. So what you've helped identify as in the recovery plan are the broad buckets. The policy direction for the dollars that would go toward certain efforts. What we're waiting for is in May, we expect to have the protocols from the federal government about exactly confirming how we'",
        "'speaker_4': 'can spend those funds. Then we start building all those individual budgets and creating basically the grant that would do those things. And then we will provide information on what are the next level strategies, how are we going to implement that?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'How would the 500,000 specifically be recommended to be spent and give all of that to the council? And then we start the program. So it's very similar to how we did the CARES act.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Fantastic. Thank you. Thank you, Rosemary Richardson. Next up is Camp Clemens and Haas.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mayor. Actually, I was wondering if if we could hear public comment, if there's any. Before.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think there's one. The. Yes. Substance addiction. Yes, go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We do have one person on the line for public comment for this item.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'd love to hear them. Please.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'City Council. Thanks for the presentations very in-depth. I came to this presentation wanting to see a bit more data as they become aware to me in being a victim of a violent crime. Actually, two in the year 2014, I have learned through that experience and what I did not see this evening in terms of data concerning not'",
        "'speaker_6': 'just gun violence. And I appreciated both the progress and where we are compared to 1991. I was concerned with the lack of data on and I'll give a content warning. Our sexual assault crimes, having dealt with Sergeant Correll and various detective over the years, have become aware of quite a few issues that I really would like to'",
        "'speaker_6': 'see discussed and opened up. As you know, I supported the Black Health Program and hoping to see that program expand to include prevention of these crimes as well, and trauma informed healing and the way in which we deal with these victims who also, you know, directly communicate with our district attorney's office and currently victims of violent crimes'",
        "'speaker_6': '. It's just what's missing from that report that haunts me, concerned about it not being included in future discussions. That said, I know that there's so much work that the site team does too. So I'd like to see and know more about where we're headed with that in the future.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'd like to see when victims of crimes come to the city and attend meetings, that we are also not depressing their knowledge of their experience and seeking high level critique the highest level of experience as being a victim of a violent crime.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We do have things to share and we do hope that these things get better within the city for everyone's daughters, your cousins, your aunt, your grandmother's, all of the women that we see and love in our community, they need to be supported in this way as well.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I am hoping to hear discussion in the future as well on our facility at the community hospital. I can speak on that experience and there's not enough time. So again, really hoping we begin to have these conversations and include this data from a very significant portion of victims who experience this in the city.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. Good evening.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. That concludes public comment for this item.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you very much, Mr. Clare. First of all, I just wanted to say thank you so much to Chief Newnham and and Director Collopy for this presentation. I know that it is very important to me and my district to hear this because as you know, as one of the districts that has been affected by the most violent'",
        "'speaker_3': 'crimes and I know that this has been a discussion that has been going on among us and our city departments. But I think it's also important to take the opportunity like this and use our platforms to really speak directly to the concerns of our that our residents are making and making sure that we fully update not only'",
        "'speaker_3': 'not only ourselves and educate ourselves as council members, but update and educate our our residents on what's going on. I know the intent of this study session, for me at least, was to be able to see what the city has been doing, is doing and what the city plans to do in order to reduce violent crimes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I know that you know that that is what this presentation is doing. Of course, public safety is always and will always be our top priority as a city. And it's unacceptable to me that many of my residents have lived in fear because of the staggering increase in violence in in the district itself.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'At least that's how we feel here in the district. I really appreciate the the presentation that was given by Chief Luna, which indicates that violent crimes have actually gone down. So I appreciate that. But I know that my residents and in my district we ask as the data shows, you know, there have been a lot of violent'",
        "'speaker_3': 'crimes occurring. We as a city have have responded to a number of outlying, you know, in number in a number of ways that were outlined in today's presentation from Director Colby. And I really, really appreciate that. I think we need to continue to do that as we move forward.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm thankful that that we are looking at that at this through through an equity lens. And I think that it is very important to continue looking at this as an equity issue and as, again, going back to what the data will show, showing that, you know, the violent crimes that are happening have other issues, why they are'",
        "'speaker_3': 'also happening. And even though we are in times of COVID, I do also believe that violent crimes have been happening in these areas for a very long time. And and, yes, COVID most certainly, you know, we have seen an increase.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But one of the things that does worry me is that, you know, summer is coming. And as we all know, sometimes that is a time when violent crimes also increase. So one of the things that worries me is to see some of the programs that are doing so good, like the V programs that are walking alongside with'",
        "'speaker_3': 'our neighborhood residents and which. I have gone in so many, so many great feedback comments from my residents saying how important it is to have our police officers out there outside of their car and actually talking to them and talking to their children and how how important that is and how they want to see that continue.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I hope that we can find ways and and most importantly, find funds to be able to continue in those efforts. And one of the things that I would also like to share is that we need to continue providing ways to prevent violent crimes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And the other day, I had an amazing meeting with one of my residents, David McGill, and his organization, books and buckets there. And what they do is they're working to provide free basketball academy mentorship and education to help children in our Washington neighborhood and find a way out of what could be a path to to choosing violent'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Your 5 minutes is up.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Then I just want to finish my sentence. I just want to say that funding organizations like this that will help children mentor them and help them get into college, I think is very important. I know college made a difference for me and my life, and I know that it's made a whole lot of difference for others'",

        "'speaker_2': 'We all know that, that once we get to know our police officers out in the field, that the stress level goes down within the community. And that's very important.

        "'speaker_2': 'Community.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'A LGBTQ.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Advisory committee. Those committees are still in existence or are they pretty much on hold or have morphed into something else that you're so curious as to what the the status of those committees are at this point?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Councilmember Muranga. So because you've been around for a while, you do remember during the recession we had a community relations division. And during the recession that got cut out of the budget. At that time, they were managing 14 different advisory groups.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Some of them you named. And they were extremely helpful and productive, doing a lot of work with us. To this day, we still maintain a couple of them here and there, but it's a capacity issue for us. That's not to say that we believe they're any least important.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Though recently we did develop a policy review advisory group that has a very diverse group of community members that involves clergy, academics, advocates, business leaders, and even an attorney from the ACLU. They're currently looking at our use of force policy.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We believe, as it was written, it was part of a lot of the re-imagining of specifically in the use of force category. But now we have this group looking at it that's providing very valuable input to us. That's just one example.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We're running that out of our Office of Constitutional Policing, but we always look for opportunities in the future if we can figure out from a capacity perspective. But even some of these programs we're running right now, they're all pilots, and I'm stealing from other places to make these units work until we can reduce some of these shootings'",
        "'speaker_7': 'out there. But thank you for that question.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Pryce.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I appreciate the presentation from both departments and the comments from my colleagues. I do have a couple of issues. We're talking about violent crime. I'm curious, what are the resources that we're allocating to support victims?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Because I imagine the victims of these crimes are also Long Beach residents. They've experienced tremendous trauma and understanding that they do have some rights under Marsy's law and that either the district attorney's office or the city prosecutor's office is providing some minimal support.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Are we doing anything to help those victims with trauma informed recovery and programing counseling, anything like that?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Good evening. Council Member Price Thank you for that question. Our department does amazing work when it comes to working with our victims of crime, specifically as it deals with child abuse, domestic violence. And sexual assault. One place that we fall a little short on is dealing with trauma, with shooting victims.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That hasn't stopped us from looking at other opportunities to engage our victims. You stated one of the resources, and that is through the district attorney's office. We also work with the city prosecutor's office in town. But if you remember, about a year ago, we actually enacted a contract with a tip trauma intervention program.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Unfortunately, because of COVID, that kind of put a stop to that. But we're reengaging as the COVID situation, or at least as my health director says, things are getting better. We're on the path to recovery. And hopefully we can get back on this program to to assist the victims.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'At the end of the day, we were victim centered. It is all about victims. And you're right on that is that should be our absolute number one priority. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Chief. And I'm I know I'm going to run out of time here, so I may have to queue up, but I do want to hear your I want to hear your answers, not just myself talking so good.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Moving to the health department, do we have any sort of programs that are designed to help victims equity focused programs? Because I imagine that a lot of the victims are also residents who are in in the target area that the chief utilized in his presentation.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So we are engaging in the trauma informed and resiliency work and then working with our communities to build overall trauma and resiliency. We do not currently have a specific victim focused program. We have had some discussions about what those opportunities could be, and we would look forward to partnering with the police department as part of the TIP'",
        "'speaker_8': 'program to understand what additional needs there would be and what services we could look at supporting.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, that's fantastic to hear, and I would be very, very interested in how the health department and the police department can work together to assist these victims of crimes, because in many cases, we just have, you know, innocent people who are being while every crime victim is innocent, but really their lives are forever changed as a result'",
        "'speaker_3': 'of the crimes that they're that are committed against them. You know, I know and I know Ms.. Collopy knows this. I'm not sure if the chief knows this, but I'm very involved in my my regular profession on some of our restorative justice measures in terms of intervening early with mental health people, with mental health issues and people'",
        "'speaker_3': 'with substance use program issues. And so my question would be, in terms of our early intervention strategies, do we work with the county at all or are we completely on our own in terms of what we're doing with our early intervention strategies?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In regards to some of the issues that you've mentioned, because I've also noticed that with mental health, a lot of programing and things closed down as a result of COVID. So we did see more an increase in a lot of quality of life crimes, of poverty type offenses as a result of people not getting the treatment, the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'programs that they needed. So how are we working with the county to address those people early with an early intervention program?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So at this time we are not currently coordinating with the county mental health programs. We do coordinate and partner with the Office of Violence Prevention. We are continuing to work through different options. So there was the opportunity through the Long Beach Justice Lab raid that where we had, um, we had a mental health provider who was located'",
        "'speaker_8': 'in the jail that was able to assess people while in the jail and then connect them to services as they were, as they were leaving. We continue to look at different opportunities to fund that capacity. We're also implementing, um, two or three new mental health providers located within our homeless services division to be able to really engage'",
        "'speaker_8': 'and look at different opportunities for, um, violence prevention in those spaces as well. Just the more that we can support healthy lifestyle, the less likely that will be that they would engage otherwise.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah. Councilwoman.'",
        "'speaker_4': '5 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. My one quick question. Do we still have a clinician in the jail?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We're not currently have a clinician until that program has ended.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilwoman Sara.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mayor. And I want to thank Chief Luna and Director Collopy for the presentation. I really appreciate the, you know, the collaborative. As far as the intersection of how we talk about crime and violence and how they're connected to the social and economic disparities and conditions, you know, somebody who's done violence prevention work, it's really significant'",
        "'speaker_3': 'for me to see this step in this direction. And I also appreciate the data that's presented by Chief Luna. It's really important to see, even within the short term amount of time, that the pilot program around the Neighborhood Walk program that started that, we're able to get these data that helps just demonstrate to us not just for'",
        "'speaker_3': ', you know, how it's been going. And I look forward to asking more questions as this will be an agenda item for our public safety committee and to talk about other community policing practices as well. You know, and I also want to make sure to address that I think that this is a right the right the right step'",
        "'speaker_3': ', the step in the right direction around how we're doing approaching violence and crime in a comprehensive way. I think that with the discussion around how social and economic factors play a role in how we do do violence and crime prevention, particularly in areas of high crime, as demonstrated with such as the Washington neighborhood and how they're really'",
        "'speaker_3': 'places that are positioned for these, you know, hopefully economic empowerment zone where we really think about not just social programs but also economic programs as well, that can help ensure that we're providing a really holistic approach to developing and supporting individuals and their families to break the cycle of poverty and transition into a place and gain ability'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and security. And my question is for Ms.. Director Collopy is a lot of people always say, especially in the funding world, you know, prevention and intervention programs, they just take a really long time. It's a long term approach.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But really I think that there are short term metrics and evaluation that is done to demonstrate that it does work. I'm wondering if you could share a little bit about what those metrics are within the program you share on short term, mid-term and long term to demonstrate that they do work and they're not necessarily long term strategies'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that they do have short term outcomes.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Woman. I'm going to, um, I'm going to have you have on a Lopez who is leading those efforts speak to the evaluation conversations.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilwoman, for that great question. One of the things that we're doing as part of the violence prevention effort is really to focus in on the collective impact approach. And part of that is not only designing specific goals that we're going to track, but agreed to as a collective body.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'What are those data metrics now in the short term, the things that we could look at in terms of social cohesion, cohesiveness, engagement, immediate results, looking at people accessing services, I think in the long run we're really looking at that change over time and economic stability, family reunification, reduction in violence.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we are looking at what that metrics will look like. We are trying to also coordinate this with the data equity working team that the city has in place under the racial reconciliation framework. Great. I love I love to hear more about it and see more.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Are these metrics as somebody with a research background, this is stuff that I actually love to read at night about and think about. I know as big as that sound, I think about prevention, intervention all the time and how do we measure it and how do we demonstrate that it does work?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Because it does. And I believe that we can demonstrate. So thank you so much. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I want to I want to get clarification on a question that Councilman Price asked, because I was surprised at the answer, and I'm not sure that that the answer was correct or maybe needs clarification. Mr. MODICA Can you clarify the clinician question?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Because I know there were some changes around code, but that program is still a part of the city and will continue. Isn't that right or am I wrong?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes. And I'd like to have the chief talk a little bit about the operational model. We did have some changes due to COVID.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Mr. Mayor, members of the city council. If I understood the question. Right. If we're talking about mental health one, if we're talking about our mental evaluation teams, they're still out there working with the L.A. County clinicians. If we're talking about our contract with the guidance center, where we have a clinician in our jail that did stop temporarily'",
        "'speaker_7': 'during COVID, obviously, jail operations were heavily impacted during that time. But the contracts back on and that individual is back with us and integrating to everything that we're doing. I hope that does answer the question.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But no, I think that actually answers the question. And I just want to just re-emphasize just as the when I heard Councilman Price ask that question, I just was really that's a really important program. It's one that I've been really I've followed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And, you know, I know a lot of us were involved in getting that program started there at the jail, and I'm really grateful it's still there. And let's just work to make sure that that program continues. I think it's really it's really, really critical.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So thank you. And thank you to Councilman Price for for asking about it. Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. And I really appreciate this discussion here tonight. I mean, obviously, it's very, very important, the number of slides I have notes on here, and I'll try to do my best to stay within the 5 minutes. But Chief Luna outlined a historical violent crime stat illustrated.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'What I think many of us, particularly those of us who were around in the eighties and early nineties actually already know, is that we have a much safer city than we were 30 years ago today. Obviously, we we want to be safer and we want to reduce any violent crime in our city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think as a council member, Sorrell said, I think we are headed in the right direction with this approach, particularly a collaborative approach. I'd love to see collaborations with our departments, you know, breaking down the silos and and structural barriers.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This is this is this is really encouraging. The the data is very, very important. And, you know, one of these issues that I have been, you know, kind of harping on and focusing on for for several years now is the prohibited possessors and getting guns out of the hands of, you know, those who are higher risk to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'committing crimes with those guns. Right. Those individuals we know. And and it's clearly clear that the focus there is yielding high percentage results for us. Right. And so we as a council need to continue to to try to find and focus on efforts like this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In my opinion, she going to mention gun sales being up 64% nationally. Right. And that doesn't surprise me. I mean, over the last year, you know, people a year ago probably felt like, you know, that the world was about to end or, you know, they felt less secure.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we saw people lined up, you know, buying ammunition and guns, you know, everywhere. But what it doesn't account for is the illegal guns trade and the and the ghost guns that are out there in the market, the market that we don't even know about, you know, we can't quantify.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So this is this is a pretty, pretty interesting piece of data. And for me, what I heard here was a lot of good information. But I think there's a there's a there's a tie or correlation there that we can't ignore.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm not sure I would love to get more data on this because I want to know what the causes of the violence really are, right? Where to root and what's causing the violence. Is it is it economics? Is it the illicit market?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know, it's a neighborhood beat geographics. I think these are things that we need to also explore. Go back to slide number nine in the chief's report where he actually gave us an example of a five time repeated prohibited firearm offender.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Right. And that the consistency was that this individual had been, you know, arrested five times with on gun crimes. Right. But if you look at the arrest, most of those arrests were also related to drugs. Right. In substance for sales.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Right. And so I think there there's a correlation there that we can't ignore. And when we related to our public health approach to violent violence prevention, I think one piece of that plan that I'd like to see us focus a little bit more on is how we deal with that challenge of drug abuse in our city, how'",
        "'speaker_2': 'we how we as a city, and what can we do to strategically look at, you know, cleaning people up and discouraging such use? I think that that really is a is a root common denominator with so much of our violent crime.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We really can't ignore that. And so, you know, and I'm not talking about going back to the old practices of, you know, the war on drugs that, you know, don't work. I'm talking about, you know, innovative strategic approaches and obviously recognize that this is a human experience and part of it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I had several other comments, but my colleagues, I think, really addressed many of them. Like I said, I really appreciate the discussion here on this very, very important item. I think we are headed in the right direction and we need to continue, you know, utilizing data, but also testing and, you know, our our public health approach to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'violence prevention. And so those are my comments. I appreciate the presentation this evening.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman. Then there's.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mayor, and thank you, everyone, for all those wonderful comments, too, and suggestions and thoughtfulness. I think that it's very important that we unite together. One of the things that that my residents keep asking is, you know, how early release has affected our violent crime status.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And maybe, Chief, you can answer that. I know that in my check ins, some of my residents have asked if we can find out how many of those early release persons do we have in our district. Is that something that we can that we can share, that we have knowledge of also, you know, because there's been so'",
        "'speaker_3': 'many regulations that have changed during COVID. Early, early releases being one of them. I know that that's one of the concerns that my residents have, is to see if that has has influenced the high crime or the shootings that have happened in my district.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'A.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes, ma'am. Councilwoman Cindy has in regards to early release. I want to preface this with saying that we as a police department, for me as your chief, I don't believe in in putting people in prison for minor offenses.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think we've been there, done that. I think the proof is there that that doesn't always work. So when we transition over to early releases, if people are being released early on, good behavior and then there's a way for them to come out and transition, that's great.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'What we're focused on and a lot of the statistics that I talked about were individuals who are getting out immediately, finding a way to possess a firearm and victimizing members of our community. Those are the ones that we're definitely focused on.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And from an early release perspective, we know there's more early releases as a result of COVID. We've been trying to pin down numbers. We could work to try and get more specific numbers about where people are going once they're released.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It is extremely difficult to track. A lot of the systems in the county and in the state are very antiquated and a lot of people, when they're released from prison and or jail, will usually give you an address that they never go to.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'A lot of them will say they're transient and a lot of them, unfortunately, are within our homeless population. So there is a challenge. There doesn't mean that we can't roll up our sleeves, but it it would be a hand search and it would be challenging.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But it's a very good question and a significant concern that we have at the police department. Thank you for the question.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Chief, for answering that. I also wanted to say that I totally do appreciate the reentry program that our health department has. I think that that's very important for those that, you know, are getting released early because of good behavior or those that have gone to jail.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'When they were 16, 17, and are now, you know, ten years later. And they they did you know, they changed their ways and they need help in in, you know, reshaping their lives. I think that that's very important that we have those kind of programs in place.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I appreciate that. And thank you chiefly for answering that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Marco.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. My questions were a lot along the lines of Councilman's and De Haas. I was listening to a report related to a lot of the violent crime and its correlation with. The gang population. And even though that gang might not be prevalent in a particular city, they may have correlated with or what you have.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And while they were in jail and I was hoping to get Chief Luna's perspective on what programs or what solution we could put in place if, in fact, one, if, in fact, he believed that to be partially true or completely true.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And what could we do? I know we talk a lot about job programs and a lot of. Programs that are longer term. And we talk about upstream and downstream. What about like. Today is the day you're getting released.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'What can we provide you in terms of resources to put you on that bridge?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Councilmember Mongo from. I think that may be a better question for Director Colby in regards to reentry programs because her department specializes in that area. But to answer your your initial question about gangs. When I look at the, the shootings that we have, um, based on our statistics, it looks like about 30 to.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Just under 33% of our shootings appear to be gang related. So that would mean that, what, 67% are not. So that is is all over the board between just car to car shootings, people who get angry for whatever reason.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And there's there's a lot of different disputes and things of that nature. And I think when you start looking at some of the challenges that we face historically with with violence, it's some of the more simple things are people, individuals that are unable to have a conversation without resorting to violence, an argument in today's environment.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And somebody reaches for a gun. But if if Kelly can help me out with the the reentry.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Poll, I appreciate the statistic, because the statistic I heard from another city was significantly higher percentage. And that so that because that was going to lead me to my next question, which was do you think there would be a direct impact if we instituted the violent crime gang unit?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But it sounds like. 33% is still an important percent.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It absolutely is. I mean, if we can reduce our numbers by 33%, that would be great. But I know that the question comes up about the the gang unit. We still have a gang unit. We don't have a gang filled unit.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But as you know, because you've been the, the, the budget oversight person for us prior to Council member Austin, it's a matter of resources and figuring out where they go. And those are reductions that we had to make in order to make our budget.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So and I've said this in front of this council in community, I'm not going to cry about what I don't have. I'm going to do the best I can with what I've got. And that's what I've shown tonight with this coordinated response team and this neighborhood watch program.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I say I've got to Assistant Chief he Bish. He's kind of the the architect of all that. And he's here to answer any questions from any of you regarding any of those two pilot programs. But got to make do with what you have and try and make a difference with it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, I appreciate what your officers are doing with what they have. And I also know that there's been some great results in some of our programs. I know Councilman Zendejas has connectivity to the Reentry Integration and Employment Services Program in her district, and we may need more programs like that across our city to make sure that we're'",
        "'speaker_3': 'building those bridges everywhere. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Allen.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mayor. I also want to thank Chief Luna and Director Collopy for their presentations. I know when council put this item forward, we saw that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There was an uptick in crime.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we wanted to make sure that that was being addressed and that we were doing everything that we could do to make sure that our city was safer. I know that that crime has gone up, you know, over the last year and that many of our residents did not feel safe and they don't feel safe walking around'",
        "'speaker_3': ', taking their kids to school.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And just being in the neighborhood. And I've heard.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'From a lot of them, and I know that we weren't alone as a city, that we're experiencing the uptick in crime. But the numbers look good. It looks like that is decreasing. And I just want to thank your officers and I want to thank the command staff for all the hard work that I know that you guys'",
        "'speaker_3': 'are doing and women out there every single day. I also know it to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Be true that it's important.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To prevent crime before it even starts. And getting all those guns off the streets were important. So I was happy to see that great work. I'm also the the CRT team was very effective. A 36% decrease in citywide shootings is significant.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I was I was happy to see that. And also, I want to say, you know.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'As a as a former.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Police officer, I understand the importance of our community relations division. I know how important that was to our community. And it was a great tool for preventing crime. And and I know that resources were tough. I also, you know, previously worked the game unit.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I, I know that we did a lot of good work out there, too.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'During the days and in preventing crime.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And unfortunately, I know that budgetary, budgetary reasons, those those those programs have been cut. But I definitely one of the things I love about having the boots on the ground and getting out in the community, and I know your officers loved doing that, too.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So devoting those resources to community policing, I think is going to be instrumental not only just in preventing crime, but also just having a good relationship between our police department and our community. And one of the things that I just want to make sure that I understand is that future funding for things like community policing or your'",
        "'speaker_3': 'of the CRT teams. And and I also want to understand what strategies and how these this funding will be allocated. So I know that we will hear back from you in from city management. So I look forward to understanding more of that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But again, thank you for the presentation. And I just really also deeply appreciate all of my colleagues comments on these issues, too. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Let me go back up to Canterbury Ringa. Then then back to Vice Mayor Richardson and then we'll circle again to Councilman Diaz. And I haven't said anything yet and then I'll go after councilman's in the house.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mayor Actually, may I put that up? But too, I didn't hear a motion to support the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Motion to grant the report. Richardson. Thank you. Just a couple of things. There was a question earlier about engagement with the county. We made a motion a while back to go explore Measure J. I spoke with some folks at the county about Measure J, and I know we're not quite there yet, but the intent of Measure J'",
        "'speaker_0': 'was a budget allocation of noncommittal 25% of uncommitted funds in the county would be redirected into opportunities, violence prevention, youth opportunity, all of those things. And they're beginning the process of shaping the uses of the funds now. And so I want to ask a question of Kelly.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Have we gotten to the table and we joined the committees and gotten to the table and begin engaging with the county around Measure J.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes, we do have health department staff who are participating in the conversations at the county level around Measure J. They have a number of different committees and we have folks participating in it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Fantastic and how we have we forecast it when we think M.J. will be available.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Now. We don't have any insight into that yet.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Because that's going to be a big opportunity. While paying for the county's funding as the second largest city in the county, we should be paying attention to measure day because it's going to be an opportunity for us to continue to invest in a lot of the strategies we talked about today.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The other thing I would say is that, you know, across across the nation, the increase in crime has been directly, directly attributed to the pandemic. And there's data that shows that the economic crisis related to the pandemic. And so I'd like to just understand, as we begin the process of reopening and obviously safely reopening, we have to'",
        "'speaker_0': 'be thinking about where how do we activate those high crime spaces as we reopen? When we came up with Be Safe a few years back, it was that same premise. It was based on summer night lights, and it was, how do we activate the parks in these communities to make them safe?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And as we think about where the crime is taking place, we have to connect that to our recovery strategy. It just makes sense. So so I'd love to know what specific strategy moving forward we're doing in the parks, in the business corridors, in the areas that have been hardest hit, particularly over the past year during the pandemic'",
        "'speaker_0': ', as we move forward, as we recover from it. But great feedback from everyone. Thank you council members and house as well for your motion and I'm happy to support this. Thanks. Cats are super not gonna. All right. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Great presentations, great commentary. Thank you for that. I wanted to provide a response on a topic that was brought up during public comment, and that is the START program at Community Hospital. And what people may not realize is that when the former operator left community hospital.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The Sexual Assault Response team left at the same time, and I've said this publicly before, but we actually have three new council members since I said it originally, I believe it's an appropriate topic for April. April is Sexual Assault Awareness Month, but I made a commitment to the former operator of the program at Community Hospital that I'",
        "'speaker_0': 'would do everything in my power to bring that program back. And I've been consistent on this message from day one that that was a vital program and it needs to be brought back. So as our emergency room comes back online, I'll be working harder on that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And from the words that are used tonight, Councilwoman Pryce brought up victims, I think, trauma informed. Well, that's right. In the wheelhouse. So the sexual assault response team. So I'm happy to continue supporting that. And to Chief Luna, thank you very much for the statistics on on gang related gun violence.'",
        "'speaker_0': '67% is not in in the presence of politicians. That's called a supermajority. But I might frame it that if anyone suggests that every single shooting is gang related, that person would be wrong two thirds of the time. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Van de Haas.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And thank you, Councilmember Super now for saying that again. And I think it's very important for for us to know that specific statistic. I personally thought it was reverse. And so I really, really appreciate that statistic.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And it gives me it gives me hope going forward. I think that that's very important. One of the things that I also wanted to ask, Chief, that my my district usually, you know, has been talking about why are we not bringing, you know, the gang unit back?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And and one of the things I keep telling them also is, you know, funding we don't have funding for that. But one of the things that I would like to ask is, if you are your staff can please, you know, describe or define the difference between a gang unit and a gang unit.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'A gang field unit.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes, Councilmember. And there has. So our gang enforcement section, which is comprised of a group of detectives, investigate any and all gang crime. There are some overlaps, for example, with our homicide detail and others. But if it's related to a gang incident, that gang investigative unit will work on that project.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'When we had a gang filled team, they were detectives, but they were assigned to the field to strictly enforce, primarily to gather intelligence and information and then coordinate with other resources within the department. When that went away, the gang enforcement team in the field went away.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We didn't stop doing that work. What happened is each patrol division has a directed enforcement team, and that team is responsible for counsel complaints. For example, a commander goes to a community meeting. It's part of listening to the community.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'What are the challenges? And typically they're the ones handling those challenges for all of your constituents. They work on narcotic complaints. They work on neighborhood problems. There's a whole list of things they do. They're also primarily responsible. Even now, in the last couple of days, as we were preparing for worst case scenario for potential civil unrest.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There are primary unit that does that. They are now part of this coordinated response team. We have pulled them from those areas so they can focus on this. And there's actually a couple of gang detectives who are also assigned to this team to make sure that if there's any gang related incidences, they're in the middle of it'",
        "'speaker_7': ', providing the right information to the right people. So we get the right people off the street who are committing violence around the city. And that's probably the quickest summary I can give you. But we can definitely spend more time in the future talking about that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you for the question.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Chief Luna. And I just wanted to clarify that for the residents. I know some of the residents advocate for gang unit. Some of the residents advocate against a gang unit. I'm not completely convinced that we need a game unit.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think that, you know, we need to focus on prevention and we need to focus on, you know, the crimes that are being out there right now. I'm question for Kelly. Director Colby, I know that we do have one of the things in my district that we do have is we have central chat that also offers reentry'",

        "'speaker_3': 'I know that they might be offered at the Health Department, but I know that the Health Department is kind of like on the opposite side of where my district is. So I was wondering how those programs are are dispersed throughout the city and where they're most needed.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes, Councilman. So the health department actually has sites all around the city. Most of the programs so such as the new reentry program and others. Some of that is funding to community based organizations to provide those funds, you know, to provide those services directly within the community.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'In other cases, you may be located at. You know, we're looking at the different sites for the the Center for Families and Youth in the north Long Beach, though it will be renamed, is is a site where we'll be offering a lot of youth programing and other.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But then we also have the in central Long Beach in the MLK Park. There are also opportunities for additional programing there. So there are multiple sites where we can offer programing or we work very closely with community based organizations located in the community to be able to provide those services.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Director.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. I think that concludes the council questions and comments. I'm just going to make some a few comments and then we'll go to the receiving part of the study session. I want to just broadly say that a couple of things.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think first is I want to bring us back to kind of the moment that we're in. And I think that it's been said it was said a few times tonight. We have to view our work around violence prevention as part of our broader economic recovery, around our recovery in general as a as a community.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm coming out of the pandemic, and I think that's something that's important for us to recognize, is what you're seeing right now across the country is you are seeing some pretty significant challenges around violent crime happening in cities across America.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think the chief will will confirm that almost every city in the U.S., every major urban city, has seen an increase in crime during COVID 19. And it's easy to to to understand why and I'm quoting some of this from our own chief and from what I've read in some other studies as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And you have, of course, oftentimes kids out of school and high unemployment and a loss of jobs creation conditions can be created that make it more difficult to ensure that there is a safe community. And of course, that's not the only reason, but the pandemic has certainly made things much more difficult.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So part of our recovery, when we look at our recovery for our community's health, when we're looking at recovery around jobs in the economy, community safety is also a part of our recovery. It has to be centered around what we're doing, which is a big reason why I believe the council also set aside money from the Recovery'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Act specific to violence prevention. So we have basketball programs coming back. We have part programs like the Be Safe programs in our neighborhoods coming back. We're focused on ensuring that the community has access to strong health programs. So that is all on on its way.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I'm very grateful for that. So, you know, my message to folks I talked to is this is part of our recovery in this conversation, I think is a big part of that. I also think it's important to note that whenever we talk about a crime, whether it's violent crime, which we've seen has gone up, particularly in'",
        "'speaker_0': 'this last year, or whether we talk around, talk around, talk about homicides or violent crime in general, we have to put it within historical context. Just comparing one month to one month or even one year to one year doesn't give us enough data to understand what's hap what the trends are over the course of the last five'",
        "'speaker_0': ', ten, 20 and 50 years. And so our challenge today is real, and every single person affected is kind of for us. I know it's painful and we want to see everyone completely safe. I'm also grateful that the crime rate of the nineties, of the eighties, of the 2000 and all of those years, that that is also in'",
        "'speaker_0': 'our past and that we have less homicides and less violent crime than we've had. And so that's an important part, I think, of this conversation as well, as well as that historical context. And I'll say lastly, which I think is an important piece, is we have to recognize where we're also living right now in the middle of'",
        "'speaker_0': 'a gun epidemic. And what is happening right now with the availability of guns to the general public is disgraceful in our country. And we know that there have been little to no movement in the in the Congress some in our state.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But but but but restrained because of of federal federal measures around what we can do around gun safety legislation. Just simple measures, around background checks and around ensuring that ghost guns are taken off off the streets, have fallen to the wayside in that congressional debate.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so we have to be very cognizant as a body that our police officers are confiscating more and more guns. Every few months off the street. So we're talking more guns today than we did a year ago. And we continue to look more and more guns because there are more guns today in this country.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Then there's also we're many years ago. So we have a challenge around access to guns, and that's a piece of it. That's also, again, not the whole solution, but it's one that I'm really hopeful that this country can can address as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I want to I want to think we talked there was also some discussion and I saw some and I think call up and direct call this presentation around upstream and downstream. I appreciate the programs within the health department that do that work, but we also should be thinking broader.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It is the health department, but about prevention. It's not just the Health Department's job. It's it's as we all know, it's embedded in the work that our library system does. It's embedded in the work our parks system does.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's happening at our schools at Long Beach Unified. It's access to community college education. And so the work around preventative prevention, around violence is not only solely limited, of course, to the work that's going on in the health department.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Under the police department, it's really a community wide effort within organizations and within. But I personally believe that our education institutions have by far the biggest opportunity to make impacts as it relates to community safety. So those are our partners and they're involved in this work with us, and I want to recognize the work that they do'",
