Recommendation to respectfully request the Mayor and City Council to join with cities, states and countries in commemorating the 100th anniversary of a tragic period in a collective in our collective human rights history known as the American Armenian Genocide.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And request city attorney to draft a resolution recognizing the Armenian genocide and its place in history.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I'm going to turn this over now to Vice Mayor Lowenthal.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And I wanted to thank our co-sponsors and really the entire council for taking this up for consideration. I'd like to first move the item and also make some comments. I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There's been a motion and a second by Vice Mayor Lowenthal and Councilwoman Price. Vice Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I want to thank Councilmembers Pryce and and Gonzales for co-sponsoring this item. I'd like to also acknowledge and many of you have seen this individual in our room today, I'd like to acknowledge Governor George Deukmejian for his leadership and advocacy on the issue, certainly going back to at least 1986, officially as an elected official, but probably in'",
        "'speaker_3': 'his heart for much longer than that. We'll have a chance to hear from the governor shortly. Lastly, I'd like to thank all of our city staff and community members in attendance for this issue. Although it's customary for city staff not to speak on council items, I appreciate your being here in support.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The use of the term genocide should never be used lightly, and our bringing this forward is not a suggestion of that. It's actually just the opposite. Its origin actually comes from Raphael Lemkin, who in 1944 used the Greek word Genoese race or tribe and the Latin side for killing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In describing the Nazi policies during the Jewish Holocaust, however, it's said that Mr. Lemkin also drew heavily upon his study of experiences of Armenians during the 19th century and early 20th century of the Ottoman Empire. The Armenian genocide is considered the first genocide of the 20th century and the prototype for future regimes intent on eliminating all traces'",
        "'speaker_3': 'of a particular people or culture. The denial of this atrocity and the willful ignorance of historical facts for the purpose of geopolitical diplomacy does not diminish what most history historians. Countless countries, cities and states know to be absolutely true.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That the Armenians were systematically systemically subjected to deportation, expropriation, abduction, torture, massacre and starvation by the Ottoman Empire. And so tonight, I'm proud to recognize the importance of two thriving communities in our American culture, while acknowledging the willful genocide committed in their ancestral homelands.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And many have espoused on this topic academically, politically, personally. And I think it's one that certainly it serves us well to keep at the top of our conversations, at the top of our minds, so that we're reminded to always reject such tendencies toward human cruelty.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I appreciate greatly when great leaders can take a position and make statements, statements that many people hear across the world and over the Easter holidays. Many of us heard the Pope make a very profound statement that when you don't call something by name, it commits psychological violence and it continues to commit that violence throughout history.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so when you don't call something by name, it's a wound that continues to bleed. And so what I am thankful for is for those of us who have an opportunity to serve in local government, in these very local capacities, that we don't have to be silenced by the fact that leaders beyond us do not exercise the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'courage to call things by name. So I'm often very proud of this council. But tonight I am most proud because of something that we do often, which is call things by name so that we can start the healing process.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And with that, I'd like to invite our president and friends and Turkey to do the same. Thank you, Mr. Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Pryce. Okay. I think I had just a second, but I can go to Councilman Gonzales.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Please. I just wanted to thank Vice Mayor Lowenthal for bringing this forward. It's always very difficult to talk about genocide. I know we're here for Cambodian genocide and recognizing that as well. And it's always very difficult. But I think here in Long Beach, we've certainly made a statement with this and in her leadership in bringing this forward'",
        "'speaker_5': ', I think is very important. And I also want to thank Governor Deukmejian for being here as well. I know he's certainly a a leader in his own right. And we we just appreciate this bringing this all coming to light, especially as multicultural as we are here in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Pryce.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. I, too, want to thank Vice Mayor Lowenthal for bringing this item forward and allowing for us to all stop for a moment and remember the past and where we've come. And the message that she shared was one that I think we all feel very strongly about here on the city council.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And as members of this community together today, we commemorate a great tragedy of history. Between 1915 and 1918, approximately 2 million Americans were eliminated from their homeland through forced deportations and massacres. The surviving refugees spread around the world and eventually settled in some two dozen countries and all continents of the globe.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They are now in our communities as some of the most thriving, successful and hardworking members of our society. I want to take a moment to acknowledge, as the vice mayor has done, Governor Deukmejian, who is here, a resident of my district, and someone who I am very proud to associate with the Armenian community.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In my profession, I have the honor and the privilege to work with many prosecutors who are of Armenian descent and many judges who have been appointed through the past decades who are of Armenian descent. And I'm incredibly proud that the history and the past of this community has made them stronger and such active members and contributing members'",
        "'speaker_5': 'of my world and my, my society. So I want to thank the vice mayor for bringing this forward and commemorate this tragedy together with all of you. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I too, want to echo the sentiments of my colleagues. I think that it's important for us as a country to know where we came from and to know where the rest of the world has come from, to know where we're going.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So thank you all for this important remembrance.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Vice Mayor Lowenthal.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Actually, if I may just speak last.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sure. Councilmember Austin.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes. I just wanted to just just weigh in on this. I don't think there is a euphemism for the word genocide. And so I thank you for bringing this forward. It's been 100 years. And the Armenian people. There are many, particularly personal friends of mine and very feels very strongly about this.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This body does not have to worry about, you know, international natal relations or anything like that. We can do what's right tonight. And so I'll be voting in support of this motion. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. And also before we go, before the vice mayor closes up, I do want to also thank you, vice mayor, for bringing this forward. I wholeheartedly agree that it will be a great day in our country when we're able to verbalize, which certainly was a horrible genocide and a tragedy.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so thank you for bringing this forward. I'm going to go also open this up now for for public comment that you want to speak first. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Vice Mayor, briefly, I wanted to thank Councilmember Councilwoman Gonzalez for mentioning that we do have the Cambodian American community here as well. And what I'm reminded of on Sunday, we celebrated in the Jewish community, celebrated as a strange word.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We recognized Yom Hashoah, which is the recognition of the Jewish Holocaust. And so all of this coming together at the same time, as Councilwoman Gonzalez mentioned, reminds me that it's in the understanding, the commonality of suffering, that we actually rise and elevate ourselves as a human race and and through tragedy, we can do that and through understanding'",
        "'speaker_3': 'one another's commonality of suffering. And so I don't think it's a coincidence that we all come together for this sort of an acknowledgment and understanding. But I'm grateful to live in a city like this where we can have such a strong multicultural presence and and strong understanding of one another's experiences, because it's in that understanding that we'",
        "'speaker_3': 'don't separate ourselves as us and other. There is no other. We are the US and we are the other together. So. And Mr. Mayor, I'd like to recognize that the governor's wife is here as well. Gloria's here. And I apologize for not mentioning that earlier.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We are so thankful that both of you are here together.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'I don't know what's better with me. I. I was living in Los Angeles and. Got to meet various people. Well, thanks a lot. Thank you. Do I have to return this? And. I met this lovely young lady who was at this event that I attended, and she lived in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So. That evening concluded, and I think it was a day or two later. I called her to ask for a date, and she lived here in Long Beach. So. Excuse me. I apologize. So anyway. I came down here to pick her up, to go out on our first day.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I got to know a little bit about Long Beach that day and then subsequent dates. I especially enjoyed visiting the Belmont Shore area of the city. And after a few other dates and going here and there in the community.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I found out that there were no lawyers practicing law in the Belmont Shore area of Long Beach. They were all downtown. So. I thought I'd look into it a little bit more. And I went to the local community newspaper.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And found out a few more facts and I won't track this out. But anyway. That's what led me to Long Beach and. I decided to open an office on the second floor of a bank building. An independent bank building at the time.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'In Second Street in Long Beach. So I did that. And then. Shortly thereafter, we bought a house there, which we still live in. And that's how many years ago? Not only am I getting old, but I don't remember anything.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But anyway, so we got active in the community. And we bought this house. On the East Broadway, and we've been living there ever since. And I became active in the community, and the community was very welcoming. And I began to make a number of friends and get involved in different activities.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so. To try to make a long story short. That's how it all began. And. We're still here. Now, fortunately. Some good things come out of some horrible things. But when the. Ottoman Empire.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Left that part of the world and made their way to the United States. And eventually. My wife's family made their way to Long Beach. And so. And Long Beach was very welcoming to them and has been very welcoming to us.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I'm very thankful and appreciative of that. Time went on and I started getting more involved in the community and. Most of you know the rest of the story of wound up getting involved in politics. No. Some folks probably who don't like that, that I got involved in politics who don't agree with me on things.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Maybe they're not all that. Happy with. The purpose of this item being on your agenda tonight. But throughout the world. In in nations, in states and communities. There are occasions similar to this one where we both acknowledge and appreciate very much the few minutes that you're allocating to this item and.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'I do want to say on behalf of many of the committee leaders, that it was.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'But the entire city management team really relishes your leadership, specifically in all of the commissions that the city has, all the committees, and working with us to get those started. And one of the biggest things that you've done is transition us into register and getting us so much more transparency on the Web for the entire public and'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Well, I want to take this time to share with you all what I really think about my boss. If I was asked about what my boss expected, I found a quote and I thought it was best stated by Doug Larson.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Accomplishing the impossible means only that my boss, Larry, will add it to your regular duties. If asked, who am I bosses? Well, Theodore Roosevelt said it best. People ask the difference between a leader and a boss. The leader leads and the boss drives.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I was fortunate to have both Larry leads and he drives the person that Larry is to all of us in the city clerk office, I think expressed was expressed best by Flavia Wieden. Some people come into our lives and leave footprints on our hearts and we are never, ever the same.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Larry, thank you for always managing a way to inspire me to devote to excuse me, I'm so emotional because Larry has been such a big impact in all of our lives, but he has inspired me to deliver my best.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And for that, I give you full credit. It was it will be difficult to fill the void created by your absence as an employee, a mentee, friend, family to me and my son. Ruel such an impact. You have been to us both.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'So I wanted to come here tonight with a couple of secrets. Things you may not know, may not have made the presentation. First, secret that Larry is a recovering politician. You may not know this. Larry ran for office in Santa Barbara and to the great fortune of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'He did not win that race. And actually, it's a great story because it was that loss that allowed this incredible career here in the city of Long Beach. You may not also know that Larry had a lot of calls in here.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'City clerk, his had quite a reputation in the state of California, people trying to lure him other places. But Larry always said no. He said, you know, my work here is here in Long Beach. And I think we're all lucky that he he said that showed his commitment.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But I also want to come down here, too, to thank you personally, Larry. I want to thank you for being a great mentor, not just to me, to many others, as you've heard. I remember when we worked together on Change the Elections Code to save the city from all those ballots.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I remember that went went to waste that weren't going to be used. You taught me about the philosophy of continuous improvement of always striving to do better. I remember working with you to extend the agenda from 3 to 8 days, which, of course, we enjoy today.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You taught me the value of transparency. How good process.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Could create good policy.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I want to thank you for being a great public servant. Always thinking about how to make our elections easier to participate in, particularly for the disabled and for those who didn't speak English as their native language. You heard that earlier tonight.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But most of all, Larry, I want to thank you for being a true friend. Larry, Long Beach is lucky to have had your service, just as I'm lucky to have known you. I hope you're with your free time you have now.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You'll be making some of your famous tamales. And if you do, you know where to find me. My wife or mine is last year said, why don't you put the all of it? Oh, Larry told me to put all of.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I forgot. So some things I didn't learn from you, Larry. Sorry, but I want to congratulate you on your retirement and best wishes for the adventures to come.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, James, for being here.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Larry, good to see you. I do want to echo everything everybody has said. I'll take one. Little different approach. I would not accept his resignation. I would pay whatever was necessary to have him stay on until later this year when we have either the federal master overseeing the city or we have the new mayor and new city'",
        "'speaker_4': 'manager in place at that time. At that time. You will have earned it. Thank you very much. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr.. Good to that that concludes public comment. Now to turn this back over to the city council and myself to say a few words and then going to let Larry kind of close us out. So start us off.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Larry, I want to thank you tremendously for your work here in Long Beach. I know I've only been here in the city for six years, but in those six years, you have been very approachable. I've learned so much.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Just recently, being on the Elections Oversight Committee and working with you on election reform and all of all of the great things that had happened currently are happening. And soon to be will be happening. And so I'll certainly carry that with me as we go forward with elections oversight and just in general.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So thank you for being an amazing public servant, not because you had to, but because you really want to. And I know that will carry you through with your your next endeavors. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilmember Rankin.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mayor. And congratulations, Larry. I have a unique experience with you, obviously, because my predecessor in the seventh District, Tony Harris Wodonga, was in the committee that hired you and she says you were lucky bastard. Where? Wherever I applied for the job of getting selected.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But she made she doesn't regret that that decision that all she she sends me right now right there congratulating you on your retirement and wishes you very well. And to my part, you were as people were saying you're a mentor and you were also one of the things that hasn't been said.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You were also president of Temple, the Latino managers of professional organizations. For many years. You established the many, many, many Peres Scholarship Fund that over the years, I think we gave around, what, $20,000 or so to desiring students in in the Long Beach Unified School District, along with City College and Long Beach State.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So that's certainly a legacy that you will leave in regards to those individuals, and especially for having been part of their process and their educational professional development as you have been for your staff. And personally, I will always remember that day you took me to a Manny's at the park out there in Rosemead.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That really wasn't a many step, but it's okay, I'll forgive you for that because the original is still there on Evergreen and and East Los Angeles. And also he went to Garfield High School, a school that I was enrolled to go to but never made it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But he always reminds me about some of my my fellow students who were there and graduate with me. And and I'm pretty sure that in your retirement, you're probably going to be making some music. So go out and make some music.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Congratulations.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Big a councilmember.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Councilman Mongeau also is a member of the Elections Oversight Committee. It has been a pleasure to work with you on many of the initiatives that this Council has already really pushed through pretty quickly as compared to any previous council.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And it wouldn't have been possible without your hard work. I know we asked for a lot of research, but it was really important to us to make sure that we were making the good decisions on behalf of the citizens.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So thank you for your support and research and for leading a strong team of individuals in the city clerk's office. Because I think that being a city clerk is an important role and being a good boss is is an even more important role for this city.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Council member Austin.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. And I, too, like to join in the congratulations for Larry for his retirement. I'm envious. One of these days and it was mentioned that you you had a political ambitions once. You might want to do it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Council member. You didn't. Retiring. Didn't go into public service later on as an elected official. That's still an option for you. I want to thank you for your for your exemplary service to our city. And I can just just tell tell everybody.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Upon getting elected in 2012, Larry was warm and welcoming and full of information. And, you know, I can tell you, for a new council member coming into this this forum, you know, it's great to have a very knowledgeable city clerk welcoming you to to to the building.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I want to say thank you for that. I've found you over the last several years, and 2012 was my first foray into politics here in City Hall. But from way back, you've always been a man of great honesty, integrity, knowledge, great consciousness, but also influence here in City Hall.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'He's been a quiet leader in this building. There's a lot of people who who owe their careers and a lot, too, to Larry Herrera. And so you're going to be sorely missed and you are truly well worthy of this special recognition here this evening.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You work to improve our election processes. I can recall the circumstances in which you were hired. We are light years ahead of that. Our meetings are far more innovative. And when I look at the city clerk's office, I've developed and mentor professionals who are very well studied and understand the role very, very well.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so we're lucky for that. You not only mentored folks in the city clerk's office, you know, but like I said, he's been a quiet leader in this this in city hall. He's mentored people throughout this entire building, the city and community, for that matter.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so for that, you know, I recognize you as a as a real leader. And in retirement, sir, and your impact on this city will be be felt for many, many years after you're gone. And I wish you all the best in your retirement.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor Lowenthal.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And, Larry, I wanted to thank you for being open to a lot of our suggestions. You really are the expert and have your your finger on the pulse of what was going on in terms of technology for voting.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I know you always strive to be sure that the customer, which is the residents and those that are eligible to vote and decide to vote, you always made sure that they were your preeminent focus. And we looked at a lot of things because of you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You nudged the county to do more. But I wanted to also thank you for taking the time to review other, more challenging concepts such as instant runoff voting. If you remember that, that wasn't too painful, is it? Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That was a little painful, but you always see how graceful you are. So we have definitely brought things for consideration that you probably knew was not the best for our city at the time. But certainly you were a believer that if it was going to get more people to vote and interested in voting, then certainly we should'",
        "'speaker_3': 'try it. So thank you for that. I think that's that's my most favorite memory of you, which is you never lost sight of our customers.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Andrews.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes, thank you, Mayor. You know, Larry, for everything everything. I want to thank you for your enthusiasm, for making our documents more transparent. It's been an inspiration that will long term impact on the city clerk office and how it is ran.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I really appreciate your constant willingness to help. Your guidance and support throughout my years in office. And I truly appreciate that you've always been my top go to guy. You've done so much for all of us and the Long Beach community.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And Councilwoman Price.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. I want to echo what all of my colleagues have said and let you know that it's been a pleasure to get to know you. It's only been, what, ten months or so. But of course, I met you during the election process and for a first time participant in a political race.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You are very patient and responsive and really a great source of comfort for someone who's going through something like that for the first time. So. On a personal note, I want to thank you for that. You are always a great person to go to with questions.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I know that you've served the city, the citizens of this city very well through your service. So I want to thank you, wish you the best of luck. And I hope that you enjoy every single day that you've worked so hard to earn.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I'm going to go last. So, Larry, I mean, you've been the clerk since I've been to City Hall, first as a staff member for a short while and then as a councilman winning my special election that very first time and then getting reelected.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then, of course, through our campaign for mayor. So I've got three election certifications all signed by you. They're all hanging up in my office wall for those three elections. And I want to just to say, if you know a few things and add to what my colleagues said, first, congratulations.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think it's a very happy time for you and for your family. Also, just thank you for your leadership throughout the years. I mean, a lot of people, if you think about the accomplishments of the office and I know that you view the accomplishments like a team effort.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right. You have always put your team first. And I really appreciate that. But I think about the lobbying ordinance, which you helped spearhead and get us through the open government policy that the city has the EA commenting and kind of the that switch over to electronic services for the community.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All the reforms you've made so that people with disabilities can actually vote in more and more private way or have more access to the ballot box. All very, very important. All the reform you did on campaign finance, on campaign transparency, the work you did on charter reform, I know that that James spoke a little bit earlier, but'",
        "'speaker_0': 'there was an incredible amount of work that happened when all the charter reform amendments and changes throughout the years came before the city. That was all really, really important work. Personally, I also think you did great work getting the Assembly bill through that allowed civil marriages at city halls for all for all California clerks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think that was a really special moment so that we were able to also have all civil marriage, including same sex marriages here at City Hall. So that was something I think that we're very proud of the work that you did.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You know, in addition and then I think Councilmember Ringa mentioned that you're really the lead guy on the Latino manager's work and you pushed that for so many years. And I think it reminds those of us that as you're heading out, that it's really important for us to pick that back up and continue that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I know that's a very special organization for you, and I see our turn over there because, you know, you're going after you're going to make sure it happens. And so, you know, we got to ensure that the work that happened there continues.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The amount of scholarships that you helped raise money for that that all continues. And I want to also say that one thing I'm always struck by is that your team at the city clerk's office is a complete reflection of the city of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And if you know and you've had a chance to meet who works down at that office, but your entire you made a deliberate. Decision to ensure that the people that serve the community through its elections, records, management, all the work that happens in there also reflect kind of the beauty and diversity of the entire city of Long'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Beach. And I think that's something that is not always done by managers. It's hard. It's hard work. But you did a great job and you should be very proud. I think that you're leaving the city with a great team of managers and employees that love Long Beach and love the work that you all do.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I also, you know, take this time to personally probably apologize for some of our conversations during election seasons because I've always been a very active on giving you a call during particularly this last election. And I do get very, you know, emotional when it comes to elections.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And you have always were so good to me during the elections and just giving straight forward answers, being ethical, being honest, even when when when candidates and I'm not just including myself, but all of us that have been candidates get so passionate sometimes on the other end of that phone when there's an issue and you just took'",
        "'speaker_0': 'them all with stride and you listened and you know, there was a problem, you fixed it. And we really appreciate that because I think going through those elections and knowing that there was someone that was competent and incredibly organized on the other side, I think gave a lot of us the peace of mind because that is a'",
        "'speaker_0': 'very, very difficult process to go through. And you always did it well. And so if I ever you know, I was a little excited on the phone, I think for our on behalf of all of us former candidates, you know, we want to thank you for for that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so before I turn over to you, I am going to read the proclamation, because I think it's fitting on on on your last, you know, meeting, I think officially because you this is your last meeting with us as a council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then I know we're going to have a little nighttime celebration for you and your friends. I believe April 29th, I think is that is a date. And so that'll be that'll be fun. But I'm gonna read the proclamation to Larry Herrera.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'And if we could reference what another city's per capita use is, the city of Los Angeles is 123 gallons per day. And and every city has a different context. And so I don't make that comparison to disparage anyone else's efforts, but really just to demonstrate how much our residents have committed to conservation.'",

Last Tuesday, we took a vote based on the governor's mandate, executive order on mandatory reduction for the for the entire state. The initial motion was for a 20% reduction that was made by board member director Judy Abdo from Santa monica and seconded by me'",
        "'speaker_3': '. And while 20% sounds like it would be an onerous challenge to us in the city of Long Beach, it's something that we can do. Our residents can do that and demonstrate that. And sadly, that motion failed. And so there was a second motion for 15% reduction.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And that did pass. And and certainly Long Beach voted yes. And I'm I'm still struggling to understand, but I will call the chairman of the Metropolitan Water District to find out why the chairman of the board voted no on both motions.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So it's I looked at the vote record today. So we all represent different areas. Some areas have far more agricultural interests than certainly Long Beach does, and perhaps the challenge in reduction is greater. We understand that. And so I was a little startled by that vote.'",
