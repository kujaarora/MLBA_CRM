        "'speaker_6': 'Sorry. I was waiting to see if Tara was going to speak again. Oh, sorry. Yes. Uh, what we're modifying is the original application. So the item before you tonight is. Is exactly what you're going to have to go ahead and vote on, which is the hours that are provided and the conditions that are within the packet.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. So we're not really changing that. It's the original application.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'No, the what the Long Beach Police Department has has recommended is reduced from the original application. And then this evening, the business owner has requested an additional change to the recommendation that's been provided to you tonight. And I believe Councilmember Price has said that she is not supporting that and won't be entering that additional item.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'And so it's really important that the outreach component that we're working with, with with organizations on the ground, with faith communities, with our with with of course, with our schools, to just reach as many young people as possible to participate in these programs.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Did you want to expand on how the outreach component might work or how we're going to actually reach young people?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. Thank you, Mayor. And I can confirm that, at least in terms of my tenure here as well, that this is the single largest grant award related to a specific focus area for workforce development, regardless whether it be youth, adult or disconnected workers.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The outreach component is of critical importance for us. This is a program, again, where your entire cadre of participants are disconnected folks, disconnected from traditional systems. And also you're dealing with the challenge of the not using the for profit community for placement.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So on both fronts, getting to community groups that there are trusted brokers for our youth to access information about entering the program is a part of the significant part of the plan moving forward, as well as engaging those groups around opportunities, they have to provide a meaningful work experience that aligns with with the program goals.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So the outreach is is twofold in that respect.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's really great. I want to also just highlight when we talk about kind of job placements and possible opportunities, you I think you listed some, which is really great. I mean, a lot of these are also opportunities within the city to help on action climate action activities and you know, whether it's on the health side or on'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the library side, but I'm especially interested in this idea that we could have so many young people involved, particularly on the urban greening and park ambassadorship side, at this idea that we can have young people as park ambassadors in our parks across the city doing doing that level of work and ensuring that that, you know, teaching and'",
        "'speaker_0': 'learning about park stewardship and clean parks and and access to green space. And that's something also that's really unique from a workforce perspective. And so I'm just very interested in how that is going to develop. We have incredible parks space across the city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I also, you know, when you think about places like Eldorado Park or the Nature Center, especially in some of these larger areas, Drake and others, you do have an opportunity to to put some really great programing in place, especially, I think, in some of the larger kind of more urban forests that we have, you know, within the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'city. So anything else you want to expand on as far as like the park ambassador program and how that will work?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think you're right on with with the things that you've said in terms of the discussion we had. So we were we were convened cross-departmental before the application was developed by our DCM, uh, Theresa Chandler. And we had an opportunity to discuss the potential for departments to, to think through their plans for employment.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We have had conversations with again all the departments that we mentioned. The Parks Department has had an ambassador program, I think, on the table for some time. This is this is a vehicle to activate it for them. So we look forward to being able to do that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I think there are some some instances where with some other forms of specific gateway funding, we've started that out at a smaller scale to get people involved and engaged in the parks. And this is an opportunity, again, to open this up to more of the community and scale to the need here in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In my last last two comments. One is just want to uplift the also the urban farming and food insecurity piece that that you note in your presentation. Obviously that is a lot of really incredible opportunity there and the already established kind of urban farms and food programs that we have in the city as it relates to this'",
        "'speaker_0': 'program, I think could be really, really special. And then finally, I just want to make sure that we're keeping an eye out. I didn't explicitly see it here and maybe just missed it, but I think one of the requests that I made and when we discussed the program was making sure that we're just keeping an eye on'",
        "'speaker_0': ', you know, the conversation around the National Climate Corps program that is not fully gotten through Congress, but is there the framework there? And I know that when we had initially had discussions with the governor, that we were having conversations about that program and how could there could be some relationship between the two.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so as long as we're just kind of keeping an eye on that, I think that would be that would be beneficial.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think there's a few things to your point. So certainly the implementation implementation of SB 1383 in the city provides an opportunity for some relevant work experience around food waste, insecurity, the sorting of it, those, those types of things.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The Climate Corps model that was provided, that was proposed in the President Biden's build back better legislation was a model we looked at while building up for this. And we certainly see some of the opportunity that is going to come forward to cities through the states RFP related to Community Economic Resilience Fund as opportunities for a longer'",
        "'speaker_5': 'term placement and employment and related type activities through the Corps to prepare students for that moving forward. Great.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, thank you. This is going to be a, I think, a transformational program for so many young people. I'm really proud that we're going at this launch here in Long Beach. And do you want to do you wanted to share finally just the timeline as far as when the when you look at the next steps on the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'on the last on the last sheet here. We are sure you are feeling confident that this summer is when we're actually going to start the the placements, correct?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We are going to begin engaging with the the individual departments and entities referenced in the presentation later this week and not later this month. And we do hope to have the first set of placements in place in the month of June.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Great. And I would encourage you know, the team could also consider or think about how we're going to kind of brand the program. And, you know, is there going to be, you know, some type of logo for the program or, you know, are the are the are the youth going to get some kind of kind of T-shirt'",
        "'speaker_0': 'or some type of uniform that kind of brings them together. And that, you know, shows the breadth of the program, I think is at least something to consider for for for all of you as you're developing this. It would be great.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And with that, actually, Vice Mayor Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thanks so much, Mr. Mayor. Thank you for walking us through the program. Nick, I think this is incredible to see almost 400 youth be able to engage directly in a program like this. I think what's what's really great is that these youth, who in many ways are more susceptible to pitfalls in society, are given an opportunity that'",
        "'speaker_8': 'will create a pipeline, a pathway for them to actually have career opportunities in the future. I think that says a lot about our city and the way we're thinking about how we're engaging opportunity youth. And I look at some of these criteria low income, unemployed out of school, unemployed out of school.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We've done a lot. We talked a lot during My Brother's Keeper about disconnected youth, how you can make a meaningful difference in their lives by simply connecting them to the institutions that we already have, like workforce institutions. And if you're less if you're more likely to connect with an educational institution or workforce institution or get a job'",
        "'speaker_8': 'that pays a good salary, you're less likely to be connected to the criminal justice system. So I love that. I also love the crosswalk. I looked at it here. I know it was in the presentation, but it is here.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The Strategic Plan Alignment. You know, this is a best practice braiding together the ways in which systems and programs work for an outcome. You're aligning our youth plan or climate plan, sustainability plan, equity plans, youth plans, racial reconciliation initiative plans to have a desired outcome.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think that's smart. That's a best practice that I think we should continue to follow as a city. I'm interested in seeing, I think, coming out of the pandemic. We certainly have some some need for some extra expertize and some extra help.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm thinking about, you know, the garden at the Michelle Obama neighborhood library, which used to be a community group that helped manage. There's an irrigation system there. I think that was really a great project for them to take on.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm thinking about coordination with Conservation Corps, who's doing more work at the wetlands, and they should be opening up at the end of the summer. Their Environmental Stewardship Center at the Forest Park. So I see an opportunity there to do more work along the river.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I would love to better understand if there will be some alignment with some of our recovery efforts. We're investing significant resources in the food security and other things through our recovery efforts. I would love to see some alignment, some alignment there if we could.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And then the last thing is really there's really a question I would love to see. I would love to see some real pipeline or certification that if if some of these youth are on a certain track, it could land them into jobs that actually do climate resiliency, installing solar or even some some of the climate resiliency work'",
        "'speaker_8': 'we have. There's going to be significant work on electric vehicle charging stations, electrification of our ports. If there could be a direct alignment of, you know, these youth, when they get out, somehow they land a job with some of the infrastructure work that that we have to, you know, have to undergo in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so I would love to hear how you're thinking about the strategic alignment there.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's a great question. And we have thought about it. So so we know some of the programs and or opportunities that that some of the partners you mentioned in some you didn't actually actually create. And I think I referenced the the local higher provisions of the project labor agreement.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We know, at least in terms of the grand scale of this in Long Beach, it's going to be built by the trades. That's an agreement we signed and we're committed to for ten years. That agreement also opens up an ongoing dialog.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So how do we how do we work with our partners in the trades to say, here's the experiences for your pipeline that are available right now? Can can you look at these skills? Can you can you look at these competencies that are gained within these programs?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And can we start to brand some of this as legitimate through apprenticeship? And can we give those folks consideration related to our local hire provision? So there's a direct pathway from this to the, you know, the capital infrastructure projects that are that are going to occur in here in Long Beach and all of the other work in'",
        "'speaker_5': 'the region that the infrastructure bill and the like are going to provide. So we have thought about that and we think it's it's a direct connection to the signatory relationships we have with organizations like the building trades yet.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yeah. This could be considered a pre apprenticeship that gets them directly in. That would be a huge slam dunk. Thank you so much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilman's in Dallas.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mayor. First. Thank you very much for that wonderful presentation. I'm so excited about this program. One thing in particular that I'm excited about is not only will we be equipping and empowering our youth to address climate change, but it will also be a way for us, the city, to establish a model for the city that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'moves us forward in also offering more paid experience to our youth. And I think that the key word right there is paid experience for so many of these types of opportunities where we were only able to afford a couple and now will be able to give it to more youth.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think that that's really what what really excites me. Having paid work opportunity helps in reducing barriers and increasing civic engagement for young people. The bottom line is that this program will be changing the life of so many of our youth.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It is going to be so impactful on their on their confidence, self-confidence, and that's going to propel them to seek other future opportunities. And, you know, I'm just super excited about that. I also want to make sure that we you know, that we recognize that this program also comes with mentorship.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I don't think we put enough emphasis on how important mentorship is in the in the building of a youth. You know, like it's just so life changing. So I really want to acknowledge that. And I welcome those opportunities where our youth are going to be mentored and they're going to be taught and in particularly they're going'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to be paid. And so I think that's going to help in so many ways. And I agree with the comments that have been said here before. And I can't wait till till we get this program on the road.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I really want to be connected with you because I know that outreach is going to be important, especially to those individuals that qualify for this program. So I'm looking forward to connecting our offices and making sure that we reach all of the young students and individuals that will be able to to benefit from this program.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think we can make that commitment across the dias that will share the outreach plan with with all of you related to other folks who you believe we should be in contact with in your district. So we will do that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Allen.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes, thank you, Mayor. Just a huge thanks to all your team, to Nick and Oscar and Meredith and Larry and Teresa. I know I'm missing some, but all of your team that has done so much, you know, that got us to this point.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The amount of funding for this program is absolutely astonishing. It's transformational. So I'm just really excited. It's also been a privilege for me to work with your staff on designing this program for the city, and a chance to create youth employment and career pathways is just an absolutely huge blessing for so many of our of our youth'",
        "'speaker_7': '. And I look forward to hosting as many as possible the Climate Action Fellows that are that are loud in our legislation department and I absolutely agree with the mayor. We should have, you know. Badges or are collateral or something.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'm just really proud of this program, so I hopefully that you can incorporate that as well. But thank you so much. Great work, you guys.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Sarno.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mayor. So, yeah, I just want to add to my excitement as well as given what was said by my colleagues and the mayor, you know, I just kind of calculated it is a lot of money that is being invested in a youth program.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I calculated that if we're going to have 380 youth, it's really about with 450 to 500 hours. It's about 12.5 weeks, which is about two and a half months. So just enough to get a taste and maybe what it's like to be in these placements.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Right? Because some of us, it takes us a minimum a year to acclimate into a job. And so I'm just curious about, in addition to mentorship, what will be additional workforce training or transitional opportunity and where they're learning to build their resume?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Because we're working with many of the youth that would be in my district, which are low income, are unemployed, are just as involved, or so they have all these other challenges where they may have needs, services on top of making sure that they have and pretty much be job ready after their they've been in place.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So just curious about that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah, I think I think that's a great observation. I would say related to youth participants, given all the other factors in in a complex life, especially those of out of school youth, we find that most of them average somewhere between 20 to 30 hours a week at most.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They won't burn through that at a full time clip. With that said, all the other supportive services that workforce offers will be wrapped around these participants. They'll be co enrollments with other programs that they're eligible for. Child care, transportation, other types of equipment or clothing related to the occupation will be made available to them.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then all this all of this off skill and other development workshops that we put on will be there. They'll also have the opportunity, if they're not ready for for full time sustainable employment, for them to go into a training or continuing education program will equip them around the suite of tools we have to increase their digital'",
        "'speaker_5': 'access and if they're so inclined to earn, why that why they learn. We have a couple of platforms where they can engage in training while they're actually simultaneously in the work experience. But we plan to deploy all of that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Price. Thank.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So a couple of questions and the presentation was excellent. So thanks to both of you. How did we come up with the number 380?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Then number 380 was were and the the wage ranges and the anticipated hours worked was a look at our our existing caseload of opportunity youth what it usually takes for them to have a meaningful work experience. Adding in that some of the folks who are now eligible under this program are in our adult caseload currently.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we factored in what the typical experience were for an adult was came up with a calculus in terms of. How people disconnect from the labor market and what they need to reattach. Just wrap that around. A total number that came out at 380 tried to average close to 500 hours of work experience and pay them somewhere'",
        "'speaker_5': 'around market value, which for what we would hope would be the next step in the labor market for them.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we we do think we'll be able to fill all 380 of these spots like we think there's enough capacity there.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We think there's capacity and there's demand. I think we think about the the generation that we're going to serve as as very, very connected. But the pandemic actually had. Set an amazing effect on that. You know, they like to be online.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They like to be chatting electronically. But there's there's a demand like we haven't seen from youth this age to to be in person, get in-person service, interact with individuals, know that they have a safe space and someone who cares about them to be with and look at their future employment journey with.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we're we're excited to offer this and we think the demands and the uptake is going to be so great.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then what is the term out of school mean? Is it somebody like is the age.'",
        "'speaker_1': '16 to 30?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It is 16 to 30 out of school means not currently enrolled in a formal educational program.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So would like summer vacation qualify for the 16 to 18 year olds?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It does not.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It does not.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It does not.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So so these are these in in terms of a term we used last week, these are opportunity youth.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I see. So 16, 16 to 18 year olds would be the ones that are no longer going to school.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. That would be that population. And then have we found some of the ideas for the projects to be awesome? But I was just curious on some of these like for example, on urban agriculture. Operating public orchards and fruit tree programs.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Do we have a public orchard in Long Beach or are we going to create one, for example?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'd have to defer that that that answer. I'm not I'm not sure on that. I think that's an example Lynch lifted out of the Grant text.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think Linda's raising her, yes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Council members. We do currently in the City Sustainability Program, working with Larry Rich.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There are some agricultural programs.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The hope is that with this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Program that can be expanded to include.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That that type.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'More robust type of urban agricultural program.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Oh, great. Good. I wasn't aware of that, but I think that's a really great idea. And then the projects that we have. The city projects that we have, some of those will be eligible for these. Opportunities, correct? City projects?'",
        "'speaker_5': '100%. And we actually related to the number we need to serve, how we look at the city departments as our biggest asset and partner in providing these job opportunities for the youth.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And good. And then how are we going to advertise this so that we can make sure we get the, you know, a high number of applicants and also CBOs that want to partner with us.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yep. So that there there has been some, some surveying done related to, um, interest in the program, uh, post the presentation to, uh, the, the sustainability committee. Uh, we're going to go through our channels, uh, with our partners in the workforce development ecosystem as well as working through, um, the Office of Youth Development, the Youth Service Network'",
        "'speaker_5': '. Again, we've made the commitment to work through all your offices. So we're going to push this out through as many networks as as possible. We have strong relationships with the Ministers Alliance and the faith based network as far as sourcing for our other workforce programs.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's really the same approach, but amplifying it to ensure that related to sustainability and climate, that there aren't organizations who we haven't engaged with before that we're missing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I would recommend also that we reach out to the Long Beach nonprofit partnership, because there's a lot of CBOs there that might do this kind of work. And also, we have a lot of sober living homes with people that are looking for jobs right now.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That might be a good place to reach out to as well. Those are just my recommendations, but it's a great program and I thank you for the presentation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. There is a motion in seconds for public comment on this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There is Dave Shukla.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening. It's good to see that the terms of this agreement have evolved and are subject to further iteration. The areas of education, climate change and food security can either be co extensive integrated programs of immediate economic recovery, as a couple of the council members have already stated.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Or they can be compartmentalized and at cross-purposes and of little benefit, practical benefit for the increasingly critical and time limited goals that the State of California have set on climate, including SB 1383. You should note that these are goals that have fiscal requirements broadly reducing pollution and climate forcing activities that are principally responsible for them across space'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and time at scale. I encourage all of you to check out a webinar by the Climate seven Climate Center that was given on the 27th of April titled Investing in Workers for a World Beyond Fossil Fuels. It's 80 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You can find it on YouTube. As many people have noted throughout the process for the development of this Long Beach Youth Employment Corps. These two need to be real jobs, paid jobs, and they do need to lead to real career paths.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Especially considering that the Biden administration has just requested $33 billion for what can only really be read as a down payment on World War Three and potentially making all of our efforts here moot. But City Manager Tom Modica, you said more than once that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This city's budget document each year is the principal expression of the city's values. So I do hope you hear me that this is perhaps a once in a lifetime opportunity for this city to shape what took years to build out in the dirty energy economy here.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Mm hmm. In the novel. In many cases, in American human history. In the 1920s, 1980s, 2000, whenever it was 1940. These are things that are going to have to be rebuilt, reconstituted, reconstructed for climate resiliency in months. And the timeline is more than one other leader mentioned is pretty critical.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Admit I was looking forward to that cross seeing what that crossed with most. But the one last thing I'd like to say is. You know, if this just goes into things like anaerobic digestion or helping the reef centralize the grid for their own interests.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'This one in particular.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Is a an incentive to bring over lateral police officers.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It takes about a year and a half to almost two years from the time you train and recruit a police officer to the time that they can serve on the streets. And so if you do a lateral where you're bringing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Someone in from another agency, that can be done in a matter of, you know, of weeks, essentially. So this is a $15,000 incentive. And it's also structured to make sure that that employee stays with us at least a year and try to make sure they have a long career here in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we're very supportive of this and ask for your approval.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have a motion in a second. Councilman Austin, did you have a question?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I just had a really quick question regarding the the benefit of the lateral. Can you explain what it costs to to go through a police academy and to train an officer?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We don't have those exact costs right now. But I think it's a it's pretty costly and timely to put somebody from the beginning of the academy through the process. And so I think this would be a way to really expedite the process, like Mr. Modica said, and give us another tool in the tool chest for recruit recruiting'",
        "'speaker_5': 'experience candidates.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, I don't have costs.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I can talk a little.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Bit about the process. It takes about a year for you to go through a recruitment.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Process, through civil service, to create the tests.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'To create the list.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We then do an extensive, extensive background on anybody who's coming into our to our organization, which includes going out and talking to anyone who, you know, they've had contact with and really understanding that person's history.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You do that as well when you do laterals.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But you can do it in a in a more compressed.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Timeframe. You don't have the long.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Recruitment and then you put them through an actual academy. And then after the academy, you also have field training. And so that person goes does not go out by themselves into the field. They actually work with an officer to train them and they do that for an extended period of time.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so altogether that is a very expensive model that we have. And this actually is a very efficient way to bring on officers quickly.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And my follow up question is, what do you say to someone who says that we may be getting somebody else's discarded officer or somebody who didn't cut it in another department? What kind of provisions are we putting in place to ensure that we're getting quality?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes. So we would put every officer that's.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Doing a lateral through an intense review process.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Just like we would any new employee. But in this case, you're actually able to really.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Delve into their background because they've been an experienced police officer. And so we have a number of tools that we use through our process to make sure that we understand that person's background. And then we are able to make selections based on, you know, what, what type of officer we're going to want to have in our in'",
        "'speaker_5': 'our in our organization.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We still put them through training. We still do things in language. You want to make sure they know about our culture.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We want to know that they know our training programs. And so a lot of officers also get trained as they come on so that we make sure that they're consistent with our policies and practices.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'We can give an update, if you like, but this is an ordinance that was requested by the council to come back for I think Councilmember Allen brought this forward and we're just bringing it back.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I just wasn't sure if there was an update to Councilman Allen. Any comments?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes. Thank you, Mayor. I want to thank you. And the city attorney's office and the Parks Recreation and Marine Department and over there for their work on this ordinance at one of my first neighborhood community meetings after being sworn in.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There was a resident and her name was Sandy Nair, who reached out with an idea about kids zones. And she talked about the issues like adults misusing the playgrounds or engaging in activities that discourages children from using playgrounds.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And this issue was not just at her park near her house on the promenade, but citywide. And she shared the idea of marrying San Francisco's No Adult with a child in the playground program. In the following months, more residents shared similar ideas.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I spoke with the Parks Recreation, Marine Department and Animal Care Services Department about checking out what other cities are doing and how we can model and look at that. And I know this has taken a little while since March of 2021, but, you know, good policy takes a little time.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I know that we've had a chance to work with other neighborhoods, parent groups, other council offices to make sure that this ordinance is balanced and representative of our entire city. Throughout the city, we've seen that these spaces designed for children have been misused, vandalized, and even just outright destroyed.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I think we've listened to our residents who use these spaces, and we're taking the steps to protect them so that our young people can enjoy the outdoors and enjoy the parks. And by establishing kid zones, we can ensure that the city playground equipment in these play areas, specifically designed for children, remain safe, open and accessible spaces'",

Parks in my district, like Miracle on Fourth and then the Promenade Square Park, which is now as my colleague wonderful Mary's and de has this district are you know are still impacted by ongoing loitering issues which discourage park usage by shot by children and by their their guardians.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So this ordinance today establishes protections and guidelines for public spaces. And I hope this policy makes our parks safer for our residents and our families. The one element that I have some concerns about is the is the enforcement.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I did get this question. So if there's someone that can answer this, I know a resident ask specifically the language about 12 year olds prohibited youth older than 12 for from enjoying these amenities. So if you can clarify, because one of the things and I thought this was a good question, I have a nephew who's Pacific'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Islander and he's, you know, 12 years old, but he looks like he's 20, a linebacker getting ready to are the NFL draft or something. So. So I just just want to I just want you to address that constituent, whoever is here on those concerns.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'If someone can do that, that would be great.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. Thank you, Councilwoman. This is Brant Dennis, the director for Parks Recreation Marine. That's a very good question. I know. Typically, when we are designing our playgrounds and working closely with public works, we have, you know, the youth, the top lots that are, I guess, zero through age five and then the older children, which is traditionally five'",
        "'speaker_5': 'through 12. And that's kind of how we define youth in a lot of our programing. Also, I think the intent of this is really just to have a watchful eye over the type of use or abuse of our playground spaces.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I don't think it's going to be the custom that we're checking IDs. Actually, a lot of youth probably don't have forms of identification on them, but I think the intent of it really is to, as best we can, just keep a watchful eye on our playground spaces that are designed for for younger people.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But we have had some examples where.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Adults have.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Actually caused a lot of damage by aggressively using or abusing our playground equipment. So I think it's all for the good of the child, of the children, of our community and young families in particular, that we want our play areas to be safe, welcoming and respected.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mayor. And thank you, Councilmember Allen, for also bringing this forward. Very happy to sign on to this. As you probably remember, about a year ago, our playground at Admiral Kidd Park was totally destroyed, probably because someone just abused the playground.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I would also another playground in my district at Silverado Park also went through a lot of damage. And fortunately, through funding and fundraising, we're able to replace those two big playgrounds again and make them state of the art.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I think in order to ensure that these playgrounds remain safe for kids and last a long time and have a nice, long shelf life, I think that this ordinance would be would go a long way in helping protect that.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Price.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. I do have a question for the city attorney because I received several emails today. I know there's other cities that have similar ordinances and Councilman Allen touched upon them. Has this type of ordinance been through any sort of litigation to determine whether there's any access or constitutional violations?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm going to ask Anita to respond.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There has not been any constitutional challenge or litigation on these particular ordinances. Specifically the city of Santa monica, which this is modeled after. Great. Thank you. And then the other question that I had is, what's our enforcement mechanism?'",

        "'speaker_4': 'I thank you, Councilwoman.'",

They both pursued a very broad community awareness campaign. And I know with our army of community recreation services team members, it'll be out and about all of our community centers and our parks that happen'",
        "'speaker_5': '. To have the playgrounds that's going to be on their task list is to engage with the park users and in particular, I think more watchful eyes with our young families so that they're aware of that and also will be posting kids zone ordinances with the municipal code clearly stated.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'At each of our I think we have.'",
        "'speaker_5': '82 playground sites that they'll have the kids own signage posted. So it will be an awareness campaign and I think it's going to be a kinder, gentler approach. I don't think we're going to be hard, fast and and keep people from enjoying all of our play spaces again are intended for kids.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. And then I just want to clarify one of the things I think there was some misinformation and some of the correspondence I got. This is definitely not prohibiting people from going to the park. It's just literally the playground space, which a lot of times is delineated by sand or some sort of a safe landing floor space'",
        "'speaker_3': 'or ground cover.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes, Councilman, that's correct. Most of our place spaces by design have have curbs and accessible walkways surrounding them. So I guess the optics are to be fairly easy to see once there's a kids on signposted what would be perceived as the play area.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Great.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. I appreciate that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. And I think a couple of my questions were answered already, but I want to get back to the the issue of equipment and and its design. Can you explain go a little bit deeper in terms of the playground equipment that we have throughout the city?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And who specifically is it designed for? Because I did receive some comments from adults stating that they like to utilize playground equipment or that their their special needs adult children may need to utilize playground equipment. What sort of provisions have we made or are we taken for that?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And to your.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Councilman, that's a good question. So essentially, when we develop playground concepts and I think our signature playgrounds are kind of the flagship of quality. But we work closely with our colleagues at Public Works. They actually will bring on board a consultant.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'A lot of times it's a landscape architect to look at.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Design of the play space. And most of the manufacturer products have tried and proven specifications for durability and longevity and ease of maintenance. But I think going back to the premise of the the ordinance proposal, it really is not.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Prohibiting an.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Individual to engage in the play as long as they're supervised, supervised from someone. It's really just that individual who wants to just hang out and maybe interfere with the play actions of kids. And that's really the intent. So I think we'll be very, I think, empathetic towards certain cases.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And again, we just really want to create an environment in and around our play areas that are welcoming, safe and respected.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So and today, if, if, if we go out and we see an adult creepy person hanging out at the park or at play at a playground and, you know, we asked that individual to leave. Is are we out of line?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, once the ordinance is passed.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And signage is.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Posted with the municipal code listed, there's a stronger basis to inform them. And usually the awareness they'll find another.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Place to hide. So this ordinance gives us a tool to.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's a tool in the toolbox.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes. I just want to be clear on that, because there's, I think, a lot of confusion as to too the intent and what we are trying to accomplish. I know, you know, there was a measure, a playground that we worked really hard to get put in place in one park in my district in Jackson Park.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I received a number of complaints over, you know, a couple of weeks period of time from residents who said that there is somebody here who's kind of taken over the the equipment. And, you know, I'm afraid to take my my children there.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Other complaints that we've received at other parks are paraphernalia used, condoms, things of that nature on playground equipment, which is really appalling. And so my my take on this is I think that playground equipment should be almost a sanctuary space for our children and for our kids.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And for that, I'm going to happily support this item. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Again, Councilman Zendejas.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mayor. As a person who's has had fire in her district at one of the playgrounds, I am very, very supportive of this. And thank you, Councilwoman Allen, for all the work that you've done along with Councilmember Muranga and the team.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think that this is very, very important. Our little ones deserve to have a safe space for them to enjoy safe playgrounds. And the parents also deserve to have a place where they can take their children to the playground and feel safe.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm very supportive of this new ordinance that places the safety of our kids at the forefront of our park policy. So for that, thank you. I also wanted to clarify, this policy will be applied to all parks in our city, correct?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That is correct. To all parks that have a playground. Thank you. I think end and the signage that will be going on, you know, what will that see?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes, councilwoman. That's a good question for details. So there will be graphics run by the P-I or Kevin Lees, because we do have graphics standards for tape, font and colors and all that. But essentially it'll be a 24 by 24 inch metal sign orange field in the background with black lettering that will say kid zone.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And that beneath it will be the municipal code that cites this ordinance once its chips are passed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And will it be posted in different languages as well?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You know, that's a good question.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The term kid zone, I don't know if that's a universal term. It may not be.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, we always do go through.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Our language access step, but that's a very good question. We'll make sure that that's addressed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Thank you very much. Very supportive of this item.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thanks, Mr. Mayor. Just just a few things. So as a dad of little ones, we go to the playground all the time. So I completely understand the need to keep your playgrounds safe and kid friendly. And so for that reason, I'm happy to support it tonight.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think also, you know, there are playgrounds that we like to frequent and sometimes there's a lot of broken equipment. And it's because, you know, sometimes people mistreat the equipment. And I know how hard it is to identify resources to replace that equipment, you know.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I think we definitely need to need to think about that. I am empathetic about the circumstance around someone with my son. Someone has special needs and they're above that age. Or sometimes, you know, a 16 year old, a 19 year old may not be, as you know, they may be maybe smaller or have mental health issues'",
        "'speaker_8': '. I figure out we're going to need to be empathetic in how we deal with how we make this policy developmentally appropriate and sensitive. I also think I think about real examples of high school kids from Jordan High School that go next door to out in part and sometimes hang out on the equipment.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I don't want to see those kids getting tickets or caught up in the criminal justice system. But I think we need to just work with our park staff because it doesn't happen often. But kids do from Jordan High, go over, hang out when no one's using the playground.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think once the playground is invested in, more little kids will use it, more parents will be there. And that will kind of sort of self-police itself. So I would say, you know, when we have some funding for design, the sooner we get that program, that playground designed and built, I think the better it is.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But I just want to say, I understand the sentiment of what we're trying to do here. Let's make sure that we are developmentally sensitive in how we implement and that we're looking out for the circumstances of teenagers, high school students who just are being high school students.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so those are things that I just want to be mindful of. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you for your public comment on this. Then we have a motion and a second was cast our votes.'",
