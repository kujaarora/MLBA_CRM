        "'speaker_0': 'Week. John Keisler as team.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Honorable mayor and members of the City Council. I'm very excited tonight with our staff to to present to you that it is a national economic development week. And we're going to start a short video to celebrate that here in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So over the next week, we'll be pushing out messages and videos about the benefits of economic development in conjunction with the International Economic Development Council, which is doing this around the planet. There's about 350 events going on around the country to really celebrate the people like our small businesses, our developers, the people who create jobs, and also'",
        "'speaker_5': 'our commissions and our committees. And all of the volunteers in the city council who are doing such incredible work to promote economic opportunities for workers, investors and entrepreneurs in our city. So thank you for your ongoing support. We'll be celebrating Economic Development Week and you'll see more information coming out.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And thank you for pushing that out to your constituents as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Country Ranga.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Mayor. Nothing shows the vibrancy and the desire and the dynamism of a city like economic development. And I'm so happy that within the last several years that we reinstitute and recreate it, refocus, reorganize, restructure our economic development bureau and department, because I think it's one that has really been a focal point and a key to'",
        "'speaker_8': 'having the city be as successful as it is. And I want to congratulate the John and his and his team for doing a great job with our economic development goals. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Price.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. That was an amazing video. It was a really great video. I don't know if I've seen it before. Did we show it at State and City? I have seen it before, but it was a really great video and I enjoy seeing it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So if you push it out, then we can share it as well on our social media. So thank you and thanks to the great work that you're all doing. I love the energy and the vibrancy that your team, your entire team is bringing to the economic development efforts.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I can really feel a difference. It just feels very fresh and out of the box. And I love the anything as possible attitude that I feel like I've gotten when I've reached out to members of your team. There's never a hard no, there's always a, you know, a soft no.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so and and that's good because it allows us to to, you know, keep the opportunity open if things come along and they have and we've seen things come along. I do want to highlight a city department that I think contributes greatly to economic development, but we never really link them with economic development, and that's our libraries'",
        "'speaker_6': '. I think first and foremost, our libraries provide Internet access to a lot of people who wouldn't otherwise have Internet access. They offer bilingual computer classes, in-person and online, teaching people marketable job skills such as graphic design, Microsoft Word, coding, robotics, ESL.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They have free online classes on computer science, accounting, software programs, finance, entrepreneurship and business development. They have free access to online one on one job coaches who provide resume skills and cover letter assistance. People can visit the Family Learning Center to meet one on one with a guide who provides them job search, resume and cover letter skills'",
        "'speaker_6': 'they can practice tests, take practice test to become an EMT, firefighter or police officer. And they have free access to various databases full of sales leads, market research and employment opportunities. So I want to highlight the libraries because we rarely connect them directly with economic development.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But for many of our residents and visitors, the library provides them a place to be able to get prepared for the job they want to have, so that when we do have investors coming into the city, we have qualified people ready to go into those jobs.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So thank you very much for everything that you do. And specifically, I know you help citywide, but specifically you've been a real asset to the third district and again, allowing us to achieve things that may not be traditional.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'And I think what a great job he does in economic development and still finds the time to work in community hospital. The community really appreciates that. Also down the hill from CUNY Hospital is the traffic circle area. And not a week goes by that I don't get congratulations, although it shouldn't be going to me on all the'",
        "'speaker_7': 'new development in that area and the removal of the blight, let alone eight brand new buildings, probably a dozen new businesses when it's all done and by my rough estimate, $50 million of private sector investment. And we couldn't do that without the team here.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Q Councilmember Councilwoman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I just wanted to say thank you first and foremost to our Economic Development Commission. They've worked very, very hard, and the Chairman and past chairman have really spent a lot of time on our economic blueprint. I'm thank you to my colleagues, especially the two members of the Economic Development Committee.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Councilman Price and Councilwoman Turanga. The tough decisions have to be made somewhere, and I really appreciate the time that we spend together debating those things, because at the end of the day, without a engaged council and a staff and a department that is open and willing to make the implementations, and when we come up with something, you'",
        "'speaker_6': 'find a way. I don't think I've ever heard. No, either. It's let's think about it. Let's find a way. Let's find the funding. That is how a city of our size has the lowest percentage of unemployment in the recorded history of the city.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It is because people come together and they're willing to have the hard talks. And I really appreciate everyone, every department here. The library. Yes. A big part of economic development and also development services. The big strides you guys have made in the last three years in putting things online and shortening the process and being open to refunding'",
        "'speaker_6': 'business licenses, things like that weren't discussed before. And your willingness to be a part of that with us is really powerful. So thank you. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. So I'd like to first of all, congratulate the mayor and the Council for having the foresight and commitment to restructure and create an economic development department. And then they have been doing a great job on the economic development team, the staff, the commission led by John Keisler.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They bring a an optimism and energy and strategic approach that that I, for one, very much appreciate. Yes, they do have a get to. Yes. Kind of mentality, which I very much appreciate. And I think that's a quality that we want to have in our economic development team.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I also want to specifically thank you for your efforts, the team for their efforts to to help us with our development on Atlantic Avenue. I know myself in the eighth District and Councilmember Richardson in the ninth District are really looking forward to some of the new developments in the North Village, new retail and restaurants that will complement'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the the new development of our new library, our crown jewel in the north, and also the new developments planned along Atlantic in Artesia, which will, I really think, transform our north part of our city. And lastly, I want to thank you guys for all the great work you do in support of our business improvement districts.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They make a big difference. So thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, councilman. Accountant Pierce.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I want to echo my colleagues and say how much I appreciate your willingness to partner with people that you haven't partnered with before. You're always very honest about what you know, what you don't know, and willingness to learn, which I absolutely love.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think in downtown, maybe as of now, we've got six cranes instead of seven. We saw one of them coming down today for the Civic Center, which is exciting to see them go up. It's real exciting to see them come down.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I also want to just applaud Development Services as well. We know that economic development, while you guys are running as fast as you can, it's got development services working extra hard as well. And so just want to say thank you to the entire team.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Long Beach is definitely moving quickly. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Andrews. Yes, thank you. I think a lot of the credit should go to.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Mr. West because, you know, I look at these guys history the hard way and these three guys walk into your office. I'm trying to figure out what is this? And I guess they do on the hardness. Yes and.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No. Keep living, you guys.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You know how to say no. You're doing a great job. Keep up the good work.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I don't know about all this. No business. But but let me just add that really obviously proud of our department and Mr. Kaiser is in a great job of leading our department. This this city council restarted in its first budget the economic development department, which had been eliminated for for many years.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think that was the first kind of bright step in creating the department and creating a director that is now Mr. Chrisler in creating the Commission, which created our economic blueprint that is now guiding a lot of this work.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And in fact a lot of the I know equity work that's happening out of that blueprint, including the summit, is directly one of the commission's, I believe it was item number two in the blueprint that's being kind of implemented right now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I also want to commend the members of the Economic Development Council Committee, which includes, of course, Councilwoman Mango and Council Woman Price and council member Ringo. And I want to include also the and thank our partners at Bloomberg and many of the foundation partners that are allowing us to experiment and do innovative work.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that has led to a lot of changes on our interface with our businesses and our users, particularly when it comes to busy port and a lot of the upgrades that we have done to our systems, whether it's through the permitting process or whether it's been through the appointment process, the business licensing process, the list goes on'",
        "'speaker_0': 'and on that our team has worked. It is such a a smoother experience to open a business today than it was a few years ago. And a lot of that has to do with your work. I want to thank, of course, our community partners that are doing work with us.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I know that you partner with our bids, with the chamber, with the work, with some of our work organizations and so many others that are particularly involved in the blueprint implementation. So I just want to thank all of you for that and and if any public comment on this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Please come forward.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hello. My name is Kimberly Obiero and I'm with the Long Beach Public Library Foundation. Thank you for highlighting the many ways our our city supports economic development and for also mentioning the library and the many programs we provide.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'll just mention one more. Many of the digital tools that the library provides have been mentioned. The Library Foundation is also very proud to fund scholarships for the career online high school program, giving adults a second chance to earn their accredited high school diploma at the library.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Since 2016, this program has had 28 graduates and of course, the many literacy programs the library provides. Studies by the Campaign for Grade Level Reading show that students who do not learn how to read proficiently by fourth grade are four times more likely to leave high school without a diploma.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And this can have a huge impact on our economy. We hope you will continue to view the library as a valuable public education center that gives people the opportunity to transform their own lives and create a more prosperous Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And ah, the comment. And then we'll go to a vote. Dave Shukla on file. Fellas, I'd really like to see more on manufacturing, especially clean tech manufacturing. We're losing a lot of market share in a lot of critical parts to San Diego, to San Francisco.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'As someone who grew up in this town, I really, really want to see a better focus on the things that we can say yes and continue to say yes to it, as.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Well as some of the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Limits that we're going to have as a city. Cranes coming down is a good thing if we are the ones bringing them down and someone who lives where I live. Considering everything that we're talking about today, consider everything and choose wisely.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And with that of vice mayor, did you queue up?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Sure. I just want and thank you. Obviously, this is this is a good thing. But I want to take a moment. Just give a recognition to the economic development department and also shout out to the team that's coordinating our upcoming economic equity summit at the Long Beach Convention Center on May 17th.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So this summit is going to outline some national best practices and strategies. We've got a number of our council members, number of stakeholders engaged and want one level or another and essentially is going to make the case for, you know, when you think about everything from homelessness to public safety, education, these issues all have a common denominator'",
        "'speaker_7': 'and that's poverty. So cities who address that and make it the core of the economic development strategies are cities that ultimately thrive. So I encourage you if you haven't signed up. My understanding is that it's sold out. There is a waitlist.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Go ahead and feel free to contact our economic development department or office at 570 6137. For more information on the summit. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Vice Mayor and I, we didn't mention also that I want to thank you guys. Also, I know the the beach poverty rate, which had been about 22% for for many years, is now down to about 18%, which is the first time we've hit under 20.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I know a long time. And so as fairness, I do want to I do want to thank the team and all the work on that issue. And we did public comment. So Members Pisco and Castro votes. When we did public comment, I called for it.'"

That was the parking garage and the brand new terminal. Mr. Roemer, our airport director, is going to walk us through the phase two projects and what that entails.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'We are going to get into a slide deck here. But before we do that, I want to just do a set up here to get a summary overview of what the project will entail. It is in the staff report.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Just a reminder that this is comprised of nine components as part of the phase two best estimated base cost of $58.8 million, with a contingency that takes it up to a possible total of $65.2 million. Key features of this project include a new enclosed ticketing lobby, a new open air consolidated baggage claim area, new relocated in-line TSA'",
        "'speaker_0': 'checked baggage inspection system and bag maker facility as well. There are six other components that will help enhance both the wayfinding as well as traffic features of the airport, as well as providing a new avenue for rental transactions to occur inside of the historic terminal.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The delivery method for this was procured through a design build, meaning there will be more efficiency through integrated coordination and contractor responsibility. This aspect of the project has been achieved through a competitive request for proposal process for proposals were submitted in response to the RFP that was put out on the street after a technical review and interviews'",
        "'speaker_0': '. Three of those firms moved on to an interview for analysis of a cost component. So based on the panel's overall review of that, Swinton Builders was unanimously selected to be the best value overall for the city. It is important to note, and it'll be in the slide deck, that the earlier limitation relating to allowable square footage was'",
        "'speaker_0': 'abided by in the overall net new square footage. And it is within actually it is under the previously approved council limit. From a funding standpoint, this project will be paid for with airport cash and an amount of about $23.3 million passenger facility charges in an amount of about 20 and a half million dollars customer facility charges which'",
        "'speaker_0': 'are received through rental transactions of $7.6 million. And lastly, a TSA grant amount of $7.3 million. So before we get into the slide deck, I do wish to thank our engineering group that's headed by RB three. They've done a great job.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's been a heavy lift to get it to this point. Stephan Lum, who's the senior civil engineer. I've asked him to come up here with me in the event that there are some questions after the presentation that he may respond to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And Stefanie, going to one presenter is also been integral to this project. Our in or our contract consultant Jacobs Engineering and CG also have helped to get this project to this point. So I'll go ahead and get into the slide deck.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So as Mr. West explained, you know, this phase one was completed in 2012 and comprised of improvement and development of a passenger concourse, the TSA screening facility, passenger screening facility, and the construction of a parking structure B, which folks will know from the main parking structures, are entering the airport off of Lakewood Boulevard.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Phase two envisions us to really continue that enhancement. In the travel experience, we will be renovating and simplifying the security check in process through the new ticketing lobby. We will also rehabilitate the historic terminals, timeless and beauty, and restore its original functionality.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In addition to some mechanical and building upgrades, we will be relocating the car rental transactions into this building. This was this process really involved in required us to engage with the community to make sure that this space was reused appropriately.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Again, the what are the main goals for the terminal it's a historic criminal is to revitalize and streamline pedestrian and vehicular access in and around the terminal area. We did consider as paramount importance of the airport priorities. And of course, as we said, we wanted to make sure that this project was within the certified E.R. and then'",
        "'speaker_0': 'subsequent council approved limit of 89,995 square feet, which this is well within that limit is one of the mayor's eight by 28 projects for the Olympics initiative. This project itself accommodates existing activity, meaning that it's really to help the experience, the customer experience, the passenger experience for those coming to the airport, it's already a great airport.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This will just take it to another level. There is no impact to the general fund in terms of expense for this project. And as a matter of fact, we will not be using any debt financing for this. It it'll be fully paid for through cash in fees that are collected at the airport.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And really important for the community as well is this will not result in any additional flights as a result of undertaking this project. So this slide here shows an overview of the existing site plan for the terminal area.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You can see there on the lower portion that is currently parking structure. And to the left is the rental car rental return, which is where possible. Our customers will pick up a drop off rental vehicles directly above that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Around the middle of the slide is the historic terminal, and immediately above that is the existing screening facility for checked bags. A little bit above that and to the to the left is the passenger screening facility, which was developed in 2012, along with the concourse areas which are at the upper part just below the the aircraft parking'",
        "'speaker_0': 'positions. The large rectangle to the right is where we will redevelop and have I mean, right now it's the valet storage and aircraft parking that will be redeveloped. It will show you that in the next slide here. So this one here shows in the after condition once this project is completed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So these are some of the big changes of note. As you know, the terminal facility itself will open up into the plaza because we will be relocating and constructing the baggage screening baggage facility that will be off to the west and to the south, along with the new ticketing lobby there as well to the to the south'",
        "'speaker_0': 'of the terminal, the consolidated baggage facility I'm sorry, consolidated baggage claim, which is now currently three, will be consolidated into one facility there to the to the north of the checked to the security passenger security area and then the new rental car storage, which will be service storage and ready return.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So the function that currently takes place in the the parking lot right across from the terminal will move over to the north. And that area, which is currently part of the ready return, will be reprogramed and repurposed into a ground transportation center where we will have the taxicabs, rideshare companies like Uber and Lyft, as well as other'",
        "'speaker_0': 'commercial carriers that they will stage in there in being one location that's convenient to the terminal complex. So the following slides were really show kind of before and after what we're envisioning. And this right here is a shot on the left is the current or the existing historic terminal where people will check in and either get their'",
        "'speaker_0': 'boarding passes or check their baggage before they go out to be screened in. Going on to the concourse area, you can see that it's a very compressed and tight space during peak times. It's actually much more crowded than this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So what we're envisioning through the new ticketing lobby is a much more open space. There'll be much more opportunity for folks to use the self-check in kiosks, of which we have a few, but we will see many more deployed in the new facility.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This is an elevation showing the western side of the historic terminal. So on the left, you can see it at the bottom of the terminal elevation there, the screened area, which actually hides the checked baggage facility building that was put in there, I think 2006.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So on the right shows that it's gone. And it shows that open flow from the plaza so that folks are deplaning and heading out toward either to rent a vehicle or going out to be picked up, that they'll be able to go straight into the historic terminal.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This is another view here on the left that shows that it's looking southeast and shows a portion of that fence that that that hides the the checked baggage facility. And on the right where it's removed, that that will become seating area.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And again, to make the plaza much more inviting for builders and greeters, as well as anybody else who works at the airport and wants to relax and hang out in a nice space. This next one here shows the rendering of where we envision to be the the baggage claim facility.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So on the left recurrently, it's just a wall that hides some areas behind that, which are our staging areas for for airlines. And on the right, you can see the left or the left part of that rendering shows the baggage claim carousel and to the right of that, some concession space that we expect to develop.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So this is a view again. This is the historic terminal on the left. And part of our plan is to repurpose it and have the rental car companies do their transactions in the space. So this is a view looking to the south.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's the same terminal building. There are that left photo. Again, it's a very tight compressed space. And what we will do is open it up and relocate counters and make it much more friendly so that people who are coming in from flights, they can go directly into this building and transact and with their preferred rental car company'",
        "'speaker_0': '. And this is just another view that shows looking to the West again, that this really highlights that opening out into the plaza area, so that one of the features will be that you could actually go from the front of the curb, straight through the doors, main doors in flow, if you want to go straight out into the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'plaza. And one of the components we talked about here, this is an overview showing on the left is the existing ready return or the car rental operation there where folks will both rent their vehicles as well as return and pick those up that will be relocated to the north.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then this space will be converted into the ground transportation center, which will have basically staging for cabs, shared ride busses and other commercial operators. Project entitlements again, going over that, you know, we went took this through a process.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We were very mindful to engage the community. We had outreach sessions so that we could make sure that people understood what it is that we were attempting to achieve, which again, is overall an improvement to the facilities and not an expansion of the airport.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'On April 5th this year, the Planning Commission approved the addendum to the previous IIR and they also approved Phase two site plan review. On April 9th this year, the Cultural Heritage Commission approved and issued a certificate of appropriateness for the renovation of the historic terminal building.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then the table below really just shows what the council originally approved as part of the IIR 97,400 545 square feet. It was later reduced down to 89,995. So the post phase one square footage resulted in 70,000 square feet or thereabouts.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And with phase two, with the reduction of some space and an addition of some space, you could see that results in 89,929 square feet. So that's well within the envelope of what is what is permissible in the air.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So tonight, as we said earlier, we're we're requesting council approval. This is a design build contract in an amount of up to $65.2 million, initial funding to support the major three components that we would like to deliver within the next 12 to 18 months.'",
        "'speaker_0': '32 million. 32. 32 and a half million dollars. Those will include the ticketing lobby, consolidated baggage claim and the in-line screening facility. As I said earlier, funding sources for this or airport cash that we have on hand. Passenger facility charges, which are those fees that are attached to tickets for people who are departing the airport, customer facility'",
        "'speaker_0': 'charges, which are fees that are attached to rental transactions and a TSA grant that we applied for and have been provisionally awarded by the federal government. It stays progression that our overall goal will be to maintain airline passenger operations throughout the term of the construction and control of the contract may be terminated at any point.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Should financial conditions or anything else emerge that we would have to take pause and rethink the route, the balance of the project. So with that, that concludes the presentation, and we're here to answer any questions you may have.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And a very impressive presentation from the staff. And you guys did a really, really great job. I know this is a long time coming and an important improvement that the community has been asking for at the airport.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Let me first turn this over to Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. I only have a couple of questions. This is a it's a very impressive presentation. And and I'm glad to see that it's stays within the parameters of the air that was approved by council before us. That that said, when how long do you foresee this project taking?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm not sure if I heard that in the press.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, I'm sorry accounts, but this is a program for a three year period. So from the commencement of doing the work, which we expect, I mean, to commencing the work which we expect to be later this year, probably in the in the beginning of the fourth quarter of it, we would expect it to take three years to'",
        "'speaker_0': 'complete.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Because their priority in terms of what projects will go first.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. As noted on one of the slides, you know, the the the priority projects include the new ticketing lobby, the new TSA bag screening facility and the baggage claim device.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And this project does fall under the project labor agreement. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, it does.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right. Thank you so much. Looking forward to it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman. Councilwoman Mango.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. I just want to thank the airport staff and the community for this great opportunity. We've come together and it will be amazing. And so it will continue to be the best airport in America.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. I just wanted to congratulate you on a great design, I think. And what I noticed about the new terminal versus the old terminal is how bright it seems when you walk outside. There's like outdoor firepits and it's bright inside the actual was that concourse or whatever it is and the original building seems a little dim'",
        "'speaker_7': ', has always seemed dim to me. You walk in at the original building, goes from daylight to dimness, and then a scene here is much brighter. So I guess my question is, what are what are they? What do we did?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We did they add more lighting? Did they open the windows or something? The rendering looks very, very bright on the inside. How do we do that?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, I'm going to take a stab at it on a high level. Then I'm not turn to Mr. Lum to give more detail. But, you know, one of the main features is, as we pointed out, is the restoration of the doors leading out on the western side of the building.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think that's going to help quite a bit in the fact that the the existing ticket counter areas, those will all be removed. I think the lighting that that exists beyond behind that through the windows would probably help quite a bit.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But Stephan, is there anything else I'm missing?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Jess You're correct. The back side or the whole west side face of the building, it's actually has a whole bank of windows that are currently blocked by the airline offices and in front of that, the ticketing counter. So when we renovate the first floor, all that will be cleared out and and opened up into a more open'",
        "'speaker_7': 'environment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Great. Thank you. Let me just say two comments. The first is that, of course, I think this is really impressive. I'm very excited about these improvements. We've been talking about them for a while and the second piece gestures to make a note for your team.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Two things I've mentioned before I just want to reiterate publicly. One is we need to please look at the possibility of the parking lot for the transportation plaza and or other opportunities that are outdoor for solar. I think what I think, you know, Cal State, Long Beach has set a great model on their parking lots and how'",
        "'speaker_0': 'they're using solar to power the facility. And so at least we should at least explore that as an opportunity. And then I just want to make sure that part of this improvement that we don't forget, of course, the lighting that I'm talking about to make lighting, just to make sure that as we're that we bring in a'",
        "'speaker_0': 'expert in night lighting and so that we are appropriately lighting the historic terminal as well as the rest of the facility in a way that is more interesting than what we currently do, which seems a little bit hokey sometimes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I look forward to that lighting plan. Any public comment? This is certainly a commendable project. Really the lighting. It's a shame, though, that the one drawback is that people come into this city. And I'm sure in time, particularly when in the next year or so, two years or so, they'll realize they're coming into a venue, a'",
        "'speaker_0': 'city where it has one of the most corrupt mayors in the history of Long Beach and. Excuse me in this state. And all they would have to do is look at the tape of the comments of the mayor less than 10 minutes ago when I referenced the fact that he will be spending time in prison.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And he mocked that by saying, well, I have been saying mayors have been corrupt in this city for 24 years. I have lived in the city. I think it's 40 years and never once, never once, never once. Have I ever said we had a mayor that was corrupt?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have some that were dubious in terms of projects and mental capacity, but none were dishonest and corrupt, as is Robert Garcia. And that and even that I haven't been saying it for his full term. That corruption started a little over three and a half years ago with the criminal complicity of raising the Marine Stadium support structure'",
        "'speaker_0': 'to its period. The tape of this meeting, of course, will go to the U.S. attorney's comments. In fact, I sent you a memo of that just now. An email will go to the U.S. attorney tomorrow morning. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Mr. should here. I'll be happy to send the tape myself. Area of in a second. Please go ahead and cast your votes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Motion carries.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Great. Excellent. Good work. Next up is item 12.'"
