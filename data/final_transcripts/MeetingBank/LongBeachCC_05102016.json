It was extremely difficult, contentious billboard ordinance. It took a lot of discussion, a lot of public was involved.'",

There were a lot of very difficult issues that were discussed, and one of them had to do with billboards, digital billboards on our landscape freeways. And I thought we had all come to an agreement that that is something that we did not want to have, mainly because what we have in terms of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'landscaping along the freeways was pretty nice and we didn't want to interfere with that. So the brightness of these billboards is an issue. But then also that effort did win the city an award, a hard fought award, because it was such a difficult thing to come to an agreement about.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Now, we're being led to believe that this minor change in this ordinance is is minor, indeed, when in fact, what it's doing is opening up the door to allow digital billboards to be in a place exactly where we did not want them to be.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then also, if you take a look at a table in the item, it says that they can be 500 feet apart. Now, staff will tell you, well, that's just not going to happen because, you know, of the land uses and ownership and this and that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, once you open the door, you could possibly have digital billboards every 500 feet down the road. It might not happen for five or ten or 15 years, but eventually you may really regret that you're passing this besides the fact that they use an incredible amount of energy, they use so much energy and generate so much heat'",

So in terms of being the green Long Beach and we tout the fact that we're energy efficient and we're responsible to the environment, I think it's a terrible idea if they're generating money, that should be for the city that should be spoken about here.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'If they're not distracting, why have them? You know, it doesn't seem to make sense. I want to point out, too, that the height restriction that was proposed earlier in the last reading is actually an increase in the height.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Currently, the ordinance calls for 40 feet, no more than 40 feet high. Now it's being led to up to 50 feet and even higher than that if there are sound walls nearby. I would really want to see that go back down to the 40 feet and one of even more restrictions.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'And Cantrell. And I will repeat some of the things that I wrote to you in a letter. They've been addressed by other people today. Electric billboards are distracting. And if you take your eyes off the road to look at them.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Studies show that it is at least 2 seconds that your eyes are off the road. In that 2 seconds, the person in front of you can slam to a halt and you can run into them. I think that putting distractions like this on the freeways is counter to what we were trying to do.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'When we tell people, Don't use your phone, don't text, don't put on makeup, don't shave while you're driving. And then. We put up electric billboards, as has been stated. It also takes energy. And as I understand it, we're making a deal that we can take the old billboards in the neighborhoods off the streets so that we can'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Tom Stout live in Wrigley Information File. I agree. You know, all we're doing is exchanging one form of light for another one that you see. I mean, if you get all these billboards along the freeways like people are talking about, you know, it's going to look like the Las Vegas strip.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You could probably see it from the piece, the space station and a few more years if things go the way they are. So exchanging, it's not a good idea if you're going to make some money. There's probably better ways you could make it than, you know, sort of putting in signs that nobody really wants.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'But I just wanted to say that and said my time was productive. I've been writing movie reviews for the L.A. Times and I strongly recommend The Jungle Story. It's a static, wonderful film. Having said all that, I'd like to talk a little bit about billboards, which I'm here for first.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The remark that we're somehow distracting from the beautiful landscape of the freeway with the billboard remains to be seen. I see very little. A beautiful note of the scenes to be seen around the billboards. Second, the billboards a work of genius.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Some of them belong in art galleries. They they tend to be very beautiful for the most part. And third. And most importantly, billboards. Generate revenue for the city. You know, it increases sales. That's why I have them. It's good for the city.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's good for commerce. Another point to be made is that. The notion that Las Vegas is somehow worse. Worse off with billboards is it is not true. Las Vegas and Tokyo are noted for their billboards. The lighting in particular, and really quite beautiful.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The lights are meant to be beautifying and not distracting. And my last point is this all the complaints about billboards, it's been it's been presenting a distraction. Well, it is a distraction just because it's so good. People are attentive and want to see billboards.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And furthermore. You know, Bill, boy, I work hard. I want to I want to emphasize and they do increase revenue. And the last point to be made is that they're not deleterious. They serve a productive function. They inform like the story of a haiku poem, an insight set in a few words, a few lights, a major comment'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Amy Burdick, Director of Development Services. Answer that question. But I believe it's 138.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think it was over 100 for sure. Council member, mayor and Council City Manager Pat West is correct. We do expect 138 billboards to be removed with the ordinance change specifically from one company. We do have potentially another application which would remove another 38 billboards in a different location on a different freeway.'",
        "'speaker_2': '176 billboards, I think, is a remarkable accomplishment for us with this tiny change. And I'm really proud that you brought it to us. I think that it's a great thing. And I know that someone made a comment about find another way to make revenue.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This is not a revenue generator for the city. This is a way to remove blight from neighborhoods. And if you take a few moments to look at last week's council meeting, I think that was Bodak did an excellent job showing us the locations in our parks and in our neighborhoods where people lived with that blight before.'",

        "'speaker_11': 'present, but also on the on the tube. Over the last year, we've heard a lot of reports about what's been happening in Flint, Michigan. And there's have been several reports about other municipal municipalities across the country that may have similar issues in their infrastructure, all piping piping that is probably lined with lead and therefore having a potential'",

        "'speaker_11': 'So I asked the director, Chris Garner, if he would be amenable to coming to the city council and to present the the efforts that we have here locally to ensure that our water is safe and that we have taken measures to ensure that it remains that way.'",

        "'speaker_11': 'So I'll hand it over to our staff director, Chris Gardner.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you very much.'",

And what makes it even more of a tragedy is it could have been avoided with proper respect for the science of water treatment. So what we have done tonight is we brought I brought my water Einstein with me, my director of operations tight saying'",
        "'speaker_4': '. And he will walk you through real briefly.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'On what happened in Flint, Michigan, and what went wrong, and then how in Long Beach we do it differently.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'The residents of Long Beach that the drinking water in Long Beach is very safe. And he will explain to you in terms I can understand and hopefully the rest of you can understand such.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Honorable Mayor and members of City Council. Thank you for inviting us down to provide a brief presentation on what's happening in Flint, as well as give you some explanation of what Long Beach Water Department is doing that is different from the city of Flint and provide some assurances on the water quality that we provide to our residents'",
        "'speaker_4': '. So first and foremost, what is happening in Flint. Flint, as you have heard on the news, is experiencing lead contamination problem and the source of that lead, the primary source. The lead is the lead service line and that's the pipeline that goes from the city main to the house.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'A pipeline is made of pure lead. Other sources are lead that's been introduced to the system is from household plumbing fixtures. So there are in brass fixtures. There's also lead and there's also lead in some of the old solder of when you solder copper pipe.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So what happened was in 2014, the city of Flint had decided to switch the water supply from Detroit water to the Flint River. When that happened, it caused a major shift in water chemistry, and that caused the water to become very aggressive and caused the the scale that protects the pipeline from leaching lead to become unstable.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'To compound the issue, the operations of the Flint Water Treatment Facility had decided not to implement corrosion control, which would help to restabilize that scale and prevent the lead from leaching from the led service line, as well as corroding the lead the brass fixtures within the household plumbing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So consequently, there was a lot of delays in appropriate action and ultimately resulted in the lead issue that you're hearing about in the news. So what is different from Long Beach, from Flint? Well, first and foremost, Long Beach does not use lead service lines.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We use copper service lines. So that primary source of lead does not exist. There are some brass fixtures in homes, so that does provide a source of potential lead contamination. But Long Beach has been using its water supply for over 50 years.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We're primarily groundwater. We're about 60% groundwater, and we're about 40% purchased water from Metropolitan. And that water is very stable. We've been using it for a long time, so we don't have that rapid change in water chemistry that caused the problem in Flint.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'At the same time, we do have an active corrosion control process where we work to add chemicals to the water to make sure that whatever scale that's on the pipeline remains relatively stable and that does not allow the water to corrode any fixtures.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then lastly, we've been monitoring for lead since 1992, and all the monitoring results reported to the state has been below the compliance detection limit. So from the monitoring, we know that we don't have a levee issue. So hopefully this provides you with some assurances that the water that we provide to the residents is safe to drink'",
        "'speaker_4': '. With that concludes my short presentation. Thank you for the opportunity to speak. I'd be happy to answer any water quality questions you may have.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you for the report. So having that information, would it help residents to put like, say, a water filter on their faucets to clean the water to make sure it's even cleaner than what it is already? Or is it recommended?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Do we need it or not?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The water that is delivered to your home is perfectly safe to drink. Now, whether you decide to put a additional filtration device, it's a personal taste preference. You can do it. The only thing I would caution you is, for example, if you use a better filter, what it does is it removes the chlorine from the water, which'",
        "'speaker_4': 'is the upset, objectionable taste that some residents complain about, that chlorine is there for a reason. It prevents biological growth from reoccurring in the water. So when you remove it, you have to drink it right away or refrigerated.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Do not leave it out. It could cause problems for you later on.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'You I was good at. That was going to be my next question. You did mention that you put some chemicals in our water to I guess, to make sure that it's clean as possible and it avoids, I guess, parasites from growing in there.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'What are the types of chemicals you put in there? Fluoride as an example. Equal fluoride in our water.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes. We've been floating for a long time since the seventies. When you add caustic soda, which raises the and that's what helps keeps the scale stable in the pipeline system. We add a chemical disinfectant. It's a combination of ammonia and chlorine and what we call chlorine means.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that's what is the disinfectant that's in the water. It stays in the water and prevents the michael michael biological activity from going out of control.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And another point you mentioned, you made mention the fact that you report, you test our water on a periodic basis. How often and you report those to a state agency and are those results available on the Internet or can we access those test results to make them available?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Or is it something that we have to go to the State Department in order to get those results?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we collect about 55,000 samples a year to test for various contaminants that may be present in the water for the lead testing. We do it once every three years and then actually this is a year for lead testing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we do over 100 samples and we actually in the the bill stuff, we had asked residents because of the sensitivity issue of Flint, we're offering additional testing to the residents if the residents want to volunteer. There is a limit to how many samples we could take and couldn't test the entire city.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It would be too much of a cost, but we are adding that in terms of the water quality results. We do. We do report monthly the water order results to the State Water Resources Control Board. That is the governing agency that that regulates us.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'In terms of the results itself. We do publish an annual water quality reports that is available that used to be mailed out to every account on file. But in an effort to be more green, we have converted to electronic.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we do make it available on our website so you can get access to all of our quality monitoring data on our website. And if you do want a hard copy, you can contact the water department and we will provide you a hard copy.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Excellent. One last question. These two had a long to guard program.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We do. We still have the long current program.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Wonderful. That's all I have. The Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you for the report. You know, we've been hearing so much on the news. And so I think also my my colleague, Councilman Roberto Arango, to bring this forward, sometimes we have to, you know, tackle the challenge head on and really learn a little bit more about this.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So appreciate it very much. I don't have any other questions. I think you answered them all. But appreciate the the report.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'By Councilmember Ranga.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I also want to thank both of you for being here this evening. I'm going to be partnering with the Sierra Club very soon. We're going to try to hold a a town hall meeting, if you will, workshop on water quality and what can be done so that the community can be better informed as to how we can'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Do you have anything that you wanted to add?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Now, we we again, we appreciate the opportunity to talk to you and to the.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Public about the water quality. And as I mentioned, if anybody has on the public, there has any question about their own water quality in their house, contact the Long Beach Water Department and we will do testing for that and.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Give them some assurance. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Great. Thank you. And as always, keep continue to conserve. I mean, lawn pictures and a nice job. The residents have done a nice job through this last year of really conserving water. And we've got to continue that. There's a lot more work to do.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So thank you. Thank you. Okay. There's a motion any second. Is there any public comment on this item? Please come forward.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Mr. Mayor, city council members, a name is Ben Rockwell. I would like to thank the water department for giving us the reassurances that they've brought tonight. I feel that this is very much in line with what we need to hear.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'This is something that is very important to all of us. And I want to thank our water department for the reassurances and spite of the reinsurance that they have given us. I don't like the taste of chlorine and some of these other chemicals.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I do have water filters so that I can have my drinking water, my cooking water, such that I am getting rid of the chlorine and some of the other substances that could be injurious to my health. And thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Peter Rosenwald, Honorable Mayor, members of the Council, assembled citizens a sometime in the 1980s or early 1990, and I believe the Water Department had a program where you could get a container and take your water in to the testing area.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It will take it into the water department and and have it tested. I just remember this. I never did it. But I'm just curious. Does anyone remember that by any chance? And. What were they looking for at the time?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. We still have the program. If a resident feels like there's a concern.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You can call us up. We'll talk to you over the phone. Listen to what your complaint is, what your concern is. And if we feel there's a valid.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Concern, we will go out to your house and we will collect a sample and test for you and give you the results.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So let me go ahead. And Mr. Gardner. So if you wanted to want to finish your public comment and then we'll kind of get to public comment.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you, Mayor. This was something that the water department would give you a sample container and you would bring it in. So I'm glad that they have that. And I also I don't believe I usually would read the water insert and I don't believe seeing this in mentioned, maybe it's not mentioned because it would engender a lot'",
        "'speaker_11': 'of people calling the water department or asking for them to make an inspection. But anyhow, that's my comment.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hi. My name's Ellie Gonzales. I as on file. I'm really glad that this item made it before you today. I think it's really important that we do an assessment on our water infrastructure. I want to speak not specifically about Flint, but the issues around Flint.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So some of the issues that came up, it's not just about the water in the lead. It's also about communities being lied to for about a year, actually about two years. It's also about communities that still don't have access to clean water.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Now, when we're talking about entire cities losing their water infrastructure, I want us to remember it's not just Flint. It's many of the communities that have dealt with fracking for the past ten years that have lost their access to clean water.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And if you don't believe me, you can go ahead and ask some of these people. In fact, the mayor of a former mayor of the city of Denton, Texas, a Republican truck driving, you know, gas, gas loving guy.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'His city was so heavily fracked that his water was able to catch on fire. I'm sure you guys have seen some of the YouTube videos. And so he was out here in the city of Carson helping them promote their ban on fracking.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So so their community doesn't have to deal with what he had to deal with. His kids got sick, his wife got cancer. You know, and these are very real things. These are things that already happen in our communities.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I want to just mention that communities do get lied to. And then the government does work with companies to say, oh, no, you don't know what you're talking about. You're not a scientist. You're you're you're you're not educated enough.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's what they told these people in Flint, Michigan. And I want us to think for a second, can that ever happen here? I want us to make no mistake about it. There is a grace upon this city. This is a wonderful city.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But when we practice the same sort of practices or relationships with industry, we can also fall victim to the same sort of accidents or incidents which occur, which lead to governments then being involved in covering up their mistakes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So the company that that did the water testing for the residents of Flint that said, oh, no, you guys don't know what you're talking about. Your kids aren't getting sick. You that's an odor thing. That's a taste thing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That company is called Veolia, and they actually do testing here in the city of Long Beach, actually in Signal Hill. And they work with some of the drilling companies, again, right here in Signal Hill to help them produce water tests, the testing results that show that that the water is safe.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They also Veolia has also done studies here for the communities in Watts near the Exide battery plants, where communities say that their water was contaminated. So I just want us to think that to just remember that when people like me come up to this council and say, hey, you guys, you should really take a look into fracking'",
        "'speaker_4': ', since so many communities have already suffered water contamination, that maybe you don't want to be one of those elected officials that say, oh, no, you don't know what you're talking about. So I do just also want to make one other mention.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The person who introduced this presentation, I've got nothing personal against the gentleman. He worked for the Oil and Gas Department for 25 years. He was just appointed because you guys had some beef with the other guy. Thank you.'",

We thought it would be important to have this discussion before the City Council and invite Frontier Communications to come and address these challenges and what customers can expect moving forward. It's very important to note that each and every one of these council members pride ourselves on promoting quality of life and when quality of life is impacted'",
        "'speaker_3': '. We hear from our constituents on whether or not we control or having control over the issues or not. After my coauthors have an opportunity to speak, I would like to ask for a brief staff report about the city's communications on this issue.'",

We also have representatives from Assembly Member Patrick O'Donnell's office, who is hosting a town hall this Saturday at the Expo Art Center and in my district.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I'm sure that we'll have an opportunity Saturday to go into greater detail. So I'd like to turn it over to my colleagues. If anybody has anything, if not, we can go to a starting point.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I guess first let me go to Councilman Price.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Sure. I echo what Councilman Austin just said. We have received a number of calls. They seem to be unending. They've lessened over the last couple of weeks. But even as recent as last night, we received an email from a resident who did not have access to their landline and could not call 911.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I have some concerns about safety issues for them. I, too, am a customer, so I've experienced a lot of the disruptions in service. But that's not really my my priority. You know, my service is not a priority.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But I gather from my own experience that my residents are going through the same thing. One of the other concerns that we've heard a lot from residences. Why should they be paying for a service that is has been diminished over the last few months?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Why why should they be paying for the full service if they're not getting the full service? So I'm sure that's a question that Frontier has has heard and is prepared to answer. We honestly don't have an answer for them.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I think, Councilman Austin, for initiating this discussion, because I think that we've done our very best to refer our residents to Frontier, and I can only imagine how overloaded the team is. However, what we've heard from a lot of residents in our council office is that there have been a lot of missed appointments, cancelations, not a'",
        "'speaker_6': 'lot of notice. Again, granted, everyone is probably busy working day and night to make this transition smooth, but it has not been as smooth as we'd like it to be. I understand that only a half a million, a half a percent of of a million people have.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Are continuing to have disruptions or had disruptions. But those those numbers for us mean individual people, residents who are calling our office, people who want help, people who want us to help them. And we really don't have the tools or the resources to be able to help them.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we're looking forward to Frontier being partners to us and helping us figure out how we can help them because we really. Are unable to assist them with this particular issue. So I want to thank you for being here and look forward to hearing an update as to what the plan is moving forward.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay with that, I'm going to turn to first blush as any objection, turn to city staff and then allow public comment and it'll come back to the council. Is that okay? All right.'",

On April 8th, our city began receiving complaints from our residents in regards to landline telephone, internet and cable service during the transition from Verizon to Frontier Communications.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'On April 13th, the city reached out to the senior vice president of Frontier Communication, Steven Crosby, and notified him of the problem. Since then, the city has also communicated to the California Public Utilities Commission and noted them of the problem because they are the franchising authority for this matter.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The CP you see is fully aware of the difficulties that residents are experiencing. The CPU commission has also assured the city that a new frontier consumer point of contact has been established for residents so they can call directly for issues concerning services and or outages.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Further, the CPC will be attending the town hall this meeting Saturday, May or May 14th so that they can have a better understanding regarding the problems that are still present. Also, Letv is running a public service announcement informing residents on where to send their complaints via email as well as the complimentary phone number.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'With that, then as my staff report.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'No, sir.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. So why don't I go to public comment and then we'll go back to the council? This is an objection. So to I know we're going to start off public comment. We're going to have actually Melinda White, I think, is going to make some comments.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'First, from what I understand, who is the regional president of the Western region president and then any anyone else that wants to make comment during public comment, please come forward. And then we'll go back to the council.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Mayor and city council. We do appreciate the opportunity to be here this evening. I am Melinda White. I am the regional president for the West region, for Frontier Communications. And as a part of the acquisition that commenced on April 1st, where we took over and began the operation across California.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Verizon's wireline business, consumer and business, including FiOS, there was a lot of activity, as you might imagine. California was one of three states that commenced operations California, Texas and Florida. And as a part of such a large transaction, we did expect that there would be some gaps.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And as we move forward through the transition, we realized that the gaps that we were that we were experiencing, many had something to do with the fact that our network is an IP network, Internet protocol, which means that it's largely software.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we do operate IP networks today across our 29 states. And what we identified across the California network, fortunately, is that the disruption was minimal. And you're right across the state, it was actually less than 1% of our customers who experienced any disruption as a result of the conversion.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Our focus, as you might imagine, being a local team, we all live here, we work here, we play here in California. And in fact, our local manager, Randy Campbell, is here this evening. He is responsible for the entire Long Beach area.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This, by the way, is our largest market, very important to us as part of this California acquisition. Our focus is on addressing and resolving all customer issues as quickly as possible. And that's what we've been doing over the last four weeks, four plus weeks.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And we did bring a team this evening. And if there are any folks here who have issues or concerns, we have the right people here this evening to help you as a part of ensuring that we had outreach through the community.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We did set up a couple of local channels so that customers would have an easier way of getting to us. You probably heard of the email address, let Melinda know at Broadcom. And we received several folks who outreached from Long Beach, in fact, through that channel, and we were able to help them very quickly.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we, too, are very serious about the fact that we are moving forward into this community. And we have now many community members that we want to make sure that we work hard to regain their confidence. And that starts with getting their service back in order and ensuring that they have an experience, which is what they paid'",
        "'speaker_6': 'for, what they expect from us and what we commit to them. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. I'd like to do any other public comment on this item, and then we're going to have the council. Please come forward.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Again. My name is Ben Rockwell. Council member. Mayor. And members of the city. When I moved just before I moved here to Long Beach 28 years ago. My entire phone bill. Including our long distance calls, was only approximately $28 a month.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I was paying another $25 a month for TV or cable TV. Just today. The new charges from my frontier phone bill. To $188.13. After I pay my gas, electric and my rent, I have approximately $600 a month to live on.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Now almost half of my income. Has been charged to me. I frontier. My bill before from Verizon was approximately $176 a month, which I thought was high. But to go up over 100. And $11 a month as. Beyond belief.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's difficult. They promised to work with me, but I still. My voice mail is not working properly. Every time I try to go in to pick up my voice mail. The code word has been changed. When I do have voice mail in there, I haven't had but two calls.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Go to voice mail. And the last. Uh, 37, 38 days since Frontier took over. My voicemail has not been working. My TV is not working properly. I was on the phone talking with one of the members of the president's office back.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Back East. And my phone, my TV and my Internet all went off at the same time, and they were off for almost 2 hours. Most of that time, I was forced to use my cell phone. Which brought my cell phone usage to over double the usage that I'd had in the previous six months.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Per month, this has made it so that I've had almost double the cost of my cell phone for the month of April May.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Rockwell.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Good evening, Mayor. Members of the City Council. My name is Alison Gallagher. I'm here tonight on behalf of Assembly Member Patrick O'Donnell. We want to say thank you for bringing this forward before the city council. Like each of your offices, our office is also experiencing a number of calls related to this transition, which is why I will'",
        "'speaker_6': 'be hosting the town hall that Councilman Austin mentioned just a little bit ago this Saturday, 11 a.m., at the Expo Art Center. Those who are interested in attending, we do encourage to call our office at 5624290470. We will have representatives from the Public Utilities Commission, as well as Frontier Communications, who will be bringing a large group of'",
        "'speaker_6': 'their technicians to assist residents one on one with any problem that they might be facing. So thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hello, Mayor and Council. My name is Joseph Hoffmann and I had no plans to be here tonight. But driving into work, I heard about this meeting on Frontier, on the news radio, and I said, I'm going to be here tonight.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So first I'd just like to say thank you for the Frontier executive who came here. I would question statistics, though, because they're claiming less than 1%. I'm here as one of the 1%. I don't know how they determine who's affected, but, you know, that's a whole nother matter.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm here because I'm affected. I experience service outages and stuff. And, you know, it's kind of funny that it was April Fool's Day, right, that the transition happened because it was quite a foolish thing we had to go through.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I've gone through many phone calls and really resolved my most of my technical issues. I'm here because I have really an ongoing concern about how this is all going to turn out for everybody. And what I mean by that is the frontier customer service representatives are very nice.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They're very accommodating on the phone. I think they would have to be going through this transition. My issue is the only way to communicate with them is via phone. That is it. We're all on hold forever. There's no record of the conversation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so that leads me to why I'm here. I've had documented communications via email with Verizon. I've told Frontier I'm willing to pass these on to you. That document, you know, the programs and stuff I had and all they said was, we'll bring it up to our managers.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So tonight was the first time I heard about Let Melinda Know or something like that. I don't think that that's necessarily going to address this completely going forward. So my experience has been I renewed with Verizon in November of 2015.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'For 24 months, I had promotional inducements in order to do that. Frontier is now telling me we're not sure if we're going to honor those promotions. So that's not a technical thing. That's just I sign up for 24 months.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I have no way of communicating with them in a written way that documents these problems. So this is really what. What I'm concerned with. There's no email to communicate with them, to show them what I've already agreed to, to have them look at that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There's no records now going into records. All of my Verizon records. Hey, I'm for the environment. I agree to paperless billing. Those records are now all gone. I have no access to my Verizon records. Frontier has no access to my records and not giving me any of that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I feel like a fool because I signed up for paperless billing. I have no records of anything that I've done. When you call Verizon, they require you to enter your phone number and it says you are no longer of a Verizon customer and they refer you to Frontier.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then we get on the phone and to circle repeats. So we really need professionalism in documented communication with this company is really what I'm hoping to achieve. You know, that's what we need going forward. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you. Is there anyone else that would like to address the Council on this issue? Okay, we'll take it behind the rail. Councilmember, your anger.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you, Mary. Obviously, we've been through this before. We had Southern California Edison last year that experienced many problems. And then we had to address sort of California Edison and their issues. And we even had to go all the way to the CPC to get an understanding as to what occurred.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And I think that's where the situation that we're at. I think right now I'm not sure why there's a big issue with that transitioning from Verizon to Frontier. It might be that the Verizon's systems were faulty or weak or needed work that was delayed or not done.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And Frontier is sort of like stepped into it. Or it could be that Frontier was just totally unprepared to take over a system that was weak and didn't have the data protocols necessary to evaluate what was going on with Verizon before they before they made that deal.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And I'm uncertain as to what would occur here, but I would want to direct staff to write a letter to the CPC requesting a full investigation as to what's going on here and perhaps provide some testimony at the next meeting to determine what it is that is going on here.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Because up to this point, I'd be getting the same types of complaints from residents as far as billing or being overbilled for services that were not rendered or not provided for services that were billed that they never they asked for and never got.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And, of course, the public safety issues in terms of for our elderly who are who had limited access to dial 911 or emergency services. So there's a lot of there's a lot of moving parts to this issue that I think needs much more in-depth investigation and study.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So I would that would be my my concern at this point is that I think we need to have more than we do need a town hall. No question about the town hall. But I think that we also need to have the CPUC present and review it and look at it from their point of view as to'",
        "'speaker_11': 'what took place here, because we're not going to get full answers locally. We need full answers as to what happened at the state level with the CPC and the transition that took place between Verizon and Frontier in exchange for the services.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Because it is there's just too many, too many issues going on here in terms of not only the services but the billing. And people are asking, well, at least I was told people have been asking for refunds and none is being provided.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And as well as a situation where people are getting billed for services that they didn't ask or didn't get. So that would be my comment at this point.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you, Councilmember, your younger Councilmember Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. I want to thank the sponsors of this motion for bringing this forward. We all have received some of those concerns about overbilling access to 911 emergency services. And some of this is to be expected with a transition.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But I think I think it's great to see that we do have the representatives here with us today. And I, I was very pleased to see the quick response to the gentleman's concern most immediately. I also want to acknowledge Frontier for being one of the first sponsors of the My Brother's Keeper Community Challenge, Mentorship Challenge.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So welcome to the community in that regard. So the way that you've approached the community, I'm confident that we will be able to work together through these community concerns. Two of which that I'm aware of is the concerns with the DVR.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That's important to me. I got to get my Game of Thrones on. But but also about the call center in jobs, that my understanding is that some of that call center, you know, was maybe contracted out on a temporary basis.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And that's very concerning. If you have people who, you know, haven't necessarily worked with this constituency and may not know how to engage with this constituency, my hope is that and maybe this is a question that can be answered.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'My hope is that whatever transitional workers are brought in, that we make sure that the existing workers are sort of maintained through this process. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Councilwoman Price.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor, and I appreciate Frontier being here, too, and I appreciate hearing from Ms.. White. I think that this is it is going to be a great partnership long term, I'm sure of it. But there are still a few concerns that I have that I think it'd be nice to have some answers, too, and that'",
        "'speaker_6': 'is the issue of fees. So although I understand that that number, a half of a percent of a million customers, seems like a small number. And while I appreciate that when we have a transition this size to have such a small number as is actually a successful project, and I get that and that in the business that'",
        "'speaker_6': 'may be a successful project, but I don't know where that data is coming from because I can tell you just here on this council, we've got I mean, if we're a representative of what that population would look like, several of us have personally had complications.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then when we go to community meetings, we have swarms of people come up to us saying that they too have had disruptions. So I'm not saying I'm sure that the data is accurate, but is that data out of Long Beach specifically?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Is it statewide? Because if it's statewide, the chances of three or four or five members of out of nine all having disruptions and that being an unusual circumstance in relation to the other the main population, it's highly unlikely.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I think that maybe it's just this I don't know, I'm not familiar with the market, but maybe it's just this this area geographically that's experiencing the most disruptions. In any event, I think a lot of the community has legitimate concerns that if they weren't able to access certain aspects of their cable, do they have to pay'",
        "'speaker_6': 'the full cable costs? And I don't know what the answer to that question is. I don't know if you're prepared to answer that tonight or if we should have people email specifically about their their specific bill to this email address that you gave us.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We can do that. I'd like some further direction on that and then I'd like a little bit of direction in terms of outreach. You know, one of the complaints that we've received a lot of is there's not a lot of notice.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I get that when we have a transition like this, we don't know what the gaps in the system are going to be. We can't anticipate those. That's why there's efforts to try to resolve it. But people are saying that they didn't receive a lot of outreach.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So the only thing I would ask is, as we move, as we as we move forward, if we're going to have any sort of changes in the system or any upgrades in the system or anything that might potentially disturb the system, that we do some sort of an outreach to the community, whether it's in the utility bill'",
        "'speaker_6': 'or whether it's in, you know, on the Internet or some some kind of outreach if you're going to do any sort of upgrades to your system, because sometimes there's disruptions and they're totally unintended. So those are the you know, the fees and the outreach would be the only other things that I would I would say we would'",
        "'speaker_6': 'need a little bit more direction from Yuan in terms of what your company plan is. Yes. Is it okay if she a thank you, Ms.. White, if you'd like to. Thank you. So I will address three things that I heard that I think are important to get in front of you this evening.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'One, if a customer was out of service for any amount of time, certainly we will be crediting and we have been crediting the accounts and we will do that proactively to. The question came up about outreach and I believe it was in January.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Verizon did send a notice to all Verizon customers at that time, letting them know about the transaction and the timing of that. And then Frontier sent a communication out at the end of March just before day one, to ensure that the customers knew that Frontier would be the new service provider.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'A question or comment came up about the call center, and I'd like to address that, sir. And that is that it's right that we used an outside sourced or an offshore call center during the conversion period and still are.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And part of that is because as we brought over almost 5000 employees in California, there was that thing called We need to train them. And they were not trained yet on our systems and our processes and we needed to ensure that that was done.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It is in progress now and we are beginning to put California based call center reps in support team members on the phones. But in the meantime, we have an offshore that we're using interim. It's the same offshore organization, by the way, that Verizon used for many years.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It has been a bit disappointing. Yes. So we're very excited to get the California based employees on the front lines in the interactions with customers. The field techs, by the way, have been out there since day two, working very hard, very, very proud of them.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They've done a fabulous job interacting with the customers, resolving issues, answering questions since day two. So I hope that helps fill in the blanks.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you, Councilman. I'm sorry. Is that okay?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And thank you very much, Councilman Gonzales. Thank you. I, too, just appreciate Frontier being here as well. I think it's important that we know our residents ourselves are able to speak with you directly on many of these issues.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The constituent that was here in the wheelchair is one of my constituents. And we hear from him very regularly. And, you know, it's it's unfortunate that his rates have gone up. But what's even more striking is that people aren't able to get to 911, which I think is just incredible.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I ask, I mean, we have had similar situations with other utilities or with Edison, I should say, where, you know, communication is the key, and especially if we're your top customer, your largest customer. Hopefully it will be crystal clear in terms of getting to residents.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And sometimes it needs to be not just the mailing, perhaps informational meetings where you're out in the community, additional methods that aren't, you know, the regular, regular email or letters. And I know that I have faith that that will happen and also information back to your customer service, because I know some residents have complained about connecting with'",
        "'speaker_6': 'customer service. And, you know, there's a disconnect and I know that happens. But, you know, there may be disconnect where they're not being able to get the information. You know, they're not understanding that there was some issues here in Long Beach and, you know, all that might happen.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So there might be some miscommunication with customer service. So as I always say, communication is key. And I think if we move forward from here, hopefully things will get a lot better. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you. Council member Supernova.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. I, too, would like to thank Frontier for being here tonight. And Steven Crosby is not here. Oh, you're Steven. All right, well, nice to meet you. We we met informally over email, but I just like to say, Steph reported that the problem started on April 8th and that afternoon or early evening, I got a call'",
        "'speaker_8': 'from a constituent. It actually was a voicemail in my office and I called her and she happened to be disabled and she lost both her landline and her internet. And she was calling me on her cell phone. So I sent an email to Steven Crosby and she had her landline up the next day on a Saturday and'",
        "'speaker_8': 'her Internet back on Sunday. So I was very happy with Frontier at that point, as you can imagine. So was my constituent. So well, first of all, we should commend my constituent for her resourcefulness. I've lived for all my life and never would.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It occurred to me to contact my councilman over my telephone not working. But she did. And it worked out for. And the other piece is what struck me about that is, as I think it was mentioned, the field techs were obviously very, very good.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But that following week we got an email from our city manager saying that we're going to turn this over to the California Public Utilities Commission because it wasn't working out for others. But it just strikes me it looks like that could have been just a numbers game, because if you're if your techs could jump on that so'",
        "'speaker_8': 'quickly and do it so well, but if you're just overwhelmed by that problem multiplying itself all over, you wouldn't have enough techs to do the job. So if that's the case, it sounds like just something that will be caught up with eventually.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The other thing I'd like to say, and the speaker mentioned that we no longer exist to Verizon, and I think that's a kind of an inherent problem. And it also manifests itself in the addresses like if you had a Verizon dot net email address that's can been converted to AOL.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So for instance, in my case, I want to change one my aliases. Guess what? I cannot do it because I don't exist anymore to Verizon and you can only go back to Verizon. So if Frontier has any way to resurrect that relationship for us and our constituents, I think that might be another thing we can look into'",
        "'speaker_8': '. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Councilman Mongeau.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I echo the comments of my colleagues. I appreciate you being here. It has been a frustrating several weeks as so many of our constituents have been, without valuable phone lines and internet. I was a frustrated member of this community back when Verizon closed up shop to the fire's FiOS locations in the community.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so, like one of our public speakers here tonight, there isn't a place to go and stand in line to talk to a live person. And I think that that is something that was very important, especially in our low income community.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And the prior location of the Verizon facility that was local was at the blue line station. And often when I would go there, there was a long line of individuals there ready to pay their bill and oftentimes in cash, because some of our most needy residents are in a tough position where they can only pay the last'",
        "'speaker_2': 'minute. But those services, phone lines are just crucial to our ability to be able to reach public safety. So on top of the work you're doing now, I to encourage you to look at an option of a new storefront in the community.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think it's a big part of our ability to touch some of our most needy residents. I know there's some kinds of funding that are being utilized through fees that actually go to our L.B. Cat program, that help our low income residents with their cable bills and their phone bills and the such.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I don't know what kind of partnerships could be in play, but I know that Derek Samson's a community leader who's open to opportunities to help our our neighbors and our our businesses. And finally, I would just like to say that it's very frustrating to a community that worked so hard to get online.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Many of us communicate with our residents through our newsletters, and those email address changes are hard for them. And so whatever we can do. I thought it was funny that I had discontinued my Verizon service recently because we did a little experiment in my community where when Verizon laid down the lines, they cut charter lines literally underneath'",
        "'speaker_2': 'homes, they cut charter lines. And when Verizon was here before and they had to put in the infrastructure, when they poured those sidewalks, they poured them crooked and they poured them in a terrible way. So when you were taking over Frontier, I was like, great, a new community partner, a fresh start.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Let's look at what opportunities we have. So I hope that in a few weeks, once this is all behind us, we can start that fresh start and then we can look at those opportunities because the lines that were cut by the company you purchased and do need to be repaired.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If customers want to convert or change over, they need to have those options. This is a free market. And then we also need to look at repairing the relationships of the past and how we can work through to the future.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I know you can. You're a strong company. We're glad to have you here in Long Beach and we look forward to a future of partnership. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Council member Ringo.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you, Mary. So I want a little bit of a clarification at this point in terms of where staff is with this issue. There was some discussion about the that staff has already made contact with the CPC in regards to what's taking place.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Where are we at at the present time?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Brian Dennis Yeah. Council member, Urunga. We're actually the CPC will be going to the town hall meeting and they need to have a better understanding as well. And in regards to that. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Now, I understand that the CPC is also going to be having a a meeting on May 18th. Is this going to be part of that agenda? Are we going to be there at that discussion?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Councilmember Your Honor, I'm not aware of that.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. Well, I think that we should have a presence at the CPAC meeting whenever that comes up in Sacramento so that we can like I say, I see this as the same issue that we dealt with with Edison.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And we need full disclosure for a full investigation, a full clarity as to why this happened in regard to whether it's infrastructure cabling, whatever it is that took place in that transition between Verizon and and Frontier, whether it's the you just to determine who's at fault, if a fault needs to be laid anywhere would basically like to'",
        "'speaker_11': 'have that kind of clarification on this here. And Councilmember, if I can add, so we did immediately it once we started receiving calls not only reached out to to Frontier but also to the CPC, called them and let them know that there's an issue they've provided it's information that we can give residents to help log complaints because'",
        "'speaker_11': 'they are the they are the regulatory agency. They have.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Assured us that they are looking into the matter and that they're.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Going to be doing an investigation. At this point, we don't have any information about the status of that investigation and what their discussions have been with Frontier. But as Mr. Hunter mentioned, they will be listening at that next meeting that's coming up in the town hall.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And we can certainly follow up with them and ask what the status of their of their review efforts are going to be. All right. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Vice Mayor Lowenthal.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I know I missed the bulk of the conversation and I've heard council comments as well as some customer feedback, and it may have been discussed or the mayor may have mentioned it, but Long Beach is not the only city.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Unfortunately, I work in the city of Santa monica, as you know. And at the big blue bus, we take 5 to 7000 phone calls from customers a month. And our phone customer service lines have been down since Thursday.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That is a historic outage for us. And it's not 911 service. But if you think of transit, it is often times service for those of us that don't have the greatest agency of resources. And so it's it's quite disappointing.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But I do understand that you are doing your best and. But I think you. Can appreciate how those of us that are here representing a city of 450,000 people, whether it's 1%, half a percent, and I don't necessarily agree that it is, because if I look at the big blue bus in Santa monica, a city of 92,000'",
        "'speaker_10': 'people and 5 to 7000 phone calls are missed monthly if this continues. But it's about 300 calls a day. So it is a lot for us and we do have to respond to our constituents. And I appreciate that you are here in person, but I think providing us updates through the city manager's office will allow us to'",
        "'speaker_10': 'be abundantly honest and transparent with our customers, with our residents. And even if it's not good news, we. We are of the mindset that we want to be able to communicate as much as we can. And that is what we had made very clear during our utility outage some months back.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Even if it's not good news, people want to hear from us. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. And finally, I just have one question to to just follow up on on Vice Mayor Lowenthal, the comments regarding the city of Santa monica. Has the city of Long Beach expressed or been impacted in any way by, by services through, um, frontier negatively?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Councilmember Olson, we've had challenges within our billing system. We're working closely with Frontier right now to obtain some online access to pay our bills electronically. But as for a system standpoint.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We are not impacted for any type of connectivity. It's more of an administrative level. So with the billing issue, deal with Internet.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's telephone. Telephone systems. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Thank you. Finally, I just also like to just think of staff for the report and the work that you're doing on this. I want to thank Frontier for for being here. And your candor is why for standing here and taking the tough questions and representing your company.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Certainly, we are rooting for you to get this right. As a council member, Richardson said, I mean, Sunday nights, we look forward to Game of Thrones. We missed it this week, but I know many of our residents are are certainly inconvenienced by this this transition right now.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We were rooting for you and look forward to a long partnership in the city of Long Beach if these issues are not corrected. I certainly I think we all know that the market will make the necessary corrections as well as the consumers.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so thank you very much for being here.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. See no other council member comment at this time. Killers emotionally sickened members. Please go out and cast your votes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Motion carries.'",

    "Recommendation to request City Manager to explore the feasibility of implementing the Urban Agriculture Incentive Zones Program, and report back to City Council in 60 days.": [
        "'speaker_2': 'Communication from Councilmember Richardson, Councilwoman Gonzalez, Vice Mayor Lowenthal and Council Member Oranga recommendation to request the City Manager to explore the feasibility of implementing the Urban Agriculture Incentive Zones Program and report back to the City Council in 60 days.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilmember Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I'm happy tonight to be requesting this feasibility report in partnership with residents, community organizations in Long Beach Fresh. And I know there's a number of people who have remained and hung out with us tonight for this agenda item.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So thank you so much for your patience. In 2013, California passed the Urban Agriculture Incentive Zones Act. This bill allows cities and counties to give tax breaks to property owners that allow their vacant properties of less than three acres to be used as community gardens or urban farms with a five year commitment.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And just last month, the L.A. County Board of Supervisors voted to implement the program countywide, which allows cities to opt in as well. Urban agriculture provides many benefits to not only those growing food, but those, but also to those cities in which it happens.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'These include education about fresh, healthy foods and the effort that it takes to produce it more vibrant green spaces. There's an ecological benefit for our city. Green gardens and farms help build community. There's also a potential source of modest economic development here in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We've adopted a number of policies and legislation that support urban agriculture, agriculture and healthy eating. In October of 2014, we adopted the Healthy, Healthy, Healthy Communities policy, and one of its objectives under the Healthy Food Access goal is to encourage the use of temporary, vacant and open space for urban agriculture.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'In addition, last year, the City Council voted to improve and ease in the rules governing chickens, goats and bees at residents homes. We are a city that values health, sustainability, community and a strong urban agriculture incentive zone program would help support those values as well.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'This program would allow us to lessen blight and some of our vacant lots in our neighborhoods. And it would also give small scale farms and community gardens a better chance to thrive and would in turn benefit our communities.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I know that we've we have the existence of willing community partners to help implement this policy successfully. And I feel that it would be a benefit to our residents. So I look forward to the finding of this report, which essentially asks for exploring, exploring the feasibility and what all needs to go into implementing a policy and'",
        "'speaker_9': 'encourage. I encourage support from my colleagues. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes. I want to thank Councilmember Richardson and also primarily Vice Mayor Lowenthal. I know she's stuck with this for a long time in urban agriculture. And we finally got something passed last year. And so I want to thank her for all her leadership in this and especially the community members here.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Long Beach, Organic and the lots on seventh and chestnut and eighth and Chestnut. I think I've eaten out of both lots over the few years. It's been incredible to watch these areas flourish in places that people would normally not think of putting a lot and especially putting something that you can grow organic, locally grown food from local'",
        "'speaker_6': 'residents here. So it's I thank you very much for sticking with this. And I think it's a great step in the right direction for the city of Long Beach as we've this is the trajectory that we've we've been on.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And just to look at a report would be great. I'm looking forward to that. And I have a couple questions for city staff. Right, Larry.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We'll have Larry Rich, the manager of our Sustainability Bureau. Answer any of those questions.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. Just a couple of questions. Do we know how many empty private lots exist currently in our city?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Council Member. Mayor and members of the City Council. We don't have a recent count in anticipation of this item. We've started working on that. So within the 60 day time period, we'll be able to report back on that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Because I also see with this, I mean, that, of course, sustainability and urban agriculture, but also just the maintenance of the lots, because I know a lot of the lots that we have are just not maintained by property owners.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And it'd be great to be able to to look into that, which is kind of a larger discussion, but. Okay. And and if we I know we I've worked with Long Beach Organic, I think, in the past and connecting them with property owners.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But that's just been, you know, kind of sidebar situations. But what do we do when there's. Locations that might be foreclosed or when we have to take a little bit more time in finding who the owner is to be able to even let them know that there's this incentive program.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We certainly have a mechanism in place through at least code enforcement to contact property owners. And certainly when there are maintenance issues on properties, code enforcement takes the lead there so we can tap into those avenues to identify and contact property owners.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. All right. Thank you very much. I appreciate this. And I also ask our council colleagues to support. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilmember Ringa.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you. I, too, am looking forward to work, especially when it deals with my area in the West Long Beach. I always describe West Palm Beach as an island where there's only four access points into it and it's virtually a food desert when it comes to the West Palm Beach area.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So I hope that we're able to at least address some of those alternatives for West Palm Beach as well as, of course, other areas, obviously. I mean, that's my my district there. I would have a self in in hoping that we are able to address some issues in the West Palm Beach area.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So I do look forward to seeing the report and also ask for my colleagues endorsement in support of this item.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thanks, Marie Lowenthal.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I wanted to thank the authors for bringing this forward and also for allowing us to keep progressing in this area. And as Councilmember Gonzales said, it's something that I've been working with the community for quite some time, and I want to thank them for their patience.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Nothing that unfortunately it did take quite a while, but I'm very happy with where we are right now. I'm glad to have this item come forward. I know there's a desire in our community for community gardens and EB 511 would help with that, as it suggests.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And we all know the community gardens offer many things. Councilman Gonzalez shared that better access to fresh foods. I like the terminology food, desert. I don't like having that terminology, but I think it's it's quite descriptive of what some of our areas can feel like.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And so access to fresh foods and plants and beautification and positive environmental impacts and a sense of connection and contribution. I think a lot of times we don't highlight the social connectivity that ends up happening when someone even when someone converts their personal front yard into a edible garden and invites people to at least gather and have'",
        "'speaker_10': 'a conversation, and if, if and at times gather and collect things from the garden. So I'm a resident. We're all residents here. I think we enjoy, enjoy. Items like this when we're able to help our community and our residents not only beautify our landscape, but to contribute in some way to wellbeing and health and community well-being and'",
        "'speaker_10': 'health. And farm to table is something that. We had a very long time ago as a way of life before it became kind of posh from a local restaurant standpoint. And so I appreciate going back to that and look forward to seeing where a possible urban agricultural incentive zones program can take us.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I want to thank Mr. Rich, Larry Rich, for his commitment to the issue. I know he's been very patient and diligent as well. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Controversy or not.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. I, too, would like to commend the residents for their patience and stamina and to the vice mayor. She's very modest in saying while she's worked on this, I think Larry Rich is very good with numbers. I've only been on council for a year, but I served for seven years on the Sustainable City Commission.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Mr. Rich, did that come up our first year of existence, maybe 2008, that this first came to our commission, something like that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes. In respect to the chickens, goats and bees aspect of urban agriculture. But of course, the urban agriculture incentive zones was more recent at the sea level.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Right. Same topic, just a little different nuance. So thank you, Mr. Rich. Two for your stamina.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. And can I get any public comment on this right now? Please. Please come forward.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening, mayors, city council members community. My name is Karen Reside and I live at seventh and Pacific at the Park Pacific Tower Senior Building. And I am one of the recipients and gardeners in the community garden on Pacific Avenue in sixth.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I commend you all for advancing the mission of urban gardening for the seniors. I can tell you we have a number of people that have plots in that garden, and those plots are heavily in demand and they're accessible because they're very close to our building for those that have limited, limited mobility.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think our oldest gardener is 85 years old and she's the one that has the amazing papaya tree. And I can tell you, I haven't had to purchase lettuce in two years. And I share my produce with a number of residents in the building that don't have mobility.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It makes a big difference when you're a low income senior. We heard some testimony and people in our building are living on $300 a month. So any little incentive can make a great difference in their health and well-being.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And one thing that nobody mentioned was the produce this organic. And Joe Corso does a wonderful job in managing the gardens for Long Beach Garden, which makes a difference for some people with their health, health issues and the food that comes from an organic garden and natural eggs.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There is no comparison to the taste in the produce which encourages more eating of healthier food. So thank you all for your commitment to this and know that it is making a great impact on the community. And Larry Rich and Suja Lowenthal, thank you for your efforts to make this happen in our community.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening, Mr. Mayor, and esteemed members of the City Council. My name is Sasha Cano, and I am a homeowner in the sixth District and operate farm 59 in the seventh District. I'm here in support of the proposal to conduct a report showing the feasibility impact of AB 551, the urban ag incentive.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I started a front yard produce exchange in 2008 shortly after purchasing our home. It quickly outgrew my porch and landed at the Wrigley Association meetings. The Wrigley Garden was hatched from this and eventually led me to start farm Lot 59.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We need urban agriculture. For me, it's essential. We are in our fifth growing season at the farm and in that time we've produced over 50,000 of organic produce. Unhappy N.A. on what was an illegal dump. We have taught over 150 students in our outdoor classroom in 2015 alone.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We have paid staff that are making a livable wage in the city and are able to farm for a living. We are hardworking and we connect people to where their food comes from. We've built the trend for Long Beach restaurants to be able to purchase truly local produce and use the ingredients in their kitchens.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I believe our culinary scene is thankful for our efforts. The demand is growing and we need more farms to keep up. And I support the next group of farms and farmers and will assist in their success. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'An honorable mayor and city council. I'm Joe Corso. I also live in the sixth District. I'm the garden director for Long Beach Organic, Inc. We're a nonprofit group, and we managed nine community gardens in the city. But of those nine, four of them are on private property.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so tonight, I just wanted to share our successes, the positive experiences we've had developing agricultural products, projects on empty, privately owned lots. For instance, in the Wrigley area, we have a private lot on Pacific Avenue, which was once a haven for drug dealers.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Has been a garden now for 20 to 20 families for seven years. In North Long Beach, we turned an idle industrial quarter acre on South Street into a garden with room for 30 households to participate. Also, chickens, bees.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's a wonderful spot. Also in North Long Beach, the owners of a large property with horse stables have turned over what was once their front lawn for a garden that is used by adult educational groups, a church sponsored kids group and volunteers who grow food for charity.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we also get free horse manure. Finally just up the street on Chestnut at Chestnut Avenue, we have it's a tiny corner lot. It's become a charming neighborhood garden with 22 smaller plots. And so this is it. These gardens are a win, win win situation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'First, it's a win for our members who have a place in the neighborhood to grow healthy food for their tables. And it's also a win for the community. When an empty lot is transformed from a local eyesore into a verdant garden, it becomes a neighborhood focal point.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And whether neighbors are directly involved or not, they enjoy seeing things grow. Where once there was an empty lot. And finally, it's a win for the property owner because many folks have vacant properties that for one reason or another, they're not ready to sell or they're not ready to build on.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And owning such property can be a real headache. So trash, sofas, vagrancy, drugs, these are all the things that empty lots of tract. When we turn such a property into a community garden, that headache is relieved. Even though we lease these properties for only $1 a year, the owner no longer has the worry and expense of maintaining'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the property. Still, it's a rare property owner who's willing to turn their land over to gardeners and farmers. We've contacted dozens over the years and gotten only after a tax incentive could be the deciding factor for someone considering such a use for their land.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that could lead to more winning projects in the city. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Counsel I'm sorry. Speaker I saw you cued up. I'm sorry about that, please.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. Good evening, honorable mayor, esteemed council. My name is Demetrius Zeigler. I'm a resident of the eighth District and I am with my partner, Kelly Johnson, the co-owner of a local small farm in town called Long Beach Farms.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And we're a little bit newer in town. We've been in operation about a year and a half, and we owe a ton of debt of gratitude to the folks that will speak after me and some of the folks that have come before me.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But I will say that I feel like I represent with Kelly Johnson the kind of the new face of urban agriculture. We are both passionately committed.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'To the principles.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Of sustainability, of feeding our community and addressing a lot of the health, environmental and, let's say, social concerns that urban agriculture can can benefit. I thought I might just share a couple of quick anecdotes about my business and what I see with this movement.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Long Beach has been slowly progressing along this tract of promoting urban ag in our city, and I think that this city really could become a progressive leader in the entire region as we continue down this path. So I urge you to keep keep discussing and keep pushing this forward quickly.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We've been in business about a year and a half. I have a decentralized approach to farming, which means we don't have a big plot of land on which we can have the typical road crops and farm animals as such.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I have in effect in North Long Beach, about six or seven smaller parcels that we've aggregated to grow food for the people that invest with us and help us grow. The biggest hurdle to our growth has been the availability of land so far.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That will continue to be a hurdle for us and other urban farmers that come into this city. But 8551 in other measures that you're considering will help promote or help promote a connection between the farmer and the land.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I think this is something that should be carefully studied. The other quick anecdote that I would anecdote I'd like to share is I have a single dad. I have a six year old who couldn't quite make it through the earlier consent items.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But she's taken to field trips so far this year as a kindergarten kindergartner at Kettering Elementary. The first was to Tanaka Farms down in Orange County, where they spent a farm day. The second was to the other strawberry farm down in Orange County, where they spent a day harvesting strawberries.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That should happen in Long Beach. Our children and our students should be able to drive down the street or be bused down the street here in our community to learn these great things and and provide a farm based learning opportunity for those kids.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So among other things, these are these are positive benefits that may be five, five, one, and this discussion can promote. So thank you and I.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Appreciate your time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, honorable.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Mayor and esteemed Council. My name is Michelle Engleman Burns. I am a happy resident of the.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Ninth district and.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Really appreciate so much. I follow recs and participatory budgeting and all of our good stuff that's happening up there.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We moved here three years ago.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We bought a house in North Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Moved from Houston, Texas. And I can tell you that I love the city. I love the city in mayor. I'm just amazed at the things that, you know, the engine that's happening. I'm really proud of the city.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We love that you love the city.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I really am. I'm kind of a cheerleader. So we moved here to be grandparents. Our children started having children. And that's you know, we were fortunate.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Enough to be able to do that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So the thing that I need to say to you is I just appreciate the fact that this is something that has taken a.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'While because this is something that was natural for me in Houston and this is what we did in the community. I can't tell you how much it pulls together the community and from the social.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Aspect, but also from the, you know, the elder residents. And there's just so much that it does for the city. And I really just want.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'To tell you from my.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Heart how much.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I appreciate all of you and.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'What you do for our city, but specifically for this particular.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Ordinance. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Please. Hello? Yeah, my name is Ryan Serrano. I live in the first District 81 Chestnut Avenue. I was the founder of an organization called Food Scape Long Beach. And I own a business called Earth Steward Ecology. I work as an ecological consultant and landscape developer.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I specialize in California native habitat and food production systems. I wanted to kind of come from the place of not maybe rationalizing the economic reasons for for supporting this kind of development, even though I think it's really clear when you look at that part of it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I want to maybe just come from the place of being a person that looks at an empty space. And I don't speculate how large of a structure can be built there or how much money, how much financial energy can be mined from that space, but rather what living finance capital, what living capital, what spiritual capital and social'",
        "'speaker_4': 'capital can be yielded from that space for future generations and what can be regenerated over time to be something more meaningful and more more real than than all of this infrastructure, which is, you know, decaying as we speak and has to be rebuilt and and is expensive and, you know, all those things.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think that anything that supports urban agriculture is also supporting future generations. I feel like it's it's. Especially clear that it's needed as we transition both economically and in terms of fossil resources that are left in the world, that we need to be producing more of our food rather than importing it from the Central Valley or where'",
        "'speaker_4': 'have you, where it lacks, among other things, nutrition, nutritional density. It lacks integrity as far as being unadulterated by chemicals that are not foods. And and it also separates people from understanding and having a sense of literacy about what they're eating.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Young people grow up in the world eating animals and plants that they couldn't identify if they saw them in real life. And that's a reality in the city. And it's it's a shame that people here are inept to that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I think it's important that people have access to opportunities to grow food. I think it's an inalienable human right. I think access to food on its own should be considered an inalienable human right along with water, along with shelter, along with all those good things.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I think that. Beyond all of that, people should have access to meaningful vocations that feed their identity more than deplete it like a lot of city life entails. I think that the work that and and the economic and food energy that can come out of supporting this kind of development.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'On a policy level is important for the future.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening, Mayor Garcia, Vice Mayor Lowenthal and members of City Council. My name is Tony D'Amico. I'm a resident of the third district. I am the co-director of Long Beach Fresh. We're the local Food Policy Council. I'm also an executive committee member of the Long Beach Alliance for Food and Fitness and a participant in the Building Healthy'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Communities Initiative and the Kaiser Heal Zone in District nine. So I owe a lot of thanks to Councilmember Richardson for being eager to pounce on this opportunity to move urban agriculture forward and huge thanks to council members around Gonzales and Lowenthal for signing on.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So with the projects I work with, I think together those four projects have convened many residents, institutional stakeholders and dozens of local food systems leaders to identify policy priorities toward public health. And 8551 is one of them. So tonight, I support tonight's proposal for a study.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I got involved in urban agriculture, growing some vegetables in a shared space as a renter in 2010, while learning about permaculture and food justice from local advocates like Ryan, who you just heard from. And it was amazing to me to learn how much the urban environment, again, as Ryan was saying, has separated us from real food, from'",
        "'speaker_4': 'nature and from one another. Even more interesting to me was the discovery that our city's diverse communities have a rich history of growing their own food for themselves, for their communities, and as a way to make ends meet.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I've since come to believe that in order to be food secure and sustainable as a city, we need to protect the right to grow and also create more opportunities both for community gardens and urban farms. While we do have a community garden policy as a city to establish community gardens in parks over five acres, that policy has'",
        "'speaker_4': 'been slow to actually be utilized. And I think it's because there are a lot of barriers to growing on public land. So I think that this proposal actually opens up more possibilities for private spaces as well, and that both policies together could really help us quite a bit.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And in my experience, like right now, I live near there's a very a junction community garden which is one of our largest and of course has a long waiting list. And other community gardens that are near me also are full.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So while we have at least 14 community gardens in Long Beach, there's still very high demand and there's also only four small urban farms. We could certainly benefit from more opportunities to buy local produce for those who don't necessarily have the interest or the time and resources to garden themselves.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So as our city continues to focus on development through high tech innovation, density and mobility, let's be sure to create space and incentives for healthy food production, create opportunities to restore our soil, and in turn, empower residents to take control of their health.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Excellent. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Good evening, everyone. My name is Rodney. Laura Sam. I was very excited when I saw the item agenda today and I'm very proud of my city. I started in this community as a homeless ten year old kid in the sixth District.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I had PTSD trauma. I had nightmares of my mother was being too near death and suffering from the PTSD, from the genocide of the Khmer Rouge. I was too young, too poor to uneducated to ask the right questions to get the right help.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I never had any traditional help for my psychology things that I needed. But I did discover urban gardening as a form of healing. So living in crowded apartments, even though my neighbors would grow vegetables in containers, it helped me in so many ways.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I use urban gardening as a form of healing that I graduate from poly high school with a 4.0 GPA. I went to UC Riverside and graduate with a bachelor's degrees in biochemistry. And this is the first time I'm speaking at my voice.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I'm speaking from a standpoint of voice of a property owner in the fourth district and sixth district. A business owner in a fourth district. A resident in the third District and the sixth District and a founder and a director of a nonprofit called the May Center.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'May is an acronym. It uses meditation, urban agriculture, yoga and education to help people with trauma promote their own self healing and live a fulfilling life. And I want to congratulate my city because it has done an amazing job.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I want to thank Congress or Council member Allen Austin for electing the ME Center as the champion winner, using gardening as a form of healing. We did a documentary, over 50,000 views on Facebook viewed in France, Canada, Cambodia and the states.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The main center has been a site studied by Harvard Program in refugee trauma. UCI. UCLA. Cal State. Long Beach. Cal State. Dominguez Hills. And currently. We are working with survivors. For them to use gardening to heal themselves. And not only that, but earn an income.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The Long Beach Community Foundation and the City of Long Beach is currently working on a $10 million grant, put the first farmers market in central Long Beach, and the survivors were able to sell their produce at the first farmers market.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I see that the vacant lot is a community health issue.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Good to wrap it up. Good time's up. But please continue. Please wrap it up. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. It is a neglect of this community, of the city and by the community and by the city by supporting.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, sir. I'm so sorry time that I have to keep 3 minutes to every speaker, so.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you for supporting this. You were giving your community a chance to transform blighted lots into healing lots.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Thank you so much. Wonderful story. I have a couple more council speakers. I just want a couple comments. Well, first, I want to thank all the the farmers and the advocates that came out. I think you guys have been so active in this movement, been leading the movement.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's amazing to see how we've grown in the urban farming movement and just the farming movement and the healthy food community that's that's developed in Long Beach. It's always been here, but it's it's I feel it's more vocal and more visible than it's ever been, which is which is really great.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And you see it from a lot of the organizations, a lot of the represented here tonight. I just want to make sure, Mr. West, as we move forward, I know it's pretty clear, looking at the agenda item tonight, looking at the urban agriculture ordinance that was passed that Vice Mayor Lowenthal and others brought forward in the past'",
        "'speaker_1': ', that the council as a as a body is very committed to urban farming and urban ag. I mean, there's no question. And so I think as we move forward and we look for other opportunities and we talk and we look at at Park Development and the L.A. River Restoration and the Drake Chavez connection and all these other'",
        "'speaker_1': 'open space Terminal Island Freeway possible decommissioning. When we look at all of those possibilities, let's make sure that we're always considering and advocating for the urban agriculture community. And they were advocating for this. It's really developing in a lot of progressive cities, and I'm really hopeful that we kind of take that to heart, because I think you've'",
        "'speaker_1': 'heard loud and clear from the council that everyone is supportive and interested in this. And so I think it's important for us with our new Parks and Recreation director on board, that this be a part of our park planning in the future as well as as we move forward.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes, sir. Okay. Thank you. Councilman Mongeau.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I am very fortunate to have had a increase in allergies that brought me to the farming community. I learned a lot about local honey and then now I'm a community gardener. And as a young person whose grandparents are from the Midwest, I was raised on meat and potatoes and really the only vegetables I knew were corn and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'peas. And so as an adult and had the great opportunity to try new vegetables and now grow vegetables and learn about the different strains and the recessive tomatoes. And I'm looking forward to an exciting season. And I really hope that people who are watching at home consider looking into a community garden nearby, because while there are a'",
        "'speaker_2': 'shortage of community gardens, I know that many of them continue to pop up as our population gets older and they start consolidating farmers onto single plots because one garden can harvest for multiple families. It's been remarkable. So thank you for all you do.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you for continuing to share the good news of bee rescue, because we are we do have a bee shortage. And every time people post online, I see many of you posting back, no, don't call an exterminator, please call the beekeepers.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So thank you for all that you do in keeping it possible to have urban AG. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Councilmember Austin Thank you very much. I just want to applaud the the advocates for being here and I want to thank Councilmember Richardson for bringing us this very this feel good item to the council this evening. It makes us feel good to to be progressive and to to move in advance and to be creative with with policy'",
        "'speaker_3': '. And, you know, it's no secret it took me a little while to get there. I mean, I wasn't there all along, but I have had the great privilege of having the growing experience in my district and spending a lot of time volunteering there and supporting the efforts of that seven acre urban farm.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I want to challenge each and every one of my colleagues to come out there and volunteer a couple of hours of the growing experience as well, because it's a great, great opportunity and it will really, really be an enriching process for for each and every one of you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I want to thank Demetrius and Kelly Johnson specifically for her constant advocacy. I mean, she's been a leader in the farming community, the urban farming community for for many years and is a dear friend of mine. We can't lose sight of the fact that Long Beach is an urban city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And with that. We need to balance our opportunities, opportunities with economic development, opportunities with housing and building sustainability. And so I am going to be happily supporting this item because I think this is this is forward thinking and I want to offer my support to the farming community to encourage private property owners.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'As a partner of yours moving forward, particularly if with any properties in my district that you identify. You can count on my support. So thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor Lowenthal.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you. At the risk of admitting how much I think of urban agriculture, I want to share, at least with my council colleagues, that there is a 2007 film, British film called Grow Your Own, and it's incredible. It talks about the social connectivity and well-being that's created when communities come together.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And if you haven't seen it, I do recommend it, although we're not here to give movie reviews, but it's it highlights things that we don't think about. We as I said earlier, we talk about the food, we talk about affordability.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And and that is all very, very, very good in terms of our objectives. We talk about teaching our children, and I'm glad we got that one to bed, teaching our children about the origin of their food. But the things that we don't often talk about are hard to place.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And our young speaker that came to us and shared that she was homeless at age ten and had been able to heal. You just reminded me that there is that healing power of tending to a piece of the earth that you can call your own.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And then there's a book called The Earth Knows Your Name. So all these good things. But I do want to share with you that that that is a fascinating film. And if we really want to be proud of what we're doing, I think what we can do is see our community down the road really heal in ways'",
        "'speaker_10': 'that we wouldn't have been able to have been a part of otherwise. They're quiet, but magical ways. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. And Councilman Andrew.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes, thank you very much. I just want to, you know, apply to Councilman Richardson and the other council individuals who brought this to the diocese, because the fact that I know that, you know, we talk about the salt of the earth, what he does for an individual.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I think the young lady who gave us, you know, I mean, just a such a saddening story, but what came out of it was just such a, you know, enjoyment of healing. And I just I'm sure that you'll notice that we are going to do the night market.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I sure hope that you'll really spirit a lot of that, because this is going to happen off a lot of people. And I want to thank you again for being so instrumental in a lot of things we were talking about and over agriculture.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you again very much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Okay. With that, we have a motion in a second. Members, please go ahead and cast your vote.'",

What we did was we started to get a lot of concerns from residents letters to our office regarding this issue.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So Belmont Heights resident and I actually wrote a letter in the grunion and asked the community what they thought about leaf blowers and whether they thought we needed to have some regulations on leaf blowers in general, but also maybe modifying our leaf blower, having a leaf blower policy that allows for certain types of leaf blowers so that'",
        "'speaker_6': 'we could minimize the detrimental impacts to the environment. So John Cisco from the Belmont Heights Community Association was the resident who coauthored the article with me. And as a result of the article, we received numerous letters and correspondence directly to our office, but also in the local paper regarding the issue.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Many people are supportive of either banning them entirely or thinking about an alternative that allows leaf blowers to be used but has battery operated, not gas powered leaf blowers that could be quieter and less detrimental to the environment.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we wanted to have our. Board of Health and Human Services. Take a look at this issue and analyze the impacts and the possible options that would be available to the city of Long Beach. Looking at what some of the other cities have done, several cities have actually banned them entirely.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Others have allowed for modified the use of certain leaf blowers, modified leaf blowers to be used. And we want the board to come back with an analysis for council and give us some recommendations and options in terms of what we could do to better the noise and health impacts of leaf blowers in our community.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I'd ask my colleagues to support this. Again, we're not voting tonight to ban leaf blowers. We're just asking the board to evaluate the impacts of leaf blowers and make recommendations to council in regards to what some options might be for us.'",

        "'speaker_10': 'Ten years ago, approximately ten years ago, we adjusted our noise ordinance, which included tweaking the hours of operation for leaf blowers, which ended up being a win for residents because it gave us a reprieve from early morning leaf blowing noise, especially on the weekends.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And as our city evolves and we continue to live closer and closer to each other, and we continue to want to raise our standards on how our world and environment we live in should be treated. We do have to take careful review, as Councilwoman Price mentioned, these issues and issues that impact our quality of life.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I think it's timely. So I appreciate that you brought this forward. I look forward to the report coming back. And as the councilwoman mentioned, I'm hopeful that we're looking at alternatives and incentives. Years ago.'",

It's very important to be sure that folks remain as whole as possible in any process that we look to to improve our public policy.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Now, Councilmember Ringo.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you, Mayor. The one concern that I have with this issue is that I don't think there's a over expanding study that's going to include what would be the economic impacts on the leaf blower or gardeners trade. I don't get the grunion in my in my area.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So my neighborhoods that don't necessarily have access to that type of information or access to weigh in on this issue. The cities that were mentioned there. Yeah, I have no comment on that. They're not they're not my communities.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But I am concerned about the effect that it would have economically on the businesses that provide our gardening gardening services to throughout the city, not only in the second, third and fifth, but also in the sixth, seventh and eighth and ninth in terms of what they do.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So I would want I'm not I'm not saying I would oppose this. I'm saying that if we're going to do a study that's being comprehensive as possible, they include the economic impact that this would have if we were to have complete ban or the economic impact it would have if we were to require our gardening services people'",
        "'speaker_11': 'to switch from a gas power to an electric power or any other alternative power and power manpower that breaks into doing this kind of service. So I would want staff to also include that. As far as that, what would be the economic impact of switching the leaf blower capability of people?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. I see no other public or. I'm sorry. Let me get a public comment. Any public comment? Please come forward.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hello again. Ryan Serrano, first district. Um, I mentioned that I own a business called Earth Store Technology, one of the services that we provide as ecological landscape maintenance services. But we only do really like fine gardening maintenance, so we don't do any mowing below service.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We only actually take care of food, productive spaces or native habitats. And but what I can say is that my father, I grew up doing landscaping work at my father, and that's where my background is. And he had a mambo service and he still has it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And what I can say about that industry overall is that it's highly polluting and highly exploitative of of and underpaying workers. And the noise pollution is a major issue. But I would also speak to the air pollution which all of those gas powered machines have no have no emissions regulation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So they don't have a catalytic converter like a like an automobile does. So to give you an idea, the carbon emissions of a of a mower blower operating for one hour is equivalent to driving most cars 300 miles.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And. In addition to that, for people who are doing alternative, who do have some sort of alternative gardening, especially something that's drought tolerant, like a native landscape, the mowers and blowers are actually propagating weeds and actually creating an expense for these for these alternative gardeners that are actually otherwise doing something that's good economically.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I think that that's important. Also speaking to the economics of of workers and and the people who do those jobs now, I think it would create more jobs. When you take away those machines and start recognizing that labor, you would actually increase the number of people who are paid to do skilled work and increase the number'",
        "'speaker_4': 'of people who are doing things like raking and and pushing brooms. You could actually employ more people and I think you would also see more self-employment versus people working for big companies that, again, exploit people who are willing to compete for low wages.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And this is coming from the son of of a mexican immigrant who watched who watched him grow up in the world doing that and also who is employed people in that position. My company has been paying a minimum wage of $15 an hour for the last two years.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I'm light years ahead of 2020 doing work that involves no polluting machines.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening again. In control. And this is not a new issue. I don't see anybody left. Up here that remembers about 20 years ago. Diana man. Waged war against the leaf blowers and a number of us came down and raked leaves out here on the lawn in Lincoln Park while the gardeners used the leaf blowers.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we found out that. It took just about the same amount of time to get the leaves off the grass. However, the gardeners were very much opposed to this, as you were saying. They were afraid that they would be losing their employment.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Now, 20 years later, well, actually, it was about 11 years ago that I hired one of those gardeners that was opposing the leaf blowers with the provision that he use, rakes and broom and. He was hesitant at first, but now he uses rake and broom for all of his jobs.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'He has found that it's cheaper because he doesn't have to buy the gasoline and it's better for his health and a better for his hearing. And he's a complete convert. I did pay him a little more each month to do this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If you do decide or even if you don't decide to ban the leaf blowers, I think you can start in the city parks with Azteca. They stand out there with their leaf blowers blowing leaves off the park grass, which is totally and needed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And along the medians they're blowing leaves off the part of the grass. And this is wasting a lot of money and time and polluting the air. And so if nothing else comes out of this, I hope that you will.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The next time that you. Contract with as tecca that you make sure that they don't have they don't use their leaf blowers anymore. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. See no other public comment. I'll go back to the council. Councilman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I want to kind of add to Councilmember Ortega's comments. If we could also explore some of the options. I know within my neighborhood we have a couple of gardeners. I live in the same neighborhood as an Cantrell, and we have a couple of gardeners who are in the neighborhood multiple days a week.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And they actually would prefer if all of their clients would all align to the same day of the week, because then they wouldn't have to come back so many times. And the same is true of some of our poor men, and they've actually spoken to me a few times and they said.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'What do I say to your neighbor to convince them that everybody else gets their lawn done on Thursday, but they want their lawn done on Monday? Well. A lot of it has to do with what day the trash is picked up and what day the street sweeper is and things like that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so one might also consider if we consolidated the days in a community when the leaf blowers and lawn mowers were available, because that would actually help from an economic standpoint, the gardeners that have really strong roots that perhaps they would align better and then they'd be feeding the gas to and from each neighborhood and getting more'",
        "'speaker_2': 'houses on the same street. So I want to be pro-business and ensure that they are helped, but also be conscious of the quality of life of our neighbors. And that could be a neat compromise to consider in the report.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilman Price.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. I appreciate the comments from my colleagues. What I would like to do is recommend that we move forward with the study first and let's see what the study says and what the alternatives are. And then we can ask for an economic analysis of the alternatives, because I don't know that the Board of Health and Human'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Services is in a position to do an economic analysis. I think they're just going to talk about environmental impacts and pollution. And to Councilman, your Angus comments, you know, we are all very respectful of one another and I think we all do our very best job when we draft agenda items to be to try to give our'",
        "'speaker_6': 'colleagues data, but to reference the cities that were listed in our agenda item and somehow, you know, imply that those cities have nothing in common with, you know, a particular constituency, I think really defeats the point of the article.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I say that with all due respect, the the article that was written and it's available online and the agenda item that went along with it really are designed to talk about the impacts of the pollution, which impacts kids regardless of what district they live in.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They impact adults, seniors, they impact people. It's not a district based thing. So the pollution issues and the noise pollution and the health environment, the that there's numerous studies available online that weren't included in our agenda item talking about the damaging effects to health and to asthma and to breathing as a result of the dust that's collected'",
        "'speaker_6': 'are that flows in the air as a result of leaf blowers. All leaf blowers do is they move debris from one location to another that that's all they do. And in the process, they blow the debris into the air.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So that is why it's a negative impact on anyone that lives in the area. It's not a district thing. And the cities that were listed on the agenda are listed on the agenda because they happen to be cities that have very successful models.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But again, there's a lot of research out there on it. And I would like just to find out, like Vice Mayor Lowenthal said, there's possibly some incentive programs that could help people switch out the equipment that they have and get equipment that's not having a polluting impact on the environment.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And the city can possibly be in a position to help incentivize that change over time so that as they get ready to to change out their equipment, there's an incentive the city can provide that gives them a non gas operated leaf blower.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So if council will indulge me, I think it would be simpler for this study to have the Board of Health and Human Services do an environmental impact because a report that's the that's the scope of their expertize. And then if it comes back and we want to go further than we can request an economic evaluation, and that'",
        "'speaker_6': 'would probably be a different city department that would handle that analysis. So that would be my recommendation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Councilmember Ranga.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I appreciate the councilmember for a second district's comments. My my comments were not targeted towards any negativity towards those other cities, obviously. But when we compare Long Beach to other cities, we don't compare ourselves to those cities right there to that.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I just want to clarify that very quickly right now. And whether they have successful models or not, that's fine. My comments were more directed in terms of I'm not saying let's proceed with a study. However, we need to include an economic analysis as to what's going to take place.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I think that doing a study first and then going back and doing an economic study, doing a piecemeal, we should just do it all at once. I don't want to waste. Let me let me rephrase it. I would like to have staff pursue it in a more efficient manner by looking at the big picture as it's all'",
        "'speaker_11': 'inclusive, as opposed to bringing one aspect of it first and then going back and readjust analysis that needs to take place again to do it, to go back again, that those are the types of studies that I really don't like.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I mean, I've we've gone through this before with other studies that we've had where I was basically opposed to the studies because any time there's there's staff time involved, it there is a cost impact to that staff's time to do that.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And if we have one, the deals just with environmental and if we come back and deal with the economic, that's twice the work. So maybe it's a question for the city manager in terms of being able to consolidate or being able to have a two pronged type of study that would address all those issues and in one'",
        "'speaker_11': 'report. As opposed to doing it one against the other of city manager. I guess it be a question for you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Mayor Councilmembers Honestly.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We're here to take direction from the City Council on.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Where the council likes to go. I think it I'm looking at what Councilmember Price said, probably the Health and Human Services Department, I mean, commission is not the vehicle to look at the economic impact.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But we're not bringing up the economic impacts of it as well as what would that what would it mean for vendors who might be required because of the study? And, you know, I agree with with with the overall impact of what leaf blowers have, you know, gas and all that.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I mean, I agree with that. I'm not opposed to that. But there is going to be an economic effect. Should we move in one direction or another? So I'd like to know what what that is going to be, if at all.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If time is not of the essence, I see no reason why we.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Can't do to dependent.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Studies. We would do one with the Health Department Health Commission, come back to.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The Council of the Council. So wish they.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Could direct it to staff for one of our economic development commissions to then review that piece to come.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Back to the Council for a final decision. Okay. So you're saying that you want to do part A before going to part B? I think that it's up to the city council. It's up to you. Well, that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Would be great. As long as as long as there's no hurry to do this immediately.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And there was a need to. Well, 90 days was.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think it's a go to the Board of Health and Human Services and at that point they would come back within. What is the days? Within six months. Is that.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It? Six months?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yep.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. We think you can work with that. Great. So we have a motion in a second to go to have board Health Human Services come back in six months. Councilwoman Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Not to complicate things, but I was just suggesting because, you know, we're hearing so much out there, but I think getting the report back first would be great to be able to understand the the environmental impacts. But is it possible as well to have staff come back with just some, uh, some type of incentive programs that'",
        "'speaker_6': 'could be available to these businesses just so we can get a preliminary idea of what is out there. And then if we do need to come back, go, you know, come back and then go back to the Economic Development Committee.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Then we do that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Absolutely. That's we could be checking with HMD on that at on a parallel course. And then with that information, we could then do another look see at this if desired by the council.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. And perhaps that comes back just in a two from four, unless the council wants an anything additional with that.'",
