    "Recommendation to receive and file a report from City Manager on the status of the citywide coordinated effort around the prevention and enforcement of illegal fireworks in Long Beach before and after the 4th of July holiday.": [
        "'speaker_2': 'Communication.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Excuse. Excuse me. Was was item eight pulled?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It was not.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Was not. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Communication from Councilmember Richardson, Councilman Price, Councilmember Odinga and Councilmember Austin recommendation to receive and file a report on the prevention and enforcement of illegal fireworks in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Council Member Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor. We're about six weeks out from the 4th of July. And as we know, the amount of illegal fireworks in our neighborhoods seem to be at record levels last year. I know that many of our council offices and the mayor's offices received complaints from social media and through our offices.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I know that there have been a number of measures taken by a number of us, both council members and city departments. So my hope is that we we receive an update tonight and also have a better understanding on what our proactive approach will be heading into the 4th of July and any changes or updates that we might'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that might be taking place this year that we can help to educate or make aware to our our our constituents. So at that, at this point, I'd like to just hear from hear from city staff.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Can yes. Vice mayor council members will have a report representing the police department in the fire department, representing the fire department as our lifeguard chief, Gonzalo Medina. Representing the police department is Deputy Chief Rich Rocky. And they'll follow off a report that was sent to the city council later on this later this afternoon.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So rich or Gonzalo? Good evening, Vice Mayor. Council members. Good evening, Vice, by our council members. As in previous years, the fire department will coordinate with, coordinate public service announcements, press releases, and utilize the distribution of educational materials, communicating that all fireworks are dangerous and illegal in the city of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This message will be communicated through a variety of media, including social media, television, electronic signage and the posting of fliers, banners and posters in the highly visible locations. Educational information will also be shared and distributed in Long Beach schools, and our CERT team or Community Emergency Response Team made up of volunteers will help distribute this information as'",
        "'speaker_4': 'well. Relating to that, all fireworks are legal in Long Beach. Additionally, this year, the fire department will speak at community meetings and events such as concerts in the park about the illegality and the dangers of fireworks. The fire department will have its full staff of four arson investigators out through July 2nd and fourth in tandem with our'",
        "'speaker_4': 'police department and. And I'm open for questions, sir.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. So just one quick question and then I want to hear from our colleagues, because I know there's significant interest and I know that a number of council members have let me know that they're already doing work on this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So, number one, I'd like to have a better understanding on what our fine structure is and whether we we've actually handed out fines in recent years and whether we plan to, you know, educate people on what that fine what that what that fine structure is moving forward.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That would be my only question at this point then. And then I'm finished.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Honorable Vice Mayor, members of city council. Yes. So the fine structure is something that is capped and it's capped at $1,000. And that is something that is governed by the California government code and cannot be changed by local government.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'As far as our citations, we do write citations each year for the use illegal use of fireworks, both illegal fireworks and safe and sane fireworks. And last year, in 2015, although these numbers may not seem like they're a lot, they seem quite low.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We wrote 50 citations during the 4th of July holiday season with six arrests, so a total of 56 the year prior in 2014. Those citations were 65, with four arrests for a total of 49. And then in 2013 was our lowest out of the three years, with seven arrests, 42 citations, and with a total of 49.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I would like to point out that in addition to the sites that are written, the police and fire department last year collectively confiscated 650 of illegal fireworks and 60 of safe and sane fireworks. So that is something that we do work together collectively to continue to impact our illegal fireworks within the city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Don't remember your anger.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mayor. I want to thank Councilmember Richardson for bringing this forward. Every year it seems that we're getting worse and worse. It's like sounds like a war zone out there. I represent to the west now each area and it seems like the West Palm Beach area gets the has a high incidence of these types of activities'",
        "'speaker_6': '. One of the questions that I have is and it's my understanding that the police department might be called out to a site where activity is taking place. But once they get there, the perpetrators are either move away or go inside or remove themselves from that activity.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And and the police department is held with with not being able to do anything because they didn't see anything. Is is there any kind of additional rule or ordinance, law, whatever that can that can be held against these individuals, even though they might not be caught in the act?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But there might be evidence that fireworks activity was taking place that would serve enough as evidence to confiscate the fireworks or to give a citation.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Councilmember Younger. Yes. As far as enforcing the laws, you are correct. It's very difficult for us to identify and end up citing those who do light off illegal fireworks, because the law requires that our officers witness the person who is actually lighting the firework and then being able to cite that person if they don't run from us'",
        "'speaker_8': 'prior to us being able to detain them. Most of these occur at night, again and in groups again, making it difficult for for officers. However, witnesses who do see people lighting off fireworks and want to be involved can call the police and can identify those who are lighting off that firework and place them under a private person's'",
        "'speaker_8': 'arrest. They would be required to fill out that private person's arrest form, and then we could cite that person who lit up that firework if they are still there when when the police arrive. And we could give them a cite based off the private person arrest form and the observations of the citizen.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Anything short of that? It's very difficult for us to do any enforcement action unless someone wants to be involved and be that witness.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'With these forms, be something that can be acquired ahead of time. Or can a citizen fill it out right at that right at that point with an officer present at that point right there. What's what what would be the procedure on doing such a such an activity?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Councilman, during a we do keep those forms with our police officers. There is a process with that form that our officer does have to read the person and admonition and then they sign that private person's arrest form. But all our officers in the field do have that form with them and will present them to the citizen at'",
        "'speaker_8': 'the time they contact them for that private person's arrest form if they so choose to do that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilwoman Pryce.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you very much. I want to thank Councilman Richardson for bringing this important discussion forward. We all know, and as he stated, that the 4th of July holiday is is right around the corner. And we need to have a good functioning coordination among our multiple departments if we're going to have any sort of impact on the use'",
        "'speaker_5': 'of illegal fireworks. After numerous complaints to the city and council offices as well as the mayor's office. Last year, the Public Safety Committee actually took this item up for discussion and requested that the fireworks steering committee reconvene. In past years, the city led an effort to inform the public on the dangers of fireworks and fire that and'",
        "'speaker_5': 'informing them that fireworks are illegal in the city of Long Beach. Fireworks Steering Committee met on a regular basis beginning in the month of March through the 4th of July holiday, in an effort to be proactive with fireworks, education and enforcement.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'A number of city departments participated in the committee, including City Council, Harbor, Public Works, Fire Police and Special Events and filming. The committee was responsible for such tasks as creating public service announcements and videos, press releases, distributing multilingual fliers, posting banners and signs, electronic messages, public education in schools, and notifying block party permit holders that fireworks are'",
        "'speaker_5': 'illegal. This year, the fireworks steering committee held its first meeting on April 20th, which my office participated in. It is my understanding that Fire and Police Department are working on a list of proactive measures that we can take.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We've discussed some of those tonight to curb the use of illegal fireworks in the city. There is going to be a cost associated with this. And I don't know if either of the representatives are in a position to give us an estimate of what that cost will be.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But I know that last year the outreach efforts were funded at a much lower level than prior years. So I want to make sure that we're not setting up our police and fire departments to fail by asking them to do public outreach without giving them the resources that they need to do it right.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It was a significant issue last year. It always is. But it seemed that last year as as Councilman Turanga said, it's it's almost like a war zone. And that's the reports we heard from a lot of people because of the the volume and the magnitude of the fireworks that were being being used.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So if you have any information about the budget, what you think it might require of you, and then perhaps the city manager can let us know whether there's any sort of funding source available for this, since this is a one time expenditure that, you know, we want to be able to fund it an accurate, adequate level.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Councilwoman Pryce We do not have a funding number yet. We are in the process of putting together our operational plan for this year's firework strategies, and I'll talk a little bit about what those are, since that was one of the questions in your comment.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And the police department is in the planning process, the fireworks enforcement for this year, beginning in early June. Some of our strategies include uniformed and plainclothes officers working in the areas of high complaints and activity impacting the supply chain.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'As we discover illegal sales of fireworks in our city and surrounding areas, participation of the city's firework committee to coordinate a joint education campaign which fire alluded to notifying our community of the dangers of fireworks and the enforcement of those who break the law.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And within the next few weeks, our city team will push out a city police department and fire department. Joint media release use of social media to get the word out, distribution of informational information to our businesses, association stakeholders, etc. So this is truly a collaborative effort on the police and fire side for the enforcement and the city'",
        "'speaker_8': 'family for the education piece.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'May I make one recommendation that's relatively low in cost and I think it can have a huge impact. And that would be working with Long Beach Unified School District to get a flier in every middle school and high schoolers backpack meet, citing the fact that it's illegal and enumerating the penalties that are associated with a violation and'",
        "'speaker_5': 'then asking the superintendent if Long Beach Unified will do a robocall about it to all the parents and also send out an email blast in advance of the 4th of July holiday. I think that if children are advised that this conduct is illegal, hopefully they will remind their parents who are tempted to violate the law.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And if if nothing else, the parents, knowing that the children are advised that this is illegal, might curb their behavior and that that may have a little bit of an impact in terms of outreach. We have a lot of youth who do not know that fireworks are illegal in Long Beach because some nearby cities allow fireworks.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And a lot of those, those high school students are reaching adult age soon and probably experimenting with some of these entertainment options on the 4th of July. So that that would be a very low cost, I think, outreach measure.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes. We'll include that in our outreach strategy.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. Thank you for the report. Our side of town is unusually high impact as we border one of those wonderful cities who puts firework stands literally facing the city of Long Beach, asking our residents to be wooed in to purchase fireworks from their nonprofits.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So when you say highly visible, will there be a concentration of these on the border? So as people are leaving our city to go buy these fireworks and spend their money in another city that they will see said materials, and then as crossing back into our city again, realize that they are not only illegal, but dangerous especially'",
        "'speaker_2': '. I know that Councilman Price and I both experienced high volumes of drilled piccolo pits, which do sound like bombs and shoot into the air and perhaps again surrounding the unincorporated area as people go from unincorporated to the city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Because I know there's some challenges in that. Literally one house is legal to do a firework and the next house on the same street in my office adjacent to my district is illegal, so I'm highly visible. I would hope that we do a lot of border and unincorporated adjacent signage, and if there's help that's needed in that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'area, my office would be thrilled to send out interns to place them on posts as if they are lost cat signs wherever we can.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Mongo. And I just wanted to add from the second district standpoint, it is probably the greatest number of calls that we've received this past year. You've heard this from other council members, so I'm not sure what exactly is different from all the other years, but I share the concerns that each of the council members'",
        "'speaker_0': 'who've spoken have shared and do believe that this is extremely critical. Whether residents know or don't know whether these whether fireworks is illegal in the city almost it seemed irrelevant this last year because I cannot imagine that many people do not know that it's not legal in this city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I think there's a mixture of things going on. I appreciate your your persistence in this issue and the councilmembers who sponsored this item. Councilmember Richardson, thank you very much. And is there any public comment?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening, everyone. My name is Karen Retherford and I reside at the corner seventh and Pacific Avenue. I'm in one of those areas that's heavily impacted by the use of illegal fireworks. We're a senior building and there's a number in that area.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There's a persistent group of people on Eighth Street between Pacific and Chestnut and the week before the 4th of July. It is indeed like a war zone in our particular neighborhood. I want to offer I'm on the 17th floor of the building.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If we could put a camera on there and capture one of the issues is when the police come, they turn on the sirens. So as soon as they hear the sirens, they shut down and they leave. And they operate primarily with the illegal fireworks.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I wouldn't be surprised, but they were selling to others within the community. This has been an ongoing problem over the last year and a half. And I know a number of our residents have placed phone calls to the police department about this, and they just can't seem to catch these guys.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I have seen a gentleman standing outside and immediately following there are blasts and I'm willing to do whatever I can do to stop this. And they have my respect of ours and they have no respect of time. They not only operate around the 4th of July, they operate on a year round basis, and sometimes they set off'",
        "'speaker_2': 'fireworks at three in the morning. I've been awakened three or four with little blasts, and now we have flash bombs going off and people think that there meth lab explosions going on in our neighborhood. So this is an issue that I know we're willing to help however we can in terms of observation recording to get this problem'",
        "'speaker_2': 'resolved. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Uh, my name is William Napier, Honorable City Council and Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I'm concerned about.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Some fireworks around the Jergens. Building land tunnel. And the deal is if the City of Long Beach destroys Jergens Tunnel, the tunnel that made Long Beach famous, the tunnel that gave Long Beach its soul, the tunnel that everyone went through to get to the real Pike Fun Zone.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'What will be next? I say it will be our wetlands. Overdevelopment seems to be on our city's agenda and overpopulation seems to be on our nation's agenda. Thank you very much. And I love fireworks, but we'll let you make that decision.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hi. My name is Miranda Misek and I live along the riverbed in one of those tucked away neighborhoods. And I don't think that people aren't aware so much that it's not illegal, although the efforts of making children kind of help encourage parents to do the right thing, I think is a great idea.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm wondering if there's been any effort in trying to work with adjacent cities to maybe when people purchase fireworks from other cities, show maybe a driver's license or something that shows the city they live in or to help kind of with the enforcement of our laws or maybe enact laws in their cities to not have fireworks.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And also, I am wondering if maybe we can't help officers be eyes and ears and maybe equip those that have the authority to write citations, you know, like people that enforce parking tickets and things like that, maybe on that one night be, you know, a bigger force out in that community.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Because I know that the minute the police car shows up, they all scatter, you know, so maybe if there is a way to, like, have people that aren't in uniform or people that aren't usually in uniform, just kind of patrol neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'My partner and I, we sometimes patrol our neighborhood and try to get our neighbors involved and, you know, help officers that way. Because I know you can't be everywhere and I know you do your best. But I don't think that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's hard to spot them. I mean, they're they're very obvious when they have block parties in there. It's there. So I think that we need to get those citation numbers up, because if I got a $400 ticket or something, I sure would think twice about doing it the next year.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So if there's anything we can do and if there's any kind of movement in the direction of helping other cities get involved, I think that'll be a bigger bang for your efforts. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Tom Stout. This is a huge problem. And Wrigley, Stu, your anger is totally right on this prior to a week before. These are not just illegal fireworks. These are explosive devices. It shakes my whole house. Animals are screaming.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'What are their children doing? I mean, I don't know exactly how, but around between 31st and 32nd on Cedar, that's the direction these devices are going off. And I mean, they're I mean, it shakes my whole house. So everybody's being affected, you know, safe and saying, I don't know there is saying as some of the idiots that'",
        "'speaker_9': 'use them so you know that's debatable. But you know, I grew up with firecrackers and manatees. That was the device for sort of opening up toilets in high schools at one time. And these things would destroy the whole bathroom.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I don't know what they are, but I know people do also fill up balloons with propane and they're in a hell of an explosive device and you let it go and a fuze burns into it. And I mean, it's devastating.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I never tried that one, but I I've seen a lot of people when I go to Lakewood do it. So, hey, I hope you can do it. I know it's difficult. I mean, it is you know, they're like rats.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'As soon as the lights come on, they gone. And soon as you go away, they're back. And this goes on the whole night. I mean, these are not fireworks. Like I said, they're destructive devices. So hopefully you can do something because through the last two years, it's gotten out of control.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I guess we all had to buy earplugs.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is there any other public comment on item 11? I will take you back behind the rail. Councilwoman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Perhaps this is a question for our CIO. You know, we have to go Long Beach up. Would it be possible for neighbors to document where the fireworks are coming from in the weeks leading up to 4th of July, utilizing the go along, each of which has the geocoding?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Right now, you can code if someone leaves animal defecation or dumping. Could we get a new drop down, which is called illegal fireworks, so that we'd be able to at least start documenting which houses these fireworks are coming from to prepare the police for 4th of July.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Brian Sestak is. Councilmember Mongo. Yes, that's something we can look into performing probably very similar to that coyote sighting application of how we took that along and added that as well. So we could we could look into that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think that would be really helpful. I think that at least in my neighborhood, it's the same houses every year. And if on my evening walk I could just tag the house and let PD know who it is and what they're doing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think a lot of neighbors could get involved in that, especially if we, as the council, put that on our Twitters and our Facebook and show it in our newsletters that neighbors can do this. I think it'll give PD a head start on on the issue and hopefully people will be more cognizant.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mr. Stokers, hold on 1/2. I do have a follow up question, but I wanted to ask our Deputy Chief, Rich Rocky. If that were to be the case, would that qualify as some form of evidence for a citizen complaint?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They go? Long Beach. Complaint. Maybe that's a city attorney question. It would be with photo geo coded.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It would certainly be evidence that could be included in the report, whether would be sufficient evidence to either issue a citation or to be prosecuted. Would it be fact specific?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But would you be able to, if we're able to add that category, be able to look into that? Because I think what we're hearing is this is a numbers game, right? Folks who want to engage in this activity will always outnumber police officers.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's just the way it is. And so what we don't want is to leave residents with this feeling that they're there's much of it that cannot be helped. So here we're making a very concerted effort to do what we can.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But given the nature of how information is captured and transmitted today, I'm hoping that there is some advancement that we can utilize or tap into. So perhaps the citizens complaint could at least be recorded.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We could certainly talk to the city prosecutor in the police department about that. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. I would appreciate that. And Mr. Sisto, because I wanted to ask you, considering Miss Mango brought Councilwoman Mango brought up the Go Along Beach app. Is there a mechanism that you have in place or perhaps city manager?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is there a mechanism you have in place to receive requests from council members to add categories to our GO application? And is that something that the office is openly accepting?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. What?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We're open to looking at any new categories that you wish to have on there with the understanding that it's within the direction from the council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sure. So an individual council member may have requests such as coyotes are not necessarily endemic throughout the city of Long Beach, and it might be just be specific to a couple of council districts. So I hope that we're not looking to council agreement for small minutia and for this I look to the city manager's office.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah. So, Vice Mayor, I can add a little bit here. We get requests all the time from either councilmembers or members of the public or departments for adding to our go Long Beach. And we look at each and every one of those and see, does it make sense to go on the platform?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Can candidates connect to one of our existing systems, which is important too? Is that the goal? Long Beach needs to be able to feed into something we already do. So we look at each one of those and then make decisions.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Can it be on the platform or can it not?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Great. I appreciate that. Thank you. Thank you both. Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. And I want to thank everybody for their thoughtful questions. I have a couple regarding as a follow up to you. Deputy Chief Rocky, you outline the number of citations given out over the last three years. What is that compared to in terms of the calls for service or complaints that you actually receive?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Do you have numbers? That can kind of give us a picture?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Councilmember Eisen Yes, I do have and.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This is just for the 4th of July itself, not during the entire week.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'If just for the day of the fourth. Four calls for service. Yes. So for July 4th of 2014, we received 550 pyro or heard pyro calls, which means firework type calls. Some of those may have been witnessed by the calling party, and many of them are heard only.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So that, of course, if we if it's heard only, we had sent a police officer into the area to see if we can locate it. Many times we do not. Or we may see the evidence of fireworks that have been lit and the person has abandoned the area.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'In 2015, we received 635 calls for service under those same call class.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And that is just for one day. It doesn't spend the entire week, correct?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That is just for the day. 4th of July, the 24 hour period.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So based on that, you guys are responding or actually writing citations for it would be based on that. But less than 10% of the actual calls that you receive, correct?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes, sir. It's very small amount and some of those we may not respond to. It may be just what we call a district carjack, depending on the information from the calling party and if we can locate the area of where these are being lit up.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So on the 4th of July itself, and I know we think I know the answer to this question, but I'm asking for the benefit of the public as well. What does our staffing model look like compared to any other day, a regular day?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Our staffing model in the 4th of July is all police department officers work that day. The only officers that do not work are officers that are on a regularly scheduled day off on a scheduled vacation. All others are to work.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'There is no holidays, there's no overtime days, and there's no training allowed during that day.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And the the role of the officers who are staff there, then all of them aren't responding to calls, obviously. Correct. They're not all responding to firework calls they're doing.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We have different models out that day. We do have our regular calls for service units out in the field that are max deployment that year and or that day in each division. We also have a comprehensive action operation plan that we do for the city, especially along the coast, where we have the largest influx of people visiting'",
        "'speaker_8': 'our city and our community members attending to see firework shows and be at the beach and enjoy what the city has to offer. So in those areas where we have that large influx, we have officers specifically assigned to to those areas to provide public safety and enforce our laws.'",

And I've brought this up before because I'm challenged and I know our police department is challenged to enforce this this this ordinance that we actually have that all fireworks are illegal.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Particularly when every border and city in Long Beach or around the city of Long Beach actually legalizes suppressing fireworks. Right. And so we have I've heard plenty this evening about illegal fireworks, Long Beach. All fireworks are legal in Long Beach, whether they go boom, whether they go up in the air or whether they are just ground flowers'",
        "'speaker_7': 'that are that are relatively harmless. I personally think we need to revisit our policy on on fireworks period, because I think. That if we go within a blanket illegal approach, we will probably open ourselves up to a market where the more egregious fireworks are going to be more accessible and more proliferated throughout our city.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so thank you, Councilmember Richardson, for bringing this forward. I think this has been a very thoughtful conversation.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Council member. I think it's important to point out, in addition to our enforcement of fireworks, our mission is to deter and enforce laws related to public consumption of alcohol, public intoxication, driving under the influence, unruly parties, dangerous and illegal barbecues, use of illegal fireworks, which we've been talking about traffic and enforcement violations and complaints, managing pedestrian vehicular'",
        "'speaker_8': 'traffic flows, handling a high volume of calls for service in addition to managing our large crowds. So I wanted to point that out because fireworks is very important, but there are so many things that we are faced with during the 4th of July, and these were just to name a few.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'At a public safety committee meeting many months ago. And I believe with that meeting, I brought up the point that my constituents were complaining as far as 30 days ahead of time. So let's let's not get started too late.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Let's do it the earlier the better. So if we could target June 4th, that'd be great. Also, there are particular areas of my district, too, Deputy Chief Rocky, that would be beat 11 that has a lot of calls for illegal fireworks.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so if we could target certain areas, we'd be we'd just like to assist you in that, to get it out in our weekly newsletter or whatever it means we can. So thank you.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'When we purchased our home, there were discussions about the potential use of that land. And I would speak for my neighbors. We've all been very hopeful that that land would be developed and cleaned up. There have been many issues around that property and we've been promised a lot of things.'",

So we did get that cute little Baker Street Park that we're very thankful for, although there's been some additional issues with that park being placed there. I personally would love to see that developed into public use that would be to benefit of the community.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'So it's caused a lot of problems there as well. So if anything is developed on that land, I would love to see access from the main street into that area so that no more no more increased traffic is brought into that community.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They're speeding down that street, a lot of speeding because people think it's a free for all. It's a very wide open street all along golden. I'm no speed bumps, even though we've requested for them have been added. There's a park there now, so cars constantly run into the gate.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There's no security for the children. There's no speed control. And so people think it's a great place to park there and smoke and do all kinds of things at all hours of the day and night. And so even though the park is very welcomed, there wasn't much thought put into the repercussions of increased traffic both by foot'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and by car into the area. So I'm really nervous about what they put there because that's only going to, you know, impact that as well. It's also caused a problem with it being vacant because there's so many homeless folks now with the closure of the golf course right above that area there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we have homeless encampments and that's brought a lot of problems. Truly homeless people and undesirables as well. There's also because there's nothing there now, there's a lot of dust. So the quality of air and soil and water is of concern.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And the owners of that property have spoken to us. But I'm not completely convinced they've been completely straightforward or honest about all that they know. So I feel that if it was allowed to be developed, that more cleanup could be done.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There's a lot of illegal activity that goes on in there, including drug trafficking and of course, the speed and traffic that accesses that area. So if anything, please, is develop there, I would please beg you that there be Access Streets, consideration and speed control.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'So therefore, we have been working on this for many, many years. I was the senior project manager on the Long Beach River link phase one project. We held 12 neighborhood community meetings from the mouth of the L.A. River to the boundary with Paramount.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Back then, they looked at putting in an amphitheater. There's also an historic wetland that was formerly on that property. The Coastal Conservancy in the late nineties was interested in it. Many, many organizations were interested in it. We tried to get it into a redevelopment zone by making it contiguous to the West Park, and that failed.'",

I think we need the citizens of Wrigley deserve a strong effort by the city to try to purchase that property, because I don't think we should start phase two of River Link until'",

There are actually multiple parcels and several of the parcels do have an equestrian history. So for those of the community that aren't aware, the Long Beach Mounted Police used to actually reside in retain facilities on several of these parcels.'",

My name is Candice Meade and I've lived in Wrigley for almost 30 years and years ago, several neighbors and I spent quite a few Saturdays providing input to the general plan.

        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening. Good evening, Mayor. City Council. My name is Cheryl Perry. I reside at 351 Magnolia. I'm the current president of Long Beach Heritage. We are happy to see that there is potential for preservation and re utilization of the Jergens train tunnel.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'As Vice Mayor Lowenthal said, it's certainly a significant piece of Long Beach history. We would just like to be assured that that there will be included specific wording in the DDA or whatever the documents are with the developer regarding the utilization of and the public access to the tunnel.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Because we didn't have apparently enough protection in 1988 and we lost the entire Jurgens trust building. We'd like to make sure that there are enough legal protections for the tunnel itself. Mr. Mayor and many council members, you've said that we need to think big and think outside the box to create a vibrant and invigorating downtown and re'",
        "'speaker_2': 'utilizing this tunnel could certainly be an important piece of that. We don't have to have all the details yet of how that can happen. We have a lot of creative and talented architects and engineers and builders in the city that can figure that out.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But we just want to make sure that there's protection, that you do not relinquish the control of the tunnel. Be the leaders of this revitalization, this re utilization of it. Don't leave it to the developer to tell us what they're going to do with it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You are our leaders. You tell them what the city wants to happen there. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you. Sure. Next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'My name is Derek Smith. I am the political director for Unite Here Local 11. We understand the importance of this hotel. We're not. That's not lost on us.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But we also understand very well the value of what is being given away.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And the point of the process that this tonight marks today.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There has been no written assurance by the developer about which end use jobs are going to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Be quality.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Jobs. The vice mayor has put.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Forth a.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'A card check provision in her motion, which is good in concept.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Conceptually, it's important.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But it's limited because it doesn't provide any clarity about which jobs are going to be union jobs or the process by which workers will be able to decide whether they want a union or not. And those things are important.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'In instances like this, we suggest labor peace. A labor peace is appropriate in a situation where a city has a fiduciary interest in a property which you do. Labor peace is an agreement that ensures the financial success of a project because it mandates that the two parties that actually can ensure peace, labor, peace, a developer.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And a union must.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Work together and decide for themselves who's going to be covered and what the concept is and how it's going to happen. That's the agreement that needs to be in place for you to ensure that there.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'So we are asking that you put that labor peace provision in place tonight while.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'And this new hotel development should uphold the city standard for projects with community benefits, especially if we're going to negotiate a tax subsidy. So at this time, I urge that the City Council vote to approve this project only if a labor peace agreement is in place.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I have three more minutes. It's screwed up. It's okay. I'm done.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'I believe that this this is very important to us, not only the workers here, but the people who live here in Long Beach, because there's different companies out there who refuse to negotiate even once they're in control. So if you think that they're going to do the right thing, it actually takes months of litigation, months of lawyers'",
        "'speaker_4': 'for them to actually come and negotiate a fair contract with their employees. So the card check is something very important. And the community benefits also are something that that help. Because if we don't do this right the first time, like I said, it takes months and months of employees having to go to try and negotiate fair living'",
        "'speaker_4': 'wages, sustainable living wages, also assisted health care. And the workloads are something that that are something that benefits employees that you went through through community community benefits and being able to even just have a card check. Another thing I mentioned here is the voice that that you can offer to the employees that people work.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There's going to be very big with the card check and with community benefits. A lot of times there's abuse with wage theft because there's no transparency. Contracts can can also include language of transparency about tip distribution and things like that, which lead to wage theft.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Also, things that are good in that sense is that the workloads a lot of people think that the turnover in hotels is due to something very minimal, but it's actually leading to workloads being excessive. Companies are exploiting the workers and just being ambitious managers, ambitious people, short shifting people.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And all these things can be labor disputes can be litigated earlier, you know, if you do it right the first time, we need benefits. We need community benefits to keep LPC standards high. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'I am also a member of United Auto Workers, Local 4123, and I am an employee of the international UAW. I think the the trade, the transit occupancy, tax sharing agreement that we see here, I think is a really bad idea.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Basically, you're splitting that 5050 and that's giving away a lot of money and especially to give away that money for over 20 years. That's really depriving services from the citizens of Long Beach. Earlier, several hours ago, we saw the work that the public works people do.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That's money that could easily be helping the public works. So there's no need to 5050 split that total money. That's about 25 million that we could be saving for our own coffers to help out with that. So I think that a subsidy is only good for the community when there's community benefits in place that are returning that'",
        "'speaker_9': 'for good jobs, stimulating the economy and having good labor working conditions. As a person that negotiates contracts for thousands of people, I can tell you that labor peace is a very valuable thing to have. And I hope that the labor peace agreement that we do see with this language for this resolution is really clear.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so the only way this project should be given a subsidy is that the developer commits to the community benefits. We're not giving that money back to them 5050. And so in conclusion, I ask the City Council to only approve moving forward with this project if a labor peace agreement is in place.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening. My name is Alicia Quiroz. I used to work as a restaurant server here at one of the Hyatt's in Long Beach. And unless labor peace is given in this project, we oppose the project. I want to tell you what it's like to work as a server who doesn't have a union.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Without the union, we're on our own and we are subject to enduring harassment without being able to speak up. If we speak up, our hours are cut. Our days are cut. If we are not the quietest, the most submissive, the prettiest of servers, we're not given enough hours.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We can make ends meet. I had to work two server jobs to rent a one to rent one bedroom out of an apartment here in Long Beach. Like we did, there were two nonunion server jobs without a union.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Women like myself, families remain poor. We remain without health insurance, without an opportunity to have the full time good careers that Councilwoman Mango mentioned. At these hotels, you know, we cannot afford a college for our for ourselves. My coworkers couldn't afford a college for their children while working nonunion, serving jobs.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We don't have health insurance. We don't have sick days. And so these are the things that are money goes to pay for instead of a good education. Without a union, we have no opportunity to know if tomorrow we're even going to have a job or if we can afford our rent next month.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Our hours are so up and down that we never know. We have to endure uninvited comments from guests, from managers every single day. So I encourage you to do the right thing and give the hundreds of future workers at this hotel a good job, a good future, and a good life.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And do not support this project if there is no labor peace. Thank you.'",

But you know what? I think Long Beach just is going to have more cranes than L.A. one of these days, more development.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And in Long Beach is always a plus. And we we urge you to move this project forward. And thank you very much.'",

I want here on behalf of Los Angeles, Orange County Building Trades Construction Council, and we are also in strong support of this project. It's projects like these that let the future people of Long Beach work and it creates good careers and it creates good jobs not only now'",

        "'speaker_2': 'I want to say for the workers that will be working there, definitely a bottom line has to be given to the workers. A labor peace agreement needs to be in place for those future workers of residents living in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'For those seeking out jobs for that hotel. So hopefully we see that in the future. So bottom line, labor peace needs to be present. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. Thank you. Close public we we close public comment. Let me go back now to councilman Councilman Austin and vice mayor.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I do have a question for Stephanie regarding some of what has been mentioned in public comment, particularly around the card check agreement and labor peace. I understand this motion actually does have a provision for car check agreement.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Is that correct? Mr. City attorney.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That is correct.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And who was was there? Was there any was was there negotiation with with any labor groups to get that language in there? And what was the intent of putting a card check agreement in place?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Councilmember Austin, there was discussion during the day today on how best to ensure that the hotel would be a union hotel, even though it is subject to measure. And and so in discussions internally, we thought the best approach to achieve that was through the card check agreement.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so that was included and discussed with the developer. And he has agreed to pursue that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I guess to staff Mr. Conway or the city attorney. What is a card check agreement actually mean to you in terms of making it more inviting for a union hotel?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Council Member Austin My understanding of the card check agreement is it provides an option for the employees of the hotel to decide whether or not they want to unionize. And I've been advised by the developer in this particular project that in his experience, a card check agreement generally almost 100% of the time results in a unionized hotel'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and comes with a restaurant. On top of that, the chosen hotel will enter into a card check neutrality agreement with the local 11 for direct employees of the hotel.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So there's already a provision for this. The card check agreement to be with.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That will be in the purchase agreement. Yeah. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. I may have a question later. Thank you. I'm going to let other councilmembers with Councilmember Supernova.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah. Thank you. First, I'd like to thank the vice mayor for recognizing there are still people alive who remember the Jergens tunnel. I think Councilmember Andrews and I would be among those. That group. Yeah, that's sorry. But to Sheryl Perry's point about the Jergens tunnel, from what I read in the description here, there's there's no mention of'",
        "'speaker_3': 'a Northern ingress or egress from that. Mr.. CONWAY So does that mean that it's just going to be open on the seaside way? As I mentioned, I am old enough to remember it. They did close the entrance on the north side of ocean.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think you could get to it on the south side of Ocean, also near Victory Park, which was the skylight for the tunnel. Any plans in place to have an opening at the other end? So it actually functions as a tunnel?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That would be. And that's too far in the weeds right now. But I think that's something that the the folks who remember it would would.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Want to see. Council members who are the our understanding currently and we will verify that is that the northern entrance to the tunnel has been blocked off by development and therefore is not accessible. But we will absolutely ensure that that's correct.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If there is access from the northerly side, we will look to provide that as part of this agreement.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Thank you. I think there's a lot of issues we need to visit at at a later date when the folks are here to answer those questions in terms of marketing and whatnot. So we'll defer that to later.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But for now, I stand in support. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you. By Samir Lowenthal.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And I wanted to thank all the speakers, as well as council colleagues and council members. Super. And I apologize for that. Sometimes it feels like one long day and a decade can go by. But of course, it wasn't that long ago.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I. Mr. Mayor, thank you also for your gracious comments. I think everyone has worked hard on this particular project in one way or another. And Councilmember Supernormal. I have asked our city team, not just today but for years, to make sure that that access to the northern side is revisited and considered, if at all possible.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It is something that made that a very, very, very unique property. So I reiterated that request today to Mr. Conway and Mr. Modica, and hopefully the answer is a positive one, because I think that will also provide unique opportunities for the developer to consider if that actually is an option.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I would like to reiterate my gratitude for the staff for ensuring that measure and is clarified and then really sanctify through this agreement and know that the larger victory when it comes to working with city owned properties has been achieved.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And for that, I'm very thankful and I thank everyone that's been involved in almost the last ten years in this process. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'I'd like to point out that one. In 2014, we ended the year in a 40 year low in violent crime in our city in 2015. In 2016, we started to see some of that rebound, specifically in the area of violent crime and in our gun violence.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Through April of 2016, our city has experienced a 13.1% in violent crime. We have experienced an increase in our shootings of nearly 42% compared to the same time last year. About one third of these shootings are gang related, and we have seen an increase of 46.7% in gang related shootings from this time last year as well.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Murders are also have shown an increase this year of 83.3% year to date compared to 2015. Most of these, however, are gang related, and that's where we're focusing a lot of our attention to impact these crimes. One thing I'm going to add into this is our robberies.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Although some of our a lot of our robberies may not be involve guns, some of them do involve guns. So I thought it was appropriate to talk a little bit about that when we're talking about gun violence. But we have shown an increase of 24.3% of robberies through April 2016 compared to 2015.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And just to clarify, robbery, this crime occurs when someone takes the property from another by force or fear. And most of these robberies that we experience in our city are street related type crimes. And again, many of them don't involve guns, but some of them do.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The common things taken in these robberies are cell phones, personal items such as jewelry and money, and these are often crimes of opportunity. In addition, as we talked a little bit about the 40 year low in violent crime in 2014 and then bouncing back the last 17 to 18 months, according to a recent report of Major City'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Chiefs Association, major cities across the country and even into Canada are experiencing similar increases in their violent crime categories, as we are seeing here in Long Beach. And they're seeing these during the first quarter of 2016 compared to 2015, like we are here as well.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Some of those challenges that we continue to see and that have been something that we've been focused on as an organization is several legislations, legislation, challenges that have come our way in the recent years. Other well-intended to reduce prison populations.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We have seen that legislation impact us and we're still working with our. Agencies across the country and major city chiefs to determine how this legislation is, in fact, impacting us to get more empirical data. A lot of what we're seeing is anecdotal at this time.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So some of our strategies that we have employed and I'll mention a few, I do have many of them and we can include these in the upcoming report. But I want to point out before I get into the strategies and just thank our dedicated police officers in the city.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We have a group of officers who work extremely hard to impact crime and keep our community safe. And in doing that, they work with us and employ various strategies to impact crime. And to name a few, like I said.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Through crime analysis, we adjust resources throughout the city to impact crime when and where they're most likely to occur. We focus enforcement at the patrol divisions by directed enforcement teams in Impact Motors, public safety realignment teams, patrol officers and canines.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Through April of this year, a public safety realignment team has performed 213 compliance checks and made 93 arrests. We've increased our court order arrests to 82 versus 69 through the end of May of 2015, and May isn't done in 2016.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So we'll see that number grow. And we have surpassed our court order enforcement, increased proactive enforcement with the use of overtime for violent crime and property crimes are most likely to occur. These efforts, in combination with quick response to priority calls for service, has resulted in an increase of seized guns this year.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'These are evidence guns taken off the street. And so far we have seized 186 versus 139 from this time last year. So we are continuing to impact our gun crimes by taking guns off the street that are in the hands of those that want to do harm.'",

And I know that conversations are taking place at kitchen tables in our community and taking place taking place in my own home.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I do think it's important that we as a city council do have these conversations at the highest levels of our city.

        "'speaker_6': 'So I really appreciate the work that they do. And I also want to thank Cosmo Ralston for including me in this in this in this item here, because it's my district is obviously very impacted by this as well.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'One of the things that I think that as we pursue this and go forward, I think we also have to look at the besides the effects of legislation that may have an effect on where we're at right now.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But also, we also have to look at what are the economic and socio economic aspects of why we have an increase in crime. We always know that as we go into a recession or we go into a hard economic times, that there's an obvious increase in crime.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'People are become desperate or become more compelled to get what they need in in a very easy way. And it's been said there are crimes of opportunity. So we always have to keep people informed about how to secure their homes, secure their vehicles, secure their properties.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I think that obviously we need much more information on that. And besides that, we also need to keep more information and contact in regards to what to do in in dangerous situations. I don't think there's enough of that education going on.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I think that's another aspect that we need to look at as well. One of the things that I would also like to see in whatever is coming up in the report is the increase that there has been terms, there has been an increase, as we have heard right now, in gang activity.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But I'd also like to know if there's new gangs out there that are that are developing and coming up. Is there any new activities that have been presenting themselves at great challenges to our police department as well as other public safety personnel?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And also the the the the the guns that that have been confiscated? Perhaps we will get to a better understanding of where those country are coming from. There's no question that a lot of the the gun incidents that are being perpetrated are from stolen guns.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Very few are bought for the purpose of of a career of causing a crime. The most they are stolen. So maybe we have to have more education as well on securing the guns that the owners might buy locally and just giving them more information about how to secure and how the proper use and safety of those those'",
        "'speaker_6': 'weapons so that they don't become easy access for for a potential burglary or or a car theft, whatever, that that would make make a gun accessible to a criminal without bad intentions. So I would also like to to to have that looked at and more and more education.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I mean, there's nothing that is more important than anything with with our community and our residents to give them information. So the more information they get, the more knowledge they gain material, making themselves much more safer. I think it's a it's a is an improvement in our in our community.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I would like to see and they don't cost money. I know that nothing comes cheap. Creating more brochures and literature and distributing those is an issue. So we have to look at and how we're going to not only get these these guns off the street, but also how we're going to secure those that are that are'",
        "'speaker_6': 'owned by private citizens, that are become victims of a theft that later on becomes a weapon for for bad intentions. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Councilman Price.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. I want to thank my colleagues for bringing this forward. I actually didn't know about the item until I saw it on this week's agenda. But I think it's a very, very good topic to discuss. It's actually something we've discussed at the Public Safety Committee meetings.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And Deputy Chief Hendricks has given us reports on all of these topics, public safety. And I'm wondering, as we're talking, whether it might be useful for us to maybe take up the issue that Councilman Turanga just mentioned regarding new gangs and gang outreach activity, outreach and outreach and education activities that are going on citywide.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Because I know we have multiple grants and multiple outreach efforts going on. Maybe we can have that presented at a future public safety meeting, committee meeting, and then we could forward that report to the full council. Is that something that you guys would be able to accommodate?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'A council member prays. Absolutely. We can accommodate that and come back with that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So maybe we'll go ahead and add that to our next public safety agenda. And then I'm also wondering and I wonder, I'm just throwing this out there if maybe it would be helpful for us when we do cover some of these topics.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And earlier tonight, we had a fireworks item on we'd covered the same topic at Public Safety. Do my colleagues think it might be helpful to have some of those reports forwarded to the full body for discussion? Because we can we can think about maybe doing that from the Public Safety Committee standpoint on issues that really impact the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'whole city. Gun violence, fireworks. We talked about maybe gang and gang activity and education. Those are three things that I was thinking might be relevant to the full body. We could have the reports forwarded to council. I'd like to hear what my colleagues think about that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Well, I think that that's actually a great, great idea. I also sit on the public safety committee. I agenda is this particular item outside of the committee because I think it merited a a a citywide stage and a council wide discussion.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Several of our council districts are impacted. Not each not everybody on the public safety committee is is as impacted. And I wanted to make sure that we were included in our residents, as well as sending a message to our residents, more importantly, that this this this issue of gun violence is extremely important and that the city council'",
        "'speaker_7': ', the entire council cares about it. And we wanted to make sure we aired it in front of the council to give it a bigger stage. Obviously, most of the public is not paying attention to our individual committee meetings, but good work is actually happening in those committees.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And in fact, much of this information has been presented to us and Public Safety Committee, we're working. Councilmember Price is our chair and is very thoughtful. We are working to with PD and with fire on constantly on on the issues, the big issues facing our city.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But this particular item I thought merited a larger discussion. I do have a couple of follow ups and they do want to hear from the public as well. But in light of the challenges outlined, the legislative challenges, the the the challenges that we may have with with staffing, what more can we do as a city to prevent'",
        "'speaker_7': 'crimes? And I know we have a violence prevention plan. I know we have a lot of great innovative approaches right now that are unique to our city in a lot of ways. But what more can we do? And this this is it's an open ended question, but it's a question that I would just really ask for us'",
        "'speaker_7': 'to think hard about, because I can tell you that this council member and I know others are committed to doing doing whatever we can to to make our city safer.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Councilmember us and we are doing an awful lot in impacting in enforcing violent crime. And we work collaboratively, collaboratively as a city to impact that. So we certainly can look at what what we can do differently or add to.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But I think in the report you will see the comprehensive approach that we have.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So so, Deputy Chief, I want to congratulate you also on your many years of service in your retirement. We did not see A, B, one or nine or we did not understand and know what the impacts of of legislative actions would be.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And there's a lot of there's theories that that maybe some of those actions have resulted in some of the upticks in crime that we're experiencing today. Now that we know or now that there is a theory or hypothesis out there, that that that some of these legislative actions have created a situation now that we have more crime'",
        "'speaker_7': 'or we need to be more alert. The question is what what else can we do? And if you don't have the answer today, I'd be happy to get an answer at a later later time to give you 30 days to think about it, to come back to this council.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But I think what we need to do as a as a what I'm looking for today, and I know our public in many communities are looking for is is innovative new approaches to to dealing with this issue because we have new, new scenarios facing us today.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I can answer that, Councilmember. I think that's just something that I know that working on with our government relations with Diana Tang, we can certainly report back on what's happening with those propositions throughout the state of California.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. Well, I'm definitely looking forward to hearing those report back from Diana Tang, and I would encourage our PD to continue to stay the course and work continue the great work that they're doing on our behalf. My, my, my, my concern is that we need to look at some alternative approaches, some sort of new strategies that may'",
        "'speaker_7': 'not have to be laid out here before the council, but some more aggressive approaches to to end gun violence, particularly when you can you can almost put a map out there and understand that, you know, there are hotspots throughout the city that we need to be really, really focusing on.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. Councilman Price.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. So one of the things that I hope that we can do, this discussion of an uptick in crime is affecting every single council district. I mean, every single one. I just looked at the TFF that you guys that the police department sent out on crime stats and you know there.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Property crimes and theft related crimes have gone up more in some districts, a lot more in some districts than others. And this is a conversation that we're all having across the city. So I would like to elicit input from my colleagues in terms of how we can better use the Public Safety Committee to vet out some of'",
        "'speaker_5': 'these issues so we don't have to do it tonight. But as as everyone kind of walks away and thinks about these issues because we're all addressing them when we go to community meetings, we're all talking about the various issues that impact our neighborhoods, and we want to make sure that we have accurate information and that we're appropriately'",
        "'speaker_5': 'setting them as a committee and also as a body. So one of the things that we could do is maybe we can start doing, you know.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Regular reports.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In terms of specific type of information that we're bringing to public safety. Deputy Chief Hendrix always gives a very comprehensive report on whatever the agenda item is, and I usually reach out to my fellow committee members and ask them what items they'd like to put on the agenda.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'One of the things that we could do, and I'm happy to do it in our office if my colleagues are interested in this, is we can put together kind of a summary of the items that we discussed at the public safety meeting and what correspondence went along with those agenda items.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And we can distribute those. And then if a council member wants to have a further discussion, because I think that's a really great point, we may there are a lot of these topics we should be talking about.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'As a group.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We can agenda as those that come out of public safety and maybe ask for additional reporting that wasn't included at public safety, because sometimes public safety is the first place where we're hearing about an issue and questions come up that necessitate further follow up.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So if everybody wants to kind of think about that, we don't have to make any decisions about it tonight. But I'd.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Love to be able to use.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The Public Safety Committee as a venue to further vet the information that we as a council body hear so that we're all on the same page and able to report to our constituents consistently and and with full advocacy on their behalf.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I will say and I remember having a conversation offline with one of my colleagues about Prop 47 before that passed, that I knew for a fact it was going to have the impact that it's had, and it's been devastating.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The number of drug addicted individuals we have out there are contributing to our current stats. And that is a situation that I think absent some statewide resources and intervention is not going to go away regardless of how many resources we put into the problem.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The reality is there's no longer any incentive for people to make meaningful, sustained long term changes. And as a result of that, we're going to continue to see that problem go up and that problem is going to increase with theft related crimes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And the theft related crimes are going to lead to violence and the violence related crimes are going to lead to gun use and weapons use. That's just the pattern. So anything that my colleagues think as a result of these discussions that we can do to better utilize the public safety committee as we move forward on these citywide'",
        "'speaker_5': 'discussions, I'd love to hear from you at some point so that we can, you know, be the most efficient and make sure everyone gets access to the reports that we may have. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you, Councilmember Ringo.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, I'm just going to go ahead and throw it out there. There's the big elephant in the room is guns. And their accessibility and their misuse. And until we really, really get some real good gun control laws in, we're going to always have this problem.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So what can you do as a public safety committee or what can we do as a council if we're going to have to address that? It's not the time tonight or maybe in the near future. It's certainly a federal issue as well as they're looking at implementing some kind of ID.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Then application processing for applications for guns. But those are the legal ones. And what we have here but when we're looking at gun violence and we're looking at how they are acquired by gangs and to prepare to perpetrate robberies and assaults and everything else, I mean, we're not going to be able to really get a handle on'",
        "'speaker_6': 'this. But then, you know, and we do it at the risk of of being a target of the NRA and other pro gun activists out there. So we really won't be able to resolve maybe the gun issue. But certainly, as I indicated earlier, education and information is the immediate thing that we can do.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And that's something that I think the public safety committee can do. It increased its accessibility to the public in terms of what to do in those types of situations or how to secure, again, their their their guns and making them less available for for theft and illegal use.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So it's a difficult issue. It's one that's not going to be resolved immediately, obviously, but it's certainly one that eventually it's going to come to us. I recall many years ago, the city council was addressing the very same topic, gun violence.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And there was a proposal put on the council. I don't know who was around at that time back this goes way back 1980s and 1987, somewhere around there. There was a proposal to eliminate what they called at that time, Saturday night specials.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Anybody caught with that would be or committing a crime would have added penalties for for carrying those. And they were basically outlawed in the city in terms of gun sales. I think stores were required to eliminate the sales of those types of handguns.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So maybe that could be another way of addressing this type of of activity as well as I think there was also an effort, not a recall when that was, but to also look at the elimination of gun sales of an AK 47 or other automatic automatic weapons.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'How many AK 40 seconds are used in these crimes? I have no clue. I'm probably, I'm guessing, probably very small because there aren't that many out there anymore. But those those types of things that we could look at, maybe the types of guns that are being used in the in in gun violence would be.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Useful, perhaps, in terms of the types of guns. I'm not a gun aficionado, so I have no clue as to what type of gun is popular with with purpose. But maybe that's something that we could look at in the future.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'MCHUGH Councilman Alston?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yeah. I don't want to beat this to death, and that's probably not the best word to use, considering. But it's a real word because there are a lot of people in a lot of families facing just that death in their their families.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Death on our streets as a result of guns. I brought this idea forward in all sincerity, to try to get ahead of summer 2016. Generally, we see a rise in crime during the summer, and I do not want this council or anybody in the city to to become desensitized to gun violence is not normal.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It should not be acceptable for for people to be dying in the streets as a result of gun violence. And I think we can and should do more as a city council. I did ask a question and I got two different types of answers.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'What can we do or can we do more? And the answers and what I like to think about is, is improving technology. Improving community policing and new approaches to community policing. Gang intervention strategies. And I know we have all of that there, but I think we have to do more because the numbers don't support a measure of'",
        "'speaker_7': 'success. And so I think we need to continue to do more, continue to work hard. This is no way a blemish on our our hard working men and women of our police department. It's no way of a blemish on this city and its leaders, but we have to do more.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And the gun violence I went to a vigil just a couple of weeks ago, and it was it was heart wrenching that a 16 year old kid was was murdered in a park within walking distance of his home to to be with his family and to understand the anguish and the the pain that that that family was'",
        "'speaker_7': 'suffering as a result of that crime. And this is happening all too often throughout our city. We need to pay attention to this and we need to step up. And so we may not answer the questions this evening.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We may not have all the answers this evening. But, you know, I would just ask my colleagues and yes, we're going to work through our public safety committee and city staff to identify more solutions. And I'm committed to doing that.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you. I'm just gonna make a quick, quick comment as well. I just want to make sure that we to add as well that I appreciate the conversation and think there's no bigger issue right now in the city than ensuring that we are adequately addressing this issue of crime that's beginning to increase across the city.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And we know that it's not a challenge that we have alone is a challenge that we share with almost every major city, particularly in the state of California. And on the issue of guns. The chief has often said that we are now seizing more guns today than we have in recent memory.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So we seized more guns were seizing more this year than we did last year. We seized more guns last year than we did the year before. And we're just seeing more and more illegal guns on the street. And so that is a incredibly serious concern, I think, of everyone that certainly is of the police departments, and that'",
        "'speaker_10': 'is something that we need to address. In addition, I think that we have to also having a realistic and honest conversation about the resources that our police department has. I think they are doing everything they can with what they got.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I just want to thank them for for their hard work. They're out there. They're out there every single day working very hard. And and we know that it's it's it's incredibly tough. And so we appreciate them. And I want to thank everyone that's had the discussion tonight.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'There's a lot more to do. The just as important is and the chief will say this, as important as policing is violence prevention and making sure that ah that there's parks for kids to play in, making sure the programs are strong, making sure that services are in place for those in need that need them as well.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And so I think that that approach has to be a unified approach and it's crime fighting, but it's also violence prevention and ensuring that people have access to to economic opportunity and to and to safety in their neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So I will say to Mr. City Manager, it's I think it's partly related. The sooner that we can implement our citywide LED light program, I know we've started that. I think the better we've having visited some of our test neighborhoods that are that are seeing that it's it is a dramatic difference of how bright we change neighborhoods'",
        "'speaker_10': 'and we had that light. So the sooner the better. And in fact, we should speed up that process if possible. Let me turn this over to the public. Anyone any public comment on this item? Please come forward.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Karen Refight again. We will never get ahead of this problem as long as we continue to be reactive instead of proactive. Before I retired, I worked for the Boys and Girls Clubs for six years. I've done over 30 years in youth work, many of it in gang infested territories.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I actually employed gang members, ex-gang members in one of my previous jobs. Five years ago, I wrote the Calgary grants pro bono for the city. Those grants were proactive grants and they were incredibly successful. Pat West and Community Development made a decision to shift in a different direction.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There are differences and gang members. Adult gangs are different than youth involved in gangs. We need to identify those differences and create programs that divert our youth away from being wanting to be involved in gangs. Some of the kids have no choice with their in a third, now fourth or fifth generation family that's gang involved.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You have to do something really drastic to break that gang cycle. As long as we deny that that Long Beach has a major drug problem. And Councilwoman Price, your comments just right on. Long Beach is one of the main entry points for drugs in the United States, and we need to have more resources.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think one of the escalations in the gang violence is because we no longer have the gang unit. The gang unit was actually, I think, very critical in reducing the impact of gangs on our city. So I hope that the committee can discuss some of these options.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I really hope that you would look at the Calgary program that was that could have been a model program. And many cities copied that grant and used it to get a grip, a Calgary crowd to their own. So I think we've missed an opportunity here and this is part of what the outcome is for missing the opportunity'",
        "'speaker_2': '. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you. See no other public comment? I'll take it back to the council. This as they believe you receive and file by Councilman Austin. Please go out and cast your vote. And then staff. He'll be returning hopefully at some point here too with the much more report things.'",
