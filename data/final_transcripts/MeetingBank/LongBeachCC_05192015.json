One of the important designations that this comes with is that anybody who comes to Long Beach will now know that the history that we have of our service men and women who have come through Long Beach, through its past history as not only a naval station, but also with our naval hospital and currently with our veterans'",

        "'speaker_2': 'I'm very proud of our city and appreciate the local chapter of the Military Order of the Purple Heart for asking us to partner in honoring our vets. These are things that I think. We shouldn't take for granted, but we do because there isn't a single person that doesn't know someone that's served valiantly for our country.'",

The recognition of honor of those who had unselfishly sacrifice themselves in war by protecting and assuring our freedoms. This unselfish sacrifice has been exemplified since World War Two by the awarding of roughly 1.9 million.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Item 11 Communication from Councilman Austin, Councilwoman Gonzalez and Councilwoman Price. Recommendation to request the city attorney to draft a resolution in support of the Meatless Mondays campaign.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. There's no motion. Councilmember Austin. Turn this over to Councilor Austin.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And I'd like to thank my colleagues, Councilmember Gonzalez and Price, for joining me on this item. Before you are to consider a resolution in support of the Meatless Mondays campaign, the City Council has often had agenda items that merely seek to raise awareness about certain community issues.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Just as in the past, when the City Council has passed resolutions in support or opposing propositions or in support of wearing a certain color for certain cause, it did not mean that we were expecting that everybody would necessarily vote a certain way or require that anyone wear a certain color in support of a certain cause.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Tonight's agenda is merely a way to wear, raise awareness and add to the dialog about the need for healthier food options, including more fruits and vegetables to be available. And raising awareness on this issue, I believe, is important to Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'A study a few years ago showed that Long Beach had the highest rate of obesity and overweight children between the ages of two and five, anywhere in California, a rate of 40%. Recent studies have indicated that nearly half of all fifth, seventh and eighth graders in Long Beach are considered overweight or obese by federal standards.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Obesity, especially in children, can have lifelong health impacts, including diabetes, hypertension, heart diseases, heart disease and some types of cancer. Many cities have adopted similar resolutions in recent years. Meatless Mondays, including Los Angeles, San Jose, Oakland and San Francisco.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Many restaurants and schools have also embraced this concept and have expanded the healthy options that they offer if even for one day a week. People think a little bit more about what they're eating and consider trying new, healthier menu options.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Then this resolution will have accomplished its purpose. I'm glad. I'd like to thank my constituent, Mr. Roy Drew Alexis, for helping me become aware of this campaign and bring it to the city council's attention. And I would ask for your full support of this, I think, worthwhile motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilwoman Gonzales. Oh.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I want to thank Councilman Austin for bringing this forward. I know that it's been a hot topic lately all of a sudden, but I signed onto the agenda item because having a different perspective, in my opinion, on eating habits is extremely important.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Our eating behaviors have contributed to more than two thirds of adults and one third of children becoming overweight or obese. And I've also learned that my own alma mater, Cal State, Long Beach, their dining hall, encourages meatless Mondays, offering a variety of vegetarian options.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In addition, the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee also made strong recommendations. Their advice, of course, is to adopt a plant strong diet, meaning more fruits and vegetables and fewer animal products. In addition, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization stated that the meat industry generates nearly one fifth of the man made greenhouse gas emissions that are accelerating climate'",
        "'speaker_2': 'change worldwide. And astonishingly enough, this statistic totals more than the emissions from transportation alone. This cuts down on your meat. Cutting down on your meat intake can help conserve water as well. And an estimated 1800 to 2500 gallons of water go into a single pound of meat of beef, whereas other meat alternatives such as tofu only take'",
        "'speaker_2': '220 gallons of water per pound. So in addition to being healthy and making this merely your recommendation, it's also a global idea of ensuring we're being sustainable, that we're being more environmentally conscious and friendly, and especially in a city that is moving more towards community gardens and healthy food options.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I welcome my council colleagues to support this. And thank you, Councilman Austin and Councilman Price.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilwoman Price.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. I, too, want to thank Councilman Austin for bringing this forward. And I want to reiterate what he said, which is this is a a campaign to raise awareness. It's not a mandate by any stretch of the imagination.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I think that's important to to think about it in this context. The initiative was created in association with Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. It's a campaign to promote healthy habits, and starting the campaign on a monday really promotes good choices for the start of the week.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This is the same message that I shared with my family last night when they asked me why we were not having my famous spaghetti sauce that I use that has ground beef in it. I told them that we were not having that last night, that we were going to participate in Meatless Mondays and and explain to them'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the benefits of using the opportunity to have more fruits, vegetables and salads in our diet. It's something that we don't do. And I think it's a really great opportunity for them to learn different alternatives in terms of their diet and making healthy choices.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This initiative has been embraced by multiple school districts because they want to encourage healthy eating at a young age. In fact, it's interesting. In 2010, Fox News Sunday House Call with Dr. Isidore Rosenfeld aired a segment featuring Meatless Mondays.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'He cited that studies showed that meat consumption can impede weight loss and is unhealthy. Dr. Rosenfeld still presents a healthy Monday tip on his show each week. I thought that might be a relevant fact this evening. Studies have led to lots of policies and initiatives over the years that are embraced by local governments smoking laws and prohibitions'",
        "'speaker_2': ', restrictions, snack offerings at school, promoting healthy snack options for children. This is just another opportunity to raise awareness within our city and to encourage our residents to think about their lifestyle, their welfare, their future health, and really to take it as an opportunity to choose if they want to try something different.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'On Mondays, why not give it a shot? Thank you, Councilman Austin, for bringing this forward.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Ringo.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Bear. I want to commend my colleagues for bringing this forward. It's obvious that there are many studies that show that meat can be very harmful to one's health. And having one day out of the week to just stay away from eating meat products is, I think, commendable.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'One of the things that I always look forward to in terms of meals is that diversity and the opportunity to eat and try other things and doing it once a week, I think, is does it provide any greater harm than it than trying to do anything else and anything in in great quantities?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Having great quantities is always going to hurt you. So I want to commend my council members on this. I support it and I look forward to Meatless Mondays. Maybe something less Tuesdays, too.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. I have Councilwoman Mango.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. I would be remiss if I didn't offer a few alternatives. How about pro veggie Monday or care about what you eat Monday or sugar free Monday? I've had calls from some businesses specifically that serve meat and steak and things like that, and it really contributes to the health of their business.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And we as an organization could encourage or encourage restaurants and eateries to. Expand their selection. But if we were really passionate about meeting Meatless Monday, then maybe our own cafeteria should be meatless. I really am going to stand with the businesses today.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I do support eating salads. I had a salad for dinner last night and I think it's a great thing. I just don't think that city government really should be in the business of telling people and making proclamations based on preferences.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But thank you for bringing the item forward. It is important and I hope that our city and our constituents and our our children will really look at the sugar intake that they have and how that impacts obesity, because I do have diabetes in my family.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. We're going to go now to public comment. So please come forward for public comment and then we will come back to council. Thank you, Mr. Mayor, vice mayor and council members. My name is Drew Alexis.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm a Long Beach resident, and I support the issuance of a Meatless Mondays proclamation. And thank you for your service to Long Beach and for allowing for this discussion. Some may fear that a proclamation is government intrusion into one's personal choices.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I want to get some background on the campaign, because the campaign is really designed to do nothing more than provide information concerning the impact of our food choices on our health and on the environment, and simply to encourage us to make healthy decisions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Meatless Monday started during World War One. It was a campaign to urge Americans to reduce their consumption of staples to aid in the war effort. Meatless days were introduced to encourage Americans to show support for the war and free resources to furnish to our European allies.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The campaign was established again during World War Two to help the nation's Second World War effort. And in the immediate postwar years, the campaign was continued to help feed war ravaged Europe. In 2003, researchers at Johns Hopkins University recommended cutting meat intake by 15% to lower the risk of preventable diseases.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The School of Public Health launched the Meatless Monday campaign as a public health awareness campaign, and of course, Monday was selected because research shows that Monday is the perfect day to kick start healthy weekly behavior. Since 2010, Meatless Monday proclamations have been passed in 16 cities, including five in California.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Many of these cities have found that passage of a proclamation is an opportunity to involve the community in the values expressed in the campaign. In Loudoun County, Virginia, for example, one of the most conservative Republican counties in Virginia.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'After passing a meatless Monday proclamation, the county partnered with area restaurants to offer special dishes, discounts and a lottery for free meatless meals, not surprisingly, and to address Councilwoman Mango's comment, many restaurants and communities that have adopted these proclamations actually support the proclamations completely because Monday is traditionally not a busy day for restaurants.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's a community based campaign to promote meatless meals on Monday may serve as a very good business opportunity for many of our local restaurants. In a few moments, you will hear from individuals who will share some important environmental benefits of eating meatless on Mondays.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I wanted to to share a few words as to why Meatless Monday is also beneficial to our health. To quote Dr. Lawrence Hansen, a professor at UC San Diego School of Medicine who spoke at a school district meeting in San Diego.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I have five reasons why the district should adopt Meatless Mondays heart disease, cancer, stroke, diabetes and obesity. It is no surprise that many hospitals and 28 teams from the most prestigious U.S. public health schools support the campaign as a tool to fight these awful and often preventable diseases.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It is also no surprise that well-respected organizations working to advance public interest, such as the American Public Health Association, also endorse Meatless Mondays. According to a study by UCLA, 40% of children in Long Beach are obese. The American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics recommends reducing meat consumption to decrease the risk of various health problems, including obesity.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health concluded that by replacing meat with an equal serving of legumes, healthy grains are nuts. One day a week would reduce the risk of early mortality by as much as 11%. Given the staggering rate of obesity in Long Beach we can afford, can we afford not to take reasonable steps to'",
        "'speaker_0': 'influence our residents to enjoy meatless meals at least one full day per week? I encourage you to vote in favor of this resolution. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Hello. My name is Vince Plods in. I moved to Long Beach in the late seventies while attending Long Beach State. I have watched the city grow and become a great place to live. My family and I reside in Susy Price's district.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'As as we all know, California is in a historic drought. Neither the short or the long term prognosis is encouraging. We are all being asked to take major steps to conserve water. Shorter and less frequent showers, brown lawns, etc..'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And this is fair. This is not just a governmental issue. This is a citizen and a community problem. However, this is literally a drop in the bucket. We are ignoring the elephant in the room. The meat and dairy industry is responsible for almost half of California's water usage.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Production of meat and animal products use more than half of the U.S. is freshwater supply. More of California's total water usage goes to livestock than any other cause. This is not sustainable. The estimated water to produce a pound of beef is a conservative.'",
        "'speaker_10': '1800 gallons. 700 gallons for a pound of pork, 430 gallons for a pound of eggs. Cattle need more water than any other large land mammal. Dairy cows range between 30 to 50 gallons per day. At first I found these numbers staggering, almost unbelievable.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I researched it further and verified it with multiple sources. My next question was How can Ralphs or McDonald's possibly show a profit? Agro farming is very heavily government subsidized, so you are not just paying for your burger, you are paying for everyone else's.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'There is a very real connection between animal based diets and devastating water shortages. A vegan, meaning no meat or dairy diet, averages between three and 400 gallons daily. Vegetarian diet includes dairy jumps to approximately 1000 gallons daily. A heavy meat based diet can rise to 4000 gallons daily.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Consequently, it takes less water to produce a year's food for a vegan diet than to produce a month's food for a heavy, carnivorous one. If these numbers do not seem important, I believe they will. Cutting animal products from meals one day a week would save an enormous amount of water.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Change always comes with criticism and scrutiny, as it should. The perception that meat is necessary for protein is a myth. There are cultures and religions that are meatless and have and have sustained for many, many centuries. No one is going to be force fed broccoli or broccoli, only diet.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'This is merely a suggestion that we keep an open mind and look at all of our options. Here are some of the people already on board for Meatless Mondays. 50 school districts, 100 colleges and universities. Over 650,000 meatless meals are served in the L.A. Unified School District.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And Meatless Monday resolutions have been passed in Dallas, Boston, Berkeley, Oakland and San Francisco. Think of it like Taco Tuesdays, but with many, many more options and healthy benefits. On a personal note, my parents, members of the great generation, dine primarily on the American diet, meat and potatoes.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'My father died of heart disease. My mother passed of diabetes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I don't serve. I'm sorry. Time's up. Time's up. But I don't think you call it.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I just think this is a I would respectfully encourage that. The Long Beach City Council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Serve time. Time is over.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I thank you for this opportunity.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hello. My name is Genesis Butler and I'm eight years old. I go to school and Monica Elementary and I love the city of Long Beach. I'm a vegan child. And one of the main reasons I went vegan is because of the damage.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Eating meat is taking not only your health but the environment too. I researched the meat industry after my mom told me some facts and that is when I found out raising cattle and killing cattle for food is taking a toll on the planet.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The animal and agriculture industry is hurting our planet. 18% greenhouse gas emissions are from animal agriculture. That this is more exhaust from all transportation, from animal agriculture is also leading ocean dead zones, water pollution and habitat destruction. It is also affecting our water supply.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Right now, we're in the worst drought in history. We kept being told to take shorter showers or not. What are you? But that's only 4%. California's water footprint is linked to direct household use. The water footprint for meat and dairy is 47%.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It takes it makes much more sense to urge people to limit eating meat. The footprint is a lot higher than the footprint for direct household use. I'm a kid and I'm really scared about the drought. I'm afraid I won't have water near the future.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We can do something about this by having Meatless Monday for our city. I really think people will accept it and want to give it a try after they learn how much water it takes to make a meat dish.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Did you know it takes 2500 gallons of water to produce a pound of meat? That's the same as a cup of showering. I know children will also be willing to give it a try when they learn. When I eat my lunch with my friends, they always throw away all their school lunch and only the piece of fruit'",
        "'speaker_2': 'or dessert. Because I see the rest of the nasty. They all they always eat all my food, my meatless lunches. My mom sent me when she even had to start sending me more food because they were eating all my food.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Recently with Congressman Tony Cardenas said, We all have the tools to make a difference. Sometimes they're disguised as fortune knives. Let's put them in a good use. I agree with Mr. Cardenas. The city of Long Beach can save hundreds of millions of gallons of water each week by saving by not having me one day out of the'",

        "'speaker_12': 'We allow for diet sodas and diet teas. Overall in terms of the vending machine impact, the original contract that went into place prior to this healthy policy, we had 146 vending machines and about $300,000 in revenue. The RFP did not go back for renegotiation.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Instead, we went on a month by month contract. Prior to that month by month, they had already had a decline to 63 vending machines.

        "'speaker_6': 'So my first question is in regards to the policy in terms of vending, have how do we ensure that the that the vending machines stock what we say that they stock in terms of the sugars, sugar free beverages?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So how do we regulate that?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'When the when the policy first went into effect. So the contract for the vending machines that are covered under this policy is operated by Parks Rec and Marine. At the time that this policy went to a death to effect, coped advised PR and that they all the nine noncompliant machines would be replaced and that they would bring'",
        "'speaker_12': 'them into compliance. At that time that was done. Beyond that, there hasn't really been much more enforcement of the policy other than anytime that we have new product offerings in new machines, we make sure that they cover that they are stocked correctly.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Great. And then in terms of the actual snacks at events, so are all the departments at this point participating in that?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Well, right now it's just youth focused. So snacks are only focused on youth, which is essentially parks and rec, afterschool programs, those kinds of things. And yes, they're engaged in that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. So so Parks Library sort of are front line departments that do youth related work. Right. Compliant with the policy? Yeah. Okay. So walk me through one final time. If we were to say that, hey, we you know, we've got momentum here.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We've we've done what we said we were going to do in terms of this policy. And we want to take it to take it to the next step and take it further. What would be your recommendation, what it specifically be in terms of the snacks, or is there more that we can do in terms of the vending'",
        "'speaker_6': 'machines as well?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So the first the first as we as I ended the presentation, so we would focus the healthy snack and beverage policy to expand that to our community meetings. So we'd be working with adults and youth in that part, groundbreaking and ribbon cutting.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So that is a lot of the outward facing activities that we do as a city with our with our community. So that would be the first place there are conversations going on about vending opportunities. And there, you know, that there are possibilities.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'A lot of cities have moved to a 50% healthy and then others have moved to 100% healthy options in their vending.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Sure. So so that said, I know that the policy as it is, it limits us to youth focused then outward facing vending machines, the inward facing sort of like at our public works yards and everything are not regulated.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then our outward facing, youth focused events are, you know, the policy applies to but not to the adult oriented. So what you're saying is, as a next step, we can go to just outward facing and events in general.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We provide healthy options and then and then just make sure that inward facing vending machines have a 5050 split. So you would recommend that that's the next step.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'That's a current that that is the current conversation. The American Heart Association has been in conversation with, uh, Councilman Austin and with me about some of that, some of that work.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay, good. So I think that's where, where we want to go. So do you need a motion on that to make that happen? So I'd like to just make that motion and that's that'll be my motion that we go ahead and move forward with the next step.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The next update to the healthy snack and beverage policy.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. There's been a motion in a second. I'm just trying to understand that I thought that we were doing that. But let me let me continue to go down the speaker's list here. So there's the motion. I think the city attorney is to move forward with the planets could would be a substitute motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right. There was an original motion corrected.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'On the maker of the original motion. I just push that still and it would be right. So, yes, I'm changing my original motion. I think what it is, is I think the best way to say it is to amend our policy to include the new the next step in regulation.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So that will be the motion.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So I read it so that we would expand the healthy snack and beverage policy to cover community meetings, groundbreaking and ribbon cuttings. And then as we are looking at new new vending contracts would be a 5050. So it would provides a healthy choice within the vending itself.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There's been a motion who seconded that. I'm sorry. Councilor Brosnan, is that you? Or could you just push the motion so we have the motion. Okay. We got Richardson and your Ranga. Next up, I have a concern for your English.'",

It's very difficult to find a place that has anything other than iceberg lettuce. It's just very different than the culture that we have in California.'",

And especially given the report that you've given us tonight, the efforts that you're undertaking to teach the youth and about healthy choices and make sure that we are putting into place all that's necessary for them to be able to actually effectuate and carry out those those choices.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'We've been doing conversation for a few months now with the American Heart Association working to build community support with community organizations. It's just unfortunate that they weren't here to be here to to see this. But I think their their hard work is certainly recognized in Councilmember Richardson's substitute motion.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We had actually planned on bringing this this item before this council four four on a separate motion or agenda item. But it's here before us this evening, and I'm happy to support it because it's the right thing to do.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There are a lot of people who have dietary restrictions, who are diabetic in the city of Long Beach. And this, I think, goes to prevent that, but also provide options for those individuals to to to use the vending machines and understand that there's going to be a healthy choice in front of them.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilor Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thanks, Mr. Mayor. So just a couple of things. And I started the conversation a little earlier with the Public Works director and parks director about this item and just want to clarify a few things. So initially, we cobbled together resources for many, many years to make this project happen.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then we went out to bid and the bid came back $1,000,000 too much to make the project to go ahead and initiate the project. So the direction was to go back, scale back the project a bit and to go back to bids so we have enough money to actually finish the project.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The item today lists that we have $7 million on hand, made up of 1.5 million from California Coastal Conservancy, 3.5 million from L.A. and San Gabriel Rivers and Mountains Conservancy and 2 million from L.A. County, Regional Park and Open Space District.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But the January 24th item from 2012 said that we had $7,717,593 toward the project, which is a lot closer to the 8 million where the bid came in, which if we received this other funding, we'd be there, wouldn't have to phase the project.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So the difference is the amount of funds is just different. So I was hoping for an explanation. The new so what originally was dedicated was California Resources Agency. It had two and a half million. It's not listed in this item.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'L.A. Regional Open Space District had two and a half million. And on this one, it's 2 million. So that's that's half a million less. A few years later, that's listed here, L.A. and San Gabriel Rivers Mountains Conservancy is a million.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Whereas it was 3,000,500. Listen, this item. And then 217,000. California Coastal Conservancy, previous grant and then 1.5 million from the same organization, California State Coastal Conservancy. I know that a lot of times we have to repackage things to make them balanced.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I understand that. But $700,000 is too large of a number to not ask out in public what happened to those resources. Secondly, when we went out to bid on this and we said we wanted to phase it into two phases so that we can move forward in a in a in a in a timely manner.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The hope was that it wouldn't expand the cost to $10 million. The original bid was 8.5 million. With this council item list that the project, the total cost will be $10 million. Now, I know if we phase it, obviously there will be more costs over time.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's why the project is more expensive now. But would it make sense to not phase it and do one project scale the project back while we have $8 million here, scale it back and move forward on it now.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So this is just a list of questions that I was hoping that we can have resolved today.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Certainly, Councilman, I can answer that. The there is a discrepancy of $700,000 that was in the Public Works Capital Projects Fund that was used for design and construction documents. So the availability of that money is no longer there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I would say this project is being scaled back so that we can get something done. I think it's an exciting project and we will get something done. And what's going to get done is 34 acres of wetlands habitat, the creation of trails, wayfinding signs, interpretive signs and landscaping.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So what gets left out of this in terms of another phase which allows us to to pursue grant funding for the remainder of it is things like planting of the south basin, which is like $1,000,000 native enhancement plantings, that's probably another 380,000.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So there's some major items that can happen with the current money. There's not eight millions not available or 7.7 is not available because of design and project costs and soft costs and a permitting and that sort of thing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Really the amount of money available is about 6.2 million. So we've got to bring scale the project back to 6.2 million. We think we can give you something really nice for 6.2 million and then build the other pieces in through the grant funding.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And this is one piece of that grant funding which allows the wetlands to be accessible.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Great. So just to reiterate, so now that we're taking this two phased approach, about 6.2 million will be the first phase. And then the other 3 million, three, $3 million that we have to fine will go to phase two.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Can you just highlight again that? So my understanding phase one is primarily the nature center, which is the the entrance at the Forest Park in the ninth District and some of the, you know, beginning work. But really the south portion is the extra, the south portion additional planting and some of the nature trails.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The second phase and my understanding.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So the south portion is accessible to people. Right now, there's some invasive vegetation that really does need to come out and put native vegetation in as part of the project. And there's also the the levy native perennial grass plantings that we need to do at a later date.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So those are kind of the major items. There's like two or $3 million worth of that sort of project. And that can also be done with the help of the California Conservation Corps. So you're getting right now with this is, again, wetlands, the creation of trails, wayfinding signs, interpretive signs, landscaping.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And this actually connects to the the biggest wet wetlands that the county provided. So it is a great project and I wish we could do the entire thing. Unfortunately, the plants were done several years ago and there are escalation costs.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So the way to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Do it is to get this first phase done. And I think we can find funds for a little bit easier with this first phase done.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thanks. So just one final question. So we'll be out to bid and finish with the we'll be ready to break ground when on phase one.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'I want to thank you for bringing this up. It's important that the community know what's going on this summer, because I think it's one of those situations where we have to keep our youth busy.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilor Andrews.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes, thank you, Mayor. I also would like to thank our contribution to bringing this item forward, because it's important that we do have a variety of summer activities for our youth. And my greatest concern is that we don't have enough activities going on, you know, in each park.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I say it, I've said it several times before, and I will continue to say it. Like you say, I'm a busy child. It's a good challenge. And I'll keep that theme, you know, out the trouble. Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We like that. Councilman manga.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think I'd like to add a small friendly to have them also provide something that we as council members can put into our newsletters and a Twitter and the such. Because each and every one of us has a constituency and a following, thousands of community members that could could really take advantage.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And while a report is important for all of us to know, I think that short picture oriented links to where kids can go in the community. And then I'll also use this as a quick forum. I'm a supporter of people making a living.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's just also important to know that the city of Los Angeles and the. The decision that they made today to increase up to $15 an hour without minimum wage for minimum wage, without an exclusion for our youth programs, actually dilutes the number of youth jobs available because the feds don't take that into consideration.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So if we're going to have this dialog locally about minimum wage, we need to be advocating at the federal level that cities that have a higher minimum wage would receive an apportionment of funding that would be equivalent to the work hours of the summer youth and or an exemption for summer youth programs.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Because these entry level jobs for youth that are coming out of mixed shop workforce development are critical to their ability to hold a job long term. So just looking into how the summer youth jobs fit into all of this and finding a way that those aren't depleted dramatically with the the future of wages in our community.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Gonzales.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's great that we're looking. We just looked at after school programs and we're looking at summer programs. And I'll tell you, you know, our city staff is amazing in the sense that, you know, when we especially with communities that certainly need it, like Washington neighborhood, I'm hitting it pretty hard and I know that we have be safe'",
        "'speaker_2': 'there. We have be safe at Drake Park and it's really working collaboratively with our departments as well. Health Department, we're going to be doing a canvass out in Washington neighborhood to make sure that people know about the summer program.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I would even encourage my council colleagues to do that as well. And I think our development services, our health department, Pacific Gateway for collaborating with us on that, because otherwise, you're right, sometimes these folks would not know about these summer programs.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think every effort that we can take to do that at the council offices and just as a city is is great. So thank you for bringing this forward.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Any public comment on the item? CNN. Please cast your vote.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilwoman Pryce. Motion carries unanimously.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And finally, 25.'"

The World Trade Center health program finishes in October 2015 and the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund October 2016.
