    "Recommendation to direct City Manager to create an open streets initiative and explore ways to open more public space throughout Long Beach to allow for increased outdoor activities, safer access to public transit, and stronger economic recovery, all while maintaining appropriate social and physical distancing.": [
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, motion carries. We still have a few minutes for for our budget study session. The time served so a few minutes away. So why don't we go ahead and do the Open Streets Initiative item 11, and then we'll we'll we'll be in time for the for the budget session.'",
        "'speaker_0': '530 Madam Clerk.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Communication from Mayor Garcia, Councilmember Pierce, Councilman Price, Councilmember Your Honor, Councilman Austin. Recommendation directs City Manager to create an Open Streets Initiative.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I want to just first of all, just think that all the council members that have been a part of this and who have been a lot of discussions in the community and we really appreciate where this is going.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I want to just say some couple general comments. First, let me start saying that we know that the COVID crisis that we're in right now is a serious one and it certainly is a health crisis. First and foremost, but it's also an economic crisis.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And it's an economic crisis that affects small businesses, especially it affects communities. And I think that the council should be commended for the creativity and innovation that is coming out with new ideas and how we help our businesses and community.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have been aggressive in working with our state, our county partners and how we reopen. I think that with some great ideas from our Restart Long Beach Advisory Group, from many of the council committees and from some of the small business owners themselves.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so we want to thank everyone. One idea that certainly is not a new one, but it's one that is beginning to grow across the country. And quite frankly, the world is reactivating our open landscape and our streets for the public, even more so than it is today.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so what we have in front of us is a new Open Street initiative that is going to want to explore ways to open up more public space throughout our city for increased outdoor activities, safer access to transit, a stronger economic recovery, and to allow us to physically distance and be safe within our own city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We know that as restaurants begin to open, they are going to be limited in how they reopen because of space if we want them to be successful. There are opportunities to allow them to reopen and expand sidewalk dining, expand tables and chairs onto the street and into public spaces, reopen some of our parking lots to some of'",
        "'speaker_0': 'these restaurants and retailers and really provide additional business support for these businesses as they begin get ready as they begin preparing to reopen. I'll also add that this initiative would look at not just how it would help businesses and restaurants especially, but also communities.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And you are seeing now the different cities are reopening up small neighborhood corridors across the city and limiting traffic. And so they become kind of spaces, public spaces for people to enjoy, to walk, to recreates, to ride their bikes in a way that's safe.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And what's great about Long Beach is we have a great tradition of being leaders and trailblazers when it comes to open space and activating pedestrian access. You think about the Parklets movement, which really began in many ways here in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You think about our early innovations and the related bike infrastructure that happened here in our community. And so we've always led the way on these issues, and this would allow us to continue that work. And so the recommendation in front of us is to direct the city manager to create an open street initiative and explore ways to'",
        "'speaker_0': 'open up more public space. The plan should include options that would enable creative opportunities for outdoor dining and and as well as recreation opportunities across the city. And I'll just make a couple of comments and I'll turn it over to the two the coauthors of the motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'd like, as part of this motion to also explore. There's been some ideas about, for example, doing drive ins in some of our convention center lots in the downtown. I want to explore that as well. There's a lot of interest in doing kind of the drive in movie theater style expansion of public space because those lights are'",
        "'speaker_0': 'ours, our public lots, and I'd like us to move quickly. First, you know, we certainly don't want to create open street projects in an areas that that that may not work. This is certainly not a mandate to do them everywhere, but four, four neighborhoods, council offices, businesses that want to partner with the city to create these spaces'",
        "'speaker_0': '. It should be a kind of project by project review. And I think if I can ask also staff to move quickly in a time is now and I'd love to see some of these neighborhood corridors opening up soon and I expect the council members to be very active in how they want to see these open.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think they're getting requests from restaurants and businesses. And so I think I'd love to see the councilmembers engage within their own districts and create these opportunities as they see how those partnerships in the community. And so that is that is the motion that we have in front of us.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I do have Councilmember Pearce who's made the motion. I have a I have a second by Councilmember Andrews. So let me begin with Councilwoman Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mayor, and thank you to all the businesses. Residents, the neighborhood associations that have chimed in. I think the support that I've received or heard has been overwhelming. And so I'd like to just share. I had many conversations with members of HRO and the association as a whole, the same for East Village individual members that live'",
        "'speaker_4': 'there, as well as the association and also Adobe. And what I can say is that everyone is excited about the opportunity. Everyone wants to see what city staff comes up with and everyone is saying that they would like to see something that could be flexible.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'As you mentioned, Mayor, what might be appropriate on pine might not be appropriate in a neighborhood area or might not be appropriate on Fourth Street. So with that, I'd like to share a little bit. I think there's some interesting ideas even around closing an entire street like pine that has ball bounce or curb cuts that allow for'",
        "'speaker_4': 'parklets to be put in. But then there's different streets like Fourth Street that would want to be able to make sure that people know that businesses are open in the middle. And I think that we've seen that work on promenades.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so I'm not as fearful as some might be, but I'd look to staff to come up with some ideas around signage, messaging, whether it's on the permanent or something that could be brought in temporarily for those weekends or weekdays.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That it happens, I think would be really exciting. What I've heard from Retro is that they're very excited about doing something like Thursday through Sunday. Same thing with East Village. As we know, greenhouse gases are the number one cause of greenhouse gases is transportation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So as we look at closing down these streets, it's not saying that people aren't going to drive there. But as much as we can encourage people to ride their bikes where we have additional bike parking, where we have not just drive up movies, but bike up movies.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so really taking this, again as an opportunity to have that climate lens, because we know COVID has made our climate crisis has been made worse by the COVID situation. So really making sure that these are something that are flexible but that are exciting.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'd also like to see from staff moving very quickly and after this first phase of doing it with business corridors and maybe neighborhood corridors, having a conversation around, you know, when we get to face two or phase three, what do neighborhood block parties look like?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Because we know that those have been something that have happened almost every month in a lot of neighborhoods throughout the summer, and that people are essentially doing their own selves right now. They're having musicians come out and play on the sidewalk and people are really staying in their house or on their yard to watch.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But are there some guidelines that we could put in place or a toolkit that we could also put in place so that we can create a safe space where people know that they can invite musicians or work with their council offices or the city departments to open up those spaces.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I'm excited to see what staff brings back. And again, I do want to see things move as quick as possible. I think our promenade in the downtown is a is a prime location that we should be able to open up the second that we reach that benchmark.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I look to my council colleagues for their shared support as well. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember. Remember, Vice Mayor Andrews, I'm going to just come back to you that I have some other books cued up that are coauthors. Are they? They're also cued up. So I'll come right back to you, Vice Mayor. Next up then I have is council member Austin.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Catch them here.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Austin in.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Remember. Yeah, we can hear you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Thank you. Well, thank you. And first of all, I want to thank you for bringing this item forward, Mr. Mayor. You know, I know that other cities, other cities in our state are looking at creative, innovative ways to engage community, but also support economic, commerce and communities and save our small businesses.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think that this is an item that will will help us to do just that. I know for a fact in my district, we have a number of areas that could benefit from this area. This item here and this innovative approach, obviously, because we know that what we do that do it well, we have a successful'",
        "'speaker_3': 'bid. We also have Virginia Village, an area that is up and coming. And, you know, several small businesses need the support. And so I can I can see Market Street. There's other areas throughout my district and all throughout our city, our city that will benefit greatly from this with a little bit of creativity and organization of our'",
        "'speaker_3': 'local businesses with support. And so and I think this also gives our our businesses a big latitude to create safe spaces. In support of our community as well. And so I think this is a win win. I'm fully supportive and I believe support my colleagues to do this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And then Councilmember Price.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Can you hear me?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, we can.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Oh. Thank you. So I'm wondering if there is any staff report or visuals on this concept. Before I provide comment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. Actually, you know what? Thank you, Councilwoman, because they actually did prepare slides and I was supposed to turn to them, I think, at the end of my comments. And I did not. And so let Mr. Monica and Mr. Beck we go through that those slides.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I know you've prepared some slides for the council.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes, certainly. So staff totally recognizes the urgency. We hear you loud and clear. So we did kind of accelerate the the review process. This was something that we had been working on and reviewing. So we actually are prepared tonight to give kind of a larger presentation, to show context and what these could look like.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then really, our our goal tonight is to hear from the council about what is it that you're interested in and where should we focus. And then we would work on implementation if, if we got the green light.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I will turn it to Craig and Carl Hickman to go through the the presentation that should be showing on your WebEx screen.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Tom. Mayor, members of the council, thank you for the opportunity tonight to talk about how we can utilize our public spaces to help address our COVID recovery response. What you have before you is some information that relates to how the team looks at providing open streets.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And in this presentation this evening, we're going to review kind of what our goals were and really best practices that we're seeing in other communities and kind of taking items from those best practices that we work well in in our city.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We like the idea of open streets, certainly something we've been promoting for some time with the implementation of many of our bike boulevards. I know this council's been very supportive of the concept behind Vision Zero. We look forward to sharing our Safe Streets Long Beach plan with this council in June, which I think ties in nicely to'",
        "'speaker_6': 'the Open Streets concept, like space for for businesses. We have some examples we're going to share with you this evening. And communication is going to be very important as we move forward, I think. I heard some of the council talk about flexibility.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We fully support flexibility. Every location is a little unique and different and how we approach it needs to address that location. So I'm going to ask Carl Hickman, the city's traffic engineer, to go through some of the examples.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Again, our program goals here is that we would be able to move quickly, we would be able to be efficient and have a low cost option. So when we talk about Parklets, we are not talking about the city's permanent PARKLET program, where we have specific development guidelines, but something that is call it Parklet Lite.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Being able to utilize those spaces for public activation and you'll see some of the information that we present tonight as as an example of how that could occur. So it's important that we're thinking about maintaining social rather physical distancing to help support reopening of businesses.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And that's included in here this evening as well. So with that, Karl, if you could please go through some of the information that we put together and share with council our concepts. Sir. Thank you, Craig. The next slide.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You'll see when we were first talking about Open Streets concepts for the city of Long Beach. We wanted to investigate what other cities were doing. And here in this slide, you'll see examples from Denver and Oakland, where we have partial closures of residential streets.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'These are roads that now are open for traffic. That is only local traffic. And the regular cut through traffic would be eliminated. It greatly calms traffic and gives open space for residents to use the roadway and the right of way.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Next. Next slide, you'll see in Oakland, they dedicated 10% of their entire street network to open streets concepts, and they found that 75% of the residents were in favor of those ideas. In New York City, there was an initial rollout of only a 1.5 mile stretch of road, but they've since tried to expand that to over 100'",
        "'speaker_6': 'miles of streets in late April. So as you can see, many cities have concepts that they're implementing. For businesses. On the next slide. This is from the city of Vancouver where they're exercising and utilizing flex space options. You'll see in the slide where patrons are allowed to queue up in the roadway along the curb line while still'",
        "'speaker_6': 'practicing social distancing. They're able to access the retail establishment, purchase what they need to do, and at the same time, cars can still use the roadway, drive by and stop, park whatever they may need to do. So, again, this is from Vancouver.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Also here we are, we see partial or full closures that are applicable applicable to non arterial streets where there are dense business corridors. This. These pictures here are from New York City and then in Florida. Next slide. Also, there are many examples in many cities throughout the country where they are establishing special delivery or pickup zones for'",
        "'speaker_6': 'retail establishments and restaurants so someone can stop by curbside pick up a meal, a business can have a delivery made near their business to accelerate their efficiency of their operations. So this is quite common where where they have special pickup and loading zones.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Not from a residential point of view. We already have a program here in Long Beach where we close Bayshore Drive from ocean to second, and we do that every year from June 15th to September 15th. This is a roadway where we feel we can move that start date up sooner or we can even extend it to go'",
        "'speaker_6': 'longer. So this is something that we can implement, implement rather quickly. And also from a residential standpoint, we have many bike boulevards throughout the entire city and we could do partial closures designed to discourage cut through traffic and it would slow vehicle speeds.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We have many throughout the city. To name a few, we have 15th Street, Daisy, Myrtle, Sixth Street and Vista Street bike boulevards. Again, we emphasize denser neighborhoods with limited park access. This would allow residents to get out and utilize the city right away.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So for businesses, we can have partial or full street closures. Again, we want to focus on dense retail areas on non arterial streets. And we also have retail corridors on arterials that that will require partial closures and flex zones to retain vehicle throughput.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Again, we don't want to totally shut down the cars driving by. They may want to stop in and access the business. We want to make sure we maintain that accessibility. And as far as the flex zones go, let's see here.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Trying to move forward. Where's I.T. when you need them? Okay. As far as the partial closures and flex zones for businesses, we will need to work very closely with each individual business because, again, not every situation is the same.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We have to streamline our existing sidewalk guidelines and work with each business to make sure that we can accommodate their needs. Some examples we have, we could do partial closures or flex zones on Santa Fe Avenue, PCH, to Wardlow, Second Street, Livingston, the Naples Plaza and roadways in Bixby Knolls that are yet to be determined.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Again, we're going to support retail and restaurants and businesses. In many cases, city equipment will need to be supplemented by other devices to make these partial or foreclosures happen. Our public works team does not have all of the equipment, all the tools that we need to accommodate every one of these types of requests.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We're going to need water barriers, delineation cones, signage, etc. and we may not have the ability to supply all of these devices and tools to each and every business that wants to do this kind of a program. And we're always going to consider ADA requirements.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Public safety is a priority and emergency access. We're going to communicate closely with different stakeholders to make sure that we implement and consider everybody's concerns. Right now on Pine Avenue, we have a program. We have the ability to shut down Pine Avenue, either from first to third or from first to Broadway.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And again, we have bollards there at all four intersections that we can install and we can shut down those roadways to a full closure to support business activity. This is something that we already do for for the taste of downtown and for other events.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Looks like we're having issues with the battery. And you please move forward to slide. 13. Yeah. We're on 14 now. So again, for businesses, we talked about partial closures and flex zones. There was recently a a pilot program that was enacted last week.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I understand that the event went well and this is something also that we could implement very quickly and stick with it as a good model for us as we move forward with the program. This was put on by the DLP and.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And Studio 111. Next, we have a slide here that depicts a basic traffic control setup, which we would call a soft closure. It would be for a neighborhood street where we allow local traffic to still use the street and access it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But it would be shut down to to cut through. Traffic is going to greatly calm the neighborhood and allow the residents to utilize the city right away. Next, we have an example of a partial closure on a larger street, and you'll notice that the lane closest to the curb line has been closed.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The red would be water filled barricades or delineate or something like that where we could establish parklets. We could establish dining areas, seating areas, again, to allow retail to utilize the right of way. The next slide is a full closure, where we would take a major street and do a full closure, not allow anyone into the area'",
        "'speaker_6': 'except for emergency vehicles. We again, we could allow for dining areas, seating areas, use of the right of way, maybe with plants, planters, things like that. But this would be an example of a foreclosure. Here. We took an example on Second Street, a street that we all know pretty well.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And this is where we would repurpose the lane again along the curb line. We could install diagonal parking, we could repurpose the lane to accommodate parklets additional retail space. We could allow parklets of any kind, retail, dining, things like that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And we would also allow for a closure of a side street. We would call it a street lit where the nearby side street or Minor Street would be shut down to allow for similar activities or even parking these.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This is an example of where we may even target private businesses that have private parking areas where we could utilize that space as well to accommodate some more activity. Now moving forward, we would need to have a communications plan.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'How are we going to communicate to residents? How are we going to communicate to the businesses and everyone who wants to use these zones? We'd be using signage, press releases, social media, graphics, websites, etc., etc. to get the word out about what we're trying to do in the Open Streets program.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Guidelines and next steps. We want to make sure that we streamline sidewalk dining guidelines. Again, we want to be flexible and be able to move nimbly and quick. So we would need to streamline our processes and make these programs happen for the residents and for the businesses.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We need to identify available city resources, see what we have on hand, what could be used, and anticipate what we may have to have businesses or residents perhaps rent or purchase. Again, we have to develop traffic control plans similar to the ones that I showed earlier, where we're going to call out exactly what is needed equipment wise'",
        "'speaker_6': 'and how the setups are going to take place. And we're going to continue conversations with all the stakeholders to make sure that all of folks considerations or needs are met. We want to make sure that safety is a priority.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then we're going to again roll out the communications plan, amend the program as we move along. Again, we have to be flexible. We're going to be collecting public and stakeholder feedback at all times and reevaluate our processes and how we do things as we move forward.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Again, this is rather unique for the city, but I think that we can be flexible enough and accommodating and make things happen. Thank you. I welcome your comments. Thank you, Carl. So just a couple things that I wanted to add to the to provide a little context to how do we move this forward.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We have the team looking at how we manage current guidelines for, say, a PARKLET program where we believe we can get that done in a different process, where maybe the city takes the initiative to put in place some of the elements that were shared with you this evening, working closely with the business districts to align what would'",
        "'speaker_6': 'work in a particular area, and then kind of having a public private partnership where the businesses, for example, could put tables and chairs into the space that the city creates. We're also working actively with our partner at Metro to see if we can identify some funding to help move this forward.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we're fairly far along. We're looking forward to hearing, as the city manager said, direction from council this evening and we stand ready to implement any guidelines that you recommend. That concludes our report, and we're open for questions.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Beck. Thank you. And thank you for the presentation. And I want to thank Councilman Price for noting the presentation, because I went right by. It is a lot of work, so thank you guys for all that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Can I bring this back over to Councilwoman Price? Councilwoman Price. Councilwoman Pryce. Okay, I'm going to come back to Councilwoman Pryce. Let me go to the other maker of the motion, which was Councilwoman Zendaya's.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mayor, and thank you very much city staff and Councilmember Jeanine for bringing this up. This is so exciting for me. Not only am I excited to see what this is going to look like and especially that summer's coming up, I think that this is going to be very important.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I'm also very excited to see that we will be paying attention to the ADA accessibility issues that might come up, and especially because we have a lot of people in the first district, my district, with mobile devices as well as myself.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I thank you for taking that into consideration. And I can't wait to to see this happening and have it out in our street. So thank you for putting so much work into this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilwoman, I think we have Councilwoman Pryce back.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Enter your access code or.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Anything meeting followed by. Mr. Mayor, can you hear me?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. You can hear me. Okay. Thank you. I want to thank staff for the presentation. I thought that was an excellent presentation and I want to thank the mayor for bringing this forth. This is a concept that we have thought about for many years in terms of whether or not a temporary closure of some streets would make'",
        "'speaker_2': 'sense so that we have, you know, a day or two where there's no cars traveling on the street and we just have pedestrian and bike access similar to how we do streets. But it's always seemed like such a huge undertaking that really in Belmont.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sure, we only do that for the car show. But but I love the idea of being able to expand this concept. I will say that we are doing everything we can to think about being nimble and being flexible in terms of our businesses, getting ready to reopen and helping them expand their capacity so that they can get'",
        "'speaker_2': 'back to a place of economic viability once we get underway. And Parklets are one of the things that we've talked a lot about. What I've communicated with the businesses in the shore is that, you know, for Parklets we do have to give up parking spaces which have been at a premium in Belmont.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sure. Since this court, the corridor is generally very active, especially in the evenings and on the weekends. And so maybe in the in the as we explore this option, maybe we try a pilot program where we have, you know, maybe three or four retailers or restaurants participate so that we're not giving up too many parking spaces and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'see how it works and see how the functionality is and fine tuned where we need to. And if the investment in the parklet is not too great, then it's something that we can have the a rotating concept where hopefully many of the as many businesses as want to can participate in it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I really only envisioned it for Second Street right now, but I definitely see it working on Broadway as well, where we have a business corridor that borders the second district. I know Taste already has a parklet concept on Broadway, which is working out really well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I think this is a great concept. I love the idea that council woman peers raised in terms of music and having music on the street and being able to showcase other art on the streets and and really make it a user friendly, pedestrian, bicycle friendly experience for people without impacting.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So the residential neighborhoods that are adjacent to these corridors too much. So thank you very much, Mr. Mayor, for bringing this forth. I look forward to having detailed conversations with the city team in regards to specific streets where this might work in the third.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I'm grateful to have been one of the folks who signed on to this. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think it, councilwoman. We're going now to Vice Mayor Andrews.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'For thinking leadership when you say them. Because, you know, last summer we started, you know, seeing black boys in the sixties, back in the close, you're someone someone straight and made it possible for community to come out and partake in the Zumba and the free.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so I think they were looking at open space, you know, where we can come up and do something productive during these times when everyone is tired of being kind of cooped up. So, you know, I would like to chime in and suggest that we look at part in that, especially the ones that are not actively being'",
        "'speaker_3': 'used as part of the open space. You know, they could lead to create a huge iso, at least in my district. You know, we have former RDA labs that are sitting empty and we we'd like to be able to develop those and also look at them and and look at that and then be looked at to try'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to bring some sort of, you know, activity and some type of physical activity. So I'm looking forward to suggestions and to innovate this impact and think about giving. Thank you, Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, vice mayor. Next up is Councilmember Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I think this is a great item. I think it's really refreshing to see some item that's sort of tangentially related to COVID and really talks about something fun and exciting for the future is refreshing to see that we've made a commitment over the last few years to open streets.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's a well recognized commitment within our city and across the region. Just tonight in our consent calendar, we approved a grant from Sky Blue Mobile Sauce Production Committee to host another open street event, Artesia Boulevard. We got to figure that out, obviously, with social distancing and what we're dealing with.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But the fact that we received yet another grant is is more recognition that we're leaders in this space. A few months ago, I was able to go to New Zealand in my role as Vice President Stag and it was a yeah.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We were able to see firsthand some of the integrated space between our hotel we stayed in and the local restaurants and hotels across the street. The traffic was just limited to lay people pulling in the park, but it was incredible to see the way that the tables and the seats were, you know, spilled out from the restaurant'",
        "'speaker_3': 'into what would be the entire street. And there was no curb. It was all one level. You walk out the hotel across the street, there's no curb the step off. And there were barriers that are movable that really made the space safe and cars sort of meandered and everything was safe.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It was really interesting to see. It was very well done. Locally, I know a number of great examples. There's a farmer's market that I love, I think is Redondo Beach or maybe Manhattan Beach, where they do a road diet on one side of the media and it's limited to the other side.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The meeting they do, the farmer's market. I always look at that and think Atlantic Avenue. I think maybe even Artesia Boulevard if we if we do certain things. So it's totally possible. I think we need to have a toolkit.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It was possible in all types of corridors from our commercial quarter to a residential corridor. I think it's fair to say that this level of creativity, it helps spur economic activity. So we actually need it in certain spaces.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we need to think about areas that are burgeoning, that need economic activity and how we could apply it. There are also areas like open space. I was glad to see that in the presentation. That said, I was disappointed to not see an example in North Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There are plenty of opportunity there. I would love to see more of that in the future. The Lab project, for example, is is considering certain strategies to expand walkability around the shops. It's essential now and the way we design shops.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And it's when innovations like these are built as a means to overcome barriers to emerging communities that we really help shape the region. I love that, Mr. Mayor. I love that you brought up driving. I have little ones.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We do the paramount drive in all the time. Pre stay home. Order all the time. There's plenty of opportunities for us to look at those things and all parts of our city. And the last thing I'll say is we need to look at this and it's been brought up, but we need to look at this as a'",
        "'speaker_3': 'model for how we implement and these social distancing standards for cities across the region. Because I know that both GAG and MRC are changing their grant programs to reward concepts like this, which may be helpful to public works as we find more funding where, you know, Skog and my sources both want to look for solutions like this'",
        "'speaker_3': 'in our future grant programs. So thanks to staff for the presentation. Thanks, Mr. Mayor. All the co-sponsors and I'm in full support of motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember. I have councilman proposal.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. I think the opening comment by one appears was that one size doesn't doesn't fit all. And this may not work for the fourth district. Councilman Richardson, I didn't see any examples in the presentation. The Fourth District either.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And the other comment I think Carl Hickman made was public safety is a priority, as he said that I noticed on the screen there, you know, kind of a makeshift parklet on the street without a rail. And I think part of the transportation system, we may not be able to outfit every site with all the equipment that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'we normally use. But I'd be interested in to see the kind where we don't have the rails protecting the public. I didn't get the overwhelming support from the folks in the fourth District. And the mayor and I both received an email today from one of the members of his task force, and I just want to respect his'",
        "'speaker_3': 'comments and share those little bit that where you have a very parking impacted area. Even giving up a parking lot for seating probably doesn't work. And I think overall. This restaurateur would like the focus to remain on the complete reopening.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Like, let's not lose sight that that's where you need to be. Ultimately, I wouldn't want to see this this project delayed that process at all. And I think that we're talking about phase three. The other point I wanted to make was outdoor dining opportunities that are adjacent to residential areas.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Normally that would involve a see up process. If we're fast tracking this, we'd want to know what what are the neighbors rights are? Are would there be something similar to see where neighbors could weigh in on this? And my final point would be about law enforcement and their services required.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We had an incident today in a fourth District donut shop. You can read about it and there'll be post where the shop had to be shut down due to gridlock from cars queued up. And we just have to be very wary of these types of situations.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's it. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember and Councilwoman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mayor. I want to thank Public Works for a great presentation and for your leadership on this item, Mr. Mayor. I think the one size fits all will not work, so I really do appreciate the discussions related to various things.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I also think that full reopening could even be bigger and better with opportunities like this. I think we're going to have to work hand in hand, not just with the restaurant owners, but also with the landlord. Each district very different.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And in some cases in our district where we might have said the Spring Street Business Association and they might want to set aside some of the parking lot for one of the restaurants. We need to be cognizant of grocery stores that are significantly impacted right now as well that may have crossover parking.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so with those things in mind and the opportunity to really jazz some things up in terms of if we aren't able to do this, some of these restaurants are able to even bring music to their parking lots and let people sit outside, maybe a movie, a drive, a concert.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Those kinds of things can really bring some lifeblood back. Many of the stories in the post related to the individuals who've been singing on their porch every night as people do their walks or the trolley that's been going through the neighborhood with singers on it from the same family.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Many who we can do to get people back to work and engaged and still say stay safe. Because even if every single thing was open tomorrow, the volumes are going to take a lot longer to recover as incomes take a while to recover.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And people who have been perhaps deferring their rent and other things now have debt that they need to maintain and they can't necessarily spend that disposable income that's now consumed by debt service on going out to eat and all of those things.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So for those reasons, I think that it's important to really do both and support business owners and tenants and landlords all in one big package. So I think is a creative way. As long as we can ensure that the residents are protected and the landlords are protected and the city is protected.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman, to some final comments. Just want to thank everyone for for their support staffs and a great mayor.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I had my hand up. I guess you didn't see it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Know, Councilmember, you're not in the queue, but I don't have it here. But go ahead, please.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm sorry. I did try to use the system here. I basically thank you for including me in the time as well. I really appreciate that. And looking forward to working with staff on some areas in the seventh District that I would be very, very benefiting from such a program.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And thank you for thinking of this. One of the things that I'm concerned about, obviously, is that some of these establishments are open till two in the morning. Is there going to be some curfew involved as well with this in terms of looking over what the timeframe would we would be opening street up like this or closing'",
        "'speaker_3': 'down, as has been the discussion with PD.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Councilmember, if I could address your question, I wanted to share that there is a city team involved with this. Certainly a police department is represented on the team, public works, fire department, special events, Health Development Services. So there's a number of interests and ideas that that are brought to bear as we consider any location.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I also should have maybe emphasized that what we're sharing with you on the screen this evening is proposed to be temporary in many situations that would allow us to move the quickest to install these temporary features, allow our our kind of recovery process to begin.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then as we we transition from recovery to kind of more permanent operations and then these temporary features would need to be replaced with permanent features if they were so desired. So all those questions about timing and length and noise and surroundings, those would all be considered as each location is ultimately designed.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I also wanted to make sure that I addressed the safety issue. Certainly one of the reasons I asked the traffic engineer to be part of this presentation is anything that goes into the street and the public right of way needs to have our city traffic engineers approval to ensure safety.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So nothing would get installed that was not safe. Some of the examples were examples of other jurisdictions, not necessarily what we would put here in our city and safety would be paramount. Hope that addresses your question. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah, it does, because obviously there is a public safety concern about that in regards to looking at different. Streets around the city and in all our districts. And as as it's been pointed out, each district is different and unique in its own way.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is there a budget number that we need to hear or you want to hit to to ensure that every district at least has some kind of of a business opening up with with this program? I would hate to see that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, there are many districts that well, there are some districts that have more business districts, if you will, then, than others, mine being one of them. And I would like to know if I can have at least two or three places in my in my district that would be that would benefit from this program and have'",
        "'speaker_3': 'money for it. So, I mean, is there is there a a target that we're looking at in terms of financing this? Or is there can we just go ahead and just draw the straws? How are we going to determine which streets we work with and which we don't?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So Councilmember Yanga, specifically, first, I want to address the other comments that came up. There was no intention to slight any particular disarray.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Not to look.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Like we were only trying to show a couple examples. We certainly recognize that every district has unique features and we would work with those particular representatives and members of those communities to address those unique features. As far as funding, one of the things that we're working on right now, the city has received an allocation of funds for'",
        "'speaker_6': 'beach streets. Given that we're in the middle of a COVID pandemic, it's unlikely that you'll see a beach street event occur in fiscal year 20. So the idea is we could repurpose those beach street dollars to help implement many of the items that were presented here this evening.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And if we're successful in repurposing those dollars, we think that we'll have sufficient funding to do implementation in all nine council districts. So I don't want to leave anyone with the feeling that just because they didn't see a particular representation in this in this presentation, that they're not included.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We would work with everybody to try to implement what we can with that funding. If that funding is not made available, then we will try to address that as we continue our budget discussions. But but so far the signs are positive and we think we're going to have funding to do this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. That's all I have. Thank you very much. Looking forward to working with you and staff on this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Think you're all the councilmembers come up with closing thoughts. First is to the staff. I know that Metro is going to be adjusting its funding model for open street events to exactly this direction. And so all new metro money as it relates to Open Streets is going to be for projects like what we're going to'",
        "'speaker_0': 'be ahead of the game on, which is which is really good. I also agree, I think we've got to have a city wide perspective so that we're doing these across the city. Just want to uplift the idea of parking lots.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mr. BECK I'm hearing from a lot of restaurants that maybe aren't on a street, but are there parking lot adjacent. And so there's some creativity there. That's great. I want to also just mention a lot of these are going to be, you know, in many ways just done kind of, you know, with rail that just kind of'",
        "'speaker_0': 'comes up and then restaurants come in and and decorate and put their their tables and chairs up. And so I think we've got to be flexible that the different kind of parklet like spaces are open spaces could all look very different.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we should experiment, see which ones works, see which ones don't. We're not really creating, you know, traditional kind of parklet like structures, right? These are more flexible type structures as we explore. So I also want to make sure, Mr. Beck, that we're not imposing the same type of parklet fees or other kind of barriers for for'",
        "'speaker_0': 'small businesses. And so I know you guys will be flexible with that and we'll we'll be late in our approach. And just to conclude, I just want to thank really the dozens of restaurants that have reached out to our office, really from across the city and every from every business district that we've been talking to that are'",
        "'speaker_0': 'excited about this program. And I want to think also that the bids and the property improvement areas and and the Council of Business Associations for their leadership on these ideas, they've been doing a great job of promoting these and working with the businesses as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I thank you all. And with that, I'll have the court do a roll call.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Great. Think I'm going to make some opening comments and then turn this over to Mr. Modica for the presentation. I know we have a lengthy budget presentation. It's a very important presentation. I think we're all aware that we have some significant budget challenges here, both in the near future and in the years ahead.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Budgeting was already going to be difficult. As we all know, with COVID 19, it becomes a major economic challenge for us as a community. I've been sharing with folks that just as well as small businesses and others are struggling and there and they're really struggling, including workers, that also impacts the city and our ability to to fully'",
        "'speaker_0': 'function with all the services that residents and our residents expect becomes much more difficult. And so this will be a difficult budget process. It's going to require all of us to come together and focus on those core services and the core functions of a city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All it's going to make and force us to make some difficult decisions and prioritize. And so that's something that will begin. We'll have this presentation tonight. And of course, we know that we have a robust process that will start later this summer with our our budget oversight committee, with the recommendations that I'll make to the council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And, of course, the deliberation of the council will go into as they go into the fall. I want to want to also note that this is a moment of shared sacrifice for the city. I expect, and I believe every member of our organization will be making sacrifices and will be stepping up to to to take this on'",
        "'speaker_0': '. And so I think we're all ready and prepared to do that, including all of us. I know. And so we're going to have to push ourselves harder than ever before to get past this economic crisis. And it's one that's not just the city of Long Beach's challenge, but certainly the state of California is facing an enormous deficit'",
        "'speaker_0': 'as our sister cities all across the state of California. Let me also just finally note that you're going to hear a presentation tonight of what we have in front of us today. And obviously, there has there have been conversations about the governor's proposal to provide additional funding for Long Beach or there's been conversations about the county and'",
        "'speaker_0': 'possibly reaching out and getting support there or even at the federal level. And while all of those are very are our options and certainly some are very promising and none of those have yet been adopted or even the governor's proposal has to be passed and adopted by the legislature in the month or so ahead.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I think what you going to hear from staff tonight is where this budget is as of today and not incorporating what may be possible in the future. Rightly so, we're going to hear a budget budget as it is today.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And if those dollars materialize from the state, which we're you know, we're optimistic they will or from other places, then obviously these projections will change as we go into the summer. But but we should expect tough decisions regardless.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so with that, I want to thank the staff for their incredible work. And I want to turn this over to Mr. Modica to start this budget process.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I think that was a very good introduction of kind of where we are and also what the future might hold for us. So the mayor is absolutely right. We are required and responsible for putting together a budget with what we can control.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And that really is kind of the process at hand. We are very hopeful if there is additional, you know, revenue or if things change, we will be flexible and will be able to incorporate some of that. But as of today, we're required to put in place and start the process for how we are going to solve this'",
        "'speaker_5': 'here locally. And so we do have an in-depth presentation for you tonight. We're going to talk about first the financial strength of the city. We're going to talk about the impact of COVID 19 pandemic on our economy and our services.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Grace Yoon, our budget officer But your manager is going to give us a projection update and talk a little bit about the budget process. And then I'd like to share with you kind of my goals and strategies for budget balancing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We're not asking tonight for the Council to make any decisions on the budget. This is really for us to present where we are, kind of the approach the city manager is going to take. And then, of course, to listen and be and be mindful of some of the thoughts that the council has.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So in terms of financial strength, one, every single year we balance our budget. We do that. It is a key to good financial management. We maintain our bond rating. We've been in difficult times before and we've gotten through every single one.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we do have experience with this every year. We deliver to you a balanced budget and every year the council is physically disciplined and structurally balances the budget. In terms of our reserves, we get asked a lot. We have a general fund reserve, an operating reserve of 13 and a half million dollars, which is about two and'",
        "'speaker_5': 'a half percent, which is within our our policy. And then we have an emergency reserve, which is four and $5.5 million or eight and a half percent. That is roughly about one month of operating payroll. Emergency reserves are really there for a catastrophe.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We are certainly the closest, I think, that we have been in a long time for having a major, major issue that a reserve would qualify for. But we also need to remember there's the potential for an earthquake or something else that could come up.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so we think of those things when we think about our reserves, particularly our emergency reserve. We have other reserves, including unfunded liabilities, capital and one time projects. We also maintain our AA credit rating. It's a very strong credit rating.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We do have a large and diverse tax base. So some cities have seen very large impacts and deep impacts on certain things like, you know, sales in TOT. We have experienced those as well, but we do have a diversified base.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's not the only thing we require to fund our city. Prior to the pandemic, our economy was doing very well and we had very strong development activity and we remain to be a full service city. So we are in control of those services.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so what we're seeing with this pandemic really is severe and it's unprecedented. We have never experienced anything like this in our lifetime. We have businesses that are shut down. We have unemployment skyrocketing, some of the highest that we have ever seen, including the Great Recession.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The revenue decline was incredibly sharp and quick, and we are also at the same time experiencing increases in our expenditures to deal with the pandemic. And we are doing everything we can to get federal reimbursement. But the exact level of reimbursement is not certain, and it won't be 100%.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We also have an uncertain economy. We don't know when the economy is going to get turned back on, when we can restart, and also whether or not we're going to be in another cycle in a couple of months if there's a downturn or if the virus resurges.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so we also do not believe a quick rebound is considered likely. That was the hope a couple of months ago. It would be what we call a V rebound. It would go down quickly and up quickly. Most economists are looking at what they call the swoosh recovery.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'If you think of a Nike swoosh that it is, it goes down sharply and then it slowly graduate, gradually goes back up. We also have a lack of one time funding that we are not expecting those large one times to come in.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You know, if, you know, our bond rating could be at risk depending on what the level of the impact, how long it goes, and our reserves are at risk. And of course, we do expect, like every other city, our services to be impacted.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So do you want to recognize that we are not alone in this? We've all been reading the reports of all the cities in California and across the nation that are struggling with financial issues due to COVID one, where one area that we are unique is that most cities there is 488 cities.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In California, I believe 484 are on a July one fiscal year. And there's about four cities that are on the federal fiscal year. And Long Beach is one of them. So we're a little we have a little bit more time to digest what other cities are doing and to prepare for our federal fiscal year, which is October'",
        "'speaker_5': 'one. So I'm not going to read all of these. But to give you a sense of what's going on in the other cities in L.A., they have a $231 million revenue loss. They're using special and reserve funds. They're proposing 26 furlough days and they're doing some significant reductions, including 20% reduction in street sweeping.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'San Diego has over $300 million. They're looking at 10% reduction in services, eliminating 342 positions, including some sworn library and parks positions. Santa monica has been one of the most dire impacts that we've seen for the size of their budget 48 million in their current year, 102 million and F 21 for a total of around 225 million'",
        "'speaker_5': 'over the next couple of years. They've taken on significant reductions. 330 7f2 years. They've reduced pay in their management and others. They looked at street sweeping and going from weekly to monthly. San Jose or San Francisco has seen huge cutbacks in clout, including pushing their whole budget timeline back two months.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Oakland has done hiring freeze and laid off employees. Sacramento has a $30 million revenue loss and they're looking at kind of their tax measure that they had passed as part of the assistance. San Jose has a huge loss in the current year and 65 million in the next year and as furloughed more than a thousand of its'",
        "'speaker_5': 'employees. And so, as with many other cities, our revenue losses really are too large to absorb. It's not something we can just manage in-house. We know that both our staffing levels and our services will be impacted, and so we do need to take action to minimize those impacts.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The mayor mentioned this, that there are some federal resources out there, but the city of Long Beach did not receive the large City Cares Act funding. You needed to be 500,000 a population or more. We are at about 484, 85.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so a city, for example, that was just on the other side of that 500,000 received $89 million and we did not. So that has been a huge priority of our mayor and our council is to request those dollars.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And there is now $450 million allocation in the state budget, and we believe Long Beach is going to get a portion of that. And so it could fund things like certain expenses. It's not completely open to anything in everything.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's really COVID related, but that is an opportunity for us. There's also a federal legislation that could put more than $1,000,000,000,000 into helping state and local governments with their revenue losses. And that has passed the House, but not yet the Senate.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And of course, we're still talking to looking at grants and in talking to the county as we are a health jurisdiction and they are receiving funding for health jurisdictions. And so the pandemic has really created this significant financial crisis.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And we are going to be looking at ways, two different ways of delivering service, transforming the way that we work, providing services to our residents. We've already rapidly and effectively adapted our organization, and so we have done a lot more online.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It is it required us to innovate, to go faster, to offer services we never thought were possible online, are being offered online. And so moving forward, we're going to have to really continue that work to imagine how we could do things differently and also look strategically as look at those in technology investments, invest in innovation, make investment'",
        "'speaker_5': 'into businesses and revenue sources, and also look at our organizational structure. So I'm going to turn it to Grace Young right now to go through what the numbers look like for Long Beach and some of the budget details.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then I'll conclude with kind of our approach on how we're going to address this. Grace.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right. Thank you, Tom. Good evening, Mayor, and members of the City Council. In the next few slides, I will be going over the updated projections for the General Fund and select other funds that have significant losses and other concerns.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'These are the Tidelands, ESP, measuring and airport funds. Before we turn it back over to Tom to discuss budget development strategies and approach, these projections that we've made, as we've mentioned earlier, are preliminary and will be updated throughout the budget process and may have significant changes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They are potentially more likely to get worse than better, but we will keep assessing the information as it becomes available. So as Tom mentioned, Long Beach has responded swiftly and effectively to mitigate the threat of the pandemic. And the city has taken a number of direct actions to assist our residents and businesses.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Some of these actions have adversely impacted revenues or expenditures. In this slide provides examples of our responses as well as a rough estimate of potential fiscal impact. Our main response to address the health crisis may potentially have a net cost of 3 to 6 million in the general fund and potentially another 3 to 5 million in the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'health fund, with costs likely continuing past the end of the fiscal year. We roughly estimate a loss of about 2.3 million in both parking citations and towing revenues with the higher revenue loss if street sweeping citation program is not maintained.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Gas and water have lost about 700,000 and fee waivers and the no shot off provision and the general fund has lost about 170,000 and business license penalties with much larger losses. If continued beyond today, the revenue losses from people not paying at all are not included and cannot be estimated at this time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The city has also allowed rent payments to be deferred. The city normally receives about 2.4 million a month in rent. The monthly totals are large. So to the extent these payments are never made, which is not projectable at this time, there will be an adverse impact.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so we'll continue to evaluate these things and take them into consideration as we address our budget shortfalls. Turning to the general fund with the stay at home order and all the closures and cancelation. The projected shortfall in FY 20 has gotten significantly worse.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sales tax non measure is projecting a loss of up to 12 million or a 17% decline. From our pre-pandemic projections, TOT is reflecting a $10 million loss or a 43% decline from pre-pandemic projections. Oil has experienced an unprecedented drop in prices, even going negative at one point.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Currently, it is trending around the mid-twenties in terms of price per barrel, and our budget is at $55 per barrel. We're projecting a 3 million loss at this time or a 30% decline from our previous projections. But we are mitigating some of this by not funding future abandonment cost, which passes the risk and costs to future generations'",
        "'speaker_2': '. Parking citation revenues is estimated at a loss of 2 million, which is an 11% decline from previous projections. And there are also pandemic related expenses, which have been about 11 million to date and for the general fund. And as mentioned before, we are currently estimating about 3 to 6 million total costs that won't be reimbursed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But again, this is a very fluid number and we will need to continue to update this. And we're also continuing to look at other revenues that may be adversely impacted and will include that information in future projection updates.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'For FY 21. The projections have also gotten significantly worse with the assumption update of a slower recovery as opposed to the much quicker rebound that was assumed at the early stages of the pandemic. Sales tax non measure is projecting a loss of up to 6 million or a 9% decline from previous projections.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Totters at 8 million loss or a 36% decline. And for oil, we're projecting 5 million loss or a 55% decline from previous projections, which was assuming, again, that $55 a barrel. And our assumptions now is budgeting at $30 a barrel.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But again, similar to FY20, we are mitigating some of this oil loss by not funding future abandonment costs. And we'll continue to review and update these projections throughout the budget process as we get more information. So here is the general fund budget forecast.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We are showing a shortfall in FY 20 ranging from 25 to 41 million. This range here represents a high and low scenario based on the level of severity, what the level of severity might be in terms of revenue losses.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There's still great uncertainty as to how the economy will react for the remainder of the fiscal year, and limited actual data is available right now. In Fy21 we are showing an updated shortfall of 30 million and the out years are showing shortfalls as well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In general, we are assuming that revenue losses continue through FY 21 but start showing improvements and then more or less recover by fy22. We're not assuming a second phase of COVID 19 or another general recession. These numbers also include the cost for negotiated contracts and an assumption of a cost of living increases for other groups.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There's also higher CalPERS costs beginning in FY 22 due to the expected investment loss that we are anticipating in FY 20. And bottom line is that these large these are large shortfalls and indicate a need for a long term plan and substantive corrective actions.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The Thailand's operating fund is also facing fiscal challenges. This is the fund that supports operations and programs of beaches and waterways, the Convention Center and capital projects and the Tidelands area. For FY 20, we're anticipating to end the year with a negative of funds available of 5 million.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Assuming no corrective actions, if we continue to make no changes, the negative funds available grows to about 19 million by the end of FY 21. The assumptions we are making here regarding oil prices is $30 a barrel in FY 20 for the rest of the year.'",
        "'speaker_2': '$35 in FY 21. $45 in FY 22. And then back up to our current budgeted 55 in FY 24. There are also extra costs for bonds we are anticipating to hit in FY 21 due to the aquarium and Queen Mary shortfalls, as well as to mitigate the convention center loss per the contract.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We're also assuming that for FY 20 and 21, as I've mentioned before, we would not be funding the annual oil well abandonment costs. So for the shortfalls in FY 20, in FY 21, the budget process will be looking to address this with a combination of project funding, savings from operational reductions and the use of reserves.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Any projects slated for deferral or cancelation will be brought before council before any action is taken. The SAP fund or the special advertising and promotion fund is also severely impacted as total revenues, which is a very sensitive and volatile revenue source, is its main source of funding.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And the SAP fund supports advertising, promotional and public relations projects and special events that call positive attention to the city. For FY 20, we are projecting and ending funds available of -700,000. Again, assuming no corrective actions, this is dropping from the 5 million in funds available at the beginning of the year.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If we continue to make no changes, the negative funds available grows to about 2.6 million by the end of FY 21. The extra 1% tax that is effective in July is not included in these numbers as it is dedicated per resolution for specific purposes and again, similar to timelines for the shortfalls in FY 20 and 21.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The budget process will be looking to address this with a combination of project funding, savings from operational reductions and the use of reserves. And again, any project cancelation will be brought to City Council first for review. Measure is also taking a significant revenue hit compared to pre-pandemic projections.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'However, the impact of this is somewhat mitigated because the FY 20 adopted plan was based on a lower budgeted revenue projection as the plan was finalized prior to seeing the strong F1 19 year end performance in FY 20.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Compared to our budgeted measure plan, the loss is 5 million, and for FY 21, we are projecting to be below the anticipated revenue in the plan by 2 million. After this, however, we are expecting that revenues will be at or better than the projected revenue levels assumed in the FY 20 budget plan due to the long term'",
        "'speaker_2': 'revenue increase from the approved ballot measure. This additional revenue from the ballot measure has not been programed yet and will be up to City Council. How to allocate that in the future. As part of the 521 budget development process, a revised spending plan will be proposed that takes into account the revenue declines in FY 20 and 21'",
        "'speaker_2': ', the difficulty in funding public safety operations, as well as the long term revenue increase from the approved ballot measure. We do anticipate that we will need to potentially postpone some projects depending on cash flow with the revenues and also potential reallocation of revenues to help maintain public safety services.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Again, any changes or updates to the measure plan will be reviewed with City Council. Lastly, the airport fund has also experienced an unprecedented drop in traffic and flights, potentially resulting in a loss of up to 20 million in Fy20.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Uncertainty around when the airport will resume normal operations and how the airlines will adapt to the pandemic make it impossible to have reliable projections for the future at this time. The key immediate goal is ensuring that there is adequate cash for operations in the city's practice of maintaining a large funds available for the airport fund has made'",
        "'speaker_2': 'a huge difference, and the 18 million CARES grant funds that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Were awarded will also.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Help greatly, and the airport is anticipating on expanding these funds over the next six months. The airport is currently reviewing options to reduce operating costs, and the Terminal Area Improvement Project is being done in phases with exit ramps for each phase in order to protect cash as necessary.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Moving forward, we will be carefully monitoring adaptations by airlines and passengers, as that will affect and impact airport's future and fiscal health. There are other funds and operations that are impacted by the pandemic, including other enterprise funds. For example, we expect mobility and other state county funding from gas tax to be adversely impacted.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Utility fund revenues, including penalty fees, are likely down. Towing fund revenues are down significantly due to reduced tows and cancelation of lead sales. All of these impacts have not fully been analyzed yet, and so we will continue to evaluate and update counsel in the future.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And as part of the budget process, all funds will be asked to evaluate the health of the fund and to find efficiencies. So with this presentation, we are restarting the FY 21 budget development process that had been temporarily suspended for about two months as the city worked to respond to the pandemic.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Our goal is to meet the normal adoption date and the intent is to give the city council and the public close to the normal time they typically have for review and for the budget hearings and public discussion. In order to achieve this goal, we will need to implement a modified process that has shortened timeframes, different deliverables and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'less time for in-depth analysis. We will be submitting to the Mayor and City Council a booklet summarizing the key proposed changes, as well as the mayor's budget recommendations in lieu of a full proposed budget book in order to meet the time frame goals.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The goal is to provide the core information needed for discussion and decision making. The full adopted book will still be prepared and published after the budget is adopted in September. And lastly, during the Flight 21 year, strategies will be developed for future year shortfalls.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And with that, I will turn it back over to city manager Tom Mordecai to discuss the goals and strategy for budget balancing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. Thank you. Thank you very much, Chris. So first and foremost, we're going to do what we need to do to protect public health. And so we do not expect an impact on COVID 19 pandemic. We're going to continue to do all the great work that our team is doing, that our community is doing to to help'",
        "'speaker_5': 'people through this and to preserve public health. That said, we are already reducing non-critical expenditures as much as practical. We will look at the strategic use of the operating emergency reserves, but also making sure that we preserve reserves for the future.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Any use of reserves would come to the council before they would be be spent. We are not anticipating layoffs of full time staff in 20, but we are likely going to have to follow what other cities have done and reduce some of the part time staffing hours where there is not budget or work for those employees.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We will be minimizing layoffs by utilizing attrition, holding open a bunch of positions. And we've had experience doing this in the past. We were able to hold positions to get vacancies and also for places for people to move into in the event of position reductions in the future.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We will propose a balanced or we will balance propose a balanced budget. We're going to be emphasizing core services and maintaining a balance of services. And you'll hear me talk about that later tonight. We're going to keep looking for transformational opportunities, looking at how we can do things differently.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then we're also going to have to make investments in our economic future. And so for the F 20 budget strategies, we have put in a hard hiring freeze. There are exceptions, of course, to specific positions, but every every position is being scrutinized on whether we should hire and we're cutting back those nonessential expenditures.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We will provide recommendations later to the Council on defunding some of those non-critical capital projects as something to consider to close the year in balance. We see that as one of the last things that you would have to do, but it is something that we are working on.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We would reconsider our summer activities and programs impacted by the pandemic. We know that kids are going to need a place to go in the summer, but also what can be safely opened and how do we look at those differently?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We're going to emphasize full time staffing over part time or non-career staffing. I do believe we should defer our decisions on our police and fire academies for a little bit until we get a better picture of what is going on with our FY 21 budget.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm not saying we should cancel those and not do any academies in the future, but that we have to make decisions right now about hiring people in the next month or two, and that we would defer that for a little bit and we would continue to in encourage innovation and investment opportunities.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so we see a four pronged strategic approach to the general fund reductions. First, we would look to new or reallocated revenue. We through this would be looking at our fees, would be looking at ambulance fees for public safety, for example.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We're going to be looking at how measure aid can be appropriately used for our public safety. As that's one of the eligible uses, we would explore additional efficiencies, innovations and strategic investments. You know, how do we do things differently looking at everything from management consolidations to our functions to our various bureaus and divisions?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'How do we use that different technology? How do we come back as an economy? I'm also letting you know and letting our employees know and I'll be communicating this tomorrow that we're going to be asking for assistance and contributions from our employee groups.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I had a chance to talk to them all today and and let them know that that is something that we're going to be bringing up appropriately at the bargaining table. So that is something that we are going to engage in discussions we got.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think our employees understand and know that we are in some very difficult times. And so I was encouraged by all the discussions I had today. And finally, we're going to be looking at service reductions that prioritize the city's core services and values and do an outcomes based decision making process.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so this is really the core of the presentation. Mayor and Council, I want to talk to you about something we're calling a balanced outcomes based approach. And so we know we have critical services. We need to meet our local, state and federal mandates and legal requirements.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We have to have a core of a system in place to support all of our frontline systems and services. And so we need to keep that in a functioning capacity. And then we have the core services that our community relies on.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so we're going to have to prioritize and balance all of those core services and really look at what we are going to consider reasonable response and service levels. And so this is not an exhaustive list, but this is what I hear from you as the council, from our community.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Our core services are things like police patrol, emergency medical and fire services. Our infrastructure response like potholes, sidewalks and facilities maintenance. Our maintenance of our public assets are spaces. These are things like code enforcement, graffiti, landscaping, tree trimming, our response to homelessness, our maintaining and enhancing our revenues, our quality of life services, which is a huge long'",
        "'speaker_5': 'list, but. Could include library and recreation and community programing and support for our youth and senior populations. And so how do we achieve that balance? We need to have a couple of outcomes that we're focused on structurally balance the budget, preserve that capacity as an organization so that we can effectively operate and provide the services our community'",
        "'speaker_5': 'wants and needs and then retain those acceptable service levels. And so what steps are we going to take? We're going to look back over the past five years and review the additions that we've made to the budget and look to see are those still in keeping with our priorities and those core services.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We're going to reevaluate what is an acceptable service level. If we made a reduction in that in that core service, is that something that we can live with if it's a 48 hour response time or a 72 or we're going to look at technology in other ways we've serve the public.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I do believe we should look at the entire organization and look really at outcomes rather than, you know, a percentage in a percent there. We're going to look at our service delivery changes from a whole city perspective, but also through an equity lens.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'How are we serving all of our residents? But also what it or how does equity play a role in this? And how do we know what the impact of those reductions would be through an equity lens? We're going to also pursue in cost recovery.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We need to look at services differently and we need to think about how we can operate. And I think the COVID experiences has opened our eyes to different ways to operate. And I think we need to recognize as a community that service reductions will occur and we're going to have to adapt our approach and expectations.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so why a balanced approach or if we over concentrated our service reductions in one area in particular? I do believe we have so little services left that all of them are considered essential. We've been through the Great Recession.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We no longer do things that we used to do back then, but now we really are in that area where things are all important. If we exempt certain areas and say we're not going to touch that or touch that or even consider it, that leads really do a fractured service approach.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Everything should be on the table as we look at this and then we create options and then look to see what the what the alternatives are and what the outcomes are and especially balance because our services are linked.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so we we talk about the public safety continuum and public safety relies on libraries and parks are poor infrastructure and our maintenance can impact our police and fire. Homelessness can impact police and fire. And support for our frontline workers are critical to their effective operation.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'If we can't support them in the field, they're not going to be effective. And so you've seen this graphic before where we really look at all the different pieces of the puzzle that we do and how they're all interconnected.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so that really is the concept behind the balanced approach. And so I do want to I'm almost done, but I do want to end that finding $30 million next year in the F 20 budget is going to be very, very difficult.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so we're going to have to look at everything. And I'm just giving you an example of of our budget. So police is 250,000,048%. You can see all the percents. And just to put that in perspective, you know, ten officers is about two and a half or $2 million.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'A fire engine is $3 million. Tree trimming is $3 million. Parks vacancies, 450,000. And library, a medium sized library is 500,000. Those are by no means what we're proposing, and those are examples only. But just to give you a sense of scale.'",
        "'speaker_5': '30 million out of this budget is going to be difficult. And so we are looking at options. And so we are going to be asking all departments to participate. And my philosophy is we're going to put together something that we believe is a budget, but then we're also going to show you what some of the alternatives would'",
        "'speaker_5': 'be. So when you have to make those tough decisions in the budget, you can see why there's other alternatives and kind of how staff got to those those recommendations. We're going to ask for targets above what we need so that we have that flexibility and options.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And we're asking all departments to submit reductions, including non city manager. Non public safety will be in a range of 0 to 12% of their budget in order to provide those options. And public safety will be in a range of 0 to 3 and a half percent to be able to really look at different ideas.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The final recommendations are going to be balanced or based on that balanced outcomes approach, and we're going to keep updating our projections through this budget development process. I'm hoping they'll get better. It's a possibility that they get worse.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so finally to wrap up is we have since the pandemic, has substantially changed our financial landscape. I've said this a couple of times, but we we do know that significant service reductions are going to be needed and that we really need to maintain our core services and values.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And also ask ourselves, what are those through this budget process? You know, we we will do this. We will do it right. It's going to be tough. But this team is up for the challenge to present you with those recommendations.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And this council makes very good, deliberative decisions during the tough times. And I believe that I believe very strongly that that's going to continue. And so we do hope that all the work that we've done in our economy has really built a good foundation and will be able to recover quickly.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I will just end with saying we will get through this and we will come out on the other side a better organization. So with that, I know that was a long presentation, but we stand ready to answer your questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Modica, and just really excellent presentation, obviously sobering information, but you and the team have just done a great job of putting that together, so we appreciate that. I do have a speakers list queued up count.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sorry, ringing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'ex-Mayor. Well, this is the last time that you put this in in a readable format so that we can get it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You sound a little bit far.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If you look at my little town, I guess. Is that better?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'A little bit.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Let me do this then. How about that?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, that's better.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. So, anyway, this is a lot to absorb and I'm glad that it's in this format so that we can study it more, more carefully and come up with some recommendations. What interested me in this stood out to me, obviously, is how we are going to work with our enterprises.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Twain obviously stood out to me. It's a it's an enterprise business that we conduct. And there was a there's a stoppage of sales at this time. Leigh Sales obviously is 50% of that total operation and being that tween is down, I can see why we don't have that many cars on to sell.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But it's still an enterprise and I think we should still try to maintain the strength of our enterprise as much as we can. And if that enterprise is going to be cut back or or at least minimized to a certain extent, what does that mean?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That we're also looking at layoffs in in enterprise departments?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So Councilmember, one of the unique things about COVID is it has affected everything. So we have seen in all of our funds, we're seeing, you know, different things that we haven't seen before. Towing has historically been a fund that has been able to support the general fund.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so when we look at this, we're going to be looking at every fund, you know, some funds. You know, they're going to have different ways that they contribute to the to the issue and to the general fund.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so we're going to take a look at a fund by fund basis. And towing is one that we're going to keep a very close eye on. But you're right there. There have been impacts in there because we're not towing cars anymore.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And that fund is now also not bringing in some of the revenue that it had brought in before.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, we've got to be. I guess that would also impact what we do with street sweeping and ticketing as well. I would take it because I know some some of the pounds come from students. We have vehicles that are out there abandoned or have five or more tickets which make them eligible for towing and eventually being able'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to sell them and pick them up. Just out of curiosity. I if I recall correctly, the the toy yard can hold up to about 1500 cars, you know, exactly right now where we're at with that. But the inventory of vehicles are.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We are. This is John GROSS. We are not at capacity. We're a little fuller than you might expect. I think we are in the 800 900 level, but I don't confirm that and send you a note if that is a is an error there.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And we did resume much of our towing operations this Monday. So we're we're hopefully going to mitigate the revenue losses while still being very responsive to the COVID situation.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. That's all I have for now. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember. Next up is Councilwoman Price. Councilwoman Pryce. Not a recent.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Survey.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Now we can go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Thank you. So thank you very much for that presentation. And I really, really appreciate. Tom, that you have shared with us. You know, so honestly, what is happening and what we can expect in the future, I think it's really important for us to have these honest conversations.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I agree with you that I believe that my colleagues and I will be very deliberate and will be very thoughtful in the decisions that have to be made. And I think we are all ready for that time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But we're hopeful that you have some more time to evaluate your options in terms of, you know, where we can tighten our belts, what projects we can defer, and that you will come to us really when when those tough decisions have to be made.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And all creative approaches to preserving jobs and services have been exhausted. So I'm really hopeful that we can preserve as many jobs. I mean, to me, that's the number one goal, is to do everything that we can to preserve jobs in the city, because those jobs translate to services and they translate to quality services in every single'",
        "'speaker_2': 'department. And I know that's all of our goals. So to the extent I mean, I know I speak for myself, I'm not speaking for the whole body on this since I'm the second person queued up and I know others yet have had a chance to speak.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I'm curious to hear what everyone thinks. But speaking for myself, I think, you know, looking at projects that we already have in the queue, infrastructure projects or capital projects that we already have in the queue, perhaps those take priority over new projects.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If we haven't started a capital improvement project or it's not in the works yet, it hasn't gone through the air, hasn't gone through. Planning and permitting those kinds of things. Then maybe those are those are projects that take a back burner and projects that are underway maybe take more of a priority.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I love the idea of taking a look five years back to determine what new programs to do we fund during that time. And are those truly essential? You know, I'm I'm a lawyer. And one of the one of the gifts that that you develop over time, especially as a trial lawyer, is advocacy.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so when we talk about, you know, what is an essential service or what is a core function of the city, you know, obviously, the best debaters of the world will be able to take either position and argue their hearts out.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I'll tell you right now, when we're looking at the governor's orders and we're thinking about things like, what is it, a central business as a small business owner, I certainly could make an argument to you all day long that the business that my husband and I run is an essential business because it goes to mental health'",
        "'speaker_2': ', it goes to progress, it goes to personal worth, it goes to all these things. But in reality, I know what the term essential service or essential business means, and that would be a disingenuous argument. So moving forward, I want us to hopefully get on the same real page about what is an essential core service of the city'",
        "'speaker_2': ', and how can we make sure that we preserve those so that we do have equity in the city in terms of every resident being able to benefit from that service that we provide. And so I'm hopeful that we can look at the past five years, think about everything that we've funded, and then think about what services do'",
        "'speaker_2': 'we have that every resident in this city, regardless of their zip code, relies upon and needs? And how do we make sure that we continue those? So I look forward to that. I do have a question regarding the shelf shortfalls, and I guess this question is for grace regarding the show shortfalls, does that include all the previous'",
        "'speaker_2': 'shortfall numbers that we had anticipated, which would have included our CalPERS liabilities as well as our contract negotiations? I think it does. I think I heard you say that that includes everything. But is that true? Are these COVID related shortfalls only?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Council member. Thank you for the question. You are correct and that these are revised shortfalls that are inclusive of everything. The previous projections and that included some CalPERS or other shortfalls are included in these numbers. Okay. Great. And then the other question I had is that you're not assuming another recession.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Why is that? Is that because there's a likelihood that there won't be another recession? Or is it just an assumption that you're making for the purposes of these calculations? Council Member That is an assumption we are making for this particular presentation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We are providing a best estimate of what we think the projection numbers will be in the current and out years. But we are planning to do a better and worse case scenario in the next round of analysis. That includes a potential recession scenario as well as a scenario of what the scenario, what the situation might be if'",
        "'speaker_2': 'things turn around and look better. And based on those better or worse case scenarios, we will be also developing some contingency planning. Okay. And then I guess thank you for that. And I guess my final question would be really to the city manager, given the fact that we're experiencing major shortfalls in Tidelands, if we continue to leverage'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the Tidelands Fund or utilize Tidelands monies in order to respond to COVID related scenarios that might impact that fund, will that or could that have an impact on our ability to pay employees that are funded out of the Tidelands Fund?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So, Councilmember, this is Grace. I can address that. So what we are projecting right now is a shortfall to the bottom line, tidelands funds available number. But we are planning to address that with looking at projects, looking at the reserves that we have and also making some operational reductions in the future to have a stronger fund moving'",
        "'speaker_2': 'forward. We would be adjusting things so that we are making sure we make our payroll in the current year and that there is enough cash to do that and funding balance to do that. And so that is not something we're concerned about in terms of being able to pay our employees, but moving forward and looking at the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'health of the fund. There may be reductions, strategic reductions that need to be made through the budget process, but that would be done and evaluated as part of the budget process. Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'With that, I'm going to turn it over to my colleagues and I'm sure everyone has thoughts to share on this. Thank you very much to the entire staff for your presentation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next up, I have Councilwoman Mungo.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. I really appreciate the presentation. I do have a couple of questions before I make any additional comments. I want to thank all the staff for all their hard work. Of the 11 million year to date spend on COVID from the general fund.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'What are those expenses really? Or is that our test kits? Is that our homeless shelter set up? Is that what?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilmember. Majority of these costs are labor related. And so they point to the people that have been standing up, the EEOC, the IMT, as well as other departments that have responded to address the response. Some of these are their budgeted normal salaries and some are overtime expenses.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There have been some non.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Salary.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Or non-Labor costs that have hit. Right now these are being coded as COVID. We're not sure if they will be reimbursed, but they may be things like setting up our telecommuting or other expenses. Are there purchases that needed to have been purchased in response as well as the response to the health?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Addressing the health issues with the homelessness and other expenses, material expenses that have been expended by the EOC and the IMT.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And testing would certainly also be one of those expenses. So you're having an item before you tonight, about to $2.4 million for testing. So we are hoping to get reimbursed for 75% of everything we do, but we are going to have some unreimbursed expenses as well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So just so I'm clear if our annual. Let's do a monthly. If our monthly payroll expenses were $10 million and 2 million of those full time salaried employees were transitioned over to COVID, wouldn't our face expense drop? And then the 2 million would be reimbursed at 70, potentially reimbursed at 75%.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so our actual. Costs would have been reduced.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So for the most.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Part, supplement would be the overtime. Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So for the most part, FEMA is not going to reimburse typical salaries of a budgeted employee, even though they're doing COVID rather than what they were doing before. They're looking for extraordinary expenses, things that are above and beyond.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That said, some of the federal dollars that, you know, we've been asking for could fund some of those expenses because we certainly have people now doing things that are not what they were budgeted for. They're doing all COVID all day long.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So, you know, that's going to be part of the nuance in the next couple of months as we figure out state money comes in and others what is going to be eligible and what is not.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So a lot of sense. I appreciate that answer. Secondarily, what is our monthly rate of spend on COVID on a go forward basis?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Right now, I can say that all together the courses have been coded to COVID is about 18 million or about 18.5 million. All funds with 11.3 being in the general fund and 7.2 being in other funds. And that represents expenses from the beginning of the pandemic to about mid-May.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It is difficult. I mean, so we can extrapolate that and say what the monthly cost has been. It's been about two, two and a half months, but it's hard to say that that value will be our monthly spend because these costs that have incurred so far represent a different level of spending over different times.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There was a a lot of cost to stand up the EOC and the IMT, and then those staffing levels have changed. And moving forward, there will be different expenses that we were anticipating with testing, addressing homelessness issues. And so right now it is very difficult to say what the regular monthly costs will be.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But we have a team that's looking at this weekly and we'll be evaluating that. And as Tom mentioned, also looking at which of these costs will be able to be reimbursed by grants. And we'll be looking at that and providing updates to council in separate communications about these costs.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So just for some perspective, you said it's been two and a half months, 18 million, so almost 6 million a month, something to think about as a as a group as we go forward. Mr. MODICA, you you'd mentioned that we would look at what has been added to the budget in the last five years.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I know that as a budget oversight committee last year we did discuss anything that had been added in the prior five years. If we did that list plus this year, it would be the six years since we a majority of the council turned over in 2014.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I would just ask that while we have done that and that list is available, we might want to reach deeper back because the priorities of the prior council, all of which except for two are gone, may not be the priorities of today.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so I appreciated your line about just reassessing the organization as a whole, not necessarily where it came from or what year it was added, and just really talking about what makes sense. Does it make sense that certain things are folded into other things for efficiencies?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'What are those things? How could we save on management costs and department head costs by collapsing departments? I brought this up at council before, but during the Great Recession, Gardena collapsed a lot of their departments, unlike the county way when they created the DCO system where they put departments together and created higher level positions.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'When I'm sorry, when Gardena did it, they collapsed it and reduced the number of department, had salaries, reduced the number of management positions. And so that really helped with the structure overall. And then I just want to say that I recognize that there's a big difference between capital investment and our ongoing operating challenges.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I want to be sure that I'm a go forward basis. Our capital investment is spent on things that reduce our ongoing expenses best. So if we can invest in some kind of. I'll give you an example. L.A. County is looking to buy a testing machine.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We have a lab, so we're in a position where we can do that. Our costs for tests for COVID go down 66% if we have our own machine. Then we start factoring in staffing costs and the such. And what does that look like?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And it's still a significant cost savings, not just when it comes to COVID, but let's talk about it when it comes to city services. If we're able to buy something or do something or automate something in an area where we can still preserve people, even if the types of jobs change, as you said, holding the vacant positions'",
        "'speaker_4': 'open and allowing people to move around, maybe automation of parking in certain places in the city that are currently staffed and other things. Those investments can save us in the long term and can one or two of those could save an actual person's job, and that job could mean the lifeblood of their family.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so I think that those things are critical for us to consider at this time. Thank you for the great presentation. I plan to be continuing to monitor this closely, and I look forward to having a further discussion with the Budget Oversight Committee.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Also, I know that councilwoman for your cure. That's also a motion to approve or receive and file council. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Uh, Councilmember Pierce.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mayor. Thank you, Staff. I really appreciate, Tom, the way that you've come forward with your first budget as city manager. I recognize it's not the ideal budget for any city manager to have as their first, but you definitely have the experience and have worked with this council long enough to understand kind of how we're all'",
        "'speaker_4': 'thinking. And I appreciate that that was reflected in your presentation. I really appreciate the outcome based approach and talking about the equity lens, the conversation you had about what what is public safety, which is something that for the last ten, 15 years of my life is always a question that comes up for me, which is, yes, it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'can be police officers to some, definitely it can be firefighters. But we also know that public safety for so many of our most vulnerable is access to jobs. It's youth programing, it's mental health. And so when I think about the unique moment that we're in in history and really thinking about what does it mean for the city'",
        "'speaker_4': 'to be to provide essential services? And I think that our essential goal is to make sure that should there be a rebound or another surge or should there be another pandemic in in five years, how are we as the city, really positioning ourselves so that it doesn't get this bad?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Right, because we know that this health concern has really impacted so many. And so I echo the same comments I made last time around. Investment in climate. And I want to take that to the point that Councilmember Mongo just said.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We do have a lot of capital investment projects that are in dreamland that we haven't brought forward. I know from talking to staff that there's a long list of things that they'd like to do as we look at capital improvement projects, thinking about how we can reduce our energy bill.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I would really be curious, you know, one on one maybe with our finance team to understand what our electricity bill is for the city and reminding us that whenever we do investments or tries to get microgrids on facilities like fire station or parks that we could be able to lock in our energy cost at 2% growth'",
        "'speaker_4': 'every year instead of something as high as six or 8%. And so thinking creatively about that is where I think we should think when we're talking about capital improvement projects. As I mentioned, I feel like the the jobs program and everything that our economic development team has done has been wonderful.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We have really demonstrated a short period of time that that team can step up, that it can reach a community that historically hasn't been reached before. And so when we talk about essential making sure that we are thinking creatively about how to maintain staffing there.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It was brought up about youth services and the fact that right now we don't have a summer program planned as a mother of an eight year old. Trust me, I would love to have a summer program even if they put them in bubbles where they couldn't touch each other.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I wouldn't send her away. I'm kidding. But I do think that there are some creative programs out there. And I did talk to Scott today about programs, whether it's an online program that's 2 hours a day with park staff facilitating a Zoom call.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's what groups like the Girl Scouts are doing. What are some of the other summer camps are doing? So I don't want it to be something that is cost prohibitive because we are trying to maintain our budget, but really thinking about how we ensure that our community doesn't go nuts in the next year if we continue to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'have this lockdown or, you know, shift. I had two questions around oil revenue and I wanted to understand, when we budgeted for oil, we haven't budgeted for 55 a barrel right now. What's the lowest that the city has budgeted for oil revenue in the last ten years?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Council member, we have budgeted as low as $35 a barrel in FY 17. Prior to that, we went even as high as $70 a barrel. And if Y 13, 14 and 15 and in oh nine, we went even higher than that to $85 a barrel.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we learned our lesson very quickly that budgeting at the actual price is very risky. And so our practice from lessons from the past history has been to budget more conservatively, at least at a minimum, $5 below what we think the actual revenue will be, so that we end the year with a little bit of a cushion'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and some anticipated one times. But we have budgeted as low as 35 in FY 17.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Thank you. And that was helpful to understand that $5 below what you estimate. So I'm just curious about what policies there might be around trying to budget, you know, very responsibly with that. The other comment that I'd like to just make sure we talk about as we look back, I agree also with Mungo's statement around let's'",
        "'speaker_4': 'look farther than five years, because we know that this council is a council that's gone through everything to get what we have now. And so looking at the previous councils and saying maybe there's something that's there that's not working or that we're budgeting for that isn't necessarily efficient.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And it wasn't mentioned yet. But as we talk about equity and making sure that everybody has access and that we're making sure our neighborhoods are safe. I would like to make sure that we maintain the language access program that we have worked so hard over the last seven years for and making sure that all of our residents'",
        "'speaker_4': 'really have access. And I think, Tom, you've done a great job just in seeing the community meeting that you had with our Latino community, very different than what was happening last year. And that really demonstrates the value that the city is carrying forward with engaging everybody.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so language access is being a part of that. So I look forward to going through this process. I know it might be difficult for some of our community members having a shorter timeline. And so I just I appreciate your guys work on this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's not an easy task. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you for that, councilwoman. Next is councilmember supernova.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Just a couple of points. Mr. MODICA, I'd like to go back to slide 24 and the fifth bullet point down. You're probably not surprised I'm going here. I think I made a very compelling argument about this topic in the past, but it may not have been convincing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That point is defer decisions on the fire and Police Academy until later in the fiscal year 21 budget process to better understand funding and budget from a. And what I would like to do is propose that we go ahead and conduct that fire academy in August.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then possibly, if you need to, you know, eliminate one, it would be, you know, that February class. And the reason I say that is. Now some of the points that I made before that we are in the pandemic right now, it already hit prior one time.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We hope it doesn't hit again. But there's always that vulnerability as you get past guys, you get into the fire season where we have automatic aid, uh, mutual aid, and then you. These other jurisdictions, they may be hit by COVID also.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So this is not a time when we have the luxury of limited staff with fire. And heaven forbid you just saw a couple of nights ago, L.A. City lost ten firefighters were injured in one fire. And we just need to keep fire fully staffed and make sure that you have everyone in place and functioning at 100%.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If you if you don't do that, you risk firefighter safety and public safety all the same time. That's a statement. Tom, if you want to respond, go ahead. But my asking is very simple. Let's go ahead and. Go.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Will be. Um. Um. August. Um. Academy for fire. And then if we have to make adjustments later, let's look at that. The other well look point. Oh, I'll tell you, I talk about three sweeping and other cities eliminating some of that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I'll wait to our other agenda item tonight to bring up those points. And just one final point I'd like to make. And this goes back 18 years, and that is I served on a fourth District advisory committee in 2002, and we're having lots of challenges back in 2002.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And one topic that came up right away, and I know it's not in your presentation, was the sale of city assets. And I think time they talked about city buildings. So I'd just like to ask if that is something that would be on the table is.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You are free.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm sorry you broke up, Daryl. Can you say that again? Council member We couldn't hear you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'About that or what are your thoughts?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Can you repeat that? Daryl That did not come through.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Can you hear me now? Yes. Okay. So in 2002, when we were in tough budget times, one of the first topics of discussion was the sale of city assets, including building buildings. Is that a discussion for later on in this process?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is that being examined now or it's just not part of the presentation? And is that a more drastic way you look at it later date?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So to answer that question first, I think we we're open to anything. So, you know, my challenge to the departments and others is to look at how we've done things, look at how we've done things. We can do things differently.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'If that means there's an asset that we can put in play that would help, I'd want to be able to see that and review that. And if it makes sense, propose it to the council.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Thank you. That's all I have for now. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I did want to clarify the question on Academy. So we have been through several years where we didn't have any academies and that was part of the budget strategy of the Great Recession. It did save some funding, but it also led to some problems later where we went four or five years without any new police officers'",
        "'speaker_5': 'and firefighters, and we're still feeling the effects of that today. So I do believe that academies are important, that we, you know, can't be too shortsighted and and not do academies at all going forward. That's going to have to be part of our strategy.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I am concerned just about the short term timing. We have one coming up in June, I believe in July for P.D. and August for fire. I'm looking to get a little bit of room by looking at a couple of months of pushing back so we can make some decisions.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And just so we understand how this affects things like the safer grant, the rest of the budget police, the number of people, the retirements, and even looking at how many firefighters were in police, we're going to need. So this right now is a shorter term decision just to allow for that analysis.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I wouldn't expect it to be pushed much longer than, you know, a month or two or three. So that's really our thinking at the time.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I think in case they broke ups of what I was what I was saying, if you can hear me, was that I would like to not forego the August Academy. I don't know. I think we should probably take a look to see if eliminating a training academy would affect the safer grant and also just the timing'",
        "'speaker_3': 'of the year. And as I mentioned in viruses and whatnot, I would much rather look at a later academy for elimination as opposed to one to make up in August. So that's it. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember. Councilmember Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. First of all, I thought the presentation was incredible. You know, this is this is we're heading into a difficult time. But somehow this presentation and maybe I'm a serial optimist, but I feel good about going into this process with with with Tom delivering the framing that he delivered about a balanced outcome approach and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'making sure that we still resemble the city still resembling substance itself in some ways as we come through this. I think I was glad to hear the confidence in Tom saying that our team is up to the challenge.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's incredibly important. I have support from your leadership. I heard the question, what are our values? That was important for me to hear that values are going to be a thread that sort of guides the decisions that we will make.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we need to make sure we have a full understanding what those values are across the city. What's our what's our philosophy as the city, as it relates to our budget? I think a few things on it sort of highlight.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think the economic investments are important. If we're talking about a 3 to 4 year recession here. This is an opportunity to plant some incredible seeds and seeds that will allow us to come back even stronger than we were before in all parts of town.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I remember when there was a little bit of, you know, every once in a while we hear about, hey, we're able to make this investment in this project to make it happen. But we were able to get the money back through the increased property taxes or increased sales taxes that will generate on this project.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I want to hear more of that as we move forward. Where are the other seeds that we can plant in all of our neighborhoods to really make sure that our economic engine is booming over the next two years?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I was proud to hear that discussions have gone well with our employee groups. We will certainly need buy in from our entire city family in order to preserve the quality of public services that we have. I was around I started in the city in 2010 in the midst of a tough budget and budget season.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That was you know, that was I remember that was the budget. That rescue 12 was cut. I can speak to you know, I know that there's going to be a lot of conversations about priorities. And what I can offer now is that what I'm really looking for as we make these decisions?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think we're too early to talk about what the priorities are today, but I'll be looking for certain conditions on how we make those decisions. And I think that balanced outcome approach sets that up quite well. I think one is we need to consider and reflect on data.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So as we approach prioritization of cuts, I want to know more about the context to everyone's ability to access services no matter what neighborhood you live in. For example, in his neighborhood, what is the per capita rate of access to your library?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If you have 50,000 people with access within a mile or two miles of your library that we need to understand if that library hours were cut, hours it to have a greater impact on that significant amount of people, just as an example.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The same applies to afterschool programs, tree trimming streets for street sweeping emergency response times. I know a lot of times we talk about as it relates to emergency response times, what the overall citywide average is. But when you peel that out and I had to learn this the hard way, I didn't realize it initially.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But that cut to Rescue 12 gave North Long Beach a 3 minutes later response time in emergency responses than everywhere else in the city. We had to peel back, you know, layers to understand that and which made it incredibly important.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We were just going on with the citywide average was so we need to understand what those impacts are so we can we can understand what the base level commitment is will provide to the city, not the average, the base level commitment.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Everyone should meet a minimum standard for every one of these services, not the average on minimum standard. And see how we all compare to what that minimum standard is across the city. If one one area town has a much significantly lower, lower, lower response time or low access to some service that should affect every one of us'",
        "'speaker_3': '. And that's the way we should really be thinking about this thing as it relates to public safety. I was glad to see the reference. The public safety continuum was reflected in the presentation. It's important to our community and frankly, it's a part of the values we've talked about for the last ten years.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Public safety continuum. The outcome of safety is it's judged by a broad set of factors beyond crime statistics. Yes, we want crime down. We want response times low. But safety to me also means that our streets are clean, well-lit.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It means our parks are activated and graffiti is abated. It means. That means public works. Parks. Animal control. Animal control. Libraries, health. They all play a part in helping me make our community and keep our community safe. I'm glad to hear that we're moving forward with our academies.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm glad to hear that the reference to the academies that were canceled in the early 2000s and the way that that affected our ability to respond. And so it's great to hear the framing that, hey, we're moving forward, I think is responsible, that the city manager saying, let's evaluate the impact of the safer ground and the size'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and scope of the academy. So I think that's responsible to do. Another thing I'll say, just based on witnessing this, this process in the past is contracting out. I think I've heard it a number of times. We're proud of the quality public services that we provide as a city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We want to continue to count on that. It's quality because those are those are hard working city employees. We know their name. We know they're going to retire from the city and they love this city. So we need to really be mindful of as we explore, as we explore ways to innovate and use technology that we're mindful'",
        "'speaker_3': 'of, of contracting out and protecting and preserving our quality both services. The last thing I'll say is, you know, I think these it's going to be a few difficult years. That's true. But this is a real opportunity for us to reinvest and reimagine, to set the stage for a truly robust recovery in our economy.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That should be our focus. If we really focused on thresholds, outcomes, service outcomes and set the stage for robust recovery. Thanks a lot. That's that's my.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember. Appreciate that, Councilmember Austin.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, I thank you. And I think my colleagues have said most of what needs to be said, and I appreciate all the comments thus far of Tom. I thank you and financial management staff for giving us a very, very clear.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Outlook on what is facing us as a city in terms of our finances. I did do have a couple of questions and then a couple of comments as well. I'm not sure if I heard it, but we do know that there are other actions you take you both the state and federal level that could yield windfalls of'",
        "'speaker_3': 'of moneys to our city to help us deal with COVID 19. And I would hope that should that happen, I think that should that happen many of the. Conversations regarding potential cuts to our budget will be mitigated. And I'm speaking particularly to the Heroes Act for Congress right now.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, let's hope that the US Senate and the President do the right thing to help not only our city but the rest of the country. I didn't hear a lot of conversation regarding how we are going to be utilizing our reserves to to to deal with this crisis.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And perhaps you can enlighten us again on that, how strategic or if we're going to be using our reserves strategically to to bridge any gap. I tend to agree with the comments regarding. Public safety. Yes, public safety represents two departments, represent almost 68% of our budget, a little over that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But these are critical services for our city and they should be prioritized. I think our residents would agree with that by and large. But at the same time, we need to to consider. The personnel there and the human resources that we have in those public safety.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Officers and firefighters that that we invest so heavily in. I guess the one question that I have and will have is, you know, as we move forward in the budget process above the budget oversight process. I'm always curious to know where are our our city staff is and what the outlook is on on retention, retirement or I'",
        "'speaker_3': 'think those have that information will help us make good, sound decisions, particularly when it comes to our our our our personnel budget moving forward. I'll remind you all that I'm reminded by this. That. That in 2012, when I joined the city council we were facing a month later we were hit with a $17 million budget deficit projected'",
        "'speaker_3': 'for NY 13. And obviously then it was quite a task for the City Council where the cuts that were being proposed were enormous and obviously that is. What we're facing today is is significantly higher than that. So the decisions before us are going to be great.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm super excited and I'm thinking, Chuck, Tom, for reaching out to our bargaining units, our unions throughout the city. Their partnership in this is going to be critical. Their involvement engagement in this process is going to be critical for us all.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We are in this together and we want to come out of this as a stronger city. I do think that we should be looking at. All of our contractors contracts are evaluating those very carefully and in-sourcing the work where we can.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We do have a very talented staff and even looking at consolidating apartments, redefining our city where we can do that, you know, right sizing where we can. But from a standpoint of sensitivity and understanding that the people that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Personnel that work for the city have done so diligently, faithfully, for many years, and they are the face of the city. Most of the time. And so all I'm really, really interested in understanding more about the balanced outcome based approach.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This is a first, and I'm sure it's an innovative approach of learning more about that as we engage more in this conversation. And I think there was some conversation regarding projects. I understand this is budget. Our biggest challenge is to be more more programmatic general fund, not necessarily projects in terms of one time funds.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I would just say that there are jobs associated with those projects as well and jobs that are important to our economy. And so let's not be too quick to cut. You know, public works projects that that that are that are improving our infrastructure.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And making our city safer as well. So I'm going to reserve the rest of my comments. Looking forward to a robust conversation. With the Budget Oversight Committee and the rest of the City Council for weeks and days. The.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Council member, Vice Mayor Andrews.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. Thank you very much. First of all, I want to thank you and Grace and everyone to help with this presentation together. I'm not going to make it long because we have a big agenda tonight. So this is how I'm accountable.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, until a U.S., as you know, managed that time. But you were there and we got through that. And I feel very, very confident you being on the know with this. And so I think there's so much that we have to look forward to and looking forward to continue to work so we can make some decisions'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that keeps the livelihood of our city. You know, I really think we can afford to put our public safety at risk. You know, our infrastructure is important and a continued workforce is vital. So we are really, really going to have to keep an eye on this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so with that, I think the presentation was everything that we saw there. So there will be more questions right now. I think, you know this great presentation and thank you again and your crew.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Vice Mayor Andrews, I want to go to a councilman in house and then I've got a group of folks that are chewed up for a second time. So we'll go to you guys after Councilman De.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You, Maer. And thank you so much, Tom, and city staff for all of the hard work that you've put into this. I echo all of my colleagues sentiments in regards to this item. It's it's terrible time that we're going through.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I feel very confident that we will indeed take a good look at this budget. And together we will come up with a really good resolution so that we can indeed come out stronger from this. One of the things that I also want to echo is the importance of our public safety, especially with police and fire.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think that a couple months back, I remember hearing people throwing out the words, oh, we another recession is coming. You know, we should expect another recession. And I would be like, Really? Hmm. But but never in my wildest dreams that I that I think that something this this that mental would happen to our city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And with that said, I'm so glad I'm so glad that we have a city manager right now that is at the top of his game and that knows budget very, very well. I feel very grateful to have you leading this time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'With that being said, you know, we are in a recession. And I also think back of when people said, what happens if we go into another crisis? And I'm not talking about just, you know, Corona virus again, which, you know, could or could happen again.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I'm talking about those things that are also unpredictable and that are out of our control. Like if we have a major earthquake, what is going to happen with that? You know, we are a state that is very prone to earthquakes and we should expect that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But we've been very lucky to not have had one. But what if that happens? You know what will happen. So those are things that I worry about a lot. That's why I go back to how important it is to keep our public safety.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I agree immensely with my colleague, council member, super not in the fact that we cannot we should not risk. Not having our fire academies right now. I think we need them more than ever right now to prepare ourselves not only for a second round of COVID.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That knock on wood will hopefully will not come, but also from any other catastrophes or any other things that might affect our our safety, our public safety in in this city. I'm I'm also very prideful to have our own police department and our own fire department within the city, and they take such great care of us.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Then I think that it's time. Times like this that we need to take care of them. I think that bringing on the academies, at least the ones that are scheduled to come sooner than later, and then let's work through them and see how we can adjust those.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And actually, if we need to eliminate something further on down the line, then we should. But right now, I think that that that to me is very important. So I want to make sure that that we do continue to have those the media that can and be also, you know, from a budget perspective.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We could also say that when new new recruits come on to either fire or PD, they come in at a much lower rate than those who are retiring. So maybe we can think about some incentives that could help people retire sooner.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But, you know, and also seeing that after this pandemic, those that were maybe in the verge of deciding whether to retire or not retire might be deciding to retire. So then that would leave a little bit of room to be able to bring some of our new recruits into our department.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So again, thank you all for all your sentiments and thank you staff for all the great work that you're doing. And I'm I'm very hopeful that together as a city and as a council, we will come out of this stronger than ever.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I might go back again for a second time to some council members council oranga.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I would call the comments have been great. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. We know we have a long agenda. Councilmember. Here's for you up again.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes. Just very briefly. Yes, we have a long agenda. I wanted to just briefly echo the comments around the academy. I know. I guess my question is more about if there's a. There is a way to craft the academy differently versus just saying that we can't fund them.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so I agree with what the comments that have already been made. But as we look forward, this is always a good time for us to kind of restructure and say if it's 7 hours this day, does it make sense to make it six and then do X amount of training, you know, and at a different time'",
        "'speaker_4': '? So I'm just curious about that and I don't need an answer necessarily. And then wanted to I just really appreciated Rex and I haven't talked about the budget conversation at all, but I appreciated hearing how he brought up access to services.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I think that that to me is really what the lens needs to be. Call it whatever you want to call it, but everybody should have the same access to resources, even if that means that that everybody's time is a little bit more delayed.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I appreciate all the comments that have been made and agree on the comments around stopping just, you know, making sure that all of our all bargaining units that are coming forward, that we're obviously negotiating in good faith and that we're all being asked to kind of do the same thing as much as we possibly can.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To come. Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilwoman. Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mayor. Just another quick question. Are we accounting for the percentage each of our public safety agencies is in relation to the budget. But when we. It.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Councilmember. I think you're breaking up a little bit. Can you repeat the question.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Into consideration, have a significant reduction in overtime due to special events. But it does the percentage of the budget that they are on a go. Can you hear me now? Can you hear me now? Yes. Okay. So when we talk about the percentages on one of the slides in the presentation, police and fire and public safety and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'preparedness and the EOC and dispatch make up 70% of the budget. And one of the things that definitely has hit our communities is a considerable reduction in special events. And a lot of times that special event overtime is matched with a special event revenue.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so has that been taken into account in the percentages on a go forward basis with a reduction of these special events?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilwoman. The projections of costs have been taken into account in terms of the overall FY 20 general fund and ACP expenses. In terms of the percentage, if you're talking about the percentage for the budget targets. Those are viewed more from a budget expenditure percentage perspective and is a starting point to generate options.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And the final decisions would really be based on what Tom was talking about, the balanced outcome approach that's just based on their current budgeted expenditures. But in terms of looking at our actual expenses in the year, we are looking at things like overtime and savings there, as well as additional expenses that were unexpected.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. I just want to close by saying once again, it's going to be a difficult time. We're going to get through this together. Hopefully we'll get through it stronger when we come out than when we went in.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But we do need to. Really as a council, look at what our priorities are because this will not be none of these decisions will be easy. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Gottesman, our concern is that you again? I'm not sure. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. Okay. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. So just hearing the conversation, I think the Academy, you come up a lot and I just want to hear a little bit more from staff. So. So what stage are we? So, Mr. Modica, what stage are we in on this current academy?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Where are we in that phase? I know that we discussed this being one of our first with our new diversity program, the Diversity Officer and Fire Academy. And I want to understand sort of the risk to this potential class.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So can you give us an update on where we are with this?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. So we also have Chief Luna here and Ray Toohey, who can answer some specific questions about fire and police academies. So Fire and Police Academy is scheduled to begin in July. And right now, the police or Fire Academy I'm sorry, the Fire Academy is scheduled to begin in August.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The diversity officer has been doing their work and both classes have done good outreach related to diversity. So I'm very cognizant of that. I don't want to lose that good work. What I am really asking and looking at is to push it back a little bit within some months so that we can and also look at the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'size of the classes just so that we can really rightsize those academies to where they need to fit and just understand the financial implications. I also have some COVID concerns. We've been tracking L.A. City. They had an academy class where 17 recruits tested positive.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They put in a lot of different protocols and still had 17 recruits test positive. So bringing that many people together in an area is not really, you know, conducive to COVID. So I am looking at you again, giving us a little bit of time.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We are in you know, we're not looking at losing those classes completely. And at least allow us to do some additional analysis. So if I didn't answer the question, we have both Ray Tuohy and and Chief Looney here.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sir. Can I speak to the question?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. Well, I think fire has been the bigger question. I'll bring up Chief Tuohy.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Councilman Richardson, this is deputy chief to a yeah. We are at the background check. The packets have all been received of of approximately in excess of 50 candidates for both classes. They're being evaluated by support services. So we're in deep into the process.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The challenge for us, for the fire department is the high caliber of candidates that are a part of our process. They're also being evaluated for other local agencies. Chief Espino and I are on a weekly conference call with the area fire departments and more than half of them in excess of 20 departments are advancing on their hiring'",
        "'speaker_6': 'process and these candidates are high on their list as well. So we want to capture the quality that Long Beach attracts. The once the background process is completed, they'll head towards the medical. And if if in fact, the August class proceeds, then they'll begin the first week of August.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. So here's what I would offer to that. I think we need to make sure that as we balance the fiscal impacts, let's say, for grants and all those other things, we also balance the integrity of the class that we are attempting to put forward.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I know that a lot of work has gone in on these classes. I also know that it's difficult to maintain. You know, we've talked about this for a while. Efforts and outreach that goes into making sure we have a diverse police force and fire department.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And, you know, I want to make sure those things are not compromised. So what would be helpful to me is to understand, you know, before we make decisions, I understand what's happening in some of these other departments. Are they delaying?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Are we sort of if we delay that, triggers that they will participate in other academies happening in other agencies? I really want to make sure we factor that out. I want to I want to say that you should do your you know, do your fiscal diligence.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But let's make sure that we are balancing the risk to the rest of the academy as well. You know, if this delay is risky, I'd like to know that. Thanks a lot.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So my own counsel, I think there's been a lot of questions just on academies, and I certainly understand that given how much we have left to work on tonight, I'd like to suggest that come back with kind of a report on the academies, the financial impacts, how much they cost, how much they're going to cost if we'",
        "'speaker_5': 'keep them on the current schedule, potential impacts, safer grant, all that type of thing. So I'll prepare that and then try to answer some more of those questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Modica. I know we have a long agenda. Have folks have queued up for a second time again. So I'm going to go through them hopefully to.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'You do that on cue, up more than once. But I really want to go back in green with the super, because I don't really think we can afford to jeopardize our academy for the summit. You know, and also, you know, we talk about math, how increase in emphasis on full time personnel.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I want to make sure that we hear that they really do hear me loud and clear that the proper engagement with appropriate unions but use up to par. So please work with our union. Keep them involved and informed before making any decisions that will affect their members.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor. Councilman Sun has.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mayor. Really quickly, just wanted to say thanks to Tom for providing that information about other academies and and for letting us know that there have been COVID positive cases in other academies. That seems like an enormous amount, something I wouldn't want to put our academy through.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I think that I I'm confident in the organizers of the academies that they will indeed learn from those agencies and be able to be prepared to be able to conduct an academy at this point through COVID, because, again, we need them.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Another thing that I wanted to say is that especially because all of these candidates have already been in process, they've been told that they're going to be joining the academy, especially for Fire and the Argus, I think guess is close enough, but yet far enough that there could be a lot of the implementation of social distancing and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'ways that we can we can reorganize what the Academy looks like for the fire department. So thank you again for sharing that information. And I look forward to hearing the report on this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I think that was everyone that was queued up a second time. So let me go ahead and we have a motion in a second to receive and file the report. Thanks again to staff for a great update.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'More to come, of course, and appreciate all the input tonight from from the council. I know the staff does as well and they'll use that input as we move forward. So can we get a roll call vote on the receiving file?'",

    "Recommendation to request City Manager to report on street sweeping outreach program to impacted neighborhoods and impacts on first day of enforcement efforts; and direct City Manager on additional potential programs to waive, dismiss, or lower street sweeping citations during COVID-19 emergency as needed.": [
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Thanks again for the budget presentation. So let's go on to the rest of the regular agenda. We're going to do item 25.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Communication for Mayor Garcia. Councilwoman Zendejas. Councilmember Pierce. Vice Mayor Andrews. Councilmember Urunga. Recommendation to request city manager to report on street sweeping outreach program to impacted neighborhoods and impacts on first day of enforcement efforts.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Madam Court. I'm just going to be brief. I mention this over to Mr. Murdoch in just a minute. Obviously, strict street sweeping enforcement resumed yesterday. And I think there was broad consensus with the council of why street sweeping is important for public health and safety, especially as it relates to clean water and clean, clean gutters'",
        "'speaker_0': 'and neighborhoods and neighborhood safety. So we I think everyone is in agreement. We also know, obviously, that there's huge financial hardship. It's happening across the city and there's a really strong communication communications program that was put in place to address these upcoming weeks where it's back in place.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so this is really a two part recommendation tonight. But the first I hope we get turn over to Mr. Modica would give us an update on how our enforcement efforts, what our communication strategy was like the last few weeks, and maybe an update on how Monday and yesterday's enforcement went.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then I'm going to have some suggestions about how we move forward. So, Mr. Modica.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. We'll have Craig Beck and Nico Marconi in. Give that update. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, ma'am. Members of the council. We did put together a brief little outline just to share with you on some of the efforts made relative to street sweeping and keeping our city clean. Dico has that and he's going to go through the information for this evening.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'A. Thank you, Craig. Thank you, Mr. Mayor, and members of the council. We did resume issuing citations for street sweeping as of yesterday, Monday, May 18th. And just to give you some background, the city originally suspended, issuing street sweeping citations on March 17th.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The city did encourage residents to move their vehicles, despite the fact that there were no citations. But as time went on, fewer vehicles were being moved and sweeping in. Many areas of the city had become ineffective as debris continued to accumulate.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'As a result, this city council agreed and directed staff on, I believe it was April 21st to resume issuing citations on May 18th and to provide two weeks of noticing prior to that by putting fliers on cars that would otherwise have been cited for a street sweeping violation.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So beginning of May 4th, we began putting fliers on vehicles, warning them that beginning May 18th, we would be we would be issuing citations. Yesterday, about 925 sites were issued on Monday. Our average Monday is typically around 450 citations that are issued.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we issued about twice as many as we typically do. But if we go back to May 4th, where we we first started putting fliers out on May 4th, Monday, we fired 6000 vehicles and probably just a little bit over 6000 vehicles.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And if you take a look at the 6000 vehicles reducing to 925 vehicles, two weeks later, it's about an 85% reduction in the number of vehicles that were on routes compared to May 4th. So with that and our other public education outreach efforts, which I will review in just a moment, I think the message did get out'",
        "'speaker_6': 'to the majority of the public. Any time we attempt we temporarily suspend citations for street sweeping. We typically see a spike when we first initially resume citations, despite how much outreach we do do. We also typically see a small bump during light rain days like we had yesterday, because some people assume that we are not going to'",
        "'speaker_6': 'sweep it. We only suspend sweeping if the rain makes the operation problematic. Yesterday we did have one route where we stopped sweeping partway through the time zone. It was the 10 to 12 a.m. total from 10 a.m. to 12 noon time zone.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But by 1230, when we began the next time zone, that was dry enough to continue sweeping. To get an idea of the tonnage being collected, our inability to sweep properly during the suspended time period brought us to a low of 0.3 tons of debris collected on April 27th.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Compared to when we did start sweeping the citations again yesterday, it jumped to 2.54 tons. So it was more than eight fold increase in the amount of debris that was collected. This compares to about one and a half to one and three quarter tons in a typical sweeping pre-COVID.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So it still was a spike from what we would regularly get. And that's a reflection on the increased debris that was accumulating along the routes. It's important to note, too, that Monday is our fewest routes, fewest residential routes, so other days have much more significant tonnage that come with it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We did receive approximately 150 calls on Monday regarding street sweeping. Virtually all of those calls were questions, not complaints. We have about ten complaints on Monday about why are we issuing citations. The rest of the calls, about 50%.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We're asking if we indeed were initiating the resumption of issuing sites and 50% were questions regarding are we still sleeping because of the rain? We did receive about seven or eight more complaints today and the city has provided a free parking program to help assist people that may be impacted for parking as a result of being home'",
        "'speaker_6': '. We have 20 lots citywide that are available with over 4300 parking spaces. For those spaces, 1357 permits have been issued, leaving nearly 3000 permits still available to utilize those off street parking lots. I'd like to talk a little bit about our outreach efforts.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We issued six press releases through our Joint Information Command Center, specifically about the street sweeping program. We have included information in six different editions of the Golden Beach newsletter. We have in five locations and our on our websites on the city's COVID page, the public works page, the city's press release page, among other pages, where we have'",
        "'speaker_6': 'identified the street sweeping, resuming service and parking enforcement resuming service with regard to street swimming, we ran paid advertisements online ads in the post, the grunion an opinion on starting May 15th to Saturday, May 23rd excuse me, our social media, Long Beach City social media.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We had over 50 posts with 500 over 500,000 views between March 16th and May 17th regarding street sweeping public works, social media 21 posts with over 122,000 views. And Long Beach Recycles also had 13 posts with nearly 10,000 views.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'An interesting note to make is that the recent overall increase of posts tend to be supporting resuming street sweeping operation and with the information center has not seen a general increase of complaints leading up to enforcement. And that's that's a that's actually a.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'An example of how our our residents and businesses have, I believe, embraced and appreciated the efforts that we've made to provide some relief and are now helping us in providing the proper street sweeping service. All these are these efforts don't even include the council offices and the mayor's office for messaging your constituents.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And we appreciate the support you provide in doing that. Also, as I said, we worked for two weeks distributing fliers on vehicles rather than issuing citations that would have been in violation of the street sweeping restrictions. We issued we issued over 80,000 fliers during that two week period.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'd like to also just add in before I conclude this, that the city does have some existing payment relief assistance programs. There is an indigent payment plan which was mandated by the state a while back, and that can be utilized for people who are of low income and need assistance.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There's a non indigent payment plan that's available to anyone who requests that the city decided to implement themselves without being forced, without being required to do so by the by the state. And there's a one time towing and parking citation waiver for homelessness.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If people can provide evidence of experiencing homelessness where they can have a one time waiver. That's my presentation. I'm here to answer some questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Appreciate that update. There are public works team. And I just want to just, you know, again, just say that I want to thank the entire public works team. I think you really heard the council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You went out and did an enormous amount of outreach. Obviously, the wiring work, the social media work. I know that we've been in touch consistently on on this work. And so I just want to thank all of you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We think you've done a good job. But so why are we here? And, Mr. Modica, I know you and I are having some discussions and you can maybe answer some of these questions that were kind of lead me to where I'd like us to go.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we're certainly I know some of the council members also would like us to end up. So. Mr. Modica, just to be clear, so be we. The amount of citations given out yesterday were double what we normally would on a monday, correct?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And I think what that reflects is two things, I think. One is I think I, along with many others, were worried that that would act, that that number would be a lot higher. Right. We didn't know how many folks, because here's the reality is we fired for two weeks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And still there are a lot of folks who still did not know about the change. Not everybody is on social media. Not everybody has access to these communication networks. And so a lot of people still didn't know about the change.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And more importantly, there's a lot of folks that are greatly burdened by their financial hardship who a a ticket of this type would be very damaging to their own survival and their own ability to pay. There are other other fees.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I'm in no way I think we need to st we we all understand that support that. But how do we provide some additional relief as we're easing into bringing back this enforcement? And that's really what this conversation is about.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so what where I'd like to see us have I know that currently. Mr. MODICA you've mentioned to me that the city does not have much flexibility when it comes to waiving parking citations. And I think many of us know that when when folks reach out and try to get citations waived or protested, it's a very small'",
        "'speaker_0': 'fraction of.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Folks that are.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Able to do that in the code. Is that right, Mr. Monica?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes, that's correct.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so and it doesn't provide you with much flexibility in emergencies or times of kind of crisis. To make those adjustments. Is that right?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we do have some ability to do that. But what we are always very cognizant of is treating everybody fairly. So it is really something that we want to have kind of direction on if we're going to do that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'How do we define who would would be eligible? So we really wouldn't want that to be on an individual basis. It's more of a programmatic. So that I think is the discussion tonight.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right. And so from a programmatic perspective, I think what we would like to see is to provide the city manager with the ability to waive for that for the next two weeks, the ability for the city manager to waive parking I'm sorry, street sweeping citations as it relate to anyone that would come forward with any sort of'",
        "'speaker_0': 'COVID 19 related financial hardship. And so it's for the next two weeks, as we're easing into it, tickets will continue to be given out. But if someone reaches out to the city to protest or because they didn't or because any of these relate to COVID 19, they didn't get the flier that didn't hear the information.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We waive that first citation and the city manager would have the ability to waive those automatically. We obviously know a lot of folks will pay their citations and that's fine, but some won't be able to and some will reach out for help.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And this is a way to assist them as we transition, and that will expire after next week. And so for this week and for the following week, we'll be able to waive that's that citation almost as an additional warning.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So that would be the main the motion and I know I see councilman's in Dallas as I made that motion. If I can get a second on that motion and we'll go through the.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The motions here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Can you see a second on the motion? So that's the motion as it stands. And then I'll have some additional comments once we get through the Council as well about some suggestions, effort from public works as well. So that's a motion on the floor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Matron, it's over to Councilman's and Dallas.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There has been a representative of the First District that is a hugely impacted district when it comes to parking and also hugely impacted where with the inability to get direct communication or from city and from staff, I think that this is the only the fairest thing that we can do.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think that a lot of the residents in my district are going through very, very hard financial setbacks, as is everyone. Right. But like you said earlier, a ticket like this of this magnitude can really, really set them back.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So having this this program in place, I think, will be very, very helpful not only to the residents in my district, but to the residents in the whole city. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilwoman, I have the second, which is Councilmember Pearce. Councilwoman.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, mayor. And thank you for your bringing forward. I know the last time we had this discussion, it was robust. Obviously, the second district is highly parking impacted. Also, we have a lot of residents in the second district that are the ones that are struggling with unemployment.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so I support the motion on the floor. I did just want to clarify because I've had lots of people ask and I asked Tom this question earlier. People have asked about reducing the parking fees. I think the parking fees like $70, if we reduce it by 50%, the council would have to vote again to increase it'",
        "'speaker_4': '. Is that correct? We couldn't say for the next two weeks, reduce the parking fee and then automatically it would go back up to the normal rate. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's correct. You would have to actually have a hearing. We'd have to agenda is it for a specific hearing and actually reset the fee?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. I appreciate the the direction of this motion. And I think as the COVID situation continues, we have to continually reevaluate, you know, what's appropriate. I know the last time we talked about this, we talked a lot about the parking lots.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I know that staff is extremely busy with a lot of priorities. Has there been any movement on reaching some of those parking lots and being able to say, let's take one of our parking stands, like one of the ones we removed off Fourth Street, give it to them so that they can charge parking in their parking lots'",
        "'speaker_4': ', like the parking lot that we talked about.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So Councilmember, I think to address the question, what you're asking about is a privately owned lot and the placement of a parking meter where that private entity could then charge parking rates. We do have the ability to move forward with that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'However, what we're struggling with is having the privately owned property owners wanting the city to cover liability for public parking on their lots.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I understand that that's continue to be the conversation, I guess, and I don't want to spend too much time on it, but it is. What? And when you drive to downtown L.A. and all of those private lots are opened up for private companies to take people's money to park there.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Who's paying the insurance there?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They are because they're making money off of it. So we would do that in a heartbeat. You know, if they wanted to charge for the funding and cover their liability costs, that would be fine by us.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes, that's what I'm what assuming the whole time is that we would assume that they would be making money, therefore they would pay for their liability. Not that it's just opening the door for anybody to come, but that if we found that ability to put in one of those parking meters, like what we have at fourth and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'cherry, that that might be a good solution because I appreciate that we have parking that's available, but I know some other council members and, you know, the the north side or other side of my district doesn't have those lots close to them.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I just don't. Any time we talk about parking, I'm going to bring up the private lots and say that my staff is here to help do outreach. If there's another way that we can have the conversation, I'd appreciate it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But and Craig, I think you and I have a briefing next week. We can talk a little bit more about it. I support the motion on the floor. I really appreciate the mayor for bringing this forward, and I look forward to seeing how the process goes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilmember Superman.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. I spoke quite a bit on this on the 21st, and I have some unique conditions in the fourth District, so I apologize for being repetitive, but this is certainly not a one size fits all. As I mentioned in the previous meeting, zip code and I have no way to go for.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It was dense zip code in the city and that's the western half of the forties. I'd like to commend Public Works for doing a great job of outreach. That's not the problem. The problem is there's no place for folks to move their cars to within a reasonable distance.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I did point out also that of the the 2500 spaces found in Lodz, only six were located in the fourth District and that's at the Pruitt library. And those will go away when the libraries reopen. I'm. If it doesn't look like I'm going to have support on a on a on emotion.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I would like to bring out one. When someone doesn't pay a parking ticket in Long Beach and you can confirm this. Mr. MODICA After 76 days that gets turned over to the DMV. And then when that individual goes to register.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The. Oh, those park. You take it so they can't register their car. Are you aware of that policy?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So John GROSS will talk to us a little bit about that policy.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You broke up a little bit. Council member but in in general, we have a timeframe. I'm not sure whether it's 76 days, it may be, but at some point we do turn it over to the DMV. We have, um, temporarily and DeKoe is, is sitting there.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I believe we have temporarily suspended that process. We will. And we've done a number of things to help in the COVID crisis. We don't apply penalties on parking tickets in general, and we have backed off of the DMV process also.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we have done. And that has made a difference to our community, I think.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. So just a couple of points. And if I break up, please tell me. But on April 21st when we move this forward. I for one, but I think other council members were anticipated we'd be in a different place on May 15.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'A speculation that the safer at home order might be lifted that point since it hasn't. We have the same conditions that we did back then when we instituted the suspension. So it doesn't work. I guess what I would offer if we can officially suspend the policy of sending these citations to the DMV, because I think that's particularly'",
        "'speaker_3': 'onerous for a period of one year. I could support that. Now, is that is that made as a friendly amendment?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember. I know that Customs and data says that as the motion. I have no issues with suspending. Would you be amenable to suspending them until the safer at home order is lifted?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, the problem with that proposal is that would accumulate. And if someone gets, you know, behind in parking tickets, then they might have a 300 or $400 bill filled up. And then suddenly they can't register a car which might be subject to towing if that car is parked in a public public street at some point.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I don't have I don't have an issue with that. I'm okay with that. I just I don't know the implications of what that means. The staff want to comment on that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes they can. In the short term. In responding to what we think City Council wanted, we have effectively suspended that operation. We have not determine when to turn it back on and that was something we would be coming to council with.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But it no longer is in practical enforcement at the moment and and the financial implications to do it after the safer at home order is lifted or people get back more financially would probably be quite significant. My guess is it would probably be over a million, maybe more than $2 million a year in terms of that suspension'",
        "'speaker_6': '. So it would be quite a significant impact that would have to be offset. So yes, it can be done. An alternative solution might be simply to ask the staff to come back to council when when they are thinking it is appropriate to begin that enforcement.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So let me do this and I want to go to the other members and I actually like a lot of what Councilmember Sepinwall said. So let me see if I can incorporate some of that into the final motion, because I do have some some small edits to it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And Council Councilmember let me know at that time if that's something that's.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Amenable to you. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Vice managers.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah. First of all, we thank you for your leadership on this. And I think at this time, any relief we can come up with, as you know, is greatly appreciate. And so I'm happy to be on it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So why have you this councilmember pierces at you a second time or no?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So let me go back to the motion. So let me this. What we have in front of us is and then I wanted to add add something to it. So what we have in front of us is essentially until June 1st, the city manager will have the ability to to waive the entire citations.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That would be the entire citation would be waived for anyone that received a citation, that first kind of citation as just a warning opportunity. And then that way that there is flexibility. But any anyone that's coming forward with a COVID related hardship or financial hardship or just that didn't get the communication would have that in place.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So that would be the motion in addition to that. So this was going to be part of the the original motion is I'd like this issue to be agenda ized again on the June 2nd agenda by staff, because I think that we need to at that point, review two weeks of data and see how we're doing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I know it's it's onerous, but I think this is a really, really big issue for for working families right now. And we're getting a lot of folks that are struggling on this issue and they're really having a hard time with the parking issue.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I'd like this to be a generalized as it is the councilmember supervisor friendly. I want to you know, I understand there's some concern from staff there, but can can we at least for now, because we could suspend those can we suspend what the council member was referring to as far as sending those tickets to the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'DMV, at least through the safe at home? And then when we come back on June the second agenda, you can give us a broader report on that piece of this initiative. And maybe we at that point can have a discussion about extension or what the implications are, because I want to learn a little bit more.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So at least at least we'll extend it through safer at home and then we can can revisit that in two weeks to see if there's additional extensions we want to make or adjustments. Mr. MODICA First, is that does that seem okay, manageable for staff?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes, we'd like to request that. We either come back on the ninth or the 16th, the way the agenda process works to come back on the second. We need to have our report to you by Friday. So I think you're going to want us to make the regular agenda.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I think you're going to want us to look at what happens between now and the two weeks that you gave us to waive some fees. We then could come back with a report and put that on the agenda for either the ninth or the 16th.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And we'd certainly not change anything related to DMV between now and that time and be able to report back on on what that process looks like.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I appreciate that. I'm going to actually ask for the report to come back on the second. Mr. MODICA And only because this two week process that we're waiting to see actually ends on June 1st. And so I think it's important for us to kind of take a side like at least whatever we can put together, even if'",
        "'speaker_0': 'it's on the supplemental, whatever information we can by the second. I'd like to discuss it then and then Councilmember Super, if that sounds amenable to you, well, we'll move forward on, on your really good suggestion on waiving those making that a policy.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then we can talk on the second about maybe extending that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah, that sounds great. I really like. But it's. Back to council. And quite frankly, I did not know it had been suspended by the command staff doing that. Absolutely.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And Mayor, we want to just for clarity, we're talking about street sweeping citations, right. To this point, we have not talked about anything else. Is that confirmed at street sweeping tickets?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Let's confirm because the rest of our continuing goings with street sweeping citations.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Years, and that team includes the Our Administrative and Financial Services Bureau manager Lisa Fall and Jill Stauber, our real estate project coordinator. So Jill will give a brief overview of the proposed ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'All right. Good evening. In January of this year, staff presented a draft ordinance regulating short term rentals. And we are back tonight for a new first reading following that discussion. This brief presentation provides a recap of the proposed regulations and also highlights the changes requested by council in January.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'With the slide forward. Okay for some background in 2017. At the request of City Council staff conducted research and recommended hiring a consultant to conduct a more thorough study. Throughout 2018, we held a series of community outreach events.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'An online survey conducted several case studies and presented our findings and recommendations to City Council for discussion. At that time, Council instructed the city attorney to draft an ordinance in 2019. Staff responded to additional questions, created a phased implementation plan, and executed a voluntary tax collection agreement with Airbnb, and ultimately drafted an ordinance allowing for limited staffers'",
        "'speaker_6': '. Then in January of this year, the Council discussed the item and requested some changes to the ordinance. So here's a recap of some key elements of the ordinance and establishes that we vocal annual city registration and fee protects the housing stock by limiting the number of non primary residence staffers citywide to no more than 1000 units.'",

The slide shows the maximum number of stars any one operator would be allowed to operate.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'As a reminder, a primary residence star is defined as the unit where the host resides at least 275 nights per year. And during that time, any guest stays are considered hosted and there's no limit on hosted stays. So that would only leave up to 90 days maximum per year in which that unit could be rented as an'",
        "'speaker_6': 'unhosted stay. By definition, it's also worth noting that the majority of operators in Long Beach are currently operating only one unit. Here are just some of the basic regulations, including collection of transient occupancy tax. Homeowners associations may request inclusion on a STR prohibited properties list.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Occupancy is limited to two guests per legally permitted bedroom plus two with a maximum of ten guests and staffers are prohibited and deed restricted. Affordable housing units, dormitories and adus. Yeah. And the enforcement provisions of the ordinance are the key to dealing with operators that do not abide by the rules.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Violations would be subject to $1,000 fine per day, except a 30 day warning period shall be provided for advertising in store without a valid registration. And of course, you only get one of those. There is a 24 seven complaint hotline with a live operator upon issuance of three fines.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Maximum occupancy. And conduct. Or activities that constitute a public nuisance. In order for the program to be successful, we'll need the cooperation of the hosting platforms, particularly for removing listings that have not registered or have had their registrations revoked.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So hosting platforms cannot complete any booking transactions for an STR. If notified by the city that a valid SDR registration number has not been issued to the operator platform, so remove any listings upon notification from the city and on a monthly basis the platform so provide to the city.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The SDR registration number of each listing name of operator address of the SDR unit number of days each unit was booked and the total price paid for each rental. The petition to prohibit Unhosted stickers is one of the areas that the council asks us to take a closer look at in January.'",

Is now a simple majority of the residential property owners that must sign a petition to prohibit unhosted stays.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Upon request for the city to initiate a petition, signatures will be collected by the city staff via US mail. If the petition is approved, the restriction remains in effect for three years, at which point the restriction can be lifted by a similar petition process.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The initial petition process is available within 180 days of the effective date, and a new 180 day petition process period shall be established annually thereafter. The boundary of the prohibition we had previously recommended using the census tract. But there is some concern that a full census tract was too large an area and also that the corresponding cost'",
        "'speaker_6': 'could be prohibitive. So a census tract is still an option for your consideration tonight. But what staff is now recommending is using the census block group. A census block group is a geographical unit used by the United States Census Bureau, which is between the census block and the census tract.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'All census tracts in Long Beach consist of between three and eight census block groups. Using block groups also increases the petitioning party's chance for a successful petition for those more localized neighborhoods that have a strong desire to opt out.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'To give you a visual idea of a census tract versus a census. BLOCK We're going to show you two maps of the same census tract. So this map shows one residential census tract surrounded by the black lines. And the next.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And this is the same census tract showing the census block groups within that tract. So there are six block groups within that census tract, their smaller geographical drop geographically. And this is the the boundary that we are now proposing.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So pending council action tonight. This would be our updated timeline for implementing the ordinance. If the reading is approved tonight, then the final reading would be June 2nd. But the ordinance would not go into effect for an additional 121 days or four months, during which time the registration process would be set up.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And we would select the compliance monitoring consultant. The initial registration period would last 160 days over a six month full register, full enforcement would begin at the end of that initial registration period. And just to clarify, the initial 180 days is not the only opportunity you have to register.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'People will be allowed to apply for registration after the initial 180 days. The next step would be to adopt an ordinance amending Title 21 of the municipal code. That's the zoning code, submit the local Coastal Program Amendment to the California Coastal Commission for approval and develop the implementation guidelines, which would be the actual registration process.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That concludes the reports. We are happy to answer questions. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Let me. I have a motion and a second, Councilmember Pierce, and then a second I think is going to be by Councilman Price. But let me turn this over to Councilmember Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Great. Thank you so much. I really want to say how much I appreciate staff's work on this and. Hey, Robert. Oh, man. I like when people use video. I appreciate staff's work on this. I appreciate the years that we have trying to get this right.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I think it's unfortunate that we're bringing this forward in a period of COVID, because when we brought this forward, it was a time when our economy was strong, our hospitality industry was around 78% occupancy. Our housing needed to be looked at.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We saw housing prices increasing every month. And so today it is not that reality. But I want to recognize the value that short term rentals have for mom and pops that, you know, if they need the additional income that they're in their house and they're saying that we want to make sure that this is something that that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'can bring them that additional revenue. And so I say all of that because I think that it's important that we realize that we are not in the same era that we were when we brought this item forward originally and I moved my motion.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So they are so organized and I got unorganized. Okay. So trying to find the balance in between small business owners who host their homes, the native visitors that desire alternatives to hotels, the necessity of the city to protect our neighborhoods while allowing us to in the budget needs for enforcing this ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This council has worked very hard to strike that balance. And COVID 19 hit. Our hotels have been hit hard. They've stayed engaged, working with the city, working with the health department to implement training and cleaning standards within all of their hotels.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Meanwhile, we have not had a substantive conversation about what the future of stars means in a COVID era. So before I make my motion, I actually have some questions for the city staff around the health orders and how short term rentals fall into to play within our health orders.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Are they deemed essential? Do we have cleaning standards for them? And so staff, if you could answer some of those questions for me, that'd be great.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We do have the city attorney on the line, Councilwoman Pierce, and he is prepared.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To respond to that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That question regarding the city's health order. And that is city attorney and deputy city attorney Mike Mays.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mr. Mes or Ms.. Galatia.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If. They're not.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay, Councilman Pierce, member of City Council. Can you hear me, Mike?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'All right. Currently, the health order, the city's existing health order does not directly mentioned short term rentals. It is not considered to be an essential business. So therefore, under the order, if the ordinance was passed tonight, under the current order, short term rentals would still not be allowed until the order is released or amended once, but several'",
        "'speaker_3': 'more times, probably. So it's not directly covered. The ordinance itself, as you said, Councilman Pearce was drafted in a different era before COVID. So there are no standards written into the ordinance that pertain to cleaning and sanitizing anything of that nature.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It was just assumed that the operators would come. So there isn't any guidelines in the current ordinance to address that issue.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Right. Thank you for that. And I expect that as businesses are coming back on, as the phases are changing, that there will be new standards applied to each one of those at that time. I do want to offer for transparency.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I want to share with everyone that I did ask if there was a way to postpone this item so that we weren't hearing it in the middle of COVID. But we do have other items that are really important, like the Mello Act and our inclusionary housing and staff has worked really hard on this, and from the presentation'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that they just shared, it is going to take, you know, 120 days to be able to get this program up and going. And so we know that it wouldn't be like tomorrow. We just signed this and it would go into place.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So with that being said, with the consideration of our local economy. One other note before I make my motion, I'd also like to note that that I appreciate the hotels being at the table, but I also recognize that thanks to measures like Measure W hotels have cleaning standards in place, that we understand what the workload is and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that there's oversight. I think we've all. I know most of us have probably stayed at an Airbnb by now or a short term rental and have great experiences. But we all have that one experience where something wasn't clean to the tee.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so I think this is a good time for us to to pause on non hosted and really make sure that we have a good policy in place for the health and safety of anybody that might be staying in one.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So with that, I have a motion that I'd like to make and I know that Councilmember Price has some comments to. I, I'd hope that you guys hear this motion with the full belief that that we should move forward with a program that is respectful of our tenants, of our small business owners, and of all the work'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that we have done through the years. So with that, my motion is to adopt the ordinance as written with the following changes only permit the operated operation of hosted expires at this time in accordance with Long Beach's COVID 19 health orders and related protocols.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Request staff to work with the hosting platforms and other regulatory agencies, including the city's health department, to develop cleaning and sanitizing protocols specific to the operations of short term rentals, with an emphasis on standards for non hosted rentals.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Prohibit the operation of non hosted staffers for a period of at least six months until and until city staff presents a report to the Council for a vote to reconsider amending the ordinance to permit non hosted stays. The report should contain the following information.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Proposed cleaning and sanitizing protocols as recommended by the Health Department. Information regarding the economic impact of COVID 19 on the tourism industry in the city of Long Beach. A report on the transit occupancy tax paid to the cities by hotels and staffers during the last three years.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The number of registered permitted staffers in the city since adoption of the ordinance in the city's housing rental housing vacancy at the time of the report. I've spoken with the city attorney's office and it's my understanding that these changes to the ordinance that could be made because of the motion will require that the ordinance be brought to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'City Council for another first reading and hopeful adoption. I. I hope that there is support for this. I feel like it's measured, it's thoughtful, considering where we're at and considering that it would that it would be only really two months of hosting while staff has the opportunity to do the work on the back end, to set up'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the structure, to make sure that there is enforcement and registration and all of those pieces as well. I think the work that we did the last time on the council took a lot of work. But I believe that the language that we have in place right now is the best language for our our city, based on my'",
        "'speaker_4': 'conversations with development services and their wish to maintain the language as we have it now. So with that, that's my motion. So I look forward to hearing your comments. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. The second is by Councilwoman Rice.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Can you hear me, Mr. Mayor?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay, great. Thank you. And thank you to the staff for your comments on this. And thank you to Councilwoman Pierce for making the motion. I want to reiterate that I spent quite a bit of time talking with staff about the proposed ordinance and making sure that the preferred language that they have proposed is what I encourage my'",
        "'speaker_2': 'colleagues to adopt tonight. These are. These are novel issues to some extent for the city. And I think staff has included language in here that will allow the staff to better regulate this industry in the city as we as we welcome it as a as an operating and legitimate business in the city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I think having staff's preferred wording in here in terms of the regulations of both the STR operator as well as the the host platform I think is very important. And so I am going to be asking my colleagues to support staff language.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I do have a couple of clarification points and I think I know the answer. But just for the record. Councilmember Pearce, the unhosted stars that they would face in no earlier than six months from the adoption of the ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Is that correct? Correct. So that would allow hosted to begin and get phased in, which would take about 120 days. And then somewhere around then is when I imagine staff will give us a report on the Unhosted regulations and the items that you thoughtfully included in the report back.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then hopefully then at that point is when we would go into the Unhosted phase, which would be about two months after the hosted is already online.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think that timeline's. Right? Yes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay, great. Okay. So for staff, I have I do have a question. Slide seven of your presentation, is that consistent with the language in Section 5.7, 7.50 sub a? I just want to make sure that the language on Slide seven is consistent with what's proposed in the ordinance, which is that the burden would be on the hosting'",
        "'speaker_2': 'platform. My understanding is. To make sure that they include the registration numbers that. Correct. That is correct. Is the the the ordinance that's proposed includes that language. With a burden on the platform. Okay. I just want to make sure because when I looked at Slide seven and again, I'm looking at it very quickly here in the course'",
        "'speaker_2': 'of the the meeting and haven't had a chance to analyze it. But I just want to make sure that we're consistent. And it's my understanding that although the hosting platforms may not prefer that model, that's a model that staff believe will best allow it to enforce the order.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That is correct.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I say that because a major component, Councilmember Pearce and I, I believe it's districts two and three that have the majority of the short term rentals that we know of right now. Is that correct? That is correct.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I know that one of the issues that we have to balance, in addition to the requests and the desires of the hosting platforms that I know have contacted, council offices is the needs and the interests and the concerns of the residents.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And regulation of the stars and neighborhoods is very, very important. So I just want to make it clear, as I have from day one, that my goal would be that staff would have the tools that it needs to help easily regulate this industry so that we are mitigating neighborhood impacts such as noise and parking and public safety'",
        "'speaker_2': '. So I just want to confirm I know that the. Hosting platforms, you know, maybe want prefer different language. But I did speak with staff and I know staff has a strong preference for this language. Correct. That is correct.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. And then I. And so I'm going to support that because I want to do whatever I can to help regulation be as easy as possible for staff. And I do know that staff is also willing to sit with with the hosting platforms after this ordinance is approved to figure out how to make that particular requirement and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that language hopefully workable for all parties. Yes, we've made it very clear that we'd like to sit down with them and explore best practices as we develop the administrative procedures associated with the ordinance. Okay. And I know you will do that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But since this is perhaps not language that would have been selected initially by the hosts and platforms, I urge you and your team to do whatever you can to try to have a meeting of the minds of how to best effectuate your intent in accordance with how they're used to running their operations.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If there's an opportunity to to have a meeting of the minds, I would I would hope that that can be accomplished. And then on page 12, the language about the 180 dead. Oh, by the way, my I would like to offer a friendly to this motion that we adopt the opt out provision as to census tract blocks'",
        "'speaker_2': ', not census tracts. So hopefully that's okay with you, Councilwoman Pierce?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes, that's fine with me.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Can we clarify, Councilwoman Pierce, that you meant the census block group, the the lower level. Councilwoman Pryce and Councilwoman Pierce. Yes. We want the census block groups. Okay. Thank you. So my question in regards to that is the 180 days I know I talked with you about this earlier, Ms..'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Tatum, but on page 12, you know, the the language of how that 180 days would roll out. I understand the intent of it, but the language of how that would roll out and how neighborhood associations.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Or block.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Neighborhood track blocks would know when the 180 day period is up. I'm not sure if there's a way to fine tune that language a little bit more. Councilwoman, we we actually have proposed some language that fine tuned it and the city attorney is proposing to use that language.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It does not change the intent or the substance of it in any way. The language is just rewritten to be a little bit clearer. Great. Thank you. That's. That's all I wanted to make sure. And then with that, then I have nothing further.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I just want to thank staff for their excellent work on this. Thank you, everyone.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. You see, I got. Next on the list is Councilwoman Mongo. Are you muted? Councilman Mongo. Okay, I'm moving on to Councilman and day house.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hello. Hello.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There she is. Go ahead. Oh.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Thank you. Um, I guess I was hoping to find out the. Safer. The safety of our residents is of utmost concern to me and the safety of our residents, especially our hosts. Obviously, they can choose not to participate and not host when people come into town.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I would think that from a COVID perspective, Unhosted would be safer than the hosted. Now, I don't want to change the motion. I just think it's important. The lifeblood of a lot of these neighbors income is completely zero right now, and they are hoping that they're able to get the supplemental income or primary income in some'",
        "'speaker_4': 'cases back in place. And so I appreciate the balance. I also see that we've received communication, that there are already cleaning protocols that have been issued to some of the platforms limf hosts. I think this is important because right now across the region, we have first responders who are being sheltered in a lot of these platforms, vacancies'",
        "'speaker_4': 'during their COVID quarantine period. So they're cleaning protocols are there. I want to make sure that we keep that in mind and don't give a misunderstanding or misconception to the community. I actually think that measure w while it did provide a limit on the number of square feet that can be cleaned by a hotel, I don't think'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it came with specific cleaning protocols. And if it did, I would imagine that COVID would would potentially even increase those. And so I rely upon the management of those organizations to do a good job in bringing that forward in the same way that I would hope that these platforms would bring forward that work.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I say that because our staff is extremely overworked right now with COVID, it is very, very difficult for me to see additional time to be carved out for issues like this. And I appreciate Councilman Pearce's statements related to not wanting to put it on hold again.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They've done so much work so far. I would just be cautious about the depth of the amount of information and what's available and the cost of that information. We often have to outsource that to vendors and consultants and that consultant.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Money on those reports could be kept in-house to pay for our plumbers and our carpenters and our parks and rec staff. And so $100,000 report to me is not that high of a priority. So I guess what I would ask Councilman Pearce to do is put a financial limit on it for for it to be gathered through'",
        "'speaker_4': 'city resources only because when we're at the at the chopping block where we're cutting park programs and library hours. I think we all just need to work hard on pulling data from the sources that are out there and really limiting our contractors.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Is that something you'd be open to? This is Pearce. Yeah, I believe there's two things that I've asked for, and this are all things that either our health department, our economic development team or development services team could provide.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I appreciate that very much. I know that the city manager had previous a previous city manager often used his management consultant fund. And I just didn't want us tapping into that under any circumstance like this. I think that that kind of consultant is is really more important to be paid towards our city workers and the the the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'time that we need them. Next, I'd like to kind of just repeat something that Councilman Price said. I completely agree that the platforms are really responsible for telling us who that we if we tell them there is a violator.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Miss Tatum, in our discussion the other day, if we tell them the following, 15 homes are in violation of our policy. Is it your understanding that the language in the ordinance today states that it would then be the time for the platform to remove them from the platform?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That is that is correct. The ordinance has written with a couple of purposes in mind.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If we identify an.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Unregistered ACR, we can ask them to remove it and they would be obligated to do so. However, the first premise of the ordinance is that they should not put up on the website any stars that do not have a city registration number.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we have come at it in the ordinance from both directions.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then if a person were to lie with a fake registration number or type in the registration number, that's not truthful. The platform is also providing us on a regular basis some data about who is on their platform that we can verify against our own sources to let them know that there's a piece of a host that's'",
        "'speaker_4': 'not appropriate.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That is correct, as well as the additional resources of a consultant who specializes in data mining and having, I guess, a way to check that information. So, yes, we would have that available and the ordinance calls out for that specifically.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then if a host is potentially violating the 90 days, we would possibly get a report from neighbors. And then we would, as a city, let that platform know or let multiple platforms know because they may be only doing 90 days on one platform but say 90 days on another platform.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But we would let all the platforms know and then the platforms would be required to let us know how many days that facility had been rented.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That is correct, because the 90 days is a 90 day limit on the unit, not on each platform.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Right. So then we as a city would have to take that data in to verify. Okay. On this platform, they did 50 days and on that platform they did 50 days. So thus they're in violation. And then we would then notify the platform that they are in violation of the city policy and they need to be taken'",
        "'speaker_4': 'down for the remainder of the year. Or would they lose their permit?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They if they violate or exceed the 90 days and we can document that they would indeed be cited for a violation and that would count as one of the three violations that they're allowed before they would proceed to the revocation step for the as to our license.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Just before we continue, I. I think that there's maybe a crickets or maybe someone's outside. Diane. The crickets are really loud.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Oh, I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's okay.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's the baby's inside asleep, though. And when I talk, I'll wake her up.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, we'll take have as the sounds of the fifth district.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I just want to make sure that that was. Maybe that was catwoman's life. Just everyone else's muted. That's what those are. That sound is. Ah, crickets. So that's fine, you know, really.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Crickets. Thank you. And then just to provide some additional clarity and. When? If. If we pass this tonight, it will come back for second reading and then implementation will start in six months from the second reading.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'With.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Once that implementation happens.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Then the.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Unhosted. Right after that it sounded like a council in Pearce added in an additional vote to the council or something, because I get some clarity on that. Yes. Councilmember Mungo. The motion that I made says that staff need to do a report with.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'In six months. And at that time the council would vote on what would be appropriate for non hosted stars. And the reason for that is that this entire ACR policy was crafted when we were in a very different economic situation and a very different situation with our hospitality industry.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so giving us some, some more tools in the toolbox before we decided on what that appropriate number is. So yes. Oh, you're saying? I guess my concern is if we're only allowing a thousand citywide and we're only started starting with.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Posted. Theoretically, all 1000 spots could be filled by hosted. Is that correct? That is not correct. Okay. Help me. Posted is on unlimited. It said that the number that thousand was non-votes. Got it. Okay. Thank you. That helps.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This motion allows for hosted to go forward now, and there's not a limit on those. And then it says, let's look at the economics and then come back and then have a discussion about what what non hosted looks like.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And our housing market might be very different. We have no idea what it will look like at that time. So it makes it very difficult to bring on an entirely new, quote unquote new industry to the city in a time like what we're having right now.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The question would be to Mr. Modica, we have been budgeting revenue for and hosted and hosted and we've been receiving that revenue. So what is your prediction if the motion on the floor to pass in the amount of cuts we would need to make?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Due to the loss in revenue of. Potential.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'An Unhosted.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Non allowable. Airbnb, the RBA, whatever.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah. So that is something we want to bring back to you at the first reading when this comes back. So there's two components of it. One is the. On General Airbnb, which they had just been it been we had done the agreement and it's gone the general trend that certainly has gone down because of COVID.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So that's one impact. The second is we were planning on charging the cost of the program to the thousand units for non hosted through a registration fee as well as hosted. So with the reductions the Council is making, that's going to be a smaller amount of people who are going to be paying those registration fees.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we will come back with an estimate of how we're going to do that. It will likely be a smaller enforcement type program. So we know we may not be able to do all the enforcement that was originally envisioned until we get to a larger program and we'll report back on that when this comes back.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Councilman. What was the number? I'm sorry. Just one quick thing. Mr. Modica, do we know what the number was that we were projecting in those registrations in fiscal year 20?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, 800,000 was the TOTY, I believe, or. I'm sorry. 800 stars. You're. Yeah. Lisa forward would say that under the mike. I don't think you could hear that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'As part of the Fy20 budget process, we had made a conservative estimate that there would be 800 staffers registered. That was because when we were first doing our estimates, we had assumed that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Only property.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Owners in the city would be allowed. But with the change to the cap.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That number then did increase.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But we did not change the budget estimate with the registration being $250. The total revenue budgeted for FY 20 was $200,000.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Million, 200,000 and registration fees and 800 and top of which the total is split 5050 with the city. So that would be a 100,000. No, the 800 was the number of stars generating the 200,000 and.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Believe that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So far this year, 1.6 million has come in for FY 20.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So that would be the 800,000. That would be the 800 split into the two different funds. So 800 and general fund, 800 in SAP. So that's the numbers off the top of our head will reconfirm that when this comes back.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so, Miss Pearce, are you okay that we're going to move forward the way we are now? And would you be open to the process coming back September 1st so we could still record that 200,000 of revenue before year end on the registrations?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think that there's. There's a couple of things that maybe need clarifying. One is that we're only talking about a two month period in between when hosted would be on board and the conversation would come back around on hosting.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's a two month period. It's not a long period. The second piece is that these projections and these numbers staff is giving you are based in an economic time. When our hotels were at 80% capacity, nearly 78% capacity when the economy was strong.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We have a stay at home order right now. So it doesn't matter what number we say right now. These are still not deemed to be operating nonessential businesses right now. So what I'm asking for is for us to consider the economic time that we're in right now and and be able to have that conversation in six months'",
        "'speaker_4': '. So I don't think that the calculations are as big as it would be if we would have made this decision in a non-covid time, which I think is why Councilmember Price and I are. You are here. And I think we we need to just move the motion as it is.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I've tried to be really thoughtful about the entire process and all SDR, so I'd like us to move forward with the motion as it is, as supported by Councilmember Price and and hear what my other colleagues have to say right now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Mango. Anything else?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, yeah, I'd like to finish my sentence. I'm not asking for the delay. I recognize 60 days doesn't seem like a lot, but it's a difference of ending a fiscal year upside down or right side up. And I know 200,000, $250,000 doesn't seem like a lot, but $250,000 is two or three or four plumbers.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so I recognize that this is a time and again, this is I'm not talking about the million dollars that 800,000 times plus $800,000. Those are both also a big risk of loss. But again, registration fees are a person paying a fee, even though there are no reservations.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so my ask is only not to approve the unhosted today, but just that the Unhosted presentation come back September one. A couple of things. At least you'll still be on the council if it goes into November, you won't.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I thought you'd want to still be a part of this discussion. The presentation could be September 1st. Still, a decision doesn't necessarily need to be made that day. And again, it still could be two months later. I was just asking for the presentation to come back sooner because so many things are changing so rapidly.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I appreciate that. I don't think that the presentation coming back that soon will give us a full understanding of what's happened to the tourism industry or be able to provide us with the data that that I've requested in my motion.'",

And thank you to all the council members who have brought this item to where it is today, especially council members Pierce and Price.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you very much. I think it's very important that we realize that there's going to be a lot of cuts that are being done and that in the next six months, maybe another, a lot of people will be using these short term rentals, the unhosted ones, because we are all you know, we all have to be very'",
        "'speaker_2': 'careful of traveling right now our, you know, just for safety reasons. So I just wanted to say support this item as is. And thank you very much for bringing it forward.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you. Councilwoman de Haas, Councilwoman Press.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sorry. I do have one quick question, and that is I just was looking at the audience right now, and I cannot believe that I missed this. But in regards to the area that where we talked about the opt out.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So on page 11. 5.77.080 since we're going to be adding some different language for the 180 days and since this is going to come back for a first reading anyway, I wanted to have some language in there that made it a little bit clearer of the fact that you need the majority of the property owners for the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'petition to prevail. And also, we had talked on January 21st about the fact that I wanted to make sure that those who were circulating the petitions were property owners, because one of the concerns that I have is we don't want people paying folks that don't have a vested interest in that neighborhood to be circulating petitions.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So that was something that was that that was very clearly an intent of mine. So I'm wondering if Councilmember Pearce, if you're okay with them clarifying that intent, which was the intent from January 21st under somewhere under section 5.77.080 and making it clear how many votes are needed to prevail on this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilman Price, I'm sorry to interrupt you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I'm on.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Section B of that section, page 12, line three. It talks about the petition must include the signatures, printed names and addresses of a majority of the property owners of residential real property. Does that address your concern?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. Okay. So that's good. I see that that wording there now. Thank you. But what about the prohibition against signature gatherers?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'What? Anyway.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Because this.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'An impact on the redistricting process in some form.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Or fashion. And so I just want to share a few highlights about.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Changes and also acknowledge that the schedule changes would have to be changed, would have to be approved by Congress in order for them to be effective. So the as you can see on the screen.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The census response.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Deadline, according to the new schedule, would be extended from July.'",
        "'speaker_5': '31st to October 31st.'",
        "'speaker_3': '2020, about about four months. And this would shift the apportioned the time frame that the apportionment counts are due to the president from two I'm sorry, to April 30th, 2021, instead of December 2020. As a result, the states would receive redistricting counts four months later than expected on July 31st, 2021, instead of April 1st, 2021, like we'",
        "'speaker_3': 'originally anticipated. So also, I want to point out that, you know, according to the city charter, the new maps must be approved by the commission at least six months before the next election in order for them to apply to that election cycle.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So if the proposed modification to the census schedule is approved by Congress, which is very likely, and the 2022 primary election date of March eight is not extended, then the Commission would likely have less than a month to finalize the new maps.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If they are to apply in the 2022 election cycle, it would be practically impossible for the Commission to complete the work of redrawing the maps in that timeframe.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'However, I want to point out.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That right now there is a bill under consideration in the state legislature, SB 1970 that proposes to move the primary election date in 2022 from March to June of 2022. And if that were to occur, the Commission would have sufficient time to complete the redistricting process.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'However, the the the the planning time frame would be about one month less than we originally planned for. So it could have some impact on the number of meetings that we originally planned to do. But overall, the Commission if the primary changes from March to June of 2022, the Commission would have sufficient time to complete the redistricting'",
        "'speaker_3': 'process as proposed. So with that said, I think we'll just close out and J.T. will highlight.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Some next steps in the process. Thank you. Thanks, Kevin. The next steps following the close of the application period on June 30th began with the initial review of the application to determine which applicants are eligible. After the initial review, the Ethics Commission will then create a sample of 20 to 30 applicants from the pool of eligible candidates'",
        "'speaker_5': ', including at least two from each current council district. Once the sample is established by the Ethics Commission, the chair will then randomly select the first nine commissioners, one from each current council district. Those first nine redistricting commissioners will then select the remaining four members and two alternates for the remaining candidates in the sample.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Once the Commission is fully established, training means will begin in December 2020 and the redistricting process will commence following the release of the census tract data according to the possible timelines Kevin mentioned. Thank you. And we are available to answer any questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Great presentation. So appreciate all of that. Let me I do have a motion to receive and file the some of your ringa in a second by Councilmember Austin. Let me turn to customary ringer first.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Barry. And it's a great presentation, but I see that the districts one, seven and nine have more work to do to get a more representative pool from the API Hispanic and African-American communities. The Asian, of course, one of the things that were questions that got asked during the presentation obviously was was the timing of the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'whole thing. And 2022 is a non presidential election year. So I'm hoping that the Legislature will proceed to move the election from March to June. If I recall correctly, that was already in in place, if I recall correctly, in terms of the legislature having presidential elections take place in March, in the presidential elections taking place in July'",
        "'speaker_3': '. That is that correct? Or am I imagining things?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So, Councilmember Your Honor, this is City Clerk Ponytail Garza. To my knowledge, that is not in place yet. Again, there is a SB 970 is addressing that, but nothing is set to change the election date in 2022. From March to June.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. I guess I was just ahead of myself. Then I'll be hoping they would do something like that. The numbers look good. Again, we need to increase in those underrepresented communities, including the. The. Gay community as well. So other than that, good presentation work.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good work. And let's keep it keep it going. Thank you. And then make the motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think you are happy to support this and happy to hear the report from staff. I just want to commend the city clerk's office for the outreach effort. It. I think it's reasonable to think that people may not be paying attention to redistricting as much as they probably would be under normal circumstances.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so I would just. They continue the efforts. I've seen the advertisements and I think they've been very creative on social media and everywhere you look. And so hopefully we get a good candidate pool. I'm I'm encouraged by the numbers that I see so far.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Obviously, I think we do need work to do. And I think council offices can can help with that. I know myself we have committed to getting that information out in our now daily newsletter constituents. And I'm very, very important to participate in this process.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And let's just go back to the vision behind why we have a redistricting commission. It is to engage residents. It is to empower residents, and it's to take the politics out of redistricting. City council lives in our city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There's a great opportunity in front of our. And this is a great exercise. I hope that we get good residents to step forward and so happy to support this and I'm glad to hear the report. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilman's in Dallas.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mayor, and thank you very much, staff, again for this awesome report. I'm really looking forward to this process. One of the things that I saw that was not in the report was people with disabilities. I think that that's a very important voice to have in this process.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I really encourage that. You please look at applicants who do have physical limitations and that could provide a unique perspective to this process. So please keep that in mind as you go forward. And also, I'm more than happy to help out with more people from from my district as well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So thank you again.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilmember Richard.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I think I think those are sentiments, my colleagues. I think they'll be I think the representation probably would have been more robust if if we were in the middle of this pandemic. So we have to double back.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think there were a couple of missed opportunities with some of the of COVID 19 and the black community, Latino community, AAPI communities to touch on some of these topics, to make sure that folks do know that, you know, this process is going.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, I'm also reminded of we had the census presentation a couple of weeks ago and we saw the same areas of town. We're underrepresented in the census as well. So I love this. I think this is a wake up call that we need to double back with our communities, both on census and on this redistricting commission'",
        "'speaker_3': 'staff. I would say if there are other things that just have slipped through the cracks during this moment, we need to flag them so the council officers can do what we need to do to help get the word out.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So please send me whatever information that you have. I'm going to work, you know, work together and get the information out as best as we can. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Think you got somebody ringer to you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah, well, I think they left out was precisely the point that Katherine Richardson just mentioned right now. And that's the sense is itself that we really do need also to redouble our efforts in getting people to fill out to complete the census forms.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The latest report I saw that we were around 64, 65% complete. Some areas in my district are very low in terms and returning their their sense of data. And I'm sure other districts had the same issue. So we need to also ensure that we get get get out there and tell people to fill out their census forms'",
        "'speaker_3': '. So that's going to make a big difference for us. As we know, we missed out an opportunity to get some federal funding because we were just short of the 500,000 population threshold. And the census makes it that much more important for us to make sure that we get as full, accountably, complete count as we can.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So let's let's also redouble our efforts in getting people to complete census forms. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And next up is Councilwoman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mayor. I just wanted to appreciate Mr. Jackson. I know that I've taken an interest in the census and the redistricting thing, and I appreciate that he's made the calls and we've been able to meet on their budget and their process.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I've even had the great pleasure of attending a meeting. And so I thank them for what they're doing, and I'll continue to stay tuned into this process. It is the real backbone of our democracy that we have fair districts.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So thank you to all who have volunteered.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Please tell a friend.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And Councilman Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah. I support all the comments, appreciate staff's presentation. I know a lot of district residents that enjoy watching or listening, and so I really want to encourage the district. I think we're behind the rest of the city in our census numbers.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so definitely want to remind everybody that we need to make sure that we we complete that. So thank you, guys.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'the end of this vote, that we have not only support for our tenants, but support for property owners. And so before I make my motion, I do have a couple of questions for our economic development team. I think that John is still on the on the line.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And my question for for John from economic development, before I get into my motion is, can you share with us some of the programs that you are currently advocating for and some of the ideas that you have around support for property owners?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'As we know that if a tenant's not paying rent, that's impacting that property owner. But we as a city only can can do so much to support them. So stop. That's a question for you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes. Good evening. Mayor and city council members, thanks so much. Yes. So so in economic development, we always look at tenants, landlords and lenders, everybody who's involved with providing shelter, space, etc., because everybody seems to have both an asset and a liability that's in play.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so when we think about tenant protections, we also think about the landlords who may also have a mortgage or they may have a construction loan, or they may have some sort of other liability that they have to also care for, and that also affects their their lenders.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we have been looking at the economic development department at both how what programs are available for for tenants in terms of of rent support relief. Obviously, we're working with our partners and development services on potential HUD funding that will help with rent relief and in protecting tenants so that they can pay rent.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There are some programs at the county level as well. Funding that's coming down from the federal and state government. And then, of course, through our Workforce Development Agency, we provide a portion of rent relief through some of the Employment Development Department benefits when it comes to the landlords and the lenders.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There actually are a number of programs that came with the Federal Cares Act and they have to do with everything from tax abatement, new programs that help to relieve caps on the the tax benefits that a landlord might have with regard to operating losses that they can carry forward and get credit for in those those programs.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There's about six that we're looking at specifically because some of them are a bit complicated. They're buried in the CARES Act and we want to bring them out and surface them for for both landlords and lenders so that they're aware of of what's available to them, even if it is something that comes as a benefit at the'",
        "'speaker_6': 'end of the year or as part of their tax filing. But the other thing that we're also looking at, which has been a little bit more difficult, of course, is loan programs that might also be available to property owners in the city of Long Beach, believe it or not.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We have thousands of business licenses that are for people, business owners who are in real estate. So they either own maybe a residential building could be anything from one unit to dozens of units or in commercial real estate, it could be a very small or very large building.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So they have to have business licenses. And we've been working with our partners at the federal government to try and find ways that we might be able to adjust those programs and make those loan programs also available to property based business owners.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So there's a little bit of a range there, and it covers everything from loans to tax credits and possibly even some legislative changes. So I'll stop right there and I'll stick around for questions.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, John. Okay. So I. I want to go ahead and I appreciate that. I'm going to go ahead and make my motion so that the floor can discuss it. So I move as follows. To extend the current eviction moratorium and rent deferment period for 90 days to August 31st, 2020.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Extend the current deferral rent repayment program to August 31st, but also include benchmarks that require tenants that encourage tenants to pay at least 30% deferred rent by February 28, which is six months after the beginning of the repayment period, and at least 60% deferment by May 31st, which is nine months after the deferment period.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This language needs to be included in the preamble and not in the ordinance. The third is direct the city manager working with the city prosecutor and the city attorney as necessary to bring back a report in in June on the anti tenant harassment best practices in other California jurisdictions.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I want to be clear, this is different than what's been agenda and really trying to get us to a good spot sooner rather than later and saving us a long night with this. So number four is to exclude the following commercial tenants from the extension of the current eviction moratorium ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Multinational companies. Publicly traded companies. Companies with 500 or more employees are definitely open to exploring if that's the right number.

As as Councilmember Pearce said, this is very delicate. It is a time right now that we are experiencing that we haven't experienced before.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And as we want to find relief for our tenants that are being left without jobs and without an income coming in due to either of directly related to COVID 19 or indirectly related, we also find ourselves struggling because we also need to help out our property owners who are renting renting this out.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I think that the motion has been very, very thought out. Thank you for working with staff on this. Thank you for everybody coming together and trying to really put something forward that will that will help our city move forward.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And one of the things that I wanted to comment on is we really want to make sure that everyone knows that this is not we're not supporting a rent free couple of months. You know, this is to evaluate the the condition that we are in right now and to postpone the payment.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I want to make it very clear that this is not a rent free ordinance or motion, but rather is something to bring a little relief to those tenants who find themselves without jobs. One of the things that I would recommend also, and I don't know if we have to add it in as of friendly or something'",
        "'speaker_2': 'like that, or if it it just comes down to the individual property owners. But I would like to see something that kind of guarantees that the rent will be paid to those property owners, whether it's in the form of a contract with your landlord or something, just to give you know, just to give the the property owners'",
        "'speaker_2': 'also a. Some kind of peace that they will be receiving the rent from their tenants. I think the that here this motion is for all of us to work together moving forward and I'd love to hear with all my other colleagues have to say on this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Council woman Price.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Well, that I have for Councilwoman Pierce. Councilman Pierce.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Price here. You sound very far away.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Oh, okay. I'm right here. Is that better? Hello. Yes. Okay. Councilmember Pearce, I wanted to just clarify the. Partial payment provisions that you laid out. Can you repeat those for me again? Because I think I missed it. And also, you want those in the whereas clause, not in the ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes. I'd like them in the warehouse clause, not in the ordinance, due to the fact that we I worry that if a tenant is paying full rent and we say that they need to have something paid by a certain amount of the repayment.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That they might be able to be evicted if they like. If their rent's $2,000 a month and they're supposed to pay 20 to a month in their repayment period and they only pay 2000. I want to make sure that they're protected legally.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that was one of the concerns that that Rich and our city attorney's office had brought up and said that if we put it in the preamble, that it helps as guidance. So I think I'll reread it for you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think that would be a great hope to be able to say if we put this in the preamble and then say, you know, that if these if these measures are not met, that then the tenant and the landlord need to negotiate a repayment plan outside of these standards.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There's an agreement there, and I know that we've talked about that the last time this item came up. So now that we've had some time to kind of sit with it, so I'll reread it. Extend the current deferment payment period until August 31st, but also include benchmarks that require a tenant to pay 30% of deferment.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Six months after the beginning of the repayment period and 60% nine months after the beginning of the repayment period.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. All right. So let me go through the ones that I think might be relatively non-controversial. And then and then I'll I'll share with you my thoughts on the partial payment and see if we can have them accepted as friendlies.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If not, then I will probably make a substitute. But let me just start with the things that I think are kind of non-controversial. Well, first, let me just start by saying that I think. As a matter of fact, objectively.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Everybody. Everybody. Has been impacted by COVID. And from a financial standpoint, I would say that most everybody in our city has felt the impacts financially. Regardless of the category that we put them in. I believe that COVID has impacted everybody.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So when we're looking at helping, you know. What? Like you said, Councilwoman Pierce. Governing for those most vulnerable. Well, in this situation, it's a really unusual situation because the category of folks we generally refer to as most vulnerable, that category has really expanded a great deal.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I will I'll share with you and I know I've shared this with my council colleagues that my husband and I, our first time small business owners, it was a dream of my husband's. We both work full time jobs, still day jobs.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But he always wanted to own his own business. So we took a whole bunch of savings that we saved over a number of years, and we invested in a small business. We were not even at a point where we were breaking even when COVID happened.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so while we are grateful for the deferment programs that are available. We also realized that that back rent is going to have to be due at some point. And for us, that's in the 15 to $20000 range, depending on how long the closures last.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But at this rate, we're already above 10,000. We have no idea how we're going to be able to make such a huge balloon payment. And I'm sharing with this this with you personally, because you can't get a small business loan in today's day and age without attaching some personal assurances to it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so it's not as though we can just not pay rent and walk away and not have our our own mortgage and our own income. Personal affected. And I share that with you only because I believe that the most vulnerable community today in terms of the definition, has really expanded.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so when we when we help one group, we really have to think about how that impacts another group and how that impacts their ability to pay their bills because everyone's ability to pay their bills has been impacted.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So a couple of things that that I want to include or ask you if you'll accept a friend. Leon is. Well, first of all, in regards to some of the exemptions for commercial property tenants, I would also like to exempt that when it's in the Tidelands area.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Because I think the Tidelands Fund is an enterprise fund that's very different than any other fund that we have in the city because we have a fiduciary duty to the state regarding how we spend that money and and really having a direct oversight into the programs.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I would ask that tidelands tenants be included in the exemptions, but I would ask that the city manager and his team be involved in negotiating mitigation or deferment. Contracts or agreements with the tenants on a case by case basis so that they could limit the scope of the application.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We want to make sure that businesses or operations that were already suffering prior to COVID are not taking advantage of COVID related mitigation efforts in order to gain further benefits or further deferment. We want to make sure that the COVID related legislation in terms of deferment, is related to a specific time period and that it's not broader'",
        "'speaker_2': 'than it needs to be for the Tidelands area, specifically because we have a fiduciary duty to the state. So is that a friendly that you would accept?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It is a friendly that I would accept. And I just want to clarify, too, that a few weeks ago we also gave counsel and we gave city manager direction to negotiate with each lessee that the city had overall.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we also have that in place. But yes, I accept that. Friendly.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay, great. The other thing I want to do, and this goes back to the concept of like, look, I think my husband and I would be definitely considered part of the vulnerable community that you've outlined. But I think because because we are tenants.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And by the way, I also want the record to reflect that before voting on any business related legislation through the city of Long Beach, I sought and received an opinion regarding my ability to vote on any business legislation in the city of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I renewed that FEC opinion just a few weeks ago, and it was determined from a legal standpoint that I fall under the public generally exception, since any legislation that we would be involved in would benefit a large number of businesses and not mine specifically.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I just wanted to put that out there for the record. But anyway, going back to that, I realize that when we have tenant protections and tenant relief that we put into place, it impacts property owners. And so one of the things I'd like to do is to ask our economic development team, and I'm offering this as'",
        "'speaker_2': 'a as a friendly to create a to evaluate creating a revolving loan fund for property owners who may have been impacted by COVID so that we can offer them funds through a loan through the city of Long Beach in order to help them with some of their payments.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I want to make sure that that's okay with you as an amendment.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Absolutely. It's actually something that I forgot to mention earlier says perfect.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. I also want to ask staff as a friendly amendment to come back to council by the June 2nd meeting with a report on what options are both for foreclosure relief for homeowners. Housing providers and property owners. Is that something you're willing to accept?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It is something I'm willing to accept. And if I might counter, I think on top of having the staff bring back a report, it might be also helpful to direct the legislative committee to advocate for policies that would extend any forbearance past the 60 days, whether it's for property loans or construction loans, but to really make sure'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that we in the city are using our resources to to advocate on behalf of them as well. So I'm open to that. And I think that we can go one step further and having our legislative team work on it as well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Well, that takes me to my next one. And that would be a report from city staff on the status of SB 939, which helps businesses renegotiate leases due to COVID impacts. Reevaluate AB 828, which prohibits foreclosures and AB 2501, which creates long term forbearance and prohibits foreclosures and auto repossessions.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I'm hoping that you will accept the amendment that staff report back on June 2nd on these three legislative initiatives so that our state legislative committee can take those up once they've received some initial information about these bills.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think those are great additions. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And this is Tom. I just want to point out, we're going to have to put those on supplemental, because we would have to have the reports done in two days to get them up. And we will do our best to, you know, bring what we can within the week.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that would be fine with me, Tom, since they're really report items, they're not voting items and they're not ones that we're going to need to do extensive outreach on before taking legislative action at this juncture. So that would that would be fine with me.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The first the final it's not the final amendment, but the final amendment in this category is I'd like staff to report back to council on June 2nd on any property tax relief measures that are being considered or have been voted upon in regards to deferment of property taxes by the County Board of Supervisors.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Just an update. Did I lose you?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Pearce, did you hear that?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I support that. Yes, absolutely.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. All right. So thank you for that. In regards to so now these are these are the ones that we might not have a meeting of the minds on, although I hope we do. In regards to the extension, I'm I'm agreeable to the extension.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'However, we are starting to see more and more businesses open back up, which means more and more people are getting. Jobs back, hopefully. And so rather than extending this until August, I would propose that we follow the county's model and extended until June and then June 30th, and then have a report back every 30 days following June'",
        "'speaker_2': '30th, so that we as a council can make a determination as to whether we want to continue the rental eviction moratorium.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Um, so I appreciate the the gesture, I would say. Let's talk a minute. Just about the 30 day versus the 90 day. I understand that the county has done 30 days, and that was for areas that did not currently have a moratorium in place and for unincorporated areas.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The city of L.A. has 90 days after the state of emergency is lifted. I do agree that there are some businesses that are reopening. But we what I've experienced in my district and I have three retail shops on Fore Street alone who have had landlords tell them, you're allowed to do curbside pickup now, so you need to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'pay your full rent next month. This is something that is very challenging for them because curbside pickup for a clothing store is not something that is necessarily bringing back business. Right. People like to come in and try on clothes, etc..'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think that it. That it would be so much more beneficial if we did 90 days. So that and with the change that we can come back in 30 like if we did 90 days and we said every 30 days before that 90 days, we had a brief report from staff on it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'd be open to that. But I I'm trying to create stability for tenants and for landlords so that every month we're not re opening it up for a vote again. So maybe let's let's hear from I, I know that there's always a risk of a substitute substitute, but I really would like to just hear from the council'",
        "'speaker_4': 'colleagues. And if you need to make a substitute, then you could do that. But 90 days is a hard part for us because we've already changed it back from the original 120 that we were going to put on the on the motion.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. And then the the other. So I'm I'm taking that as a no at this point.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'At this point. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right. So what about 60 days?'",
        "'speaker_4': '60 days is definitely better than 30.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Is that still a no?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I would very much like to hear from. You know, let's. If we did 60 days and then at 60 days, we that staff brought it back for us to evaluate at that time what we wanted to do. But the idea of a solid jeopardizing it, like one of us having to agenda is it every time that the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'time limit comes up, I think puts a lot of political pressure on everybody and really is exhausting versus having staff bring forward and saying here's the state of the of the COVID situation. Now Council, you can vote to extend it or not extend it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So. Right, Captain? Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah. Bring it back on the road. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Staff brought it back two weeks before the 60 day, and then we could have a vote at that time on what we needed to do. I would support that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. And then the the final one that I want to add on here and I need to pull it up because I wrote it out on a piece of paper this morning. And and it's it's for the partial payment.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'll just tell you right now, I'm going to be a no unless we can include partial payment as part of the 12 month extension. So we're not going to extend.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That was part of my motion. Councilmember Price, that you asked me to repeat.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I think you wanted it in the whereas, not in the ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes. And if we if we could maybe turn to the city attorney and ask him for some clarification on on why that is. That'd be helpful.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sure. I always love hearing from a Chinese.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If we can hear from Rich Anthony, who has helped us on this, that would be helpful. Tom, do you know if Rich's. I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm here. Sorry. This is rich. Um, I had to do this da thing. It took me a while. I apologize. That's okay. Okay. So I take the request by you, Councilmember Pierce, to put the benchmarks, as I call them, or the partial payments in the preamble to mean it is something we're encouraging people to do, but it'",
        "'speaker_3': 'is not required. You just want to go on record as you think that would be a good idea. But it's not required and it's it's not enforceable more or less. And I think Councilmember Price is saying is that she would like it to be.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I have I have no opinion on whether it ought to be enforceable or just a soft encouragement. That's up to you all to hash out.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So my my question for you, which was based on our conversation when we were putting this together, was if we put it into the ordinance. What could happen if, say, a tenant does not pay that 30% by the six month period?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Would they be at risk of eviction or at risk of additional harassment?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Oh, they'd be at risk of of eviction. I don't know that they would have already been harassed and been at risk of additional announcement. I mean, know, if it's a requirement, if it's a benchmark requirement, then yes, if they fail to make that payment, they would immediately be at risk of eviction.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that and that councilmember price is the part that is difficult for me because I know that, you know, as a tenant and I think we talked about this last time, everybody wants to try to pay as much as they can so that they don't end up being evicted and that they're not taking advantage of the system'",
        "'speaker_4': '. So trying to strike that balance in between supporting landlords, getting what's what's due to them, but also not putting somebody at risk of saying that if you don't make that payment by that first time, then maybe they have, you know, a tax check that's coming in or, you know, as somebody that lives on very low income, it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'might be that they can make a bigger payment down the road. Something happens. And so I would hate to put them in a situation where they they might be able to make the nine month, but they couldn't make the six month.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And therefore, now they're evicted because of something that wasn't necessarily their fault. And so. That's right. That's why it's it's tricky.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Right. And I get that. I think I think it just might be and I may be right. I may be wrong. I don't know. But it just may be that philosophically we may not agree on whether we want this to be a soft encouragement or part of the ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So with that, I'm going to make a substitute. My substitute is going to be that that there will be a repayment period that will be extended from six months to 12 months, but that the repayment schedule will look as follows 10% owed at the first quarter.'",
        "'speaker_2': '25% owed at the second quarter. 30% owed at the third quarter and 35% owed at the fourth quarter. And that allows for an easy ramp up in the event that a tenant is not able to make these partial payments.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That tenant upon providing proof. And documentation of their inability to pay. She'll request relief from the payment plan. And will not have to pay those partial payments upon submission of proof or documentation. So that's the first part of the substitute.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The second part of the substitute will be that the. Moratorium on rental evictions will be extended until June 30th, with staff to bring the item back three days following June 30th for the. Oh. I'll wait. Whether it will be, I'm sorry, on June 30th.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'On June 30th, the Council will receive an item at the at its the meeting closest in time to June 30th to evaluate whether it shall extend the moratorium and not 30 days into the month of July and every 30 days from that point on, the Council can reevaluate.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In my substitute, the Tidelands Fund exemption that we discussed, the revolving loan fund that we asked city staff to look into for property owners and housing providers. The foreclosure resolution, foreclosure relief options that we asked for staff to report back on the legislative actions that are pending in the state.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Foreclosure relief.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The property tax proposal is being evaluated by the L.A. County Board of Supervisors. And I do not want. This anti-harassment clause that's in here or this I realize that was no longer part of the. But I do I'm not putting any sort of report back on that because I believe it's fraught with all sorts of legal landmines'",
        "'speaker_2': '. So with that, that's my substitute.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Substitute. Is there a second on that? Is there a second on that?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Supermodel second.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. Next up is Councilwoman Mongo. I'm sorry. Oh, yeah. Councilman Mongo. That's correct. Councilman.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes. Thank you, Mayor. I have a couple of additional questions. Thank you for the questions that have been brought forward so far. I see that there are some instances that have been brought to my attention where landlords out of a.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Significant amount of caution when taking on tenants requested in the commercial world, proof of six months of reserves before providing a lease to imports. And that there are. Tenants who are choosing even though they have the reserves not to pay.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I don't know what the solution might be, but I would be interested in knowing a little bit more about. Councilman Price, in your preamble, is there still a significant encouragement for those that can't afford to pay to pay fully because there are ripple effects to some of these non payments that are detrimental, especially in our commercial'",
        "'speaker_4': 'markets where they're not backed up by loans from Bank of America or Wells Fargo or any of the commercial organizations who are offering some of this relief.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. I'm personally very familiar with that that predicament for commercial tenants. Yes. I think if if you can. I would like that to be included in the preamble, in the whereas clauses that those who can pay should be encouraged to pay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The other benefit of that as these balloon payments are impossible, impossible for commercial tenants and residential tenants to be able to meet. So encouraging, highly encouraging payment and partial payment, I think should be included.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Also in a particular case or two where I was discussing the return of a particular employee, and she had said that she's in a very tough spot because of childcare issues and other things, but that she was actually more money.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Through current unemployment with the supplemental than she was before. And so. This Mummy friend of mine had mentioned to me, she said, you know, I'm kind of thinking about not paying my rent because I don't have to. But I do have the money.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But what if I need it three months from now or six months from now? So I really do appreciate the. Security that we're giving and giving a specific amount of days. But I would really like to also encourage that if your income has not been impacted, that you're strongly encouraged to pay.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And and even I don't know what to put in there. Maybe that's one place you have some ideas, but. The landlord that they have may not be able to pay their rent. And here is someone who could pay their rent and or they could be paying to a corporation that owns apartments, who then has to lay off'",
        "'speaker_4': 'a bunch of employees because the rents aren't coming in. So I just don't know. How to how to solve for some of these problems that are real, that are causing these rippling effects. And there's so much fear of what tomorrow will be or how long will be closed.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Will we be closed for six months? 12 months? 24 months. People are scared. I've seen holes out there that there are some that support indefinite closures. And so there's this insecurity about payment. What what are your thoughts? Council on Price.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I haven't thought about that. I think those are all very valid points. I'd be open to anything that you want to include in that. I mean, I think it allows us to look at the issue not just in a vacuum, but holistically.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I just haven't given it much thought. So I don't want to throw something out there that I haven't thought about.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay with that? I would like to. Substitute. And I would like to add. Well.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We've lost councilmember mongo.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'By for rent deferment months and then as.'",
        "'speaker_0': '1/2 we're.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Supposed to those. Can you still hear me? I'm looking to find some way where those who have six months of reserves can be exempted from the clause so that. The landlords can help those who most need it. And those who have not received a reduction in income or a change in situation could be I need some help'",
        "'speaker_4': 'from the city attorney on this, but what I want is if there is a landlord that has three tenants and all three choose not to pay, then the two who are most in need could potentially lose their homes too, because the landlord could lose the property and there could have been a partial payment.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I'm looking for some options to help us really drill this down to those who need the help.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This is rich. You mentioned two different things and the first of which was a tenant taking advantage or availing themselves protections here under. That we're not covered impacted. That's not going to happen because the original ordinance that were that were amended now requires proof of adverse COVID impacts.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Now, I think there's the section or I should say the example you give. That perhaps is an issue and I'm thinking about how to deal with it is the tenant that has been adversely impacted by the commercial business that's been adversely impacted as a result of COVID.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But does have several months worth of reserve. You know, whether it's six or more. They have a lot of money in the bank with which they can pay rent.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And these are big corporations taking advantage of some of our landlords.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. But the motion as that's on the floor now is that companies with 500 or more employees would be exempt. I mean, maybe it's going to be difficult to get into the specifics of exempting somebody who has six months of reserves.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I don't exactly know reserves of what. How do you determine what six months of reserve are? Perhaps a simpler way of addressing large companies, taking advantage of protections that they don't really need to be taking advantage of because they have money is by reducing the maximum amount of employees, or I should say the minimum amount of employees'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that you need to have. I'm sorry. The maximum number of employees that you need to have to qualify. And maybe if you bring the 500 down, that was in the original motion and is in the substitute motion currently on the floor.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I guess you made a sub sub. Is that right, Councilwoman Mongo? You broke it and you were doing that?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes. I'm trying to form my son sub.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Right. So maybe rather than dealing with six months worth of reserves, you suggest a change to the 500 or more employees and make it something lower, perhaps a lot lower.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, I guess the 500 employees kind of fared on the protections that are already provided by another act. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I don't know. I think so. Councilmember Pearce may be able to speak to that. I think it came from the L.A. ordinance. I don't know why L.A. adopted it that way.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So here's my subsub. Subsub is Councilman Price's motion with some additional warehouses related to. Those who have the ability to pay because their income. Or reserves. I'm going to try to put it in the warehouses so it's not as.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Impactful, but still impactful. And that those companies I have specific companies in my district who outlaid a ton of cash for Douglas Park and all these others and elsewhere.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If you can't make the motion.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we could follow it. I appreciate it because the whereas is the the substitute.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Motion with added recitals will.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Not qualify as a substitute. Substitute motion. There's no there's no significant difference. You're just adding additional whereas is which are recitals and unenforceable. So you have to make it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I have a change in the payment schedule as well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I haven't heard it. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. So the warehouses where as a a tenant is able to pay shall and these are on the commercial tenants. I'm going to focus on the commercial tenants. I think the residential tenants are are less they're few and far between and not probably worth attacking at this time.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Remember, if you could make the motion and not explain it, I got to follow your motion.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'First and then you can just.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Sorry. Thank you. And then for the schedule of payments, I would like to revise the payment schedule to be. 10%. At. 10% every 60 days. So it would go ten, 20, 30, 40, 50. If that makes sense of the total amount.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. So let's see. Ten two months in 20. After four months, they have to pay 20%. After six months, 30. After eight months, 40. After ten months into the rent repayment period, they have to be at least 50.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then in the final two months, they can pay the remaining 50%. Am I following you right?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The previous one was ten 2530. I was trying to go. I was hoping that at the end of year they would have paid in full. And it sounds like a 50% balloon payment at the end would be detrimental.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So let's do. Two months, 10%. Four months. 25%. Six months. 50%. Nine months, 75%, with 100% at the 12 month mark. I think that's probably the. Best way to help people stay on track. And then for the clarification on the proof of no income or no subsidy or in the ability to demonstrate.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Their inability to pay on the commercial tenant side. Which should be pretty easy to do if you're not open. But then potentially these corporations would have a difficult time demonstrating their inability to pay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. I think I understand the subsidies. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I want to thank you guys for working through this with me again. I hadn't planned on making a sub sub tonight. I really have listened to a lot of tenants and housing providers and commercial providers, and I have a lot of fears about how much worse this could get if we don't help people work together to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'stay on track. And I hope that this also helps tenants negotiate with their landlords a better solution. I have no further comments.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you, Councilwoman. Let me go to Councilmember Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. So and following the conversation on it, I want to say first that I appreciate the movement for where this conversation began, where it is and where it arrived. Under the main motion, Councilwoman Pierce's motion.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I see that. And I saw the original file. And I thought that, you know, even though it came down from like five, it came down from 94, and the amendment was accepted to go to 60 with Staff Ridge.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think I think that makes sense. I think that's what the council needs. I think that's where the council is. It included repayment guidelines. I know that that wasn't part of the original proposal and there was a lot of flexibility and grace in the way it was presented to have some level of repayment guidelines.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think that made sense and I think that's what the council where the council was, I think it considered I heard how it considered a number of considerations and exemptions on commercial considerations on the way it impacts the airport and the port.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'All of those things are good. I think that it got there. It was all you know, all of these really represent, I think, a collection of the communications we've heard and the discussion we've heard on council, all except for one friendly amendment and for that one friendly amendment to not be accepted and turned into a substitute and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'substitute substitute motion. Is it really this spirit that we should really be a spirit of collaboration, working together and working? And it didn't really align with, I think, the grace that Councilwoman Pearce put forward. And and I think it was at best earlier.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think it just comes down to philosophical differences. And I don't think this is the time to draw lines in the sand or philosophical differences. I think they're very, very close. Like 90 days, we start bringing it back.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Consideration, given the guidelines. I think I think that's where we really are. So I have a question for staff for the city attorney. I don't quite understand what the substitute substitute motion is. Would you mind clarifying what that motion is?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'd be happy to. This is rich again. So the substitute substitute, assuming I mean, I'm not going to read through all of it, I don't think unless you'd like me to. Or do you want me to say how I believe it to be different than the original motion?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'What do you prefer? I think that would be helpful. Yeah, but just the substantive points, because it just seemed like it was I couldn't understand it was freaking out. You know what? It's not meant to be a justifiable comment, but I don't know what it is.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I'd actually like to read through the entirety of any given. I'll read through the entirety of it and Councilmember Mongo can correct me if I'm wrong. Number one is to extend the current eviction moratorium and the rent deferment period for 30 days to June 30th and direct staff to bring it back in sometime in the middle'",
        "'speaker_3': 'of June before it expires. Number two, extend the current deferred rent repayment period. And I'm glad we're doing this. The original motion was August 31st, and I don't think Susie's ever changed that, but it ought to be changed.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think the understanding is that August 31st was key to the August 31st and the first part. So I think the motion should be extend the current deferred rent repayment period to June 30th of 2021. So it's a year and it would also include this wouldn't be in the preamble.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You have a year to repay if you're a tenant, but you do have five, four benchmarks you need to hit. You need to repay 10% of your deferred rent two months into the period. You need to pay 25% of your deferred rent.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Four months in 50%. Six months in 75%. Nine months in. And then the final payment before the year is out. Item number three is out and that has to do with anti tenant harassment and that's no longer a part of this episode.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Number four, there would be six types of commercial tenants excluded from the extension of this moratorium. Multinational companies, number one, publicly traded companies. Number two, companies with 500 or more employees. Number three, all airport tenancies and sub tenancies.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Number for all harbor department tenancies and Tenancies. Number five Entitlements, Trust, Tenancies and Tenancies would be number six. All those would be excluded. And then five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten and 11. So there are six other parts of it that are all direction to city staff to work with tenants on a case by case basis to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'encourage the Board of Harbor Commissioners to do the same with respect to providing their tenants with rent relief, directing staff to bring back evaluations, a revolving loan fund, directing staff to bring back a report on possible foreclosure relief.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Directing staff to bring back property tax relief measures. Directing staff to bring back a report on ASB 939 eight, 28, 28 and 8020 501. And lastly, having the Legislative Committee advocate for increased forbearance at the state level. I believe that is the service that is on the table right now.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well done.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So thank you. So I guess I'll say I think what I'd like to see happen tonight is an extension. I think the 90 days, what we proposed, but the 60 days that was accepted. I think that that's where we should be.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think, you know, the repayment schedules would probably be somewhere in the second six months benchmark starting around the second six months. I agree that it probably should be included and where the preamble is. It might be very challenging to put in inside the trigger a cascade of of evictions and other things.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If we don't do this, don't handle this the right way. So that's why I think we want to be I don't think that's where the substance of the motion is. I think the motion aligns most clearly with that is the motion.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's why I'd like to get through. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is there a second on that? I think on on council. On Mango's motion. Was there a second on that? Is that it?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I will accept that, Mr. Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. Moving on to. Well, 1/2. That was Councilman Richardson. Next up is Vice Mayor Andres.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If you missed. You know, I really appreciate the just. I want to be clear that I support. For a community like mine in a minority linnet households, because at this time we need to be focused on livelihood and that values.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'My sincere worry and focus is that we need to have financial literacy in place so that we are not intentionally creating debt. It is sort of rent. I want as a councilor to continue working with our other branches of government so that we can secure federal dollars and protection from our property owners as well as they, too'",
        "'speaker_3': ', are struggling. We also need to look for a way to assist our undocumented households that have not been able to obtain resources. They should not be an afterthought. I want to be supportive of a policy tonight that is clear.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Came somewhat in alliance with what has come in and other local governments are doing to avoid confusion as to ultimately have a contingency. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor. I have counted Boston.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I thank you and I appreciate the discussion tonight as well. You know, when this. Economic relief policies came before us. First of all, the council jumped at the opportunity, understanding that families were really hurting and people were devastated by not only this health crisis, but with the economic calamity facing our city, our state and federal government.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think, you know, in doing so, we painted a very broad brush. You know, I think there was a lot of assumptions made, and that was several weeks ago. And we still don't have the clarity we really need to make great policy in terms of clairvoyance, in terms of where we are going, what our economy is going'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to look like a month from now, six months from now, 12 months from now. And so we'll do our very best. I think there are some assumptions that, you know, property owners can necessarily absorb the losses, which I think is false in some respects.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I also think there's some assumptions made that all renters are struggling with rent, I guess, is that that's a reach as well. I think. That we as a city council should be encouraging good faith from all parties of property owners as well as campus tenants as well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And frequent and ongoing communications. I think that that's very, very important here. I want to be careful that we don't create policy that is confusing. With this application and interpretation from the public. And I do appreciate that we are trying to massage this to get to a place where people understand payment schedules, which I support, but also'",
        "'speaker_3': 'compromise in terms of what the extension level is. And I think 60 days is a good place on the. I do think that there is some clarity that's needed in this. And so I would like to offer a friendly amendment to the maker of this this motion and the motion on that motion on the floor.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think it's important that we we really try to. Understand who qualifies for this benefit. And, you know, again, in an effort to eliminate confusion, I'd like to inform. For the maker of emotion, consider a friendly that allows language in to say that you know those who who who qualify for public assistance of you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I did have something written down here for public assistance after March 30, 2020, due to COVID 19 economic displacement. I think it's very important that we help those who need the help right now, and we target our efforts to help those instead of, again, bringing in broad brush that confuses everybody.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We love to help those that are in need. Our governor has given a number that he believes that unemployment can can reach 25%. You know, those individuals need to need our help. They need our attention as as public leaders.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so that's it. Now it's never goal. Would you be open to such a friendly amendment?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Councilmember Austin. That was exactly my goal. I am trying. Thank you for putting that in such great words. My big concern is that we are painting a broad brush and I absolutely do want to help those that qualify for public assistance.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No. We're losing you. Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's a yes. You're absolutely.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Right. It does impact so many people. I can't tell you how many lamb or. Sure. Friendly.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Great. Next up is Council for Superman.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. I just wanted to get some more clarification also. But first, I wanted to commend Vice Mayor Andrews. He was the first one to mention the concept of financial literacy. And I think that's so important moving forward that we have some type of educational process here to explain how important credit ratings are and whatnot.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And and just the pitfalls of not making these payments and just some type of education piece would be great. So thanks to Vice Mayor Andrews for bringing that up. The clarification I was asking for this goes back to the substitute motion.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Councilmember Price. Stated that there had to be some proof shown from tenant to landlord. And this question, I guess is for Rich Anthony. Does that go back to reflect what's in the original ordinance. Um, by, I think it was you had mentioned state guidelines or does that all make sense to for what part in the substitute motion'",
        "'speaker_3': 'was. It does. It's a good question. Council Member Supernova. But I think so. In the original ordinance, we say that in order to qualify, a tenant has to provide reasonable documentation, I think, or reasonable evidence of COVID related adverse impact.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The way that I interpret the substitute substitute motion on the floor is that is a little different in its in its. It doesn't need to read the same as the overall qualification language in the original ordinance. This language regarding providing proof of an inability to pay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is applicable only to the inability to make those benchmark payments during the 12 month repayment period. And it's a bit of a higher bar. They have to provide proof of an inability to pay. That's the way that I heard it, and that's the way I intend to write it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay, so that answered my question. I just feel that language has to be pretty tight so we avoid confusion. Moving forward. And that's all I have. With that, I can support this subset.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Next up is Councilman Price.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Just wanted to clarify that this sub sub includes all of the same provisions that Councilwoman Pearce included in her original motion regarding the title and I'm sorry, the harbor department and airport exemptions with the requirement that city staff work with those individual tenants on a case by case basis to determine rental deferment or mitigation efforts in light'",
        "'speaker_2': 'of COVID. Does that include that council member Mango?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Absolutely. There are lots of grants at the airport that require it. So. Yes, thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Also just want to highlight this about the partial payments we want I want that in there because I know there are council members, probably all of us who really don't want to be putting anyone in a situation where if they're not getting any income and they're not getting any rental assistance, they're still being forced to make'",
        "'speaker_2': 'a partial payment. I think for those situations, if they can provide the proof and I appreciate Councilman Austin clarifying that that's a different situation, I believe that even most landlords would understand and appreciate and have compassion in that kind of situation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I just wanted to clarify the intent for that is if people just really aren't making any income and they don't qualify for a subsidy, they cannot make that partial payment, then that would be a situation that would require proof.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Absent that, it would not require proof. And and I'm totally happy with the 60 days. I think that makes sense. So. Thank you, everyone.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. We're going to go ahead and take the subset vote roll call, please.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'District one.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Mr. Mayor. Mr. Mayor. This is rich. I'm sorry I lost the train. Win, win. Stacey and Al were speaking. Was there a friendly maid that was accepted?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There was.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I don't have that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Let me just briefly, Councilman Mangum.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Was proof of subsidy.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hmm.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'From March in.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Proof of subsidy. I don't need.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Proof. Payment assistance.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No, no, no. It's proof that they don't qualify for subsidy, which would justify them not making the payment.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'My intent was proof of qualified public assistance. So. The point being is that if somebody has been impacted negatively by COVID 19, their job has been they've been displaced, laid off over the hours. They qualify for unemployment, qualify for other public assistance.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That should be proof enough to. Landlord. Property owner that they cannot make for rent. Right. They're not making up the fact that they are unemployed because they actually have an unemployment check or have they qualified for unemployment benefits.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Right. So. So this is rich again. I get it. What I was just discussing with council member Supernormal. We want to be able to say you're talking only about the benchmark payments. Is that right, Councilmember Austin? No, not the benchmark mark payments I'm talking about.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Again, I was talking about us kind of clarifying who we're trying to help. Right. In this policy, we're trying to help those who've been devastated, who've been hit hard by the pandemic and the economic crisis. Those are caught up in the workforce that is declining as a result of this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The economic impacts that and those individuals can can show that, hey, yes, I have applied for it. I've been qualify for unemployment benefits or even if they can even show me a layoff notice from an employer that those type of documents should be.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good enough to to put them in a position where they can now be any a. Rent forgiveness or relief. Position where they are. On a schedule to repay as they can. I get it. So I for the for the purposes of the motion, I think what Al is actually requesting is to provide a little more clarity on'",
        "'speaker_3': 'how a tenant would qualify for the application of this ordinance, which was not something we were discussing earlier, but it's still appropriate to it. Just this would require this friendly, I think would require a little more specificity to be provided in the opening section of the existing ordinance when it says you need to be able to provide'",
        "'speaker_3': 'reasonable proof that you've been adversely affected by COVID. If you're a tenant, well, now it's going to say you need to be able to provide reasonable proof, which will, if you can prove that you qualify for other public benefits or you've received a layoff notice, that will be reasonable proof.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think it simplifies things for the renters. Absolutely.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Does that make sense? Are you good with that, Stacey?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Absolutely.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Okay. So now we're going to go back to that clarifies the vote. We were on the roll call vote. So. Well, hold on, Councilman Price, is that an additional. Do you keep up again or that I.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I did.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. So the and I misunderstood that I'm the secondary the motion. I misunderstood that. Councilman Orson I think that's fine. I have no objection to what you're suggesting, but what I wanted to hopefully try to get a little bit of clarification on is for the partial payments or the pay back schedule for those.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I had indicated in my substitute that individuals who are receiving no income and don't qualify for anything for whatever reason, those individuals would not have to pay the partial payments. They would still have 12 months to repay. But if they couldn't make the partial payments that I was trying to find a way for those individuals to not'",
        "'speaker_2': 'have to pay through proof and documentation. So I think the proof and documentation would be that if they can show they're not receiving any income. Through subsidy or work, then they would not have to make a partial payment on that payment schedule.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so that's an A.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I accept that friendly as well. I think that's very gracious.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. We're going to go then to the roll call vote on the sub sub, Madam Clerk.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'District one. A District two. No. District three. I have District four.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'District five.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'District six.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'District seven.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'A.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'District eight. District eight.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'District nine.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Now we'll take a roll call vote on the substitute motion.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'District one.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Name.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'District two. May. District three.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'District seven.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Nay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'District eight. All right. District nine?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Now we're back to the original motion. So this is the. I think we're gonna need some clarity. Consumer Peirce, do you want to repeat? Mr. Attorney, can you repeat the motion that's on the floor?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. Are we. Are the friendlies accepted as part of that motion?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think that I think the friend I think that council council member Pearce accepted a majority of Councilman Price's friend Liz, with the exception, I think of a couple at the end. But I don't think she accepted anything beyond that because there was a substitute on the floor.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If. Right. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Can I get a clarity, clarification on what was accepted before the substitute?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Absolutely. And that's why I want to make sure that. Mr. Senator, do you have all of that that we went through what we need to be repeated?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think I can go through most of it and then I can highlight what I think is what I'm not quite certain of. Okay. Okay. So I'm going to leave the first part. And here's the part that I'm pretty sure of.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Extends the current deferred rent repayment period to. Wait a minute. I'm sorry. Hmm. You know what? Let me just start from the top. And it's the number one was extend the current eviction moratorium and rent deferment period. For 90 days to August 31st, 2020.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm not sure if the friendly was accepted to make it 60 days with direction for staff to bring it back or not.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That was accepted to be 60 days and then after the 60 days there would be a review prior to the 60 days, two weeks before to consider an extension at that point. But it was 60 days with consideration of extension for 30 days.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Got it. Okay. Then number two would be extend the current deferred rent repayment period, the period within which tenants into repay to July 31, 2021. The benchmarks would be in the preamble. They would be encouragement only not enforceable.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There would be a direction to the city manager to work with the prosecutor and the city attorney to bring back a report in June on anti tenant harassment best practices. But that would not be included in the ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The exclusion of the commercial tenants would remain the same as the last time I went through this. There would be six different types of commercial tenants excluded, including title stressed tenancies and sub tenancies. I believe that was accepted.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And the remainder five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11 would be, as I described them, as directing city staff to do certain things with respect to certain programs and also directing the legislative committee to advocate for increased forbearance.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I don't think any of those things changed or friendlies were accepted that were discussed between CD3 and CD2. Hopefully. Hopefully, that's a thumbnail sketch of what we're voting on. If you need more clarification, let me know. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And Councilmember Pearce, do you have a clarification?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I appreciate Stoffer for running through those. I know that everybody had an opinion on the way that the repayment should work, so I really will kick it over to staff to flush that part out since everybody had a different thought in that section.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So long as yeah, I think that is it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That what you want it to be but you want it to be in the preamble, right? Right. Councilmember Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes, sir.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Can I just ask for a clarification, Mr. Mayor?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, I had a qualification. Go ahead, Councilman.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. How about the amendments regarding the revolving loan fund for property owners? The report back on the foreclosure resolution with the legislative actions.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes, those are accepted.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And Tidelands Fund.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. Those were.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Accepted.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay, great.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I want to clarify also just Councilman Pierce, I think what your what your your motion is you're asking for staff. On the actual repayment plan that staff would come back to present to see how that would actually look, what the payment plan would look like for council to adopt.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I mean, considering we're in that first six months, there's obviously very little time to. Yeah, we have it's extended 12. But the payment plan process, it will come back from from staff, correct?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes, I'm.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And and I think that the the preamble question, I think I'm not I don't completely understand it. And so I'm assuming we'll get some clarity from staff on kind of where the appropriate place that should go in the ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah. I feel comfortable that I know where to put it in the preamble. And effectively the direction is to in the future, the council is going to consider making that those benchmark payments enforceable. I think that's what I'm hearing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But for the time being, it's only going to be encouraged in the preamble.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that in the next six months, because we've got six months until we want to work on what that payment plan looks like, you can bring that back to the Council for us to have a fuller discussion and about where the economy is at.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. I get it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'll go ahead and I'll go ahead. That clarifies it. I'm going to a roll call vote.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'District one.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah, I am District two.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'District three. District three. Did you get mine? No. There's three.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'District four.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'All right.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'District five. I am District six. I'm District seven.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'District eight. District nine.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Ocean carries.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, counsel. That concludes the item. All the items on the agenda. I don't think anybody has any new business that I see. No one is queued up for new business. And so with that, we will go ahead and adjourn the meeting of the city council.'"
