        "'speaker_5': 'Because the fact that a lot of individuals have lived in this district who don't know a lot about cheering, feel, that's a big hole of a walnut. So if you had a chance to go through there, it looks like a might now because we've done so much work and put so much time into it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I want to thank first, I think, in the Department of Parks and Recreation, Marines for the incredible work at the Geneva Bears Memorial Park. To date, this park is one of the most walk through every day in my district, and it has served an area to remember a wonderful woman who contributed to Long Beach in many ways'",
        "'speaker_5': '. The General Bears Love Foundation has really stepped up and worked with the city to keep Jenny's legacy alive, and I am excited to see the playground come to this park.

        "'speaker_3': 'And in this case, my sister Jenni Rivera. And we are so pleased with this park. Like you said, many children I've seen from middle school and adults walk through this park. And what Jenni Rivera Foundation has seen is that single mothers, which are our mission, is to help single mothers raise again with their children.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we provide shelter. We were providing child care, and now we want to provide a park where a single mother can.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Take her child and it's free and it's spending.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Quality time with the family and it will be out in the open, just, you know, get the kids off their cell phone and on onto a playground. And this isn't our only project. We have many other projects, but just so you get an idea, it's it's $5,000 to test the soil before we can even begin anything.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So these $10,000 will help us so much. And Jackie, the board of directors can that you know, other projects the park has.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'As you guys know we already have the memorial that my brother did in honor of my mom. And we want to do the playground first off. And our next plans would be exercise equipment and maybe a doggie center for people to walk their dogs.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Maybe also organized family days are my thing is really important to her family. Her family spend quality time together, not just in front of the TV and mom's busy, but just we want to provide a place where families can spend quality time, like.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'The first hearing hearings are up first. And that is in particular, people are here for the appeal on the mental health facility. And so that's up first. The second large item that we have here is on the healing issue.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I know that the folks here from the don't waste the Don't Waste campaign, we need to get everyone in for the mental health issue first. That is going to at least take an hour of time for that hearing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's a long hearing. And so if anyone is willing to give their seat up for numerous seniors and others that are outside, that want to be able to speak on the other item that would be appreciated, this this item will not come up at least for an hour.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Is that so correct?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Mr. MODICA At last count was almost 80. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Now.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'For approval of a star's behavioral health urgent care center at 3200 Long Beach Boulevard. Just a brief history on the project. The Planning Commission on March 30th approved the operation of this facility at the address, and at the time of the public hearing, we had a request to the Planning Commission to continue the item.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'The the Planning Commission's decision to not continue the item. So there were a total of four appeals filed on this case. I'd like to just briefly go over the location of the project here in point of the location.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This is just north of the 45 Freeway on Long Beach Boulevard. The street to the south is 32nd Street and access to the site is from 32nd Street. Next is the zoning map that gives you a better idea of the location there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The arrow is pointing to the red Kia and that is the community commercial, auto oriented zoning of the property, which in the Midtown specific plan, which in which the property is located, requires a conditional use permit in order to operate.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'An urgent.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Care facility such as the one that's being proposed. The Behavioral Health Urgent Center is proposed to be operated by the star's behavioral health group, and they are under contract to the Los Angeles County Health Department of Mental Health.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They proposed that we use an existing 14,400, approximately 14,400 square foot medical office building that is currently vacant. And their operation consists of two secure units. One unit is for adults and there would be space for 12 adults and there is a second unit for six adolescents maximum.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And it is proposed to be a 24 hour operation seven days a week. It is an outpatient only facility and the maximum stay for any potential client is 23 hours and 59 minutes. So we call it a 24 hour facility or a 24 hour, a limited duration of 24 hours for any patient.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But the average patient, according to the history of the operation of this facility, is approximately 4 to 6 hours. The way the project operation has been described to staff, the patients arrived on their own by transportation, by ambulance or by police.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But they can also walk into the facility. The patient does not, except what they call code three, which is lights and sirens by the police department. Those are not the type of patients that are accepted at this facility.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It is not a homeless service facility and it is not a shelter. It is a mental health crisis center. And it currently it fills a current gap in the existing mental health care system by providing an alternative to a hospital or an emergency room or jail for a person who is experiencing acute mental health crisis.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And these other facilities are not appropriately designed to accommodate the kind of crisis that this facility proposes to provide for its clients. I'd like to share a brief rendering of the project with you. This is the this photo shows some of the improvements that are proposed for the facility.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They will be enhancing the facade of the building with nice wood siding and new entry features on the building. And the next slide shows you a site plan of the property. It does meet all of the city's codes for parking and access.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And as I mentioned earlier, the access to the site is not from Long Beach. The building sits up adjacent to Long Beach Boulevard and access to the parking lot is from 32nd Street. I talked earlier briefly about the project staff has worked really closely.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Scott Kinsey was the project planner and he worked really closely with the applicant to establish appropriate conditions of approval for the project. We've added some very strict operations and security features to the plan in addition to those that were already proposed or initially proposed by the operator.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Those includes security guards at the site at all time during this facility operation, which is 24 hours. Patients will not be discharged to the street, meaning that they will have rides to to take them away from the facility.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There we also included conditions of approval that will document and memorialize some of those security and operations plan. Rather than going into detail on these operations. The applicant will be speaking after the staff presentation and they can elaborate more fully describe some of the operations of the facility.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Again, just on the site, I'd like to just briefly talk about some of the improvements that will be made to the site to upgrade the building before this this particular client goes into the that address. There are going to be doing parking lot repaving and re striping.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They're also proposing additional security lighting they'd be providing on site security cameras. They would construct a new block wall.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Along Elm Avenue and.'",
        "'speaker_3': '36/2 Street on the site. And they're also proposing to upgrade the landscaping that's already on the site, and that would include new street trees in the parkway. They're also proposing right away improvements to the site, including new sidewalk, curb and gutter as appropriate.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And they would be upgrading the ADA or the accessibility improvements around the site perimeter. With that, I would just like to to close the staff presentation. And staff recommends and finds that with the inclusion of the recommended conditions of approval that I just discussed earlier, in summary that this facility will not generate negative impacts upon the neighborhood'",
        "'speaker_3': 'or the surrounding community. This facility will also fill a critical, a crucial care gap in the local health care system for mental health services. Staff recommends that the City Council uphold the Planning Commission's decision to accept a categorical exemption for this project in compliance with sequel.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It also recommends that the City Council approve the conditional use permit for this behavioral health care center and deny the four appeals that were submitted for the project. I'd like to also, before closing and before hearing from the applicant, I'd like to introduce the city's the city prosecutor, Doug Harper, to make Hulbert to make a few comments'",
        "'speaker_3': 'on this project. And that concludes the Planning Department's presentation.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Honorable Mayor and members of the City Council. The Seventh District Council Office asked me to expand on some comments in the record with the letter from my office on some of the potential benefits of a UCC to public safety.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I know they'll be represented. Representatives of the police department here to answer other questions if you have them. In July, July eight, 2014, Los Angeles District Attorney Jackie Lacey held a mental health summit to discuss the intersection between mental health and the criminal justice system.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'A number of representatives from various stakeholder groups were present. Also present were members of law enforcement, including LAPD, L.A. County Sheriff's Department, Los Angeles, L.A. County Probation Department. The Superior Court was represented other legal entities such as the Public Defender's Office, other first responders, L.A. City Fire Department, L.A. County Health Department, L.A. County Department of Mental Health'",
        "'speaker_5': ', also Long Beach City Prosecutor's Office, as I mentioned, Long Beach PD, Long Beach Health Department were there. We talked about a number of things, including best practices that have been deployed in other cities such as Miami-Dade and San Antonio, to see what works in other jurisdictions and what might be introduced here in L.A. County to help the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'intersection, again, between mental illness and the criminal justice system. The result of that meeting was several other smaller workshops that which culminated in an August 4th report, 2015, from the District Attorney, Jackie Lacey. It was published by the Criminal Justice Mental Health Advisory Board.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's called A Blueprint for Change, and it's a very large document that has a number of recommendations. One of those recommendations was to use mental health, urgent care centers to assist law enforcement, but also to make connections between law enforcement and community services that might assist people who are suffering from mental illnesses.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The report specifically talks about the difficulty that a police officer in the discharge of their duties has when they come across someone who may have a mental condition that makes it difficult for them. They can take the person to jail if they are in violation of the law and be returned back to the streets.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Or they could try to transport the person to a hospital where they may wait five, six, seven, 8 hours to get services are more likely. Police officers will move someone along if they can at least reduce the problem and and move on with their shift.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'What we lacked here in L.A. County and what we've seen work in other jurisdictions is an urgent care crisis center, which is kind of an intermediate step. It's part of a larger strategy that's been deployed throughout the county.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Police departments are doing training for their officers. CIT training, crisis intervention training is being introduced to many departments. In fact, I think just about everyone in Long Beach will have that training within the next year or two. The expansion of met teams, mental evaluation teams will help police officers better deal with problems associated with mental illness.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There's long term and short term supportive housing pre-booking pre filing diversion programs and a number of other things. We were excited when about a year ago we heard that there was funding for urgent care centers. And when we heard that a center would be located in Long Beach, it gave us in law enforcement, police and prosecutors at'",
        "'speaker_5': 'least the hope that we will have additional tools to help our law enforcement officers deal with what appears to be an expanding problem. My final comments are that this is also consistent the locating of a UCC in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It is consistent with what the city has been doing for quite some time now, which is looking to transform the role of public safety. The expectations on our public safety officers is greater now than it ever has been before.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They're not just expected to be versed in the law and know how to arrest and perform their law enforcement duties. But they're also being expected to identify the root source of problems. They are now expected to become problem solvers in a wide range of areas, including mental health, by giving them the tools they need.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I believe that they can do their job better, more effectively. This is not just for the goal of assisting persons with mental illness. This is also for the goal of improving public safety in our neighborhoods. And I think if done properly, a UCC such as this with the conditions that I've heard and read in the in the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'record with an applicant who has the resources to do it right, I think it will also leave our city better prepared to deal with the mental health problems that our law enforcement and first responders encounter on a daily basis.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That concludes a city.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Prosecutor's office report.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Halbert. We're going to go ahead and like all hearings, first hear from the applicants. I'm sorry. We heard from the we're going to hear a plea from the appellants first. Right. Mr.. Mr.. City attorney. Yes, that's correct.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. So not we're not going we're actually not going to hear from the applicant's case.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The applicant can make a brief statement or if the applicant is here to speak, does the applicant and the. Appellant Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If the applicant wants to make just a few a statement, you're more than welcome to and then we'll go to the appellants who get a certain amount of time. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And city council members. I'm Kent Dunlap.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm president, CEO of Stars Behavioral Health Group. We are the agency that is going to be contracted to open this program. You know, this is something that is not just here in L.A. County, but it is actually sweeping the nation, this movement, to develop crisis services as a alternative to incarceration, to use of hospitals.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have talked throughout the community here, see broad support from city leaders, from the business community and especially from law enforcement, where we were told that on average there's about 6000 of these met team responses per year and the city is to be commended.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The city was the first in L.A. County to develop the the Met program. That's about 500 per month. 50 of those are hospitalizations. And when that occurs, as the city prosecutor said, it takes about a half a shift for a police officer.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It converts into a hospitalization at a psychiatric hospital. It's a loss of entire ship when that officer brings that individual to the behavioral health urgent care center, we're calling it the buck for short. They would wait for an assessment to be done, and that would take about 15 minutes and then they'd be on their way.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So a big improvement in freeing up police time throughout the community. I want to address the issues and concerns that we heard from the neighbors that are the source of the appellant. The pills. Would you like me to do that now or wait till you hear from them?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, you have you have the opportunity to have a time to speak. After they speak, there's a rebuttal opportunity. So it's up to you if you want to bring up some of those issues now you're welcome to. If you want to do it after the appellants speak, you're welcome to do that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I do have some slides that would give you some more information. I'll try not to be redundant to what you've already heard. You've already heard that it is a 24 hour service crisis. Stabilization is the name of the actual medical service that's provided.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The average stay is 4 to 6 hours. Even though they can stay 24 hours. The average client we will have is somebody who's living with a mental health condition, a chronic health condition. And just like anybody else with a physical health condition, a heart disease, a neuromuscular disease, they have times when their symptoms flare up and they'",
        "'speaker_1': 'need emergent treatment. That's what this is for, for individuals with the mental health program. They often come in, they know what's going wrong, they've received some trauma. Additionally, that's exacerbated their problem. Their medications are no longer working. So that's why the length of stay can be short.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Again, you've heard that it's about 12 to 6 adolescents. The volume is about 30 clients per day, most of whom will come in during the daytime hours. So you're talking about two or three admissions or people coming and going per hour.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's both voluntary and most of the clients will be voluntary. The involuntary clients will be in the minority. It is a medical program, doctors, therapists. They also use peer counselors, individuals with lived experience. They're very effective in working with.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Our clients will employ about 50 people. And if it wasn't clear there's no city funding involved with this program. It's all county funding as well as the initial grant funds from the state to start the program. We really like the site.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We looked at 17 locations across the county, I mean, across the city. This location is central between the Orange County border and harbor, UCLA, where there's another one of these urgent care centers being developed. It's also very proximate to college and memorial hospitals.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Freeway close to the other hospitals. Convenient. And that way you've seen the location with the other map we we like the location has ample parking for police vehicles to come in and drop off clients. It is now kind of an eyesore of a building.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It has been sparsely occupied graffiti at times. And we'll convert that, as you saw, into a beautiful new facility that will operate 24 seven. We're the right agency to do this for this city. We have we're one of the largest organizations providing county contracted mental health programs throughout the state.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We operate these programs in San Bernardino County. We actually operate higher levels of care, psychiatric hospitals, including one in Torrance. And we're a Long Beach company. Our headquarters are right next to the Long Beach School District. We've been in the community for over 20 years.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We are on 46 school campuses providing school based services. We provide a variety of other services throughout the community. We operate other urgent care centers. And you can see this that it is a inviting home like non stigmatizing environment for the clients to come into.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'On this floor plan, you can see that the buck is actually just two thirds of the building. We're actually going. To be releasing the bottom third of the building on the corner there for a regular community services office.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Those green things around the building are cameras. This is something that we did and proposed. And now as part of the conditions of the the permit to provide security in the community. We don't need these cameras to protect our patients or our staff.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We don't have these that our other programs that we operate. They don't have them at the other L.A. County urgent care centers. But we did this expressly to show our commitment to community safety. These cameras will be available to police enforcement, to the police via the Internet.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We also are going to have a security service I'll talk about in a second. There's the the three units of the top unit, the adult unit. Yellow is the adolescent center. Green is the crisis walk in center. So most of the clients will come there again.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Most will be voluntary, but we'll only operate that 8 to 8 is the current time period that we're looking at. After that time, anybody can still come in voluntarily, but they'll go to the rear entrances off the parking lot, to the secured areas.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So you've heard about the impact on law enforcement. It's an equal impact on emergency rooms. That's where individuals now go. If you talk to the hospitals in the area, it means it takes the emergency room staff many hours to work with these individuals.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The police are asked to stay there because the hospitals don't have the resources and so it'll be a big savings for them as well. We have all these other benefits. It's not as it was, had a program specifically to deal with homeless issue individuals.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In our experience in San Diego County and the experience in L.A. County, about 90% of the individuals coming to these programs have a home and we'll return to them. It's only about 10% that are homeless for them. I'm part of the the program will be to link them to services will work with the homeless coalition here in'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Long Beach to do that to give priority to these individuals. It's a better looking building. In addition to the cameras, we're going from a building that's closed and vacant and dark to a building with a light, a parking lot operating 24 seven.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We are having security staff on all shifts. And another condition that the city asked of us that we've agreed to is that one of the security staff will be outside the building in the parking lot at all times, will have two on the inside, one on the outside.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We'll also want to make ourselves available to the community. They'll always have an ability to call our manager who again will be there. We'll have somebody there on a 24 hour basis as well as we will take any invite to come and meet with the community groups down the road and talk to them about any issues and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'concerns. The important thing about the program is that individuals don't stabilize and then walk out the door. Part of the goal of the program is lasting stabilization, and the way we do that is to transition them into services so they have supports as they return to the community.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We do that through what's called a warm handoff. It's not just giving a phone number, but we make that linkage, maybe have that agency that's going to work with them, come and pick them up, for example. The other thing is that that 24 hour clock is ticking for everybody who gets admitted.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But if that is ending in the evening time, they don't have to leave. They can stay there until the next morning. We prefer that they do that and then they can leave during hours. So the concerns we heard from the community are really three fold.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'One is that there are homeless individuals in the area and that this is going to exacerbate the problem. We heard from local neighbors and we talked to 200 going door to door. We went to 200 neighborhood homes to their door, talked about 60 people there, about another 80 people in neighborhood meetings and heard this is one concern'",
        "'speaker_1': '. A, they expressed that there was an increase in homeless individuals that they attributed to the food bank that's done by the Salvation Army down at spring. So first and foremost, again, you can't get access to the program just because you're homeless.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You have to have a mental health diagnosis symptoms at a level determined to be in a crisis situation. And our experience is that individuals don't repeat through the program we're failing at that happens so you're talking about a high utilize or may come three or four times per year.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Again, our approach is to stabilize them so they don't need to come back to the service. Those individuals again that are homeless, about 10%. We will work to transition them into into housing as they leave. The effect of the deterrence of their facility with the 24 hour operation, with the cameras, with the security guards outside, with occasional'",
        "'speaker_1': 'police patrol cars dropping off individuals we think will be a major deterrents to homeless people being in the community addressing that concern that we heard. The second concern is that individuals after receiving treatment can just leave and walk out into the community.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's not our experience or said. It's a planned transition where transportation is provided typically that through. Friend or family member. If there's no other resource, we will provide the transition in transportation back home. If an individual does not complete treatment, if they want to leave before our clinicians determine that they've completed treatment, including have that transition plan'",
        "'speaker_1': 'in place, then we do an assessment, we do a risk assessment, and our staff will have the ability to invoke an involuntary status at 5150, if there's any risk, determine for that individual leaving, and then they will have to remain in the facility on an involuntary status.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The last concern that we heard from the community is that this is a great program. It's absolutely needed. But why here? Why in this community? Because there's other programs. Again, they equated it with a homeless program, which it's not.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They also communicated that there are sober living or other group homes in the community. Again, this is not a residential program. Our clients will come to the building, go into the building, remain in the facility, and then go back into a car or other vehicle and leave the facility.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They won't be in the community. So there's that as well. A lot more to say, but I know you're sensitive to time, so I'm happy to answer any questions now or after the appellants. Thank you very much. You'll have a chance, if you'd like, after the appellants for a couple minutes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'For three or 5 minutes. Okay. Thank you very much. Now we have. We have the appellants, and I want to make sure that the different appellants are here. I don't think one of the appellants is here, but I'm going to read their names.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If you're an appellant, please come forward. I believe it's Rick Ivey. Nefariously. Choi Carmen Allan Stevens. Did I miss anyone? Official. Doug, are you here for Doug? Otto. Okay. Please come forward. Let me just first get all the appellants here for a second.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Okay. I just want to make sure I have. Who's your first set of appellants?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm Topher Isley. I'm here for Troy. Carmen.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay, so why don't we begin? We're going to give each appellant 10 minutes. If you need to go past 10 minutes that we'll give you a few more minutes after that. A reasonable amount of time. Okay. And so why don't we go ahead and start with the Nephi Eisley?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We'll go first.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And the rest of the passage. As long as you just take a seat somewhere closer to the front, if there are any. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I don't know. I've got 10 minutes, Robert.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You can. You don't have to take 10 minutes. That's.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's more. I would have taken longer.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'No, it's up to you. However you. However you know, anything shorter than that is appreciated.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Good evening. My name is before I leave. My husband and I are homeowners at 375 East 36th Street and also 2500 Cedar Avenue in the sixth and the seventh District of Long Beach. I want to say that I agree that mental health services should be available to all that need them.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'However, I disagree with the location of the proposed mental health urgent care facility. According to the Long Beach Health and Human Services website, we currently have 14 mental health facilities in Long Beach offering services. The proposed site of the new facility is located in District seven, which already has three facilities to treat mental illness.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'District six to the immediate south has one facility and District eight to the immediate north has two facilities. In addition, in District nine, there is Telecare La Casa Mental Health Urgent Care Facility, which is located at 66 Paramount Boulevard.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They already provide outpatient services for those in crisis and provide crisis stabilization. During the Planning Commission meeting on March 30th. The Staff Behavioral Health Group stated these types of services were non-existent in Long Beach, which is not true.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They are. They exist and have for some time now with the Telecare locus, a mental health urgent care facility. I'm not sure why Long Beach needs yet another mental health care facility, especially a facility, according to the CEO of the Stars company that was service all of South Bay in Orange County.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Long Beach has enough facilities for people in crisis that we don't need to burden the residents in this one neighborhood with yet another facility. I don't know if you guys have been to the Albertson's supermarket shopping center on the corner of Long Beach Boulevard and Willow lately.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I don't think it's a coincidence that the College Medical Center, which offers inpatient and outpatient mental health care services, is located just behind the shopping center and has an increase in the numerous mentally ill people loitering in the parking lot while people are trying to patronize the businesses.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In addition, the Salvation Army load located across the street from the proposed site also offers social services. Why are we impacting one residential neighborhood? It can't be for the greater good of the community. We have close to 500 signatures that say otherwise, and I'm almost positive less than a quarter of the people that will be speaking today'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that say we need this facility live anywhere close to the proposed site. We are allowing others to come and tell us what our neighborhood needs instead of the residents speaking up for what we want. And this is not at this location.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We'd be better off putting a pediatric urgent care facility to help the growing number of families in the area with small children needing care instead of going to emergency rooms in our critical care hospitals. And one last point.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Of the 14 mental health facilities in Long Beach, none of them are located in districts three or five. Maybe we should look into a facility in those districts where today's services do not exist but are probably needed as well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much. Next up, we're going to have Rick Ivey. Mayor and city council. We are a compassionate, caring and concerned community as residents involved in the welfare of the community. We have a vested interest in all issues affecting Long Beach citizens.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We care and we want to help. We recognize the need for such an air mental health facility within the county. I would like to bring your attention to the L.A. County Department of Mental Health response to a motion made by Don Carnaby and Ridley-Thomas.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And it talks about. Urgent health care facilities to be used as a pre-booking diversion as appropriate. The exploration of psychiatric, urgent care facility, urgent care centers. So they may serve as a site for pre-booking diversion of individuals with mental illness and substance abuse disorders.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This is a document from 2013 to be to Pre-Booking jail diversion programs, initially as pilot projects serving the Long Beach and Antelope Valley areas are proposed. The proposed projects would be housed in new CCS urgent care centers to be located in the Antelope Valley and Long Beach areas.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The use CCS would serve as an entry point for the Long Beach Police Department to link individuals to mental health services in lieu of them being charged with low level offenses. Now I fully understand and I'm concerned. But we're talking about a facility for the county.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We're also talking about bringing people from Orange County. In the Mental Health Advisory Board, A Blueprint for Change. The document by Jackie Lacey from the District Attorney's Office, dated August 4th, 2015, describes diversion in the criminal justice system.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is the term often used as a legal term of art to describe alternative programs which prevent someone suffering from suffering a criminal conviction? This report uses the term diversion more broadly, as used in this report. Diversion includes all circumstances ranging from pre-arrest to post-conviction in which mentally ill persons can be prevented from entering jail at all, can'",
        "'speaker_1': 'be redirected from jail into treatment, or can receive linkage to services to help prevent them from returning to custody. What concerns me is that we're dealing with a residential neighborhood and we're talking about some. Individuals that are we're dealing with as a criminal element.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This is a little bit different from the walk in facility. 80% of mentally ill of offenders also suffer from cold occurring substance abuse disorders. As a practical matter, someone who is actively high on drugs alcohol may be violent or competitive and will not immediately be amenable to mental health treatment, may not be able to be received by'",
        "'speaker_1': 'an urgent care facility. The report goes on to talk about the need for sober living centers and residential detoxification centers. The parking lot for this emergency urgent care facility is in the front yards of people's houses. Even a bar has hours of operation.'",
        "'speaker_1': '24 hours a day is a little bit much for a residential area. The Los Angeles City Council centralized its homeless services in the 1970s as a destination for homeless resources for over and over the decades. The area now marks a huge area where homeless people are choosing to reside.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Store is a privately owned for profit business that is currently taking funding from the county under the guise that they are the solution. Unfortunately, Starr is oversimplifying complex issues, making overly optimistic policy promises of instant medical health care solutions and resolutions to grave social problem.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Problems in which the majority of care will be provided for patients in the community are just a Band-Aid to bigger issues. Los Angeles County, as cited in the report, does not fund the next level of mental care health hospitals that treat 5150 patients or seriously addicted individuals with habits costing hundreds of dollars a day are already full'",
        "'speaker_1': 'to capacity and overflowing. Obtaining treatment consists of a prolonged process of calling every hour for days until a bed becomes available. I believe there's 36 beds and they every day they have 60 to 90 more patients than they have occupancy for.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The major concern here is that patients will have no facility to be referred to, will be under no obligation to stay at this facility, will not be bound by state law and are free to leave the facility dreadfully in need of more extensive treatment and further care.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'No one will be waiting to take them back to their location of origin, though Starr claims they will arrange transportation, deserving people will be unwillingly relocated to our community with no money and no place to go. We are compassionate Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Other cities are not as kindhearted and benevolent. The Irvine Police Department and others have been cited for dumping homeless individuals on Skid Row in downtown L.A.. This is a privately funded county facility. They said they're going to accept drop offs from Orange County when it's funded by L.A. County.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Outside jurisdictions are going to be able to legally go back to their carefree, unfeeling practice of extracting and transporting and banishing their responsibility to us in the form of disoriented, confused, traumatized and now displaced individuals. Even though our acts of kindness will result in the escalation of an issue that is not a promised resolution.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It was not long ago when there were 96 vacancies on Long Beach and Atlantic Avenues. Currently, retail is getting hit hard by the Internet. Our business district contains stores that are forced to lock their doors now, a practice that a few years ago was unheard of.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Jewelry stores lock their doors as customers, employees and merchants. Begin to feel unsafe. They will first lock their doors. It will be a major change for our industrial or retail area. In Bixby Knolls, industrial businesses are fortified with fences and obstructive security measures additions, additions that a retail district's fragile atmospheric sensing experience can rarely accommodate.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This property is surrounded by four residential neighborhoods due to proximity of so many residents. I would ask first of all that you would find a more industrial and better location for this facility, but that you would limit the hours of operation like a normal business or any, I think steel craft and the other bars.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'From 7 a.m. to 10 p.m.. We would ask that a licensed psychiatrist be present at all hours of operation that they chose to be open. It's not fair to bring people from outside the area to a facility that does not have somebody to treat them.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Likewise, that all staff persons would be appropriately licensed individuals with the minimum licensing for their position. We'd ask that the Long Beach Police would double the patrols of the premises and the vicinity to include at least patrol 12.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Patrols that day. That would be one every 2 hours. We would ask that when wait times exceed one and a half hours, or when wait times exceed two and a half hours, that the facility would stop accepting patients from outside of the area until the wait time went down.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I thank you for your understanding. We want to make Long Beach a great place. We just think that we need to think this thing through a little bit better. They went out. They got 17 locations. If we're going to cooperate with the county, if we're going to cooperate with other counties, it seems like we could put a'",
        "'speaker_1': 'little bit more effort into doing a little bit better job for all parties involved. Thank you. We'll hear from the next. We're going to go ahead and hear from the next opponent, please. The next opponent up will be Troy Carman.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think someone's here on Troy's behalf. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Mr. Carmen says. Dear Council members, I am an appellant regarding the proposed five year Behavioral Mental Health Crisis facility located at 3200 Long Beach Boulevard. Unfortunately, I had a previously planned trip out of town and will not be present at the May 23rd hearing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I am respectfully requesting to allow Desiree Keys to speak in my absence. Thank you. Carmen. I am a resident homeowner of 3201 Pine Avenue, and my immediate concern is the safety and security in the neighborhood, as well as the culture and the climate change that I am anticipate happening.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Although this is an issue that is sensitive to others and we are not insensitive. We also agree that this location is not the best location for us in the neighborhood. I do have a statement that I'd like to read from to one homeowner and one resident that reside at 33, 64, 33, 66 Pine Avenue.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And this is from Miss Linda Shelton. The duplex is adjacent to the star facility on Wardlow Avenue. The facility has an open patio with picnic benches, lights and a camera outside the entrance door. I rent the bottom duplex to my son and his family, so I frequently visit the property at times, all times of the day and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'night. I would like to share concerns about the facility after hours, for instance, on May 20th. At 9:15 p.m., I witnessed a man and lady leaving the picnic benches after having sex. There are many times when people are smoking pot blasting music for my renter to hear or just hanging out.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The staff facility should surely recognize this loitering problem because they have cameras. The problem could easily be solved with a fence gate around the property. As Star Corporation grows, so does the number of employees, which means they take street parking during working hours.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It is very inconvenient for the many duplex residents on pine. For the past years I've watched the area surrounding the star facility on Wardlow and proposed star urgent care grow in crime. I speak from firsthand experience. Long Beach needs to be needs to help the residents in this focused area and make every effort effort to make the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'neighborhood more resident friendly. The new businesses should be resident friendly and responsible 24 hours, seven days a week. The staff facility on Wardlow is not resident friendly to their immediate neighbors. I am deeply, deeply concerned about the proposed urgent care and their responsibility to the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I am I am opposed to the proposed mental health urgent care at 3200 3230 Long Beach Boulevard. Linda Shelton. Scott Shelton lives at 33, 64, 33, 66 Pine Avenue. The duplex is adjacent to the star facility on Wardlow Avenue.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I rent the bottom duplex with my wife and four year old son. We have lived here for just under five years. The staff facility on Wardlow is taking a lot of the parking on Pine. There are many duplexes on pine and parking is scarce.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They have a good sized parking lot on Wardlow. But as their clients and employees grow, so does their need for parking after hours. The building, the building's patio welcomes homeless people and pot smokers. Homeless people have access to an exterior electrical socket.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The property is not adequately lit at night and weekends. The building alarm goes off and there is no follow up. I will look out to see what triggered the alarm for my family's safety. But no one from the Star Corporation nor the police ever follow up.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The Star Corporation does not take responsibility for what goes on outside the building and neighborhood. Within the past nine months, my family and I have experienced an increase in in crime to break ins at night with the family inside the house.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'One home invasion last week. Intruder in the house when I came home. Why? Wife robbed on Pacific World before cell phone. Car battery stolen. Car vandalized with graffiti. Mailbox theft repeatedly caught on camera. Car break in. Gas siphoned from car twice in April, three different neighbors, car windows bashed in, small things stolen.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I just just want to interject. I know that the appellant is Mr. Karman, right?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. So are these the testimony from other neighbors? Are they part of Mr. Carmen's testimony? Yes. Okay. I just want to confirm because I want to make sure it's Mr. Carmen's words.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. I speak from firsthand experience. I oppose the proposed mental health, urgent care at 3200 3230 Long Beach Boulevard because their facility on Wardlow is not responsible for the local residents. The area proposes a high crime area, a growing homeless community, and already has numerous social service facilities.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This Wrigley neighborhood needs more resident friendly businesses. The city of Long Beach needs to help the residents in this focused area and make every effort to make the neighborhood more resident friendly. Thank you.'",

I am here this evening to ask that you uphold their conditional use permit but require staffers to select a location for it in a non non residential neighborhood, not at 3200 Long Beach Boulevard. Proponents of the location say those of us who oppose it don't understand what we're opposing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Since being first being notified in January. Star's intention to open the book across the street from my house. I have learned quite a bit about this proposed mental crisis center. I've attended neighborhood meetings, two hosted by staff representatives and many others organized by people like me who live in the area and are concerned about what the book'",
        "'speaker_1': 'will mean for our community. There's a false narrative being put out that we oppose mental health that could not be farther from the truth. Speaking for myself and several hundred of my neighbors whom I've talked with about the book, we are persuaded of the need for urgent care services for people experiencing mental health breakdowns.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We support mental health. We support the book. My late mother would be upset with me for telling her story, but I think it's apropos here and she's not here to stop me. In February 2010, my mother experienced a mental breakdown aboard a cruise ship in the Gulf of Mexico.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'My brother and I had to fly her back to California because she was kicked off the cruise for assaulting the ship's doctor and nurse, as well as my sister in law. That whole experience, especially the flight from Cozumel, Mexico to LAX, was one of the most horrific experiences of her life or mind, made even worse by the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'fact that we didn't know what to do with her upon our return. My brother and I took our mother to an emergency room in Burbank. Once she was checked in, we went back to her house to catch some sleep.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All night long, she kept calling us on the phone to ask whether we were playing tricks on her. She thought we were sneaking up behind her, then running to hide behind the wall so she wouldn't see us. The whole time she believed my brother was really himself.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I was an imposter. She was completely delusional. The hospital staff refused to take the phone away from her because they said patients are allowed to make phone calls. They didn't know how to treat her, and the next day they transferred her to a mental care facility where she remained for several days.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If there had been a mental health crisis center like the duck for us to take her to, we would happily have done so. The staff there would have known what to do for my mother. It would have been wonderful for her and also for us.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I tell the story because when I spoke at the Planning Commission meeting on March 20, sorry, March 30th, asking for the buck to be located somewhere other than across the street from my house. Supporters of the buck told me, I don't understand.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They said if I knew what benefit this facility would provide the community, I would be in favor of it. The fact is, I do understand. I am persuaded of the need. I'm in favor of the facility, but I'm also realistic.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'My mother, one of the kindest, mildest, most well-mannered people I've ever known, was kicked off the ship because she violently attacked three people. People in the throes of a mental breakdown are not responsible for their actions. They're not bad people.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They're not criminals. They're people who need help. And they need a place to get help. But to say that they represent no threat is disingenuous. Most mentally ill people don't attack people, but some do. Most mentally ill people aren't dangerous, but some are.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Most mentally ill people won't cause harm to people or property, but some will. And my house is right across the street. Driving down Long Beach Boulevard gives the impression that Memorial Heights is a business district. But appearances are deceiving.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'An aerial view reveals houses and apartments lining the west side of Long Beach Boulevard from just below the four or five overpass down to 31st Street. Be tucked behind 3200 Long Beach Boulevard houses fill the entire span to Atlantic Avenue behind my house.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They stretch all the way back to the L.A. River. There are literally hundreds of homes within a two mile radius of the building where stars wants to open the buck. Hundreds, maybe thousands of residents live there with their families.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yet when those of us who attended the neighborhood meetings went door to door and set up at first Friday to speak with our neighbors, we found that most of them had no idea that stars wanted to move in.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They, like us, are concerned. And nearly 500 of us have signed a petition to express our concern. We are concerned because a mental health crisis center will have a detrimental effect on our property values. We are concerned that the city of Long Beach, the seventh largest city in California, seems to be concentrating the full spectrum of social'",
        "'speaker_1': 'services in our small neighborhood in rather than distributing them equitably throughout the city.

        "'speaker_1': 'And now stars proposals to bring more mentally ill people into our neighborhood from all over Long Beach, as well as from Orange County. We don't object to people in need seeking services. We object to the likelihood that unharmed people with mental illnesses will remain or returned to the area once they receive those services.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mentally ill people are not criminals, but they sometimes do cause damage to property and persons.

        "'speaker_1': 'We're here as an appeal, of course, from the March 30 decision of the Planning Commission. You have each received honorable mayor or members of the city council, and the city attorney received a may 18 letter from the law offices of Delgado.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I would ask that that be part of the record here today. There are. It's a lengthy letter with number of exhibits. I don't need to repeat the entire letter here. I would like to hit on a few highlights if I could.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'One is that there is currently litigation over who actually owns this property. This litigation is pending right now in the superior court in the city of Long Beach. You'll not find that anywhere in the application. Isn't that funny, that the litigation already existed at the time the application was filed?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But it was not declared openly to you. One must wonder why. The next thing is that the application refers to the property as vacant. Dr. Swansea has continuously operated a medical practice at that facility. Why was that not openly declared?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, some will say, oh, no, he's not there. But two H Properties 3060 LLC. The claimed title holder to the property at present actually entered into a stipulation in the Long Beach Superior Court in early 2017 that acknowledges that Dr. Tanzi has a medical practice, yet at that location has a lease for that facility that he's using'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and that he's welcome to stay there as long as he continually pays rent. Has that ever been disclosed to the city or the city council members? I don't think so. One must wonder why. We next need to look at what is the impact of this of the conditional use permit.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Once it's granted, it forever changes the complexity or excuse me, the the actual uses of that piece of property. Well, you're being asked to change the declared use of that property by someone whose title is put at issue in a legal process.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'But I do believe that the property owners attorney is also here. And so Mr. Parkin has asked that he be allowed to do a short comment on this or a rebuttal to this. And then we're going to turn this over to our city attorney, and that'll close the appellant's portion.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening, Mr. Mayor, and members of the Council. My name is Larry Cagney of the law firm of Kreeger and Kreeger. And we represent the property owner to Property 36. Earlier today, I submitted a letter, along with several exhibits to the city clerk.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I hope you've had an opportunity to review those. I'll draw your attention to two documents. They are really the key documents that should concern the Council with respect to this issue of ownership of the property.

        "'speaker_1': 'That's happening at 275 Magnolia Avenue in the Superior Court. Those proceedings are underway. They are on track for orderly resolution.

Mr. Jasper commented that the fact of the stipulation that was entered between two agent and Dr. Tansey, by which he is remaining in possession of a portion of the building, was not disclosed to the city.

The staff had done a title search and title insurance. And under the Streamlining Act, we don't believe it's appropriate that the Council will have to wait this matter, although it is scheduled for trial in September.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And unlawful detainer, I believe. In the end of this month could be appealed, could be continued, and it could be two or three years before the legal issues are over.

        "'speaker_1': 'Just for clarification, that is not an urgent care center. It is a counseling office that operates during daytime hours. This is the first I've heard that individuals are smoking pot and having sex on our picnic bench. We will certainly address that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But actually we had positive feedback when we had our meeting with the Del Mar Association that's most proximate to that location. People didn't even know that that site was there. There was talk about drug dealing going on, on the street, in front.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And as a result of that, we actually added cameras and lights to the front of our building in response. That was the first we heard that. We're happy to work with the community. We'll certainly address this issue that we've discovered this evening.'",

If you visit Harbor UCLA, like I said, then you would truly know why our special needs children and adults need their care to be a lot more special. It's honestly a title giveaway because it's because we're not educating them to fit ourselves.'",

It also adds an unmet need in Long Beach by offering another treatment option in our service system, where those in need can be seen in a more timely manner, which actually increases the chance of follow up care.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Listening to some of them speak so eloquently, there's a a picture that's painted of a clientele that really is concerning, perhaps, and scary.

        "'speaker_3': 'it is, who's going to be served by this facility. And it's us, our community. And if we shift that picture and think about it that way, I think we understand how important it is that we have this available to our family and friends and others who need this kind of help.'",

One of the pillars of Mental Health Awareness Month is reducing the stigma surrounding mental illness. It is completely acceptable in our society to talk openly about cancer or autoimmune diseases.'",

The other thing I'd like to dispel a myth is I'm not sure where the 14 mental health agencies exist in the city of Long Beach, especially to handle this kind of emergency.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'are going to need this. And you're going to be much happier to have this resource than the kind of resource I found 25 years ago. So thank you very much and I look forward to your passing this agenda item.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please. Good evening, council members and vice mayor. I'm Robert Fox speaking on behalf of Kono as executive director. Frankly, we could not come up with a vote on this issue that's too complex and we need more review so we don't have any opinion to give to you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I would like to speak to you privately as myself, Robert Fox, living in the second District. This facility is obviously very needed and I encourage the City of Livy's to continue to reach out for mental health facilities.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I do have one concern and it's a historic perspective. I've lived in the city for a really long period of time and sometimes we need to have a historian tell us what we did and what we didn't do in the East Village.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Many, many years ago, we had 26 service agencies for the homeless congregated in the very few blocks. And so we did something called a PD 30 moratorium on that particular neighborhood in order to bring a better quality of life to its residents.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We were not refusing services for anybody, but by attrition we would make sure that the distribution of services will be more fairly and evenly distributed through the city of Long Beach. What I've heard this evening is there was a concern about density of these kinds of services in this particular district.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If that is a concern for us, maybe we should take a look at in the future when we're looking at planning commission zoning to distribute facilities more even handedly throughout the districts so that one neighborhood is not impacted above the other.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'My other concern, of course, would be as wonderful as our desire is for this facility to to be a success is we do need to have an oversight in terms of assuring the neighborhood, which has a concern that they will not be negatively impacted by the great intentions that we have here.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you so much. Make up next, be good, please.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you so much. My name is Bishop Barney Redden. I pastor at 1115 North Market Street and have pastored in this city for 20 years. And I'm proud to say that particularly I'd like to address you from three points a parent, a pastor and a mental health professional.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Because I am also a psychologist. First, as a parent, I was asked by the Health.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Department a number of years ago around the work that I do in HIV to start a faith based support group with HIV, I met a young lady who was HIV at that time, who was about 12 years old, and I made a choice to adopt her.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'She was HIV positive because she had been severely sexually abused by her stepfather. Unfortunately, we dealt with many mental health issues, as one could only imagine. I can't even tell you how many times I ended up at Harbor-UCLa.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'On hours upon hours upon hours and turned into days. To get help.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'From my daughter.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I remember in January of 2010, the last year of her life, I told the social worker at Long Beach Memorial Hospital, somebody help me.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If there was a facility.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Where I could take my.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Daughter for three or 4 hours.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Where she could diffuse herself. She might not have stepped in front of a car on the 110 freeway. January 31st, 2010. First thing. The second thing is, I've been passionate about mental health for many, many years. I was granted a $100,000 grant from L.A. County Department of Mental Health in 2015 and 2016 to do mental health work'",
        "'speaker_3': 'in the church. Many pastors don't know what to do. I had a crisis on Sunday where I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Helped some officers defuze a young.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Lady, and if I would have had a facility where we could have gone and taken them like what stars is attempting to put up, it would have been fabulous. And then thirdly, the pastors. We need this in this community.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you so.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Much. Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hi. Good evening, Debbie. Ines Gomberg with the L.A. County Department of Mental Health. I'm a deputy deputy director and a psychologist as well. And I just want to let you know, the department is very supportive of mental health, urgent care centers.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And one of the reasons for that is over the last seven years or so, we've implemented a number of them. And what we found is that they're a key continuum in our mental health system of care. Very, very important.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And basically what they do is they they provide a mental health service when a client needs it. And our outpatient clinics obviously don't do that. They're open from eight, usually 8 a.m. to about five or 6 p.m.. So it's very important.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The other thing I can tell you is that as we look at our mental health, urgent care centers and their performance, only 6 to 8% of the clients that come in for a visit, an urgent care center, are psychiatrically hospitalized within 30 days of that visit.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And that's a key metric for us. The other thing I wanted to let you know about is that this is becoming a best practice across the state. And I think I think you've heard that tonight. Many counties have implemented urgent care centers as a as a viable alternative to psychiatric hospitalization.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I am Belinda Watson and I live in.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Seventh District and I don't have my words together, but I am one to voice it. I am not for the center being on Long Beach Boulevard and I represent a number of the residents that are in that area where we had meetings where we had a meeting and was done at the Vaguely Association meeting.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Which story is good? That is bringing a lot of people to say, you know, mental health is need, mental health is needed. And what we did in the community is say, yes, we are, we agree with that, but we just don't need another facility in our area.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so I just wanted you to hear that even though they are good at bringing people from outside the district and in the Long Beach area and people in mental health, but there are actual residents. And I want you to remember those 500 people who sign that thing saying that they do not want that on Long Beach'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Boulevard. There are a abundance of areas where a facility of that type can be placed and it would not be in a residential area. I went as to want the council to reconsider that particular location. What we need.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There are more community oriented businesses that draw our community, the community that lives there to come to there. We don't have an abundance of that. We have it over in Bixby. No. We don't have it in Wrigley. We need more of those and not more behavior services.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And even though, you know, I know that there is a big need for it, we need some other things in our community other than social services. So remember those other 500 people that may not be here? I'm representing them.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They have. I was astounded when I went to the two of the meetings and most of the people who said that they were in the district were really not in the district when they left the meeting. I have never seen some of these people, so.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you for your testimony. We have said.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I want you to think about that and those 500 people that are not.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes, ma'am. Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Oh, hello.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I am Jonathan Dunn. I may be 17 years old, but please allow me to speak. I am against the mental care mental health hospital at Long Beach Boulevard because there are plenty of mental care facilities, plenty.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Of hospitals here in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But if you are in Casey, do the hospital in Casey do the hospital over there? Please consider this. If there's if the idea is about security and staff taking care of people. Um. I would say.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Dual dual life license psychiatrist.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'More than one because once not doing enough for a lot of people. So if.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You truly care.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'About the people.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Because Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is a city which has.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'A lot of care and.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Passion for people. If that's the idea.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Or Mitch needs to step up its game. Thank you for your time.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. Next for you, please.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mr. Vice Mayor. City Council members and staff. I agree with everyone who has spoken before me. This urgent care facility is needed. However.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'If if there's a question of ownership to this facility, can you proceed with with putting it there right now?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Can you vote on that? Is our city attorney saying that Doug Auto is representing a frivolous lawsuit on on this?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'What's been presented here? Does it make sense? We have two sides here positioning for ownership on this. And if if our if everybody knows Doug Doug's Doug Auto here and everybody knows his reputation in our community. And if Doug Otto's.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Client wins, how is that going to affect that building? How is it going to affect.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This facility, which we all need, which we all agree is needed? I don't think you can vote on it tonight without letting the superior court determine that. I say we need this facility. We need it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Somewhere in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I say do it quickly. But I don't see how you can do that. You're not being told.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Everything about this legally. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. Next week, at least.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Good evening. Recap of rich eighth district. You know, I came here tonight to support the need but oppose the location. But I listened to this young man come up here and speak, and he talked about our special education children.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I have a special education, son. Most of you know my son. And he has had a couple of bouts. He's he's been diagnosed with traumatic brain injury and he's had a couple of needs for some serious behavior intervention.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So this facility, as opposed to my having to find it, find the help up at UCLA, would have been incredible. But what I do want to remind you and this is something that you can actually fix the problem.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I believe that the problem is if you look at that intersection, look at Wardlow and Long Beach Boulevard. It is panhandlers on every corner. They've taken over the equality storage center and they have a meeting area that they sit at every day with all their belongings.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'You have the overpass, the underpass that is now home to homeless. You have weeds that are that tall with trash on the sidewalk. It's not a good entryway into our city. And it certainly doesn't doesn't make the people that live there feel protected.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So if you worked on not only increasing the police presence, which means we have to grow our police department, but you also worked on having more than one quality of life team in the city. We had to reduce it from 2 to 1 because of patrol needs.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'If this corridor had a more cared for appearance, if the residents were seeing that it was being better taken care of, they might not be so afraid of the homeless population that has imploded in our districts. And those districts are seven and eight.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We are seriously impacted. I know we're going to talk about that later. So thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please. Hello. My name is Larry Tricia. I live about a.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Mile up the street from the proposed facility. I live up in Linden. And I just want you to know that I'm in favor of the facility. Just a little anecdote.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'A young man lives next door, had a had an episode, and his parents.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Had to call the police. He went into a catatonic state. They had to drag him down the stairs, but eventually bumped, got him in an ambulance and he was at the emergency room for quite some time, as I understand it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It would have been so much nicer if he had just gone to a decent facility and then then taken to the treatment center. Long story short.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'He's fine.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'He's married, he's doing great. And that's good. I want you to know I support the facility. Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And while we're at it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think the gentleman in black jacket is the last speaker. If anyone else is the final call, there's anyone that would like to speak on this issue. Please line up now, because as I see it, the gentleman in the black jacket is the final speaker.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. So we've got one additional person. Okay. So the speaker's list is now closed. Thank you. Proceed.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Thank you. My name is Georgia Case, and I've been in the seventh and eighth districts for 32 years. And having served on the Public Health Re Accreditation Committee, we certainly have heard about the needs. I'm not sure if I can say anything new.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Wonderful comments tonight on in support of this very needed program. But I think after 32 years, having really survived the riots and, you know, a robbery in my home dealing with the trials and tribulations over the past 30 years in the city, certainly wonderful experiences, but nothing prepared me for having to deal firsthand with our mental health'",
        "'speaker_12': 'care system in Long Beach. It is a it was a nightmare. And to put families through these crises of humiliation and truly horrific experiences, dealing with the police department, trying to do the job, the best job that they can, but also emergency rooms and dirty.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Private hospitals. So I think this suffering, pain and suffering does need to be documented. It's it's atrocious. And it's really time that we step up and join the 21st century in mental health care for our citizens. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Hi. My name is Monica Lopez and.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I lived for many years in the seventh District.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'My mom and sister and nephews live there now. I am in.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Full support of the program, but I'm also an employee of Started Community Services. I have worked there for 15 years so I can kind of opera more like global with greater perspective as to the services and being also a member of the community.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I now own.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'A home in the sixth district and I am full and support. I cannot offer any more than what's already been said other than I don't fear for my safety.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I don't fear for the safety of my mom.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Or my sisters or my nephews who will live down the street from the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Park.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I can only offer.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The perspective that as a mental health professional, I have seen the great work that Star View has provided because I am.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'One of the people that provide that care and there's nothing more rewarding than when.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We meet with clients and we see the tremendous growth that can be done when we as clinicians are given the adequate tools to do our work. And the park will be another of those resources that will be available to us for our community, our community that is in need.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And it couldn't have been.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Said better than the young man who.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Spoke today, especially about our special education program. You know, we are a big city, but we're a small town and we're all intertwined.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And we know each other and we know.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'People who will be greatly benefit if we proceed with this by approving it. And also we will know people who would be faced the consequences if we go the way of not approving it. So as an employee, as a family member and as a homeowner at Long Beach, I fully support this program.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Thank speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hi. My name is Cecilia McGill. I live in in the district I have here living here in Long Beach like 29 years. And I support this project because we need it.

        "'speaker_3': 'for our people who is living with severe depression. And we they're not looking to prevent suicides, too. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Next speaker, please. Hi. My name is Jane Case and kind of baby. I'm bummed that Robert and Pat work aren't here, but I have. I've been involved in a long beach for a long time and through the bike station and met many people with social and different economic situations.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To me, it's not mental illness. To me it's being confused, depressed, abused, lonely. And you really need people that can help you, give you perspective on your situations. You don't take it to the next level and make really stupid decisions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think that sort of thing where people in crisis. Can come and talk to somebody straight up, given their options, and they might even want to go home and think about it and show that to me. Forget the mental illness.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's talking straight up with somebody that needs some help. And talking on a third party. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Hi. My name is Blake, and I'm a resident and homeowner in the seventh District live about ten blocks from the proposed facility site. And I wanted to come out here tonight and voice my support for the proposed facility.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I also want to say that the living room neighborhood now for about six years and has seen a lot of positive change, seeing a lot of good things happening in the neighborhood. I know if you read certain Facebook posts and so forth, you would think that things are, you know, going crazy.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But I really feel that things are going really in the positive direction for the neighborhood. And like I said, I only have about ten blocks from it, so I'm in full support for it. I really feel that this would be a.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'A step in the right direction, still on the neighborhoods progressing and changing for the better. And I think this is just a a welcome benefit to and I'll be proud to have in my neighborhood. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you so much, Mr. Mayor. My name is Jacqueline Glass and I am in the ninth District. It's unfortunate that we're going through this over and over again. Regardless of what your people's belief is, the Bible says the poor will never cease.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So therefore, we must lean out our hand. We're talking about a critical care unit.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'For critical.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Crucial problems. Mental illness is serious. I'm a mental illness survivor. My grandchildren, my oldest grandson, who's 18, attempted suicide, and my ten year old sweetie pie, Savannah Juana also had issues, whether it's from the home or wherever it's from, wherever it came from, we must address it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And in saying that the reason why we need this is because you can look around and see. I talked to so many care providers. I talked to so many people. As I'm commuting every day, people are hurting. Their families are hurting.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They don't know where to go. They sit in hospitals all day. And you have to understand, if it was your family, if was you, if you needed help, as they stated, if this was a medical hospital, be no problem is in a community the zoning laws provides that to be there as the perfect place for a disruptive'",
        "'speaker_3': 'freeway is you can't we can't you guys can't blame us when I say us. The support of this for the homeless in your neighborhood we have get your community together. You go out and you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Engage staff.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You we have we we engage with people. We have the ability to engage. And when we have that engagement, our relationship with people, then you bring hope, wellness and recovery. And that's what we're trying to do here and that's what we're going to do here.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I'm going to make it my business as a recruit and all San Antonio buyers come in. I didn't told the families, we have to deliver on this. I've already put the bullhorn out to say, We got help for you and we're here for you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We have the city with us. We have more people for us than against us. So I beseech you, I beg you, please, we will help you in your neighborhood. We need. This is mandated. Please, by the grace of God.'",

I was in high school, and as a youth, despite the issues that come along with the multi facility at allocation location, I think as a community and citizens allowances, you have to accept that there there's nothing really much we could do besides help these people.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's not it's not the the criminal, the sickness. We have to understand the background and the issues. Me personally, I struggle with depression and I see a psychiatrist for three years and I understand how difficult it could be to reach out and actually speak with people.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I think that as with this mental health facility, it's going to be one step closer to minimizing the mental health crisis and that I'm in for support and allowing my peers, along with my peers, that it will be a great it'll be it'll be a great resource to, um, to the to city to have this facility'",
        "'speaker_5': '. If, despite the issues, we as a community have to understand that we have to help these people and there's nothing much we can really do. Thank you.'",

And those people often can become homeless if you don't have the support you need to move through this devastating illness. It's it's heartbreaking. It's heartbreaking. I've been very lucky because I have a family who supported me.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I have a great job with the city for 17 years, and I loved every minute of it. I think if you ask any professional who I worked with, they would have no idea what I was going through internally during all those years.'",

And it affects, as we've said, one out of five people, one out of four, depending on what statistics you have. I will tell you that this project has been the best thing ever for me because I have never spoken in public'",
        "'speaker_3': 'about my mental illness. It was my deep, dark, nasty little secret. So at that point, I want to tell you, I'm here and I'm kicking and I'm wanting to give congratulations to Councilmember De Andrews, who recently, through his hard work and his willingness to stand up for those in need, which other district members, I'm going to have'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening, honorable mayor and council members. My name is Jill Shannon. I'm director of communications for Stratus Behavioral Health Group. And part of my job in the last month or two has been sending materials to Scott and Plant at the Planning Commission.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so I just wanted to address something real quickly. So a couple of people talked about a petition with 500 names opposing the buck. And I wanted to note that there is also a petition and it's in favor of the program and there's 618 signatures.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And of those 339 live in Long Beach and others live in Bellflower, Carson, Lakewood, South Bay, other nearby cities, we are also I think these are in your materials that they've given you, but these are all the petitions with signatures here.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Also in the materials I sent Scott with 31 support letters and most of those people were not here tonight. So there are a lot of people on the support side that aren't here as well. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Good evening. My name is Laura Diaz, Winterset, and I am a District seven resident just a few blocks from the proposed site. A lot of people have talked about the reactive strategies of this facility. But I also want to talk about the proactive.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We have a lot of.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Families that are in services now that where there is a shortage of psychiatrists that can actually prescribed medication, sometimes people are having to wait four and six weeks to get appointments and this facility will be able to provide those mental health services immediately and also after hours when the surrounding clinics are already closed.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I've had the opportunity to live in a neighborhood where they.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Had an urgent care center.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And never did I imagine that my mom would actually need those services. And when we called around to get services, they weren't able to get her in for about two months to see a psychiatrist. We were able to take her just down the street and she was immediately tended, tended to, and she was able to come home'",
        "'speaker_9': '. And there's been other times where they've had to send people to our home to just assessor, and then she was willing to go with them to go kind of take a time out and take a break from her everyday stress.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I just wanted to point that out and I definitely in support of the facility.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think inexplicably.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hi. My name's Heather Morrison. I'm an eighth district resident and I just wanted to come and speak in support of this facility. This is something. I'm sorry. It's really close to home for me. I have family members who are suffering from mental illness.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And this would be it truly would be a godsend to have something like this on which there isn't anything like this. I know there's not. I know that when you have a family member who is suffering from some kind of mental breakdown and the police have to come and the police have to help you with your family'",
        "'speaker_3': 'member, it really, truly does take them four or 5 hours out of their shift to go and take that family member somewhere far away like Harbor-UCLa, like the young gentleman said, it is terrifying, it is traumatic. And we need so many more mental health resources in this city and everywhere.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I just, I. I plead with you to please support this program. We are the face of mental health and it is so stigmatized. If it were cancer or if it were heart disease, it would be a completely different thing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But it's it's a really hard thing to deal with. And we really need this. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please. My name is Paul Barry.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I worked in mental health for about 30, 35 years. And Long Beach, honorable mayor, members of the city council. Finally, I think I'm it you know, I try to read the paper every day and and I often go straight to the obituaries.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And the reason why is I just find the stories of people's lives interesting. But I also notice that if you read down those obituaries, you'll see that there's usually a request for a donation, usually to a place that provided desperately needed services to the family or to the lost loved one.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'll tell you honestly, I don't necessarily donate.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Because I've read these.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Obituaries, but I realize how familiar.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I am with the organizations that talk about the American Heart Association, the Cancer Society, the Alzheimer's Association. I know the importance of these organizations because I recognize the possibility that anyone with any of them at any time might be providing, though desperately needed services to me, my family, my 15 year old daughter.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The urgent care facility is just like these organizations in one key way. At any time, it might just be providing that desperately needed services to people we know and love. Our own deputy chief of police, Michael Beckman, has said from his own personal experience, no family is immune from mental illness.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Now, I know staff has.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Made it clear over and over again that this is not a homeless program. And I think we can only conclude that the primary objection then to having this facility in the neighborhood is because these people have mental illness and we don't necessarily want them in the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This is a really good night to end that kind of discrimination.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Okay. We are going to go ahead and close the public comment portion of the hearing and let me go ahead and go into public deliberation. So I'm going to start with Councilmember Marengo and we'll go from there.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Mayor. You know, this is one of those agenda items that really puts a face to an issue that's not discussed a lot and not discussed openly. And it's one of those agenda items, too, that puts us as our as your elected officials in a quandary.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'At the same time that we want to do the right thing, we also have the political thing to do and to look at. So before I go on any further, I would like to ask staff if they could put Slide eight up on the screen again.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes. So that we could have a constant view of what it is we're talking about, because I'm going to be bringing up some people that I want to ask questions about the facility, including our our applicant. But right now, if we could have representatives from the police department and the health department to please come to the back'",
        "'speaker_8': '. I have a couple of questions that I would like to ask. Let me know when you're ready. Okay. What about this for the police department first? When a police officer picks up an individual with a mental health crisis.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'What are the steps that a police officer goes through to to help that that individual?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Meaning Honorable Member Members of the Council. Councilmember Yang, if you could just repeat the very first part of that. I missed it when I was sitting down. I apologize.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'When a police officer picks up a person obviously within in a mental crisis. What does a police officer go through to help the individual?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Very good. Thank you for the question. When a police officer encounters somebody that's in a mental crisis, they have a number of well, a couple of different options. Number one.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The one that some people might be familiar with is.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'What is called a hold. And that is when the.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Person who is exhibiting signs of mental illness and meets one of three categories.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Number one being they're a threat or a danger to themselves. Number two is a danger to others. And the third would be gravely disabled if they meet those criteria. The officer has the authority to place a hold on them and take them even against their wishes for psychiatric care.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The second part would be if a person who is exhibiting mental illness but does not meet those criteria as an officer is able to try and coax the person into voluntarily seeking services and transporting them to an available place for for such care.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And oftentimes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In Long Beach, the Met team or mental evaluation team is utilized to help facilitate.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That. The another option would be if the person was exhibiting mental illness. And that was, you know, maybe a reason for our dispatch out there does not meet the criteria for a hold and does not wish to seek voluntary services.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If that person has committed a crime, the officer can take that person to jail for that crime.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And that may be a fix for the situation at hand. However.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Depending on what the nature of the crime was, likely won't have a long term solution. Lastly, absent any crime being committed, meeting the criteria for a 5150 hold voluntary service or a voluntary are self admit. A lot of times the officers just have to walk away because there's nothing that they can legally do.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So on a call like that, what would be the typical amount of time that an officer spends with an individual like that? Or let me rephrase it another way, being that this facility is not here, where do officers take individuals with this kind of of a sickness in terms of being able to drop them off somewhere to'",
        "'speaker_8': 'get some get some help?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Typically, we we can take them to a number of different places. Generally, we take them to Harbor Harbor-UCLa medical center.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We can also take them to. As was referenced.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Earlier tonight by one of the speakers, a community hospital. Places like that, oftentimes places like that have.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They're busy and they have difficulty finding a bed and they take up air.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Space. Having a place like Harbor-UCLa with the size of care that they have for psycho psychiatric services is good, although they're overwhelmed as well. For people that have insurance.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'On the voluntary stuff, we can we can seek out those different places a lot of times that are outside.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Of the city and will actually drive quite, quite a ways to.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Get them the help that they need, even if it's.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Outside the city. So regardless, it takes up a considerable amount of time.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So what officer is in this type of a call? Are they are they on serve the currently on duty serving as individuals even though they have to drive, say, 20 miles to go to a to another facility?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah. They're, uh, they're out of service for the duration of time that it takes to transport that person, to care for their belongings, to fill out the appropriate paperwork.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And to turn them over to staff at the facility that they've taken them to when they're ready to receive them. And it could range from a minimum as a couple of hours from one October and could be as long as six.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. Now, in terms of training police, are police officers or do you have a special unit of police officers who are specially trained in this area? Or or do all and or do all officers receive training in recognizing a mental health issue?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Our police officers get trained in dealing with individuals. Some police officers have a higher level of training. Recently, there was some legislation passed that required field training officers to undergo higher amount of training in dealing with the mentally ill.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And in Long Beach, we had the mental evaluation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Team, as mentioned, where we have six officers that are paired up with clinicians.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'From L.A. County. And just that is that is all they do. They don't respond to they're not dispatched to calls for service, but they respond in the field to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Calls or assist other officers on calls where.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Mental illness is an issue. And just by virtue of their assignment, they have a tremendous amount of experience and are also put through additional training as well.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Chief, for the health department. When there are people who are experiencing a mental breakdown or think that they are, what's where do they go normally? Is there a place for them to go? And if they do come to see the health department through regular hours, what's what's your process, whether you do.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So in excuse me, in terms of the in terms of our facility, we don't provide direct mental health treatment and mental health services for the city of Long Beach, comes through L.A. County mental health. So if you are coming in and lower income and are looking for different services, otherwise people could go to their own private providers'",
        "'speaker_12': '. But we as a city do not provide direct mental health service. The Department of Mental Health, the rate is approximately 2 to 3 weeks if you have not already participated in their service previously. So if you have a crisis, you're probably going to go to the emergency room because you don't know where else to go.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And then you would work with the Department of Mental Health to get an appointment, an assessment and move through their process.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. There's been a little bit of discussion and some, I guess, discussion about the number of mental health facilities in Long Beach. Can you clarify that in regards to how many do exists or not exist in Long Beach?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'You know, we heard the number tonight is 14. We've been racking our brains as to where a number 14 comes from and we're not really sure. So we we will look. But I think what that may be, the Department of Mental Health hosts, they do have outpatient sites within the city of Long Beach, and there are some'",
        "'speaker_12': 'other nonprofit providers and for profit providers. But the number 14 seems high to us. But we will look and will further fact check.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'There has been some discussion about the connection between mental health issues and homelessness. Can you address that issue? That that that question?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So many, many of those who are homeless have mental health have mental health needs. So between substance use and mental health, there are concerns for those who are homeless. However, many of those who have mental health are not homeless.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So it goes both directions. So I think that, you know, as we talk about those who are homeless and the service and the set of services that are available, the Department of Mental Health co-locate with us at at the Multi-Service Center.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So they are directly there. And when someone comes into the front door of the multi-service center, we're absolutely sure ability we have the ability to connect them. As you know, the multi-service center is closed at 5:00 during that on weekdays and not available for on weekends.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So as a when someone is in crisis, then this behavioral health center would be the the urgent crisis center. It would be the space that they could go to be sort of de-escalate the crisis and then be able to attach to Department of Mental Health Services from there.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. Thank you very much. If I could have the applicant, please come to the podium. They have a couple of questions I'd like to ask.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'There's a lot of discussion, as you know, a lot of concerns about individuals who are coming in to the facility and how they exit. The amount of time we spend there. Can you walk us through a typical, maybe even an atypical situation where a person walks into a facility and take it from A to Z, from entry'",
        "'speaker_8': 'to release for a patient?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Certainly. So they walk in there voluntarily coming to the facility.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Just so that we can be clear that the facility map is upstairs. I mean, upstairs on screen. Yes. Could you like say they're coming through the switchboard where they come in? Through our home. They come in through 30 seconds.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'What's what's the process?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. So the the walk in component of the facility is on Long Beach Boulevard. And if individuals come by their own accord, there's a bus line there. There's a place, obviously, to park. Typically, though, they're brought there. They're brought by a friend or relative.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And they would come in, wait to have an appointment, to be assessed, to be assessed by our clinical staff. And again, we have a nurse, we have a mental health clinician and we have a psychiatrist. And there's an initial determination made of the level of acuity.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So the severity of the symptoms that individual is experiencing first, the assessment is, are they in a crisis? Do they have a mental health condition? Assuming they do, then there's a look to see how severe it is, and that informs the clinical team as to how long it's going to take to resolve that issue.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So the decision is made whether that can be done quickly. They remain in that voluntary section, the quiet crisis walk in section that's there. That's again, off of Long Beach Boulevard. So that front entrance there, if it's determined that they are higher acuity, that they're going to need more intensive treatment over a longer period than they would'",
        "'speaker_1': 'likely go on to the adolescent, the child unit or the adult unit. And they can do that on a voluntary basis as well. They receive the services and again, it is a service to reduce the crisis. So they're stabilized, but it's also to facilitate their transition back into the community, to alignment with resources when they go back'",
        "'speaker_1': 'home or back into the community so that that stabilization is lasting. It's not just at the point where they're able to leave, but it's lasting. So they don't come back the next day, the next week, the next month.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And there was some discussion as well in terms of some individuals making regular visits or going on a regular basis to this to this facility. And the concern, obviously, is, is that whether people are looking at this as a as a drug rehab facility or a substance abuse facility.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So can you describe pretty much what what you do provide in this facility when somebody comes in and you dispense meds or anything like that? So thank.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You. It's a great question that was brought up by several individuals. So to be clear, this is not a substance abuse treatment program. That's part of that initial assessment. And we'll work with law enforcement who all the other agencies that will utilize the program to know that we don't do medical detox.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So that's one of the initial looks with just somebody that's going to go into withdrawal or they're going to need that kind of medical treatment. The program is really not designed for that. As has been said, there's obviously a lot of prevalence of substance abuse disorders among people that also live with a mental health condition.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we do what's called co-occurring disorders. We make sure there's a referral into substance abuse treatment if that's needed. But we don't deal with somebody who's on a high level that they'd be going into withdrawals and needing detox.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I don't know if that answers your question completely, but that's a good differentiation.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The the police chief sister chief mentioned that when an officer is dealing with such a case, they're usually off line. If they have to go travel far distances to go into to take this individual to a treatment center at your facility, what's the regular time that a an officer or any other person would spend with this individual'",
        "'speaker_8': 'once he or she is taken into the facility?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So what would occur if they're bringing an individual and it's typically on an involuntary basis and that's where off the parking lot we have a separate secured entrance to the shuttle that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Would be entering through Elm.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. And coming into the lot there. There is a separate security entrance into the adolescent unit and into the adult unit. Our clinicians would do a an immediate assessment, again, ruling out this is somebody that has a physical injury where they really need to go get medical treatment in an emergency room.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Are they at a level of intoxication? That's an issue. We rule out whether they are inappropriate for the program. If they're accepted, that usually is decision made in ten or 15 minutes. We actually have a location within the facility that the officers can go and work out.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So there's actually a station. They can come into the facility, wait for that determination and, you know, use a computer, use the phone. So we have that set up for them as well. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So in that area off of Elm, is is it gated? Is it fenced off? Is there a automatic gate that would be opening and closing? What's the what's see what's the likelihood of of someone going in through that backdoor to that parking lot late at night or anything like that?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, part of the conditions is a increase in the elevation of the walls around the perimeter of the the parking area. So that's to decrease the ability to view into the facility in respect for the neighbors. But it is open access to the parking lot.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We don't have a plan to out a gate, but one of the conditions that is being asked of us is to have 24 hour security in the parking lot. So we will have a security staff position in the parking lot at all times.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Now, we talked about also they walk ins so people take themselves in and then we have after hours accepting of of patients, what would you described to be your peaks, your your your highest point of getting patients in there?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Now, you mentioned 30 per day. What times what day would be your peaks?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, I can only speak to our experience in other programs in other areas, and there is some difference between them. So part of the process of opening this program will to be to learn what those peak times are.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But it is typical that most come in during the day and it's infrequent that somebody comes in after hours. Those are usually individuals that are on a 51, 50 after hours. It's infrequent that a voluntary individual come in, but we'll see that as well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And the peak time, the peak days are usually more on the weekends than there are during the week, more in the afternoon and early evening than in the morning or earlier part of the day. So there's those kind of trends.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. Now, there was also mentioned I think you mentioned it earlier during your presentation, that the average stays 4 to 6 hours and then they're allowed to leave and get in voluntarily if they wish to leave. But if they want to stay more, they can.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It's up to them or I was that determined.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. So it's a clinical decision made as to when the individual has resolved their crisis, where they're safe to return to the community. And again, that's with supports and linkage to other services to the extent they need them so that that stabilization can be ongoing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You asked earlier about, you know, the the outliers and those are the individuals that stayed the full 24 hours. That's somebody who's having a tough time resolving. And out of those groups, those are the ones that may end up having to go to a psychiatric hospital.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They're not able to stabilize at that point. In that situation, we would arrange for the bed. They would be transported by ambulance. As the representative from the Department Mental Health spoke earlier, that's only about 6 to 8% of the individuals that come through the program.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'These programs are highly effective at stabilizing, which is what they are, of course, they're designed to do to avoid individuals having to be hospitalized.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I guess there's a definition that that I need at this point in terms of stabilize stabilization of a of a patient. What point determines whether an individual is stabilized or not when I guess when someone comes in highly agitated or in crisis and you provide the service, at what point in that process do you determine a'",
        "'speaker_8': 'person has been stabilized? What are the indicators to you that a person's ready to be released?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, it's basically the reduction in the symptoms that they were experiencing that put them into crisis or whether that's depression, anxiety, thought disorders. You know, mental health takes many different forms. And for an individual to come into treatment, they have to be experiencing a heightened level of those symptoms.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So whether it's through medication, whether it's just time they're working with our counseling staff, whether it's talking to a peer counselor, somebody that had that lived experience that can identify and communicate effectively. With them. We bring all of those resources to support the individual.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So that basically is it. It's a reduction in those symptoms where the individual is saying, I feel better, I feel safe to go home again.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Now, when they're released, is there a plan for release? Is there a what they call it the soft and to soft? And I forget the term that was.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Us, the warm handoff.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Warm hand.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There, but it's off to feel. Yeah, and I can't emphasize that enough. And that certainly is a part of addressing the concerns of the community, that getting them home, getting them back to a safe place is is part of what we do.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It is not just just charging them out the front door. And that would start with transportation, getting them there. And again, typically, there's family members that will come and provide that. If there's no other resources, we will have a vehicle.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We will take them where they need to go.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Now, one of the conditions, as I read through it, is that the that the Planning Commission put in, there was an 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. open hours for walk ins, and then it's closed down until the following morning, except for those that are brought in by public safety personnel.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I would guess.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Actually it will accept voluntary clients all the time so they can still come. It's just that front entrance off of Long Beach Boulevard that would be closed outside those hours. And they didn't the planning commission didn't determine those hours we just defined.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's how we would expect to operate. We didn't know it was actually going to become part of the conditions. We're fine with it. As you asked earlier, we'll actually discover, well, what are the peak times that may be that we say, well, nobody's coming in, you know, from eight in the morning till nine.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Let's start there walking cetera at nine. The advantage of the walking center is that it has a waiting room. And so when individuals come in there, if we're at capacity, they can wait to be seen. And so it gives us that flexibility to manage the capacity of the 18 that we have that we can't exceed at any'",
        "'speaker_1': 'point in time. So when you stop the the walking center, you lose that that waiting room and you're limited just to the 18 clients at that point.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So the doors that are Long Beach will arc will always be open for somebody to walk in.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You know, that's what will only be open during it. And so if there's that after eight.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So they would have to come in through Elm if they wanted to. If somebody wants to walk in.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's correct. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I have an issue with that, but we'll discuss that later. When it comes to releases as well, there's, I guess, a rule or a law that says a person can only be held in their facility for up to 24 hours or 23.5 night.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'If an individual comes in at, let's say, 9:00, right after we checked him or herself in after 4 hours, says, you know, I'm good to go or or the assessment is made that that person's in is free to go and it's past midnight with that person leave, walk out.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'What's what's a release process for that for that individual after midnight?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Again, it's that same process of making sure they're safe and have a place to go. If that individual has their parent coming and picking them up and the parent wants to come and pick them up at two in the morning, we'll release them to their parent, to a family member.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Would it be a warm handoff? It would be to say there's a door go.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'No, we will escort them to the car in the parking lot. They have to show up before they would leave and we would make.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Sure you have security.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There. Absolutely. But to also answer your question, we give them the I thought you were going to ask is if somebody came in at 9:00 and it's 9:00 the next night and we determine they're safe to go, but it's 9:00 at night, they can stay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So think of it as you've gone to the doctor, you've completed treatment. You go back and wait in the waiting room. You're no longer getting treatment, but you're waiting for somebody to pick you up. They can stay that night and wait for somebody to come in the morning.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Let's go to the other scenario. A person comes in at midnight and the 24 hours is midnight.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's the same thing. They can wait till the next morning if they work.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'In the morning so that they can see an additional 8 hours. So they'll be there 8 hours?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah, they're technically not. They've completed treatment. So the 24 hours limits the amount, the duration of when they can complete treatment. But if at that point we've determined, hey, you're ready to go home, but why not you? You have the option of staying until the next morning, until transportation can be more convenient.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They have that ability. The state allows that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay, stay there for just a bit, obviously. I want to thank everybody who came up and speak tonight because I know you took a lot of time from your from your home, from your families. You probably skipped dinner.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You probably missed happy hour. I know I did. But yeah, that's that's that's something else to be told. But I really want to commend everybody who came out here to speak because it's very important that the city council gets all the information that we possibly can on both sides of the issue, because we need to know to'",
        "'speaker_8': 'to address what the concerns are. And we can then make a determination as to which way the city council wants to go. So I want to I want to thank everybody who showed up today to talk about this, including the the person from the village, the the child in the village.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I want to thank you for for being here. And I know there was another young man who was here as well that shows commitment and it shows a passion for being here and and passion for the issue at hand that we're dealing with now.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I also want to to say that I had many a meeting with our department, services department and staff, Amy Borek, and we hash things out. We knew she I brought many concerns up and she addressed that and she put some conditions on there with the with 30, 35, 35 special and standard conditions that I think you've agreed'",
        "'speaker_8': 'to, if you don't mind. Right now, I'm going to mention a few more because I really would like to see if you if they workable for you at the present time. Condition 11 says well under condition 11. I would also like to add the condition that this deal with security that there be two security guards, especially from'",
        "'speaker_8': 'dusk to two to the morning, only because if we are going to be accepting individuals during those hours, I would like to assure the community that there's that there's security out there to ensure that these individuals get help, that they come into the facility and and they get the help.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But there's someone out there vigilant for these individuals who are requesting to come in.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. So just so I'm clear, you know, the condition that was added was for security guard to be outside the facility on the grounds that was in addition to the two security guards we already have. So we will be having three security guards total, 24 seven.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That that's a good that it's good to hear. I really like that. Also, I'm concerned about the openness of the parking lot and the ability for someone to or even kids, let's say, gives like open spaces like parking lot, rollerblading gate.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Anybody rollerblade.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Anymore?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I haven't seen a rollerblading in a long time anyway. Or yoga board, skating or whatever, jumping up and down doing the tricks. So I'm concerned about the openness of that, especially into the neighborhood in Elm. Would you consider or adding a being a fenced off area or the wall you say you're going to raise it and perhaps'",
        "'speaker_8': 'a sliding gate that would provide more security to that facility to to have the neighbors feel safe, safer. It's more secure that the individuals are not going to be wandering off the grounds and into the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, my first reaction to that is if that's the concern that there's people in the parking lot and coming in because there's not a fence, then I need to get a different security guard because they're not doing their job.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. It's not a big area and somebody should be able to to manage that. And I'm also I don't know how a gate would work for that all. I would answer that. Thank you. I don't know how you know, with the patrol cars coming with the gate, I don't know how that would work, but it doesn't seem'",
        "'speaker_1': 'like it would be convenient for people coming and going. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Is there also an assurance that that parking lot is not going to. Be used for special events such as a buy me a fundraiser or say a taco truck, moon bounce, that type of thing. I mean, I'm not I'm not saying that you can't.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But I would say that if if there's if you're going to have one, I would like for you to apply for an occasional event permit on a sweep through the city so that we can look at it and determine whether it's it's a permissible event that you can have.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We'd be happy to do that. We only have one event planned, and that's when I hope you come to. That's our grand opening.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We'll get an all AP for that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Also, it's.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It's it's a new facility and it's going to be something that that is obviously an unknown event right now that we don't know until it opens. So I would also like to add a condition in there that we will review the the the the facility in one year that we look at it and evaluate it in terms'",
        "'speaker_8': 'of the conditions that are put in there, that the you are biting through the cup and that they're all there. And we will review this at the end. When you go into planning commission, they review it and then they they determine whether we can continue with the with the process or not.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Is that good? Is that okay with you?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, I would respond kind of asking why that's needed. I mean, the my understanding of is there's 35.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Conditions and added a couple more so.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, but we have to abide by those not a year from now all the time. And, you know, we are going to have to answer to the city and to the neighbors if there's a feeling like we've not adhere to any of them.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Our commitment is to do that. We're certainly happy to come and meet and talk about it again. What I just want to be sure of is that this is not a one year cup and then we have to reapply for it, if it is my understanding.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But we have to come back and talk about this in a year. We're more than happy to do that. We're happy to do that at any time.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And you brought up the neighbors. Maybe one last point. Would you be willing to add a hotline for it, for the neighbors, for anybody who's out there, a direct line that goes into a a comment line, let's say, where they might a neighbor may a resident might say, I'm seeing something out here.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It's coming from your facility. I want to lodge a a concern or a complaint. Would you be willing to add a line like that?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Absolutely. Actually, we want them to call the facility. We will have a manager 24 seven and we will have the the that person take those calls so that hopefully we can address things right away.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. Now, the reason the reason I asked about the the review in one year is that if there's one thing I can't stand and it's already been proven is when I have a bad operator or a bad neighbor, I'm not afraid to go after that operator and kick them out.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We did that a couple of weeks ago with a bad operator who needed to who needed to go away, where we revoke their cup and we revoke their license to operate. And hopefully this is not going to happen with you.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But I, I just need to say that because it's important that the residents and constituents know that we got their back, that they're going to be their concerns are going to be addressed, and that we are very concerned for their self safety and their welfare.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I want to assure that when it comes to the to this facility, as I said, as I said from the outset, you know, there's the political thing to do and there's a right thing to do. And with these conditions with these conditions, I want to go ahead and make the motion to approve the facility.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But under the conditions of the CLP, with additional conditions that I added there, and I would hope my colleagues will also join me in that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There's a motion to to deny the appeals and to move forward with the with the facility is. And there's a second on that motion. Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Before before we go, because I want to make sure that I did it right to the city attorney.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, one more.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Question and is to the city attorney. What's the possibility of us at this point approving the copy but not approving the location? Is that possible?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'No, that would not be possible tonight.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So can you clarify I know I said a lot of things here. In my words with Blair.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I misspoke. Clarify the motion.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Mr. Mayor, members of the City Council, Councilmember Ewing, I just wanted to confirm a couple of things. You had asked for a dedicated 24 hour telephone hotline. Yes. That would be responded to that the neighbors could call in.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is that is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You had asked for a within 12 months of the occupancy of the facility to have a hearing in front of the planning commission to review compliance with those conditions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Correct? Correct.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I just want to state we don't give one year copies, copies run with the land. So this would be a an opportunity for us to make. Sure that those conditions are compliant. And if we do need to modify the hours of operation because of high points or low points, that would be an opportunity for us to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'consider that. Is that accurate, sir?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Councilmember, help me. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So many serves. And then you had asked about a special events permit and whether a special event permit would be necessary. Is that a condition you would like us to craft? Yes. Where they would be required to have a special event permit if they were to hold an event over a certain size.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We just had staff count and I think there's about 67 or 70 parking spaces already at the facility. So we would propose a condition that they would be required to to get a special event permit through the Office of Special Events.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If they were doing a special event activity at the facility, that would involve more than 75 people. Is that acceptable?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That works for me.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'My last question for you is that we have an existing condition, number 11, that requires the operator to maintain at least one outdoor security guard at all times when the facility is open to receive patients. I understand to the applicant, that means 24 hours a day.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Council member Did you want one security guard on the exterior or two security guards on the exterior?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well, at this point, I think one would be sufficient. But again, if there's an uptick in complaints, that that would be revisited.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Understood. So there is. Mr. Applicant. There are two inside, is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There are two inside. They're not restricted from going outside. If there's a need. For people outside. They can. They can help outside.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Like an indoor cat and an outdoor cat.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Indoor dog, outdoor dining.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay, so as I understand it, there are three security guards, but one is clearly defined as being responsible for the exterior 24 hours a day. And then the other ones can certainly aid that security guard as needed.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. Then I can withdraw that that comment.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. All right. So I believe, Mr. City, Attorney, we have three conditions that we would add to the motion. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So that's correct. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Austin.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much. And I want to probably second this motion. I want to thank all of the residents. Will come down in in speaking, in favor or in opposition. It is always healthy to get feedback. Believe it or not, a public comment is my favorite part of the evening coming to city council meetings because I learn'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so much from our public. I think this urgent care center dealing with mental health will help expand our capacity for health care. Our network in our city. And the impact will be positive on our neighborhoods and not negative.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I want to belabor what has already been said about many mental health professionals before.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Us that have.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Extolled the merits of why this is necessary. And I certainly will agree with that. I speak from experience dealing with family members who have had a mental health crisis. I think it would have been very, very beneficial to to us to have this facility when that both those episodes have occurred in the past.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If I think it was mentioned that 10% of the the those participating or who will be benefiting for the services of this this facility are homeless. And that's unfortunate. But I think the other number that we need to pay attention to is the 90% that do have homes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right. And where are they going? They're your neighbors. They're your family members in and into that. With that point, I think, again, this facility is desperately needed and I think it will go a long way to improving the quality of life for for for residents throughout the city will improve our ability to deliver public safety resources and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'improve our capacity for for health care overall. And and I would just say that if this was a dialysis center, I don't think we'd have this conversation. If this was a medical marijuana facility, we wouldn't be having this kind of conversation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So, again, I'm happy to support it. And I want to just take my colleague, Roberto Durango for for standing up and being courageous in making this motion. Obviously, this is not going to be something that's going to be met with joy from everybody.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I think the greater good of the city will benefit for having this. So thank you very much and I'll be supportive. Thank you. Councilman Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. I definitely want to say how proud I am of our council and our staff. Kelly Colby, Doug Halbert, so many people that have really pushed this conversation. They deserve a round of applause because they do. This conversation, sir, I believe you can sit down.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I don't think there'll be. Unless somebody asks you to stand back and have a seat in this conversation on how we handle mental health is a conversation that for so many people, we look at people that might be homeless and say, Gosh, why are they homeless if they only could have gotten help somewhere?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So this is not about how many people we're serving that are homeless. It's about how many people were saving from becoming homeless. This is about being able today to take a vote on something that could save somebody's life tomorrow.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I want to say thank you to everybody that shared their personal stories of personally struggling through mental illness. Kathy, I really appreciated hearing from you. It's hard for people to share that. Mental health is something that we don't talk about, like we talk about cancer or anything else.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And because of that, it is that much harder for ourselves, for our coworkers, for our family members to find a resource because we're not talking about it. We all want to say, well, I know somebody five or move that struggled with that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You know, I grew up in a household where my I had mental health issues all around. My biological mom was murdered. So they struggled with mental illness and her relationship. My adopted mom passed away in 2009 because she committed suicide.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so I've struggled with my own challenges in dealing with that. So I'm really proud of our team today for doing this because it's a good step in the right direction and it makes us talk about it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I know. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. And I know it's not supposed to be the cool thing to do to cry behind the dais, but I want you guys today after this vote to talk about mental health. Right. And if there's a tough conversation and someone seems like they're not connecting some dots, that it's really important that you talk about it and'",
        "'speaker_7': 'find out how you can get them some help to continue to talk about it so that we can be healthy all the way around. So thank you, everybody. And I.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Of course, support this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We're going to go and go to to a video here. I just want to just try to wrap up a conversation. I want to thank everyone that came out and spoke today. I also want to echo the comments that Councilmember Pearce said, particularly people that shared their their own stories around mental illness.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And it is an illness just like so many other illnesses that are physical and that we all deal with every single day. And certainly I also I do appreciate I think it's important for us to all understand that all folks, even those folks that had concerns, I mean, there are that people have legitimate concerns.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'People have sometimes issues around their neighborhood and want to ensure that their families are safe. And I think we should all appreciate everyone's concerns. And to them, I think I know it's our commitment as a city is to ensure that we have safe spaces and we're going to do everything we can to ensure this facility, as is'",
        "'speaker_1': 'as intended by the upwards, is a is a safe, welcoming and healthy place for everyone. And I do also just want to note that one thing that makes me incredibly proud of of this this council in the last few months especially, is that everyone has taken an opportunity to lead and try to address the challenges around mental'",
        "'speaker_1': 'illness and around homelessness. Remind our room, remind us that Councilman Andrews is working on building what will be a fairly comprehensive and large mental health facility on Long Beach Boulevard in the six district that he welcomed with open arms and work with me.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'John, I think it's important to note that that councilor, Vice Mayor, Vice Mayor Richardson saw a need for a permanent year round shelter opportunity as well as transitional housing. And in North Long Beach, we are now going to have that have that facility as well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It was only a few years ago where Community Hospital, which is currently in the fourth District, also changed its model to ensure that they were able to do more of this work. And it was a difficult decision at the time as well to allow that work to happen at community hospital.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But the council also did the right thing then as well. And so this isn't a challenge for any one part of the city. I think it's it's incumbent if we're going to help our families and our neighbors, because these are our neighbors and our family members.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And if we're going to help them, that it has to be the whole city that lifts up people. And I think at the end of it, at the end of the day, I think we all know in our hearts that it's the right thing to do.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I just I want to I want to I want to thank I want to thank all of you for office, for your hard work. And we will continue to do this work. And one last project that didn't get a lot of mention, but I want to also thank both Councilman Austin and Councilmember Gringa.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Just last week, we opened up an affordable housing complex, a unit on the border of the seventh and sixth District for people for a young adults that have developmental disabilities. And and the reason I bring this up is it's the kind of it's the kind of project that sometimes a lot of cities fight and don't want to'",

Councilmember Austin, in your district, I believe, and in Councilmember Durango, right across the street, I believe, from your district as well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I want to thank everyone for being a part of the solution. And councilmembers, please cast your vote.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'cities of Los Angeles and San Diego during their studies. Heavy vehicles such as trucks and busses put more, far more stress on our pavement than does a typical car. In fact, pavement engineers have found that one trash truck pickup exerts 9000 times the stress on pavement than does a typical SUV.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This, you know, this waste, this wastes taxpayer dollars by damaging the very, very roads that we're attempting and elected to repair.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'With misery.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And undermining and undermining our investments in our bike infrastructure and our walkable pedestrian improvements and in our efforts to make create a more livable city. Many of our communities, many of our communities are already overburdened with with air pollution and air quality problems as well.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Overlapping truck routes can also contribute to higher levels of pollution. While city requires private haulers to have CNG trucks, these trucks are not zero emission contrary to people's belief, and release significant carbon dioxide into the into the environment.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Overlapping routes also contribute to significant noise with trash trucks, industrial engines, machine arms and backup alerts disrupting our neighborhoods multi time multiple times a week. Here's a real example of my district in the neighborhoods across from Highland Park.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hey, boss. 1/2. Can we get. I'm hearing a lot of noise from outside, so I don't know. Someone from our staff and someone close the doors. Is there someone from the staff.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I can barely hear? I'll just proceed.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So here's a real example. In my district, a neighborhood adjacent to Highland Park, across from Horton Park, where we have a number of multifamily apartments anchored by two shopping centers to the north and the south. There are seven different trash companies in just a few blocks, less than a third of a mile.'",
        "'speaker_6': '12 different companies, 12 different contracts with these seven companies. And let's say, conservatively, that these hog haulers pick up waste twice a week. Some of them do more, but let's say conservatively, only twice a week. That would mean an estimated two dozen trips just in this small neighborhood every week.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The pavement stress of that, you know, of the overlapping is like having a quarter million SUV trips each week in terms of wear and tear on our streets, in terms of air quality. Those 24 trips are equivalent to burning 32 of coal per mile, and some of them are hauling that trash as far as Orange County or'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Sun Valley. And in terms of quality of life, those particular neighborhoods are disrupted by loud trucks pretty much every day of the week. This is not just a public safety issue and a quality of life issue. It's also an environmental issue.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Long Beach is one of the few large cities that currently doesn't have a zero waste plan. And while I know it's been in discussion, it's important that we leverage the commercial waste sector, divert and recycle as much as it possibly can.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Right now, the private recycling rate is less than 20%, according to reports. Trash company submitted to the city as recently as 2013, while at the same time a residential program which is managed here in our city is exceeding state requirements, with a 74% diversion rate, 74% for residential, less than 20% reporting on commercial.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's a dramatic difference. The city requires private haulers to provide recycling at no additional cost. However, surveys concert conducted by Cal State, Long Beach and UC students, UC Santa Cruz students and the low recycling rate reported to our city signal that not all of our businesses and our apartments have recycling options available, and private haulers are sending'",
        "'speaker_6': 'over 100,000 tons to landfills each year in the city of Long Beach. This means our businesses are losing out on the savings that they could get by increasing recycling, which will allow them to significantly reduce how much trash the trash pick up they actually need.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The low recycling rate will keep us from our goals and also emit greenhouse gases, undermining all the good work Long Beach has done to curb our emissions and to fight climate change. Most of the businesses in apartments, food and green waste ended up in the landfill in lots there instead of going to hungry people or being composted'",
        "'speaker_6': 'into new soil. And because of this rotting food and waste, landfills are the second largest cause of methane, which is the second largest contributor contributor to climate change. That's how it's all connected as a city. There are recent state laws that we need to get ahead of and we need to be able to lead as a city'",
        "'speaker_6': '. Long Beach has been an environmental leader. We can do better by holding the private sector accountable to the same high standards that our great programing and education that our city provides with our residential waste system. But we're not alone.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The state of California, according to AB 341, has a state waste reduction goal of 75% by 2020. AB 1826 mandates that organic waste recycling services for businesses and large apartments by 2019 and for most other businesses by 2021.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There's also a state mandate to get organic waste like food and yard trimmings out of the landfill and either compost it or get what's edible to people who need it. A study from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that waste and recycling refuse collection ranks fifth among the most dangerous industries nationwide.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And because of the race to the bottom in terms of pricing, pressure is placed on haulers to cut corners on basics like safety equipment, vehicle maintenance and training. Working conditions at certain in certain certain environments are unsafe. And for, for instance, in recent years, Long Beach has suffered a partial amputation and a fatality while on the job'",
        "'speaker_6': '. And because there's not the city of Long Beach, but, you know, in the city of Long Beach with our commercial waste program and, you know, but there's an opportunity to for these jobs to become careers if they're safe, family sustaining.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And, you know, and, you know, if they continue to maintain high standards. The problems we outlined are not going to create themselves. We have to build the. Systems to make the commercial sector cleaner and safer while placing Long Beach on course to improve the quality of life in our neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There's only one way to address overlap in truck routes, and that's with the zone collection system. Using an exclusive franchise, the study. We should study this system to see how we can make it work for the city of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Other cities like Anaheim, Seattle, San Jose, Santa Clarita, West Hollywood all have this type of system. San Diego, Glendale, Pasadena, Burbank are all exploring this system in this type of system, instead of every different building, having a separate set up, a separate contract with a separate waste holler.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There will be a limited number of haulers per area. So using our same example of the neighborhood adjacent to Halton Park, a conservative twice a week average, this could mean going from two dozen truck trips per week to just two truck trips a week.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Let's say four truck trips a week. This means more efficient routing safer, more consistent trash days, air and air and air quality and noise quality improvements, and genuinely, generally a safer, healthier neighborhood for both renters and homeowners alike.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'In this system, we can drive our recycling goals, work with our businesses to increase their recycling, roll out compost collection to those who want it or require to have it. Many cities like San Diego, New York, Los Angeles have found through studies that this would be the best type of system to meet their zero waste goals.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The city of San Jose saw the commercial recycling rate triple after they adopted this type of system. Like I mentioned earlier, this can be dangerous. And this, you know, the drive to the bottom could create low paying jobs, but they can also be sanitation careers under the right conditions.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'These type of jobs could provide a young person from a neighborhood with the means to support a family, even if he didn't go to college and establish him as a local hero and part of people's everyday lives, doing important work to keep our city clean, our streets safe.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'll give you an example. When I was a kid in Alabama, I knew my local school bus driver. His name was Odie McCracken. And, you know, while he had a funny name, people respected him. Everybody knew their driver.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And the reality is, simply put, driving was and still can be a very respectable trait. And right now, an 18 year old currently currently has to navigate a number of different companies where we are in a position as a city to create a direct pipeline.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I would rather see our 18 year olds, our young adults being assisted to have to find a skill tree to provide for the family rather than being left on their own to to sort of navigate these systems on their own and slip out a slip out of the pipeline.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And with an exclusive franchise system, we can explore how to work with companies through the request for proposals process to create a pipeline through educational institutions like our current truck driving training program at Lobby City College for a local training and jobs pipeline.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'By the time the new system would be in place five years from now, this could be a $60,000 a year job based on existing what people are paid today. Five years from now, this could be $60,000 a year jobs with benefits and retirement.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Additionally, studies have shown that recycling can create about ten times as many jobs as disposal. And there are also opportunities for small businesses and community organizations, including women and minority owned businesses, to subcontract and partner with haulers for things like e-waste or community outreach.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'In this in this type of system, the city has more tools to keep haulers accountable for these good quality jobs, for recycling and composting, and for high standards for community service. Haulers don't just risk losing 1 to 1 contract if they underperform or if they're not doing a good job, they could lose an entire zone.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So they won't. So they are financially inclined to make the system work and work well in order to keep that business. It's a great system for haulers too, because they can save money by being more efficient. Good. Good terms on loans have more certainty in the marketplace, and most haulers that do business in Long Beach have have'",
        "'speaker_6': 'multiple contracts in other cities. In this type of system, the city can also cap dramatic rate increases and negotiate with haulers to have transparent, fair and stable rates. So who do we think will? Who do you think will get a better deal?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'A local coffee shop negotiating on their own for weekly collection rate or working together with the entire zone on behalf of thousands of customers. Simply put, small guys don't have the buying power to drive down rates or achieve economies of scale like they could if they were if they were put together like the health care exchange.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If they negotiate together, you can get a better rate. Experts have found consistently that types of debt, this type of system that we're considering, could stabilize customer rates. In our current type of system, there's no baseline rate. There's no consistent price for service the way that there is for gasoline or milk.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'L.A. County cities with exclusive franchise and waste systems have been able to protect customer rate payers with an average rate increase by less than a cumulative 9% from 2000 to 2010 and real dollars compared to dramatic increase increases in the industry costs.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This was in a study of over 30 exclusive franchise cities in L.A. County. Eight exclusive franchise cities, including Beverly Hills Salt, saw rates decrease from 22 to 2010. Rates remain stable for exclusive franchise customers because contracts prevent haulers from dramatic rate rate and could increased rates.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Haulers submit competitive bids from the City Review and approve, and the city negotiates rates and potential increases in their contracts. Like example fixing it to the rate of inflation. Long term exclusive agreements allow haulers more security efficiency, access to low cost financing, the ability to amortize costs, helping to continue to keep rates low.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we should be in a position to lead in our city and not follow. We should be able to get ahead of the requirements in terms of organics collection, diversion, recycling, and leverage this to create real job opportunities.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'A vision for a cleaner, more responsible system. Haulers will put pen to paper to innovate and create programs and benefits in order to win our contract and win our business, such as establishing job training programs or working with our food recovery groups to rescue edible food because before it gets thrown away.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'A great example of an opportunity that I know means a lot to some of our fellow council members is around food recovery. We've got some great organizations here in Long Beach already doing this great work, but there's even more work to be done.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The most conservative estimates of what what's possible when it comes to food recovery is that we can recover over 620,000 meals per year if we were able to recover 20% of our food waste and give it to hungry families as laid out by SB 1383, it can mean over 8 million meals per year.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And that's that's just on the commercial side. It's more more than enough to feed every family on Long Beach. Three meals a day. 20%. So 20% of the states estimate that nearly a quarter of Long Beach commercial waste is food waste.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So, you know, that's where that metric comes from. So so let's let's take a minute and just, you know, have a conversation about setting the record straight and distinguishing between the myths that have been out there and the facts.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So first, one myth has come up and I received a lot of emails and phone calls with a lot of just mistruths and facts out there. So I figured, let's just go ahead and try to address them and maybe maybe hit a set a lot of minds at risk.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So one, this proposal one myth is that this proposal will impact city jobs. Well, the fact is, this proposal is for one side of the business. This is for private nonexclusive franchise collection system that serves larger businesses and apartments.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Only city crews. Our city crews still have the ability to service commercial large businesses as well and maintain a residential program. Myth number two, this wouldn't be competitive and would lead to a monopoly. Monopoly. Number one, the proposed system would be highly competitive and ensure only the highest performing companies operate in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Number two, we're not prescribing a specific model. We are going to we're going to come back through the process of this study and further define what this model looks like. Next, six of the 15 permanent haulers are really one company, and just three companies do around 70, 75% of the business in our city.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So the market is already consolidating. So the argument of going down to $3, that doesn't make any sense because we're already naturally going down to three companies on behalf of thousands of businesses. The city will able to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hold hold.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Haulers accountable for the best customer service and most customer rates, most fair customer rates. And let's remember, there's already a public option in our city without our city haulers who are not burdened to drive corporate profits and help stabilize the market.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There's nothing that keeps if someone says, my, my rate skyrocket that you can always go with the public option, the city option that helps regulate the pricing. So so that's a myth. And there are so many things we can do to help regulate that next.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This will put waste haulers out of business. Let's have a conversation about that. So, number one, this system can be designed in a way that works for Long Beach, such as a zone for smaller to incubates, incubate smaller companies, smaller haulers, or subcontracting opportunities for smaller haulers.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The larger haulers would be fine. Some of these large companies own millions of dollars worth of landfills, and processing facilities have lucrative contracts. And dozens of other cities. They're not going out of business. Next, anything you hear about how much rates will go up is an unsubstantiated rumor.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This system can protect customers from future rate increases and dispersal costs as dispersal costs increase due to closing landfills and as customers are required to sign up for organic services. The city can set caps on rate increases and negotiate establishing of fair rates to make sure no one gets gouged, such as for new state requirements for composting'",
        "'speaker_6': 'and collection services. Transparent rates also benefit small businesses. These type this type of system ensures rates are more stable over time. So moving moving forward, I just have a number of just, you know, sort of focusing and directing questions that I just want to give to staff.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So, so on the issue of the five year notice, I've heard a lot about whether we need to do this five year notice or not. And I and I want to put this within the context of a timeline.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So, number one, city manager, how long did it take us? Does it typically take us to craft reforms to large systems? And let's use an example of the billboard ordinance. How long did that take?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm going to.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Bring Craig back, the Public Works Director, to answer the questions regarding refugees, regarding the billboard company after the city council. Had a direction to actually do electronic billboards that took about two and a half years.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You concur? Correct. Mr.. Public Works Director. Two and a half years. Sounds about right. Ah, no.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I wasn't involved.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In the Billboard program. I think doing a study as you're proposing this evening would probably take in the one and a half to two and a half year range. Okay. Analyze, bring that to council and implement.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So, so let's say two and a half years. Let's say that we go through a process and evaluate and study and then the city council in a smooth way and a smooth process. We we agree. And two and a half years on what this model looks like.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And at that point, we put forward a five year notice. Now you're talking about seven and a half to eight years before anything can even be implemented. And implementation typically takes a fair amount of time. Would that be fair to say, Mr. City Manager.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Again, depending on the type of changes that we're talking about. Yeah, there is going to be a transition time frame. If you look at what the city did with the refuge contract we had allocated somewhere in the 6 to 9 month time frame, if in fact the city went with a different vendor than what was currently servicing'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the routes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we did two and a half years to study and then a five year notice and then nine months to implement. We're at we're over eight years until anything changes in the city. And for that reason, that would place us, you know, well into 2025.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And our state mandates are required to be implemented in 2025. Other mandates are required prior to that as early as 2021. So that's why it makes sense. It makes reasonable sense to do your study and your five year notice concurrently if we're going to make it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If the idea was to stall this thing, then that would make sense. What our goal is to actually tackle this issue and put forth a model that people can live with. Then we should evaluate and issue notice while we do the study concurrently.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we make a decision. We are ready to pull the trigger and begin implementation next. I know there's a lot of models and options that the City Council can consider. What will be the next steps and and with the Council have an opportunity to weigh in and suggest elements to include in the study before we actually move'",
        "'speaker_6': 'forward. So what are our next steps after today? Should this motion pass?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, I would anticipate, Councilmember, that the next steps would be, depending on what is ultimately voted on here tonight, is that we would put together a team that would evaluate how to move forward. We would look to some of the cities that you listed here this evening for the plans that they put in place.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have a big brother next door in L.A. who's who went through a similar effort. And we would evaluate how they were able to successfully do that and where they had challenges. And we would come back to council and make a recommendation on how best to move forward and implement and try to provide to the best of'",
        "'speaker_1': 'our ability where there would be challenges and where we think there would be successes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So so would there be additional opportunities for the City Council to provide input on this, whether it's through the budget process or through the process we're prescribing?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'As far as I understand what you're proposing. Yes. That Council is only directing us to come back with a recommendation study the study what you're proposing this evening and come back with a recommendation and how potentially to implement it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'At which time the council would take action on either, yes, implementing an exclusive franchise system or not implementing an exclusive franchise.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I would think there would even be a step before that. I mean, a study could theoretically require have cost the city council that they would have to sort of vote on that study and how we fund that study through our budget process.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think depending on the course of study, yes. If it exceeded the manager's threshold and yeah, we would have to come to council and request approval to enter into a contract to conduct a setting. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And with that contract, come the city council. Does that depend on how much how much it costs?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay, great. So we could very easily say, look, before the contract goes out, bring it back to city council. That's something that would be fair to say, right?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. So. So there will be additional opportunities for the city council or anyone else to say, hey, these are elements I want to make sure are encompassed in this study. So we have a full range of options before we select our model next.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There's been rumors that some that this is somehow an underhanded attempt to contract out the city's waste residential waste program. Let's be clear. We have the ability to have a conversation and study one side of the business, the commercial side, without impacting the residential side.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If there was an impact, there are legal processes we have to take before that happens. So, Mr. City Attorney, is there a way to bifurcate and say, we just want to talk about commercial waste, we're not impacting city jobs, city workers or the city or anyone who's comfortable with their basic single family residential program.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Is there a way to bifurcate and make sure we focus on one in a way that doesn't impact the other?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Mayor Member City Council The way I understand the council item and the recommended action, yes, you are in essence bifurcating that tonight. If you wanted to look at or discuss the city municipal waste system, you have a charter section 1806, commonly known as Prop L, and you would have to take additional steps to and make certain findings'",
        "'speaker_10': 'before you could consider that contracting services.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So given those those provisions of the charter and Prop L, it's safe to say banning additional some intentional action, though that side of the business is safe. We're exploring uniquely one side of this business, just the commercial waste portion, correct?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That depends on how the motion goes tonight. But as I understand it, that you've articulated it so far.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Sure. Great. So. So, look, you know, this is an important conversation. It's obviously impacts multiple businesses. It impacts residents. But it's important conversation to have in a city our size. And rather than run away from the conversation or to villainize one side or the other.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Let's be adults. Let's have an honest conversation about it and go through this process together and make a meaningful, meaningful recommendation, put forth a meaningful model, and try to create some good public policy. So so I submit my motion as written and asked for my my colleagues support.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Thank you. We have a.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have a second on that motion, which is Councilwoman Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes. If it's okay, I'd like to go to public comment. If we can do that first. I know a lot of people have been waiting, so thank you for being so patient and coming back.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. We're going to go ahead. Go ahead. And a public comment on this issue. Please come forward. I am and just listen. And just so everyone knows, we actually we're going to lose one of the council members in about an hour.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I'm going to go ahead and limit public comment to 2 minutes from from the get go. And if I have to limit to one minute, we'll go down to one minute. I want to make sure that for council's here to discuss the issue.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So let's add any objection. Okay. Go ahead. Thank you. This is Robert Fox, executive director of CONO, the Council of Neighborhood Organizations. I appreciated having a private conversation with councilman of the ninth District. And I believe that we came to an agreement that a study would be an interesting thing, and I'd like to be part of that'",
        "'speaker_1': '. A number of business people in the city would like to be part of that conversation and not left out. We want to see the city come back to a community based management style, and I think we came to concurrence with that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I hope that you're nodding to say that. Yes, that's true. The question that, of course, I still have on the table here is giving the five year notice. So I understood your timeline as you just articulated it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And it was one of the reasons I called our city attorney this morning to find out was there a deadline that we had to give that five year notice today? And according to Mr. Parkin, we do not have a timeline where we have to do this at any time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's our choice. It's a political choice to make. Here's my concern and the concern of. If we give a five year notice, which is basically a termination notice to contract as it is, because that's the only way it's written in the contract, there will be companies who have consolidated already and decided maybe this game is already tilted'",
        "'speaker_1': 'to the wrong direction or to somebody else's direction and they will exit the market. So at the end of our five year term, we will only have one hauler left to deal with. Our concern is to keep a market competition in the city of Long Beach to avoid any kind of a percentage increase.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Because unfortunately, I do have a disagreement with your percentages of increase in other cities which have adopted such a plan. We've seen a 200% increase in trash hauling from Los Angeles, and they're not even implementing the program yet.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It'll be two months to six months before they're done. Thank you. We should study that first before we make it five year. Thank you very much. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening, city council members.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'My name is Linda Serafin. I'm on the board of the Aluminum.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Beach Neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Association and.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Which is a member of the donation. Which coalition? I really appreciate the presentation.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I'll be reiterating some of those points.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm committed to.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Improve the quality of life for the community and see that the city of Long Beach reaches its full potential. My vision for Long Beach is for it to have a structure to support citywide recycling and eventually composting while creating good green jobs for all.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'One of the ways we can achieve this is to have a.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Structure to supports. One of the ways we can achieve this vision is by transforming.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'I had an opportunity to invest with my daughter up in Oakland and we experienced a similar plan. If everything works like Councilman Richards says, it'll be a beautiful thing. However, in Oakland, rates went up 150 50%. The bins are smaller.'",

But essential to becoming a more sustainable city is establishing concrete goals and benchmarks to measure our progress. The city should take strong actions in areas that are under its control, such as the commercial waste and recycling system.'",

We encourage you to create a local zero waste goal and to transform our current waste hauling system by adopting an exclusive franchise model to ensure that we'",
        "'speaker_7': 'meet this goal. And as the vice mayor pointed out, other cities are similar in size to Long Beach, have already adopted exclusive franchise systems and are reaping the benefits of increased recycling rates. We believe that we can achieve the vision set forth by Mayor Garcia, which includes having access to good jobs in a clean environment.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But in order to fulfill this vision, we need to establish concrete steps that help us move forward. We need 21st century solutions for 21st century problems, and that begins by passing a five year notice. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'So we see this more often with smaller mom and pop property owners who often have to pay higher rates while subsidizing the larger property owners. And of course, these higher costs are typically passed down to the renters, and an exclusive franchise can ensure rates don't explode on an annual basis and further passing them down to our renters'",
        "'speaker_5': '. A more efficient system which protects our infrastructure and is more environmentally friendly, will make it safer and healthier for our renters to live. Setting caps not only protects our renters, but also landlords from rate gouging, especially for smaller mom and pop property owners.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'That will greatly inform your decision. I'll close with this recommendation. Your study must really, respectfully needs to include a task force. Give us six months to organize that. All the stakeholders can be involved from Surfrider Foundation to the trash haulers to Lane, whoever you want involved.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Get all the opinions out and then make your decision. In the meantime, please do not issue that notice. And please recognize we have haulers in this community. Been working here for several generations. The thanks to them should not be that they're given a waiver on the way out.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Years, we've recycled all about a million tires, which comes out to about 22 million gallons of oil.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'One way to think about that is we've recycled more than twice the volume of the Exxon Valdez spill, and we've kept that out of landfills and we made it into new products. Now, we've also worked very hard to make sure that these jobs are good jobs, jobs that pay above the.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Minimum wage, jobs that have a path towards stable housing and home.'",

A minute is certainly not enough time to cover anything, really. I'd just like to say that I echo what has been said before me that I think it's so important to have a task'",
        "'speaker_1': 'force. Don't put the cart before the horse, have a task force, bring in the stakeholders, know what's going on, get all the facts, see the facts, and then make your action from there. Because to do so tonight under what's been said and what hasn't been said, I think would be a big mistake.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think later on you'll see that it's a mistake. Let me give you one example on race. Look at Los Angeles. They're going through a process now to switch over to exclusive. They their race sheets have been posted.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I gave those rate sheets to my haulers here in Long Beach. I said, compare those L.A. rate sheets with what you're charging now. The price came out about double what they're charging now. Thank you. Thank you. Speaker, please.'",

Going with a franchise arrangement is just sensible, it's efficient. And among the many reasons that Councilmember Richardson mentioned in terms of the safety and the preservation of the streets.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'I've been able to afford a decent living, living and working in this industry. And what I see that currently that is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Currently.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That is currently available is this exclusive franchise needs to be be signed by tonight because if you don't set the standards at a high rate, then everyone, even with this five year notice, they have time to meet meet that high standard.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Thank you. Inexplicably, in Long Beach, Mr. Vice Mayor Richardson, I really respect your passion also about this. But however, you mentioned that you're going to have $60,000 of your jobs in five years, probably be 70,000. And the only way those jobs are going to come here is unionization and a theory of unionization.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But you never once mentioned the word union during your speech. In order to have those wages, you're going to have to convert these people to unions. What union hires what union represents the most drivers in this country, the Teamsters Union.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think that's the last union we need in this city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Actually.'",

I heard you all just to pass this five year notice today to help transform Long Beach commercial waste and recycling system. And at the same time, I will say this because I had a whole little thing going, scuse me for a second.'",

Thank you, Vice Mayor, for welcoming, initiating honest conversation. The association represents many of the ten haulers in Long Beach, and they share the same goals as our friends at Lane Environmental Recycling, Compliance, fair wages and recycling, compliance rates'",
        "'speaker_5': 'and service that are excellent. Many are small local Albers who have been here for generations in Long Beach. Are they concerned about the five year notice kicking them out of the city that could render the routes worthless? Of course.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Wouldn't you be? Do they feel we could all work together, all stakeholders on a task force to ensure that your program is the very best to vet all those statistics in the Vice Mayor's presentation? Of course they do.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And do these small businesses want to be here continuing to work in your city? Of course they do. Thank you for your consideration tonight and in the months and years ahead.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'regarding LA's exclusive franchise policy. And I quote, It's been years since we have been working on this exclusive franchise. What a success it has been. We have tough environmental standards, a focus on customer service and fair rates, and equitable and transparent business improvement district process with the cream rising to the top.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'A partnership with labor and room for haulers and contractors big and small, like me. We urge you to move this forward. This is a groundbreaking vote today for the city, but not just the city, but for the region, the state, and really indeed the whole nation.'",

I'm the co-director of Long Beach Fresh, and we operate as a local Food Policy Council nonprofit trying to build a more sustainable and equitable food system. I want to thank Vice Mayor Richardson for his leadership on this and the very thorough report.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And just briefly highlight, you know, that's very beneficial to urban farms and community gardens to be able to capture compost. And while we've had a successful pilot program, that program is not scalable. And we certainly need something more comprehensive, like an exclusive franchise model to set those goals and get us into compliance with state policies.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I also, as a teacher of argumentation and debate, I must say that, you know, you've heard a lot from the opposition, particularly ad hominem attacks, false dichotomies, hasty generalizations. And I think from our side, you've seen why this is a very reasonable, logical thing to do right now.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I would urge you not to delay this vote and certainly to vote for the five year notice right now. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thanks. Next speaker, please. Hey, guys. Sir, the booing and stuff. Please don't do that. Okay. Well, we're getting through the public comment. Thank you.'",

My name is going to Kim and I'm a researcher with the East Long Beach Coalition. And so I'd just like to, as somebody who thinks about these things all day, like to clarify some of the questions that have been raised.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We've studied.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Dozens of different types of systems and have not ever seen an example where a five year notice led to all of the other.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Haulers leaving the market before the contracts are awarded. Also, around rates without set rate, small businesses, as has been mentioned, actually end up.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Subsidizing large businesses because they don't have the negotiating skills or leverage. This has been found in multiple cities across the nation actually, that this happens in a non-exclusive type of system. There are currently no limits on how much a hauler.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Could charge a customer as opposed to an exclusive franchise. It would be fair and set the speaker concerned about the four unit apartment complex.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We hear his concerns, but to reiterate, this would only affect the private sector. That gentleman would have city collection so he wouldn't be affected in any way.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Regarding jobs, San Jose recently transitioned to this type of system. Not only did they see there there they saw jobs created, too. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much. Good evening, Mayor Garcia and members of the council.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I know it's late. We've got one minute, so I'll get right to the point here. Simple. We have a golden opportunity before us. We have an opportunity to actually.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Improve our.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Environment by boosting recycling rates and actually having guaranteed access to recycling. You've heard from several residents today. We we're supposed to have it. They don't. Something needs to be done. We need a guaranteed system. We can reduce air and noise pollution, reduce street traffic and preserve our roads and not undermine measure of funding that we're currently getting'",
        "'speaker_5': '. There are numerous examples throughout the city where we have a simple four corner intersection with four separate haulers on each of those, or even upwards of five. In fact, there's a single strip mall in District five where there are four haulers in one strip mall alone.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We can prioritize food recovery for people.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Instead of landfills, and we can add more opportunities for Long Beach families. Recycling creates jobs, as Lauren just said, and we can raise standards in the industry and make sure that Long Beach residents have access to these good green jobs.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'If we think that this is important and this is something that we can improve our city with, then we owe it to ourselves to pass the five year notice tonight. Thank you for your time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Speaker, please. Hello. Thank you. It was a very fine presentation.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But I don't think you've really convinced me or a lot of the people who are opposed to this that exclusive franchising is the only solution. I mean, it is a monopoly. It's you're going to have three different sectors.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm not too sure on what the number is.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But the fact is.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We've already heard from Ms.. Gill herself. You've said that it's.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Commercial only and you know, you talked about it, but we've heard from her that it's also going that their plan is to go to residential.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So, I mean, if you're.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'If you're going to be using Lane, that is their goal to be going to residential and you're saying it's going to create jobs.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But that this this country isn't about job security. It's about being able to raise up through from the.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Lower class and the middle class. We need.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To have people who are going to lose the their businesses that they've.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They've been in Long Beach for four generations doing trash. And, I mean, it's it's a well-paying job if you own the company, if you if you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, sir. Next speaker, please. Come on. Hello, everyone.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'My name is Mikey Reading and I just want to say that my dad has been a small city trash hauler for 30 years and we had no idea this meeting was going on. I really wish that you guys would care more about the small city haulers.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You. You had a little agreement right here.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'With the city attorney. I appreciate you confirming.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That they're not going to affect the those small city haulers, but I appreciate a little bit more concern, a little bit more caring for the small businesses, because without scrolling my social media three days ago, I wouldn't even have known about this.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please. Last. Last speaker, city council.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'My name is Johnny Weir and mayor. Sorry. I'm a Long Beach property owner and a member of Better Housing for Long Beach. We represent thousands of property owners and renters and we do not support this letter. I'm I'm here on behalf of also of my tenants at 1152 East Second Street.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I don't I don't know if you're aware that some properties, the tenants pay their trash directly. And so this is going to give them an increase immediately. So if we're trying to deal with affordable housing, why are we raising more fees on the on the renters of Long Beach?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I mean, I'm surprised at home is supporting something that's going to negatively impact renters in Long Beach. I mean, this is not a good plan. I mean, what's the rush? Why do we need to rush? If this is the right thing, why rush it?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So anyway, I'm all about the environment, but I just don't think this is the right solution right now. Read a little bit, get the facts, find out how this lawsuits all pan out. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Bye bye. Great. Thank you. Okay, we've concluded public comment. We're now going to go ahead and go to the council. I had left it off at Councilwoman Gonzales.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. Thank you. I want to thank everybody for for being here. I know you've waited a long, long time, and I really appreciate everyone's patience here. So thank you very much. I think there was over 150 people here from the Don't Waste Coalition.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I want to thank them, especially for for all of their hard work on this and just for being here. You know, since 330 or so. So thank you. And thank you to all the stakeholders as well. And thanks to Vice Mayor Richardson for bringing this forward.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I know that this always seems like a scary thought to change the system and kind of disrupt the system. And I certainly am one to agree that it certainly in the front end looks a little scary. But I think if we look at it, there are some positives and I see a few things.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So of course we've talked about it and I won't belabor the issues, but efficiency. We also have an opportunity for creative cooperative purchasing vehicles. Sorry, my voice is a little shaky here. I'm a little sick. Education and stakeholder engagement, which I believe the Vice Mayor has envisioned through this whole process.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We will certainly offer stakeholder engagement for all parties during the five year notice. And finally, something I'm certainly most passionate about and many people are sustainability. Refining, refining our system and consolidating the system to lessen GHG as well as truck trips, as well as, you know, make sure that our infrastructure is intact.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And as we know, recycling is at an all time low. 20% is not a good rate to be at. We are Long Beach was certainly better than that. And in other cities that institute voluntary diversion programs such as San Diego, they've shown that voluntary just does not work.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We have to do more. And so this is the reason why I'm supporting this policy. I think it is absolutely imperative that we move forward with with a five year notice with stakeholder engagement along the way. In addition, I know that being a downtown resident myself and a representative of downtown, so many of us do not have'",
        "'speaker_9': 'recycling. And I live in a beautiful building on Pine Avenue where we have trash collection, of course, but we do not have recycling. And so many of my neighbors, we know with millions of dollars in investment in that building.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'No, no recycling. It just seems like there's a huge miss there. We need to be able to focus our efforts on commercial and multifamily premises. And in fact, as I mentioned, the cooperative purchasing vehicle. I think this is a very unique idea that we have to look at a little bit more in D.C..'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I know that there were 12 churches just about that saved about $20,000 just for consolidating their waste haulers. And in doing that, they created, in addition, a cooperative purchasing alliance that was able to help them not only with services, with waste haulers, but all additional products and services as well.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So, you know, definitely pulling the buying power together will certainly help. And I think we can see that in addition, negotiating higher standards in both labor and environmental practices. So many progressive cities are already working on these alliances and I think that would fare well for us.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And it also keeps haulers, I believe, closer to our community by ensuring that the standards are high, but also making sure that they are focused on our residents wishes and concerns such as recycling and composting. The baseline rates, I think that is something we can certainly look at as well.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I know that the rates, we're all scared of them jumping up 200, 300%. But certainly looking, as I mentioned again about the cooperative cooperative purchasing vehicle being more efficient, having haulers working on and working with just a few businesses versus a multitude of businesses in zones.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so I see this being a huge win for us. Either way, I know that will have a lot of input from stakeholders. Much of the input that was taken now I'm taking down and certainly certainly writing notes about and I want to make sure that we're learning from other cities as well.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Los Angeles, yes, they're going through that process. But there are a multitude of other cities that have this in place, and we have to be able to learn from them to make sure that we're doing the right thing here in Long Beach, incumbent haulers is something that was also discussed.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Private sector setting the prices. Absolutely. That should be something that is a private sector decision, but certainly making sure that we're setting the standards for labor and environmental practices on the back end and the market competition as we discussed.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So all of those are going to certainly be taken into consideration, I think, Vice Mayor Richardson, for bringing this forward. I think the council officers that have been supportive of this, the Andrews and Robert Otunga and I think many of you I know this is a good thing we're headed in the right direction.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Absolutely.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Council on Mango.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I hope that this microphone doesn't sound too harsh because the front part fell off. But I just have a couple questions for Vice Mayor Richardson. And is item you'd mentioned in your presentation that the number of haulers that actually own all the potential.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Current licensed organizations in Long Beach is how many?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There are 15 slots owned by different businesses. Some of those have consolidated into larger ones. So, in fact, 75% of the hauling slots that we have are owned by 75, owned by three haulers. So three companies make up 75% of the business, which creates very little opportunity for small guys to get in.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Which is why we can create, you know, we can actually write into the RFP opportunities for small guys to have a better shot at doing business in our city.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And then currently on the agenda item from many.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Years ago where it listed all of those 15 providers, they each had expiration dates. So if I could get some clarification, I know I've talked to the city attorney about this and a few others, but I still think that it's important for public record.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Why is it that if we already have licenses for the contractors, a majority of which expire within the five year period, why would we need to continue those licenses if if it's 75% are owned by three? Why wouldn't we adjust our policy and consolidate those to be more transparent to the public of who they're really hiring?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'You could certainly do that as they expire. There are some that expire, I believe, in 2018. Correct. And so on in 2019. And if the council votes to put the notice through today, you could as those came. Obviously, they have the opportunity under the five year notice to continue operating.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'You could. Clean up that issue.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So the Council has a current policy though that we would have up to 15 or it's unlimited. I thought it was unlimited.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I'll let director of Public Works.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I know we had this talk back in november. It's been a long time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mayor members of the council. Currently there's 15 in that is in the municipal code. So that is our current cap. If we were going to change that, it would take action by this body.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so potentially what we would want to do to maintain and ensure competition is to not allow the majors to own 75% of the holding options, almost as if we should work into our discussion that as licenses expire, if they're owned by another licensee, that it would expire and not potentially be renewed.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Well, I think you would. You could certainly look at that during your study on how you would and how they would control and how you would offer those services. If it's by his own or if it's by multiple carriers and you could establish, you know, as the if they are purchased or taken over by other carriers, how'",
        "'speaker_10': 'that would affect their ability to continue operating.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Because if only three haulers eventually ended up owning all 100%, and we'd be moving towards a monopoly in a way, from the competition. Great. Next question is related to. The way in which we currently collect trash at our resident are multi-unit residential.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There was some discussion today about that. In some cases, if the city collects, it is a part of their bill. I know that we had some dialog about that in the last week. If you could better explain that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So that for that, for the study, we can enter into a discussion around this component of it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Pose a question directed.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To the Public Works director.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Got it. Sure. Councilmember Mongo. Essentially, we approach it in two ways, and it kind of depends on how an individual multi-unit residential building is set up. Some have what we call a master account. So the building owner would have the trash would have the waste contract and they would be charged depending on the amount of waste that's'",
        "'speaker_1': 'generated. Some multi-unit buildings have individual accounts. So let's just say I'm an apartment renter. I may have an account directly with the city and that account would be typical of most residential customers. So it really depends on how the unit or the building is set up.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Wonderful. And so in the spirit of reducing our overall trash usage, there is a lot of talk at the state level related to water. And if a person actually sees their own water bill, instead of it being absorbed by a whole building, they are naturally more likely to see their water usage as a direct component of their'",
        "'speaker_3': 'life and then reduce their usage. And potentially on the same side. We would be able to in this study work in a way in which, whether you're using the city provider or the non city provider, that that would be able to be an option on both.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So that in the goal of reducing waste, people would see trash as a component of their use. So I have a couple of friendly amendments in consideration of those items. One would be to add to the study the dialog related to how public works could ensure that no matter who you provide as your provider, that a visualization'",
        "'speaker_3': 'on your current gas bill shows what trash does cost, whether it's absorbed by the landlord or not. Just so people are aware of that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That should absolutely be included in the study. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Wonderful. A pro-business component of competition that the study include a component of dialog related to as haulers are cannibalized on the 15 that we look at how to ensure that the small guy has a chance to gain one of those those licenses.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Absolutely. And that's one of our one of our goals. We don't want to limit the study so much to be to prescribe it. But I would hope and if I need to include this in the motion, I will I would hope that we look at opportunities to create more opportunities for the small guys than what they have'",
        "'speaker_6': 'today. We caucused a moment ago about, you know, of those 15 slots, and we know that many of them are consolidated. We need to better understand how many of those we may call them small because they're independent. But how many are actual small businesses by the federal definition?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And how many of them are minority owned, business owned? Because, you know, without understanding that we could at this point have absolutely 0% of our work going to actual small businesses. We don't have that information today to say it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is certainly not just small businesses or minority owned businesses, but Long Beach resident owned businesses specifically.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We can totally look into that. Absolutely. Let's throw it in the study.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then I've done a lot of research. I appreciate I know we've had a lot of dialogs. We've pulled together some meetings in the community already together on this issue to really better understand it. Two parts. One is, after discussions back in November, I sat down with the Long Beach Town Center to try to create our own'",
        "'speaker_3': 'consolidation so that there wouldn't be four different providers serving one business area. Unfortunately, without a city requirement, there is no ability for them as a landlord to get all of their tenants on the same page, especially because a lot of these tenants are national or regionally managed.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so within the study, I'd also like to include a component that since we are hoping strongly to still maintain competition to keep rates low for everyone, that there be some kind of dialog about complexes or commercial corridors of a certain size, that even if we maintain competition within the system, that those corridors are consolidated into a'",
        "'speaker_3': 'unified one for all of them. They can make that choice who it is, but that they hopefully can we can study what that looks like.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I don't I.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Don't necessarily know that it needs to be a friendly. What you're explaining is what we hope the study will achieve. Someone made the statement earlier. One size doesn't fit all. I would agree. Long Beach Town Center is a major shopping center.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And how does it actually impact a residential, you know, apartment building outside of that center? It's a town in and of itself, so I would hope that staff comes back. We want to maintain some order, some exclusivity in areas where it makes sense to deviate.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'From what we've seen in other areas, let's let's study it. So I would say absolutely. Let's let's look at all of our options.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then I called around to the other cities and have spoken with some public works managers about the different components that have led to the cost increases. And a lot of times.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The cost increases are not coming.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'From the consolidation of the number of participants, but actually because members of their city council or the body that came up with the solutions put in so many additional new restrictions. So whether it be we need seven coordinators of.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Recycling versus.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Utilizing a goal that the consult the the haulers get to it on their own. And so I would just ask that we work towards a option where we put the least amount of additional burden of costs on anyone providing these services.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I would think as a part of this process, we, you know, it's it's value engineering. You start with, hey, these are the things that would be great. And then these are things that are actually feasible without, you know, corrupting the system or making the system too too heavy to bear.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So the hope is through the process of, you know, five years, we start with these are the great things that we we can achieve and pare it down. Some some things may not cost very much money like the job pipeline.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It already exists in Long Beach City College. This is a matter of writing into an RFP to draw from the well that's already established. Right. So some things we don't prescribe, we set a goal out. The RFP doesn't have to necessarily say these are the specific things you should achieve.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They could say these are some goals. How best would you address these goals within your business structure and allow them to have some flexibility, some innovations? You know, be smart in how they approach, how they solve some of these things.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So all of that is on the table. But I don't want to say, you know, this study should be too narrow. We want to sort of be broad about the system.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then finally, I would say that in being broad and especially in those discussions when we talked about the number of haulers, even into whether it's the town center or the Spring Street corridor or the Atlantic corridor. Trash trucks get full.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so there are a number of there's a threshold you're never going to get below. If every time a bin left, it was all using the same company, there's still a threshold, whether it's a fast food facility or a restaurant that needs pick up more often, or a more commercial business that does mostly just boxes and things'",
        "'speaker_3': 'like that that could be picked up less often. I want to just be sure that we work hard to maintain competition and recognize that if we can't get lower than five truck trips, then maybe we don't need to work as hard to eliminate providers below five and so on and so forth.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so in my final comment, I would just ask that that were fair in looking to ensure that competition remains, because right now.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We have providers that are contractors in our cities.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And on a regular basis our residents call my council office and are upset with the services provided and we are on a long term contract with some of these individuals. And so we're on the phone regularly with their management about missed pickups or other things that are just not acceptable.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we have no alternative. And so I beg the the study to really put an emphasis on ensuring that we have that competition so that when a provider is not doing a great job, you can switch. There has to be an option to switch and not just to a city provider or a non city, but within the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'competition of keeping rates down. That that is on the commercial side. With that, I appreciate that. And my final request is I'm understanding that all the costs of these studies would be coming from the Enterprise Fund and that no general fund dollars would be spent on this.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's not in this motion and not as I understand it. But I would prefer that if we have an enterprise find a refuge fund, it should come from there. So I would say.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Craig can come.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'In. Yeah, absolutely.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Mr. BECK We certainly would have we would look at that, but I assume it would be refused. But that information and decision will be made when the contracts brought back to the Council for perfect.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. We're going to go to Councilman Ranga.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Mayor. And I want to also thank Cosmo Richardson for bringing this forward. The I met with him a couple times. I raised my concerns. He addressed them. And I want to thank Councilmember Gonzalez. She wrote she emphasized something that I wanted to emphasize, which is, let's get stakeholder input on this, because it's really needed.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Everything that I heard in the testimony was the fact that there are some haulers out there that would love to participate and give their input on the study so that they can ensure while we can ensure that their all their concerns are also being addressed.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I also want to recognize Councilmember Mungo's comments regarding the the revenue and the competition that would be in place with this. And I hope that this study will address that. It's very important that we maintain competition and that we give those smaller haulers an opportunity to continue to serve.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'One question in regards to the five year notice.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You called it.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'A bifurcated way of doing it. We did a study with a back friction that a five year study over the five years been in place during the study. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, what I'm proposing is concurrently we study and we issued a notice or we're in the position to implement and refine as soon as possible.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. And that would total, as we said, about a year and a half study. It will be about 7 to 8 years before we actually implement anything.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So by concurrently, what I'm saying is that we start the clock now on the five years we work. This does not here to take any action. We may not get it right in five years. Billboards from the time the City Council actually got on board with it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It was two and a half years, but it actually took a decade just to get city council on board with it. So the earliest would be five years. That's just the earliest legally.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And what about the if the study reveals that maybe the five year notice it was is was too much and we started losing some contractors during that that during that process, is there an alternate way that we can address that in the in the case of having some some a male from us?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I mean, let's face it. I mean, I've talked to some of the haulers as well. They met with me. Their concern is that in the five years that we put out the notice that they're not they're not sure whether they can gear up with their equipment to make them compatible with what we're requesting them to do, especially'",
        "'speaker_8': 'when we're talking about zero waste, because that's our goal. Obviously, they got no issue with that. I'm just wondering if the smaller type of haulers would have to make an expense in order to stay in business, and then we lose them because they're not able to make that expenditure to update their equipment, to make the standards that'",
        "'speaker_8': 'we're at. We're not going to be asking them to meet.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So let me try to address that in turn and as as best as I can. Number one, this the scope of the study should consider implementation and what burden would be on someone who is going to attempt to respond to an RFP.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We've gone through processes like that and I think they're very different in terms of the Clean Trucks program in the port. Those things were considered in terms of implementation. Now what we're talking about, the majority of the haulers already use are already required to use clean trucks.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's not a significant equipment burden. But if someone isn't already sort of operating at the at the standard that they're required to the RFP, the competition will expose that because there's already a standard here, that level of competition through an RFP.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If anything, it just strengthens and helps hold people accountable to already established standards. Now, if the city council adds additional standards, that's a public policy discussion after we study it. If they add additional standards and I will hold, based on the conversation with Councilwoman Mongo and things like that, that we're you know, we're modest in requiring overly'",
        "'speaker_6': 'burdened, burdensome requirements on trucks. So frankly, this is a conversation that happens later. It isn't the conversation that happens today. I don't think it's because the notice was submitted. It's just it's the nature of a competitive RFP process in itself, in my opinion.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. Well, I hope that we're able to, again, go through this study with the input of stakeholders, including aspiring owners and business owners and everybody else, so that we could get a study that is going to be complete and not have to deal with any kinds of negative impacts.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Regarding the the study itself, because of the fact that we did not do enough outreach to our stakeholders. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman Andrews. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Mayor. You know, I I've listened to most of everyone on the dais speak on this issue, and I will be in support of the motion, because today I believe in protecting the environment and increasing the number of green jobs available.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Because for my residents who really need these jobs. You know, a study has shown that recycling creates ten times the amount of jobs that are created, you know, by landfill and by this. I really feel like these are the type of jobs that the residents in my district have been waiting for.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And we need the jobs and pipeline that can be created within this item moving forward. And I would hope later as we go on and get into this time of night, we will be limited to one minute with our conversation also.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I like that, too. I'm happy to tell time, everyone. I love that. Councilman, Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_0': '30 seconds.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I'm going to try to do mine in 30 seconds. I agree. First, I'd like to just just live my support for this this motion before us. I want to also recognize somebody who's not here, Janine Pearce, because she's the first person that brought this item to my attention about a year and a half ago.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I know Lane, the Teamsters that the coalition don't waste. Long Beach has done a lot of great work in the community to generate and build support around about this. I want to address one of the comments earlier regarding I thought it was very disparaging toward the Teamsters organization.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'My grandfather was a Teamster, by the way, and he wasn't a criminal. Okay. And when it comes to when it comes to actual man in Wisconsin, you can go take it, take a left Fishbone. You have to take a seat.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's not your time to speak. Mr.. Mr.. BOLAND You said afterwards that you had no Confederate comments over you to take a seat. You. Mr. BALL. You have to. You have to take a seat. Thank you. Mr. BALDWIN.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much, sir. And I think this council should be unapologetic when it comes to supporting and creating good jobs. And we shouldn't by hide behind the fact that we might be creating good union jobs either. So I want to be clear that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I'll say it out loud. And obviously my comment, my colleagues and many of the speakers have told the benefits. I think there are some risk. I think I support a robust study with robust stakeholder input. We do not want to create unintended consequences long term and obviously this is an issue that just starts the ball rolling'",
        "'speaker_1': '. The future city councils are going to ultimately decide what's best for Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What's best for our residents, consumers. And it's going to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Be a business and economic decision that that's going to have to make good economic sense for for our city. Ultimately, when we get to that decision and so I'll be supporting tonight and again, hopefully I was under one minute.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much. Thank you. Shelter in place.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. I'm going to be very quick. I want to. We've had a lot of friendlies, so I just want to confirm a few of them. So this report is going to include the possibility of allowing for more than one trash hauler to hold contracts in the individual zones.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Correct. It's going to be overly broad to include that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Absolutely. It can include that in the study.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. And then would union and nonunion haulers have the opportunity to compete for these contracts?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you for giving an opportunity to speak on that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So you're limited by 35?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Absolutely.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So at no point does it say, does this recommendation say put forth a model that is exclusively union? It doesn't say that the standards are going to define the work, the working conditions, you know, all of those things.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The standards are going to help define that. Now, if a company has labor issues, that's on them to sort of work out. We do want to make sure that we do maintain some level of labor peace in our city.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And that's something we've, you know, we've done on our civic center and other areas. Those are things we want to study as a part of this. So at no point are we saying, you know, we are putting forth a process that says only union and not other, you know, nonunion haulers and other and other processes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You know, what you found is nonunion haulers also, you know, end up with a piece of the work. Now, whether that leads to them ultimately being organized or making the choice to go union, that's what ultimately between them and their members.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I want to echo the comments that my colleague, Councilman Urunga, made regarding the task force or the stakeholder task force. I think that's really important. I'm assuming that's also included in this process, because Councilwoman Gonzales also mentioned it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So what we heard, we heard. Task force from the public. But what we heard from our our coworkers was stakeholder engagement. I want to be very clear that I don't want to predict. Like when the consultant comes on board, they're going to be able to select what the best format is that's want to make sure it's a'",
        "'speaker_6': 'part of an official process. So we're not going to say it's a task force, but there will be stakeholder engagement inclusive of the partners that were, you know, have spoken here today, Council on Business Associations, shopping centers, apartment owners, residents who are impacted by the change, food systems, experts locally.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Those are the people that we want at the table to help craft the best policy for Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So we want to give some discretion to our consultant in terms of how that process is unfolding.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Absolutely.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. And then lastly, I just want to thank and I think Lauren from Lane. I got my first briefing on this issue probably a year ago maybe, and they've kept me in the loop. And I really, really appreciate when people respectfully take the time to educate you and answer your questions and show you the same respect that'",
        "'speaker_9': 'they expect on a Tuesday night when they come here. And you guys did that. And I just want to thank you for that. I was really, really impressed at your outreach. It was very respectful. And the one thing that they highlighted, they did their research on the council districts as well.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And the one thing that they highlighted in regards to their conversations with me was the density of my some parts of my district and their proximity to business corridors that the kind of inefficient truck routes and the multiple.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Truck routes, that the potential.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Elimination of that would be a positive for the residents in that area. And that really had an impact on me. So I want to thank you guys. You should be commended on your very professional, respectful advocacy. I really liked it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Carlton. Membership now. Okay, thank you. I'll also be brief if you'd like to start the clock. We can do that now. Is it up there?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah. Okay. I just want to follow up the.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Point that Councilwoman Pryce just brought up on the stakeholder group and how that is integrated into the study. And if you look back at, let's say, the Jacobs engineering study on the files, stakeholder input was concurrent and separate.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And if you can find a way for the consultant to integrate it into the study, I think that's the key. So we're getting that stakeholder input and somehow it's making a difference within the study. So that would be my desire.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Thank you. We're going to go ahead and go to a vote here in just a sec. Let me just make a last comment. One, I think this is a great opportunity to address our climate change goals in the city, and I think we have to get serious about waste.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I thank you all for being partners in our climate change goals and our climate initiatives. This gets us there in a very, I think, important way. And I want to thank you for that. I think that we have to be honest, all of us, including are those that are apartment owners and those of us that are'",
        "'speaker_1': 'trying to ensure that we still have competition, that the current system we have is not efficient. And so when you when you have multiple carriers on streets and alleys consistently all day, there is wear and tear. That's just a reality.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so if we can come up with a better system by working together, I think that's a really good thing. And I do also want to note that let's also, I'll be honest that some of the systems that were created early on, some of the cities that were mentioned actually have do have some flaws.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think even if you talk to our friends that are part of the campaign, I think we can improve on what other cities have done and ensure that we end up with, I think could be the model system in the country and I think that's what we want.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'How do we increase recycling? How do we increase ensure that we have good routes that are being efficient, that there is competition, that we're taking care of the workers? All of that needs to be a piece of this puzzle.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I'm very supportive of city staff ensuring that we include all of our stakeholders in the conversation and let's come up with the best possible system that we can. And as part of as we're looking at this issue around the study, there's been a lot of conversation around the kind of the larger hallways and the smaller'",
        "'speaker_1': 'cage. But we also have that group of midsize homes that are that also sometimes get caught in between. And I've heard that a lot in the in the L.A. process and others. And so I just want to make sure that we're addressing that group as well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And you guys did a great job in, I think, getting the community involved in this campaign. And I really hope that we can all work together and come up with a really great system. So I'm very supportive of this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Vice Mayor Richardson, we're going to vote. Just a final.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thing. I just want to say, you know, this was not something that I didn't wake up and say, hey, I'm coming off maternity leave. And I want to take on one of the most controversial issues in our city.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The courage from this didn't come from any of us here. It was you all in the community. We've had conversations on both sides. It's an important issue. And I just want to say thank you all for enduring this first step in a process.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And hopefully we have a better system and a cleaner and safer Long Beach as a result of this. So thank you all for your participation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. And members, please go ahead and cast your votes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Motion carries.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. It's unanimous. Thank you very much. Thank you. And as you exit, please, if we can just have the conversations outside, because believe it or not, we're only on our third item of the night. And so if everyone can please just quietly exit.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Thank you very much. Okay. Okay. We're going to go ahead and hear just the next order of items is we're going to have item 23, hearing number two and item 27 on the harbor bonds. Those and then we have a very long agenda after that.'"

        "'speaker_1': 'Believe it or not, this is going to be the longest meeting we ever had. So next up is 22. Real quickly, Madam Clerk.'",
        "'speaker_2': '23.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm sorry, 23.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Item 23 is communication from Councilwoman Price, Councilman Andrews and Councilman Austin. Recommendation to request the city manager to prepare a report on the specific areas relating to homelessness and residential quality of life in the city of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Exit quietly, please. That'd be great. Thank you very much. Councilman Price.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I want to thank we had about five residents here earlier, but they had to leave to put kids to sleep. And we have one resident who stayed behind. So so thank you and bless you for staying.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'This item comes as a result of constituent feedback and information that we have received and of course, the great work that the city has done in regards to homelessness. I know this item is long, but I want to talk through just a few things.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Long Beach has been making major strides towards addressing homelessness. City staff has made us one of the leaders in the state and how we help the homeless. I want to specifically thank two three of my colleagues who have had an important role in this issue.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Councilmember Pearce, with her support of the Hart team, Vice Mayor Richardson with his work on affordable housing. And Councilwoman Gonzalez with her request for data collection, which is very vital to this process. I hope that we as a city can build on this important progress and continue to be a leader in addressing homelessness.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'This specific item seeks to collect more information that would be useful in actually developing strategies for a long term, multi departmental city approach to homelessness. I've indicated a number of areas in the items, but I'm truly open to any additional ideas from my colleagues on the departments and the departments themselves on ways that we can better address'",
        "'speaker_9': 'the needs being felt around homelessness and residential quality of life issues. Generally, the spirit of this item is to see how we can expand things that are successful and fill in gaps in addressing areas where we have opportunities.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I encourage our city manager to use his judgment and the resources available to him and instructing the various departments that could have an impact on homeless issues. Oftentimes, we think of homeless issues as impacting only the health department or the police department, but that is simply not accurate.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The listed bullet points in this item are meant to spur ideas that can get us closer to a long term multi departmental approach to homelessness in the city of Long Beach. Further, with Measure H money coming in, as well as so many of the great progress and successes and stories that we have about homelessness and our individual'",
        "'speaker_9': 'successes in our districts, how we can help expand our services to be more efficient and effective using Measure H resources and opportunities will be vital. There are so many different approaches that we can take to make an impact on homelessness and with various city departments having unique abilities to have different effects on this problem.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'This item is meant to establish a multi departmental focus and a holistic approach to homelessness and residential quality of life issues. Homelessness also affects many residents. For more information, with many departments, we can better help those who are suffering from homelessness, as well as residential and business communities impacted by the issues around homelessness.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I'm open to suggestions from my colleagues, but I do want to say that this item came about for us because it's something that we've been working on and we've been paying attention to what my colleagues have been doing on this council.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And although I know that reports have come back, I know there was some mention that, you know, we've already done some of this work or maybe it's duplicative. You know, looking at, for example, the March 9th report that came back on this issue.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You know, there's a lot of good programs and ideas that are that are referenced, but there's really not a lot of details in terms of how we're going to accomplish some of our goals and objectives. We haven't included things that are practical in terms of how our departments can work together and how we can use the resources'",
        "'speaker_9': 'that we have in the most efficient manner, and having them coordinate with one another as they're taking on their various responsibilities in the community. There is one item I think is Council 100. Is still here. Oh, okay. He did have an item that I wanted to add on here, which was to include a well, I'll wait for'",
        "'speaker_9': 'him to come back and see if because he's the second on this motion. So we'll come back. He might want to make that friendly himself, but it involves with our information technology department implementing an online dashboard that could be updated monthly with information that the public can access regarding our data and our our, our, our tracking of'",
        "'speaker_9': 'of our successes in the city. And finally, I know I have a resident here, but I do want to mention and I promise the residents that had to go home to take care of their kids that I know.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I'm very well aware that in my district there was a petition started. The petition was written to the mayor and the chief of police. And I know there's there was a group here tonight that wanted to talk about the petition and talk about why they feel that residential quality of life issues need to be more of a'",
        "'speaker_9': 'focus when we're talking about the issue of homelessness. So I look forward to hearing from our one remaining member of the public eye today.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman Gonzales.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes. Thank you to Councilwoman Price for bringing this forward. I think any additional information we can provide and we can we can receive and figure out is is the best. However, it is very detailed and I know it's very lengthy and I appreciate her being very open and understanding that there have been reports that have come back'",
        "'speaker_9': 'already. What I would suggest and I have a couple of friendlies, but we have done a lot of work already in this, I think. And I know it's sometimes hard for the public to understand what the city is currently doing being in downtown.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'A lot of my residents, even though we have seen many individuals experiencing homelessness, they still don't understand the extent to which the city is doing. I personally was at the homeless count, which was on my birthday. Because I wanted to see it for myself.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I think that there's often a lot of residents who do not see that for themselves. They don't see what work we're doing the city departments are doing. I've had stakeholder meetings as well with many of the service providers which are located in downtown.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And they don't even talk to each other. So I think there is a gap there in terms of coordinating and what we can do there. So a few things I've been thinking about. We have a multitude of different initiatives.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We've passed policies of, you know, the Fuze fellow, I initiated a state of homelessness item, which was the March 9th report that came back. Affordable housing, the heart team. So many of us have had different initiatives, I would suggest and this is my friendly one of my friendly amendments to Councilmember Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I'm sorry Price it is late tonight I'm sorry is is perhaps asking our city management staff to aggregate all of this information and put it all together. I know we can all look it up and register, but to aggregate the successes that we've had, whether that's Fuze fellow and all of the reports, to just have it all'",
        "'speaker_9': 'in one place for for the public to kind of jump off of that is. I think I spoke to Kelly Colby, our Health and Human Services Director, some time ago, about even an infographic that shows the services that we're doing some sort of marketing campaign.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I don't think people often know the success. Again, the successes that we've had with homelessness and the fact that we're down in our numbers, we just don't we don't talk about that in the homeless count. Information comes back, you know, in a very city like document.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I don't think it's anything fascinating to the eye. Not that it's fascinating information, but I think that we could maybe do a little bit better in marketing, that is coordination in services, because I think a lot of what Council Member Price is talking about is already being done.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So is that something that we.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Absolutely I think we can certainly do that. And I think that's one of the things the agenda item speaks to, and we can put that together with our team and Instagram.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes. Okay, great. And then another thing I will say as well in terms of technology, because in speaking with the service providers, I think a lot of the disconnect is with the individuals out on the ground and the you know, I had about 15 stakeholders, First Congregational Church, Rescue Mission, MHRA, all of them in one, you know'",
        "'speaker_9': ', all of the churches you can imagine COA all in one meeting and they didn't even realize the services that each other were providing. And I think that again is a big miss. So if we had some sort of a tech, I don't know if there's a platform we can provide for these social service providers.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You know, one of them told me, oh, I didn't even know that the church across the street offered this service, whatever service it was. We don't even know what time of day food is being provided, whether it's breakfast, lunch, dinner.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I think that there's a way to. Perhaps streamline that. I don't know if there's a technology platform that could be done again. Maybe it's another infographic. We just need to think a little creatively there. So thank you again, Councilmember Price for this item.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I look forward to the information. I will just say, though, that 120 days is a little short. My item didn't come back for a year. So I think that perhaps providing additional time for for city staff to come back with that information would be great.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilmember Pearce, we we have councilmembers. I'm just confusing my I'm just trying to think I'm just thinking ahead of of the items.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is this okay?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I want to thank my colleague. Councilwoman. Oh, you're thinking council member. Councilwoman, I get you. Okay. Councilwoman Price for bringing this item forward.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Doing pronouns now.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There you go. There you go. I think that's you know, it highlights a lot of the work that we've already done, everything from the Hart team to the previous work, everything with our police department and our health department.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And it it is a lot of information. But I think that the important thing is that, you know, we had a plan, a ten year plan, and that plans expired. And so going along and saying, where are we at now?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'What do we need to do for the next ten years, knowing what we know and what we've been able to accomplish. And so I'm happy to support this. Obviously, I think when we're talking about how we provide it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The first question is how do we get information? So how do we know how many people we're serving? How do we know how many calls are coming in? All of that information is so important to be able to deliver better services and to better be able to.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'City manager. Can you let me know how many times do multiple department heads meet in a month in regards to homelessness?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Every week.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Every week. And which departments are doing those meetings?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It's it's a group of probably six departments PD, Fire, Health, Human Services, Parks and Recreation, City Manager's Office, Technology Services, Public Works.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So even information like that, I think is really important to be able to tell our story to constituents and to say we're working really hard, you know? And I think sometimes the biggest challenge is when we're in the weeds doing the work.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's hard to sing our praises. And because we're so busy doing the work and.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The teams working really hard.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yeah. And I see that. And I saw that when I came to council in a very different way than when I was outside of council. And so being able to tell that story and to be able to say, here's where we're troubleshooting, here's how we're helping out.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I think this is a good item. I think it's making sure that we know the impact of these things. So like the Hart team, you know, I would love to have one with each battalion. When we talk about the budget, that is something that we've seen them be successful on.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I don't have any amendments or anything, but I just wanted to say, you know, I think it's a good item if we can have enough time to make sure it comes back with, you know, all the information that we want.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think that would be helpful. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilman Ringo.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'll make it quick. The the study is pretty comprehensive. I understand that, but it's all concentrated on Long Beach. South Street in Long Beach. And homelessness is a citywide issue. And there are many areas where we have homelessness up here.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I think that we need to also reach out to our partners in the region, to the county of L.A., to Caltrans, to help us when we have those issues involving the freeway, the underpasses, the river. Because when we have issues that especially in my district in the seventh.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We were like.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I sent a task force out there. They know what the borders are. They throw stuff over the fence into the county site and in the county say that in doing so, I think that this study, whatever we're doing here, has to include connections or articulation, if you will, with our county contracting and Caltrans and any other agency'",
        "'speaker_8': 'that that is that is affected by homelessness. I wish you could include that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think. I have lately been attending the countywide homeless meetings, and I know that in these large meetings we're in discussions and I want to repeat the words of my colleagues that Long Beach is doing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Exceptionally well as compared to of the other even smaller cities that that have sometimes in some categories, considerably more resources. But I do think that we could be instead of recreating the wheel.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'When we talk about these systems and how to put data online, we have the fire department who hopefully is moving towards the electronic patient system. There's a homeless button in that category. And as we educate people in public safety across the region, it should be a component of doing their job and not a separate mapping system.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I know that we have so many different systems and different departments.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I would just.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Heed us not to move into a new and another system, but find components of our current systems that can be modified and integrated and posted on open.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Data. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Price.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I absolutely. Councilman, your youngest comments are well noted. And I think this should be kind of looking at the region if you look at the different departments. So what we did was we tried to research what opportunities there were in each department.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And Councilwoman Pearce is correct. We have done a lot of these things. But if you if you look at the item, for example, we're not saying let's create a Hart team. We're saying we'd like some data on the heart team's successes and can we add more and how much would that cost?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So moving into the budget cycle, same with quality of life officers, you know, how effective are they? How much would it cost and how much time would it take us to train them up? So absolutely. And, you know, there was another item that I didn't mention earlier that I know Councilman Austin and Councilwoman Gonzales were involved in'",
        "'speaker_9': 'involving where the jail, where people donate money to they donate directly to an individual or should they donate to like a meter, artistic meter, and that money would go to a primary source and that would get distributed. And that's a really great idea.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Other cities have done that, too. Councilman, you're on this point. So studying what other cities have done is is is helpful. But we've done a lot of things. But I think in several of these areas, it's important for us to think about what's the next step.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So what are we doing to educate people, businesses and residents about what all the experts believe, which is you shouldn't be donating individually to people. You should be donating to organizations that can help people, that can lead to long term sustainable.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So what are we doing in that regards? And, you know, every once in a while you mention an idea and people will say, yeah, we're already doing that. Well, if the council doesn't know that we're doing that, then it's really not we're not able to transfer that to our residents.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So if we are doing it, we should know about it. So and if we are doing it, then the report's going to be a little bit easier to complete than previously had we have thought. So that's great if we're doing it.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But if we are doing it, then, you know, is there an opportunity for us to do something better or learn something from another county? Like if you look at the public works section, there's a lot of research in here from work that's been done around the country in terms of service days and opportunities to have job training'",
        "'speaker_9': 'skills and things like that. And that's based on things that have been done regionally that may not be viable for for our city, but it's something I'd like us to explore. So again, I would like to ask my colleagues for their support.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And and I think Councilwoman Gonzales makes a good point about the timing. I think 120 days may be unrealistic, although based on what I've heard, we've already done a lot of this stuff, so it might just be repackaging it.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I would say, you know, as soon as possible and I know I did this. Does the city manager noted the social impact bond item come back? I think we brought that about eight months ago or so. Does that come back yet?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No, it has not come back. We can give.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'You a report tomorrow. I think it's shortly.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Well, we.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Weave that in here, too. So if we see something, we're already working on it. I can just come back with this, but I understand these things take time. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I just want to applaud, you know, Council Councilwoman Pryce, all the signers and everyone's done work on this issue. It's an important issue across the county. You know, the more we talk about it, the more we engage on it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I don't think we can go wrong. So. So you have my support. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Great. We're going to let me just add one thing also. I do want to thank and I'm glad everyone else everyone has touched on. This is our staff, by the way, and I see Kelly out there and I just think it's really important to thank you guys are amazing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And you guys get pounded so hard in the community every single day for doing literally God's work and the kind of work that so many folks are not interested in actually engaging on. And your entire team and I've had a chance to meet I'm so proud of them and I'm so proud of all of our partners that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'are out there every single day. And I see some of them that are here today. So thank you guys for being here.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And Mayor, do you recognize Officer Johnny Dotson who's out?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'WHITFIELD Absolutely. I mean, Johnny, I see our team. You guys are awesome. And I also just I think it's important to note that it is true we have had population shifts. But what what the data is coming back to it were Long Beach is in regards to the data versus every single one of our neighbors and the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'state of California is amazing what we're doing with the crisis that is across the state of California. And so I applaud you guys for doing that. And that by no no means does that mean that we still don't have serious issues and that we haven't seen population shifts here?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that's cause major concerns for a lot of neighborhoods. And so we know that is obviously true. I will I will say what I think is important. We're doing, I think, almost more than than most cities and agencies.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And what's great about Measure H is it would allow us to double our capacity. And so I know that you guys are working as part of the budget process that we're actually going to see pretty dramatic increases in the budget around homelessness issues.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think in all departments, I think, Mr. West, I know that you're working as part of your budget to present kind of what all the departments are doing around homelessness. And so I think that's something that we all have to look forward to, and I appreciate that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I want to go back to something that Councilwoman Gonzales said, which I think what struck me is part of the big issue is that we're also we're not communicating, I think, as probably well as we should be what we're doing and then listening to the neighborhoods about what it is that they're seeing on the ground at'",
        "'speaker_1': 'what we can do to address those things. And so, I mean, the conversations around what is actually happening, what our neighborhood partners are doing, how we communicate that to the community, does the council have all the information that they need to be kind of ambassadors in their neighborhoods and get the information out?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I think those are all actually very valuable conversations that I hope that we also have in the course of the next few weeks and months ahead as this reports put together. So I think it's a good item and I think it's good it's always good to have more information and have more conversations about a topic that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'we're all working on pretty, pretty strongly. So thank you to all of the council people that signed on to this. And Councilman Andrus. Yes. And real quickly.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I want to thank Mrs. Price to bring this item forward, because I think with her hard work and compassion and with which we all should have for the homelessness, I think we really make a difference in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We have to continue to work as hard as they have been because this is all over the country, homelessness, and we must have that compassion to really get serious behind trying to help out our fellow brothers and sisters.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Out there struggling. Thank you very much. And we're going to go do a public comment. Please come forward. We're going to have this this lady go first, sir, just because she's been waiting for a long time. Go ahead, ma'am.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening or good morning. Whatever it is by now. My name is Lauren Wakefield. I live in Belmont Heights in District three.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Excuse me. I knew this would happen.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I would really urge you to take a look at that petition that you've all been given. The 1300 people who signed it have included 1300 comments. And we have a very different outlook on this problem than you're presenting right now.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'First of all, this is not about homeless people who are sincerely down and out and in need. We don't see it as a homeless problem. We see it as a public safety and a crime problem. And that's really what's happening with us.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Long Beach receives a lot of grant money to provide services to the homeless, yet we've been told that 90% of that population refuses those services. And we were told that by your city homeless outreach coordinator. Even if we invest more money into more programs, there's no way to compel people to use these services.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm asking the city to go to the heart of the problem by addressing this firm as props 47 and 57. These laws have released a tidal wave of criminals to the city and other cities. Drug abusers and thieves are doing very well thanks to these early release laws.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There was supposed to be a period of public discussion regarding.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The nonviolent peace.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I ask the city to please address their concerns with the state. We're also asking the city to give feedback to the state on that egregious law that says stealing anything valued at under $950 is okay. That alone is causing a huge amount of chaos in the community.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'People are stealing everything, walking out of vans at traffic circles.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'With value about $1,000.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'A day, and that's just what they catch. While the state may take some time to change this ill conceived law. Can we draft some type of local ordinance that addresses it, please? It should not be just a misdemeanor to steal something valued under $950.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Please untie the hands of law enforcement, even with the stifling limitations of the props. We have city ordinances that could be enforced. Please streamline the police paperwork, give us more police officers and patrols, and let the vagrants and criminals know we're not going to continue to lie down.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And roll over.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And while we're very appreciative of being.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Put on the agenda.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Tonight, we can't wait 120 days to see results. Crime is escalating. The community is at a boiling point. We must have budget for public safety, increased police and general protection for the public. Don't wait until businesses and the tax base flee.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And tweakers, vagrants and criminals are all that's left in our city. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much. Next speaker, please. You're here. You know, it was good what she said.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, Council. This.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I have to ask this. I have to ask this. Why do we always see a unanimous vote? It seems like you. But before we got here, because then I'm hearing people talk and I'm hearing them say, okay, are they talking as if it's already been done?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I don't really like that. And I mean, you have a diverse, diverse group of people here, and it seems like it's already we don't have it. We're just here to show up and see what you guys are going to do.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's supposed to be we the people. This is supposed to be America. It seems like it's getting more and more socialist and. Ms.. Pierce, when you were going asked what was up about that happy birthday, Karl Marx. Because, you know, I'm American.'",

        "'speaker_1': ', but something's got to change. It's like this. This problem wasn't here years ago. There was the few homeless guys we had in our neighborhood. Everyone kind of knew them, waved at them. They were nice guys. These are a bunch of drug, drug addicts and a bunch of thieves.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'At the end of the day, what I see the majority of them, and it's just very disappointing that nothing's being done in my eyes to fix a problem. I know we're working at it, but that's not what I'm seeing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So whatever you guys can do to help out. Greatly appreciate it. Thank you, sir. Officer Dodson, for all your help, too. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hello. First things first. Humanity predates Holmes. So homelessness obviously existed before Holmes have existed. But I myself was very curious about whether there were just not enough not enough shelters or or why people weren't going to the shelters.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Because you obviously have you have your your drug addled individuals who are not exactly capable of handling being around other people. So they tend to not go to shelters. They tend to be off on their own loners sort of situation going on there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But there are plenty of people who are homeless, who aren't drug addled, who are who still don't seem to go into the to the shelters and such. So I have asked I've taken up the opportunities I've had to ask them, because if you want to know about something, ask people who are most involved with it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If you want to know about the Dakota Access pipeline, talk to people who are engineers in the field and find out what the actual hazards are. Not listening to a hullabaloo and all sorts of other things. So what I've been hearing is that it's it's an issue of sanitary, unsanitary conditions.'",

        "'speaker_12': 'Across using a bar of soap and a and and a and a washcloth.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And wherever they can, they can they can make it happen. And maybe catching a shower at some some certain place they found that's decent, because when they've gone into shelters, they come out with bedbugs. So then all of a sudden, instead of just going in and getting a night's sleep or what have you, a gal told me'",
        "'speaker_3': 'about having to, you know, then shave her entire body and and go replace all of her clothing. And it's so I'm not I'm not trying to throw the the shelter operators under the bus. I've never stayed in one.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I don't know what. I haven't experienced it myself. But if everybody I've talked to has had issues with it, then it's there's there's something going on there. There's a missing link as far as making sure that it's that it's a safe, healthy environment for people to go into.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I'm not sure exactly what be taken. Bedbugs are really terrible, so I don't have a great solution for it. But that's that's what I've heard. So it's not necessarily that there aren't enough beds.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Um, so that's it.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'Some suggestions about how to better involve the community in dispelling a lot of the fear and the unfounded will. Unfounded fears, certainly losing your bike again and again and having to retrieve it again and again and going through that is a hassle.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It's wrong, it's criminal, it's not right. But a lot of these criminals that are making these they're making these choices. They have severe mental health problems. And we spoke about that earlier tonight. And it was passed, which is great.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I think we'll.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'See quite a bit of decrease once Buck.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Is completed and we're able to use that. But perhaps if you can work with neighborhood associations directly and people in the neighborhood to sort of engage the community.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Members to have to.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Be reminded of compassion for these people that they are you and I, we have been there before. I have never been homeless, but there is nothing to say that I could maybe be homeless.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'At some point. And I would want.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'To be treated with the same respect and compassion that any human.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Deserves. So whether they have committed ridiculous crimes or not.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We still need to give these people chance after chance.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To help them.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I think talking with residents, dispelling fear and mental health outreach will help as well. Thank you for your time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I know it's late. My name is Ramon. I'm from the fifth District. I don't know what it takes to. All my life, I've seen a lot of the homeless in Long Beach. I've. I run across the community and I see it all.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I don't know what it takes to help this issue. It's an extremely tough nut to crack. I thought I saw it all until one day Stacy Mungo held a meeting in in Hartwell Park in a golf course cafeteria.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I heard Marie Knight say that she the city, spent about a half a million dollars trying to clear out tunnels that were in Eldorado Park. And I was just freaking out. That was amazing to me to hear something like that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I have helped some of the homeless. I've been fortunate enough at least not to be in a situation like that. But I've also helped two veterans get off of the homeless stuff after, you know, a long time working with them and just saying hello and giving them some of the information with a multi-service center that Stacy Mungo's'",

It's been such a an important aspect of the city that I mean, it it doesn't it's so difficult to find just to'",
        "'speaker_5': 'help one person and they just keep working at it and they keep working at it. And you just got to say, you know, you're doing a yeoman's job just like what the mayor has said. So I just want to thank Johnny Dobson and and Commander Griffin for all the work that they've done.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I know that we're kind of moving them around. We're not able to help them too much. But anything that we can do is is great. And I just want to thank the city for all its work that it's done.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Finally, Mr. Breland. Yes, Larry Bond. When I was a young kid, we used to go down to the riverbed in the San Gabriel River. It was before it smelled and was all trees. It's a riparian area, bamboo.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And yes, we were down. There were hobos and were hobos. Now we have homeless people and those are guys who just didn't want to be inside. But here's here's an issue. In the last recession, we had a 15% unemployment.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And people could go from a good paying job, have a house, have a car, and lose a job, lose the car, lose the house and be homeless. Those folks we have truly have to take care of. Safety net has to be there.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I'll never forget the igloos that L.A. City put up for the homeless. Remember that? Off of the freeway. And what happened? They took them out because the people wouldn't. The homeless people wouldn't go in. They wouldn't go into those igloos because they had rules.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And the rules were you couldn't smoke pot and you couldn't do crack or cocaine. The homeless people don't like rules. So what scares me is you're going to build a whole bunch of houses and you're not going to have any guests because now we're going to have marijuana is going to be okay unless we put a nonsmoking'",
        "'speaker_1': 'rule into those homes. If you say, okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Homeless, you can come in and.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You can smoke pot. And by the way, you have a bed. Budweiser won't have another bud. Bud. And so we'll have high people in our thing like everybody. Nobody has a solution to this because there is a multi layer of schizophrenia, of drug addiction, of alcoholism.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I don't know the thing, but I just say let's be cautious on how much room we spend on homeless housing versus fixing the solution with the people. Anyway, thank you for listening. Thank you very members was called and cast your vote.'"

        "'speaker_9': ', among many others. And I didn't take this to the state legislative committee just because of its timeliness. This will be in the Appropriations Committee in two days. Senator Ben Allen just had an event this past Monday to discuss the item, so it's moving pretty fast.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So that's the reason we brought it to council first. So I'd appreciate support on this item and look forward to the future.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilmember Ringa. Actually, Councilmember Pearce first. Sorry. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes. I want to thank my colleague for bringing this item forward. And I think any time that we're doing something at the local level, the question always comes up. But what are we doing at the county level, the city, I mean, the state level?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so I wholeheartedly support this and encourage my colleagues to do the same. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman Franco.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Mayor. As a member of the Coastal Commission, I totally support this item and I hope that it could get the support of my colleagues. Thank you. I thank you for bringing it forward, by the way.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Okay. And is there any public comment on this? Members, please cast your votes.'"
