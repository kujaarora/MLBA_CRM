        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, council. Mayor this item came to our well, this item was brought to our attention by the fireworks committee. Our office was directed to prepare an ordinance to increase enforcement measures for the use of illegal fireworks. The focus of this the language of this ordinance was to address those issues.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'One, been increasing the scope of individuals that could be held responsible for violations, as well as to increase the penalties. One aspect of the increase in the scope of responsibility or the scope of people that could be held accountable for illegal fireworks was to create a host liability ordinance, which would include property owners, tenants, landlords, property managers'",
        "'speaker_2': ', as well as any individual that organizes, supervises, officiates or conducts any type of firework event at a particular private location. The second main point in the language of the ordinance is the response costs. So anyone that is found to be held in violation of the language of the ordinance would be responsible for the cost.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The actual costs of fire PD and any kind of emergency personnel responding to a call relating to illegal firework activity. And so those are the two main points of this ordinance. I am available to answer any questions that Council may have.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I also want to remind Council that this is an emergency ordinance so that it would require two separate votes. Once the Council's concluded discussion. And that's the that concludes my presentation. Thank you. Them among us.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. So I just want to thank the fireworks committee, the city attorney staff. And I know Linda Tatum's been a big part of this. Two questions. I want to make sure you both questions, because I know we have a limited amount of time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And when we talk about all the parties that could be held liable, I think it's important for there to be a process or a way where we ensure that the individual putting off the fireworks is actually the one that is held accountable.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I know that there are situations where there are minors involved. I know there are situations where there are tenant landlord issues, property manager issues. So I guess I would want to know what. Our methods of ensuring that the process, if a landlord or a property manager appropriately notices the tenants of the legal requirements not to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'use fireworks inappropriately, then it sounds like as a component of that the ordinance the landlord could still be held liable. Or is it that in that case, if proper noticing went through, it would be the tenant? And then what kind of costs are we talking about?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'What is our estimate of what we're talking about? Where a current fine is $1,000? I don't know a Captain Bill that. How much an hour or how many hours are we talking about to input it, or are we talking about an increase?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I would hope so, because we came to the city and said we need these to be more. Larger penalties, but in cost recovery, it doesn't always turn out that way. We want to make sure that we have an understanding of the magnitude of what we're passing tonight and how that could be held by a landlord who could'",
        "'speaker_1': 'be a 85 year old person in a senior community who uses their rent for their fees to take care of themselves in a single community. So I just want to make sure we know what we're passing here. A Councilwoman, this is Linda Tatum.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I can speak to several of the issues you raised there. You you talked about who is responsible. And that is one of the things that the fireworks, the working group spent a lot of time on looking at this ordinance in terms of the actual implementation of it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And at the heart of this ordinance, the new concept that is introduced here is the notion of what we call host responsibility or social responsibility. And like many other property related ordinances, the ultimate responsibility is to the property owner.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So the wave of the ordinance is written when a a property owner is assumed to know or be aware or be responsible for any activities that a tenant, a visitor, or even someone who is just as long as they're on their property, they're responsible for those costs, those costs that are associated with the violation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's the fundamental premise of this ordinance. And we talked among our group about how it would be implemented. It's very much the same way you investigate any other crime is if there is evidence either from a complaint, the police department would go out, they would take a report.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They provide that the evidence of that information to the city attorney, the city attorney would thereby issue the citation. And we talked about the costs. The citation state law limits the citation to $1,000, which is why it was necessary to increase that penalty to include the cost recovery.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And at this time, we are not addressing the actual cost recovery fee. That is what will come back to you next week. And we hope to in the staff report when we present that item to have some approximate costs that we can share with the council.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So tonight, you're just approving the ordinance language. Next week you will consider what those fees are or what those potential fees could be, because we're not.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The only reason.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You're only adopting the concept of the cost recovery. And that would include not only fire and police as as Art noted, but it would also include the cost of the city attorney to prosecute the fees. And I would like to just take a little bit of time to talk about some of the other activities of that working'",
        "'speaker_1': 'group. They have been very active in terms of designing an outreach program. The direction that we got from council last July when fireworks kind of went through the roof is just to to attack this from more than just one perspective.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'One of those was increase in the penalty, but the other one was to do a much broader outreach and education campaign, and that has started in earnest. The other thing that we've been really active in is collaborating with neighbors.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We've been very active in trying to collaborate across the state with other approaches and strategies for how other cities are addressing this. So all of that went into our consideration of proposing this ordinance. Again, we're looking at best practices.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Two other things that will be a factor, at least for this 4th of July is the fact that the city council last week approved the free block parties. We're still hoping that that will be a deterrent in addition to those block parties.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The other thing that we will continue to do is to start data collection so that we know the number of calls for service and we can track those over time based upon different activities that we put in place there.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we're trying to look at this from a number of different perspectives to to really get a better handle on this and to prioritize the issue in the community based upon the council direction that we received. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Is there a toolkit for landlords and property managers or information that they can provide as a notice to their tenants? And when we did the suspension of rent, I did hear from a number of senior citizens who said, you're literally taking away my rent and grocery money because I live on that income.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I'm very cautious when we pass ordinances like this that we both want to hold the individual who's terrorizing the community with illegal fireworks accountable. And what we don't want to do is then rack up. A fee that we're we're passing an ordinance today with no fee attached to it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So, I mean, it could be anywhere from $1,000 to. I imagine it wouldn't be as high as $10,000, but I just don't know. And the reason that that council came together and said, you know, we really want the fees to be higher is because we wanted those fees to fall on the people who are willing to spend'",
        "'speaker_1': 'thousands of dollars on illegal fireworks. We didn't want those to land on our elderly residents who are providing housing for the community. And so I just want to make sure that through that social responsibility and host responsibility, you discussed that there's a process where if a landlord and or property management company could demonstrate that they did their'",
        "'speaker_1': 'due diligence and that there's still a way to hold the right person accountable for these fireworks and those fees. So that that would be my concern. Otherwise, I'm very supportive of the item as long as those are met.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Councilmember this is city attorney. The fee is in the ordinance. It's a $1,000 fee. The fees that were referenced by the assistant city manager, Linda Tatum, will be the cost recovery fees. So they will be in addition to the $1,000 fee that is established this evening in this ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If that helps in my question.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes, I definitely understand that to be the case, but I don't see any cost estimates and they said they're going to bring those next week. But today we're being asked to approve the the structure by which we come up with those cost estimates.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So that's all. And Mr. Parkin, are you of the mind that are our residents that are not setting off the fireworks, have done proper noticing and would be protected from burdening these fees and fines as the landlord who appropriately goes out and or hires resources to manage their property to ensure that those tenants aren't terrorizing the neighborhood'",
        "'speaker_1': '. And what what what does that process look like?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So so the process of the ordinance would would be to hold the host or the property owner responsible for this conduct. However, there is an exception that it does not apply to a host who initiates contact with law enforcement or fire officials to assist in removing the person or terminating the activity in order to comply with the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'chapter. So. So there is for those landlords that are working with the city and trying to eliminate this, there is an exception.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And this is Art Sanchez. Just to follow up on Mr. Parkin's comment in regard to how these fees or the enforcement against a property owner would go, they would have an opportunity to respond and provide information similar to what Councilwoman Mongeau was referring to in terms of if they provided notice to a tenant or if they provided'",
        "'speaker_2': 'specific information to whoever was occupying the property that they were not to use illegal fireworks. That certainly can be taken into consideration when we're evaluating whether or not to proceed with the prosecution of the citation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Oh, wonderful. Thank you. I hope that and his team can bring back some samples that we can circulate in our newsletters and on social media in multiple languages. Some landlords may have tenants that don't speak the same language as them, and it's really important that language is integrated into all components of our city.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so for those reasons, I would hope that a flier and or acknowledgment tool could be provided for property owners and property management companies. I think that will go a long way in getting those entities to help with our campaign to notify people that illegal fireworks are not going to be tolerated in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. A councilman in the house.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mayor. First of all, for all of those listening to our city council meeting, one of the things that I want to make very clear is that fireworks are illegal in the city of Long Beach, any kind of fireworks.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we have been having this problem for four years now as as was mentioned a lot last week, city council last week, city council meeting fireworks are not only disturbing, but because they set up current norms and don't let people sleep.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But they are also very dangerous and triggering for events that that, you know, occur or when through violent and gun battles and stuff like that. So it brings back a lot of PTSD. Yet despite the $1,000 fine that we already have imposed for fireworks citations in the last couple of years, we have seen an increase in the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'number of illegal fireworks. One of the things that I would like to see and like Councilman Mongo said, is I would not want any unintended consequences to our property owners and landlords when when they are not aware of.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Of the illegal fireworks that are being lit by maybe some of their tenants. I do worry about that. I was wondering, is there a way? I mean, I am sure that there could be a way where if a landlord does not know and does not obviously approve of their tenants doing or lighting up fireworks on their property'",
        "'speaker_1': ', that they have the freedom to be able to pass that fee onto them. Is that something that is possible?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So this is city attorney Art Sanchez. So in answer to that question, one of the main issues relating to enforcement measures of illegal firework activity is finding the violators. So if a property owner is in a better position to identify who these individuals are that are setting off the fireworks, then yes, we would take that into consideration'",
        "'speaker_2': '. Depending on what the information is and what and how much how we could identify the individual who set off the fireworks. So that would be something we could take into consideration. But as a whole, regarding the way host liability works in this situation, I think the focus is on being able to enforce against individuals and what hosts'",
        "'speaker_2': 'liability does in the language of this ordinance increases the scope of people we can hold accountable so that we can get to the actual individuals that are setting off these fireworks or have possession of these fireworks or selling these fireworks.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And, you know, and so that's that's one of the reasons for having this type of language. And, you know, again, those are things that we can address as we seek to enforce this ordinance. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Three. Thank you. Another thing for those that that are caught dead lighting of fireworks. I know that other cities such as Pasadena, which has been thrown a lot around when it comes to fireworks and I was wondering, they have an ordinance that impels the cars that that the person lighting the fireworks has.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is that something that we can consider in this ordinance?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So this is our attention that again, I have reviewed what the city of Pasadena has in its ordinance, and I didn't see anything in their actual fireworks ordinance relating to the empowerment of a vehicle. I don't know if that's related to someone that is discharging or selling or possessing the fireworks in their vehicle.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But it may be that the vehicle is part of, I guess, the committing the violation or the crime. And that may be a basis why I just don't have enough information to know what Pasadena is doing in terms of the empowerment of vehicles.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And when doing some of my research, I did come across that. And I do believe that it was, you know, for having these illegal fireworks in in the car that they were being impounded. But I will look further into it and maybe we can talk through it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think some. My second question would be, is it possible to issue like or come up with an incentive program to help residents identify who is lighting up fireworks and possibly, maybe even when we have the if we we identify someone that's lighting up fireworks and that's doing this, and then we give them the fee, which'",
        "'speaker_1': 'is the thousand dollars plus. Right. Is there a way that we can use maybe some of that money from the peak fee to create an incentive program?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The city attorney that that could be considered during your budget application process as whatever money that's coming in for the program. The cost and the fees that you'll discuss next week are to recover the cost of the services to implement the program.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So if we start giving the money or you return the money or it sounds like you're creating some sort of an incentive or reward program for reporting, that would have to be additional monies that the city would have to make that decision on how much how you would distribute that, how you would award that, and that could'",
        "'speaker_3': 'be considered during your budget cycle.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Thank you. Thank you very much. It gives me a little bit of hope. Third question, and I may be afterwards and another time. Okay. Thank you. I'll call you back up. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Council member, Austin. Thank you. I just need a little bit more clarity on that. The host you'll remember I brought forth the social host in order is related to alcohol consumption. I want to say maybe eight years ago and and I think our city prosecutor and I think a lot of this is based on on that the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'host is not necessarily the owner. I just want to be clear on that. Is that correct? City Attorney Yes. Councilman Austin That is correct. Okay. So it could be the tenant. It could be a landlord. It could be a property manager.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But it's trying to assign responsibility to someone at a specific address. That's how I understand this. And so with that in mind, that may address some of the scenarios related to fireworks in our city, but it may not all.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I'm just going to ask how we or how does this ordinance address potential situations where individuals may be setting off fireworks in an alley or in the middle of the street? So to answer your question, Councilman, the ordinance does have language that allows for a adjacent property or adjacent public right of way to a property'",
        "'speaker_2': 'where individuals are setting off fireworks and then return to a specific private property that can be identified. It allows for a violation to be attached that way. And so what that would require, unless the fire or the police officer is able to identify the individual setting or identify that the individual setting up the fireworks where he was'",
        "'speaker_2': 'located and where he went into or what location he went into would require residents or witnesses to identify one, the activity that's adjacent to the property. And then second, the property where that person that was setting up the fireworks ended up.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so that's it does have a provision for that. To answer your question, if the alleyway is adjacent to a specific property where the individual goes, then that could be assessed as a violation. Well, thank you. And I think this is a tool that we haven't had in prior years.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I'm you. Well, I don't necessarily like to see enforcement measures, but this is one that has the attention of so many residents throughout our city. And this is more than an annoyance or a nuisance, fireworks or impacting on sleep.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean, people are deprived of sleep. They're animals that are having, you know, hard times dealing with these these fireworks. They're are veterans that are impacted. And so I think it's important for us to send a strong message.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think the takeaway from this is, you know, moving forward, if you choose to do legal fireworks in our city, you are putting your own housing at risk. And I think that is a strong message to take away from this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. I'll be supporting this. Thank you, Councilman and House. You are mute, Councilwoman.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mayor. My third question would be, is there a way to penalize, certainly or legally discourage people from even participating in close proximity to illegal fireworks being lit as a way to discourage people from not only lighting up these fireworks, but also from being complicit in in a way, you know, like if they're involved in.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You know, the the whole show thing. Like, is there a way that we can also cite them, even if it's like a $50 citation or something like that for those that are encouraging the your lighters.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And to answer your question, Councilwoman Sanders, the ordinance does have language that allows for what includes the definition of a host, as any person who organizes, supervises, officiates, conducts, controls or otherwise is in charge of an activity at a property.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean, the best example I can give for that is someone that maybe has organized some kind of, you know, firework party at a particular location. And based on the information that either PD receives or information received from witnesses at the scene that they can identify this person who organized the event, that that person could be held'",
        "'speaker_2': 'accountable as a host. And so I think that answers part of your question. It doesn't necessarily apply to all the individuals that are participating at that location, but it does provide for that type of liability as a host for the person that can be determined to have a coordinated or supervised event.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'A great and is if we wanted to do something like that. How would we go about it? Is there a way to to do something like that?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Councilmember invite and this is city attorney if I understand your question correctly, this ordinance does not and I don't think legally you could craft an ordinance that would cite someone who's watching a fireworks. It may be somebody who's just walking by it, maybe a resident or a neighbor.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think what Art was explaining that we're trying to capture in the ordinance is if someone is is participating, organizing it, or at the host location and in setting off fireworks, we can certainly go after them. But I'm not sure where you would we would have to do a lot more research on where you could draw that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'line.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Okay. Understandable. And yes, more research would be welcome to try to see, you know, because usually from what I hear from my residents, it's usually a little group that, you know, gets together, likes the fireworks and tries to disappear after they light it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So that that was my my reasoning for asking that question. Also, one more question. The city has in place a system to track down the sales of fireworks as as another approach to stopping the practice of of a fireworks being set off in the first place.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Correct. I mean. Do we trip? Do we track it by the the cars? I just want to make sure that my my residents and actually other residents are informed on how we track the fireworks and the calls that are being placed.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I can speak to that really generally. We have through the emergency services, the emergency line. Whenever a call for service comes in regarding fireworks, it is tracked by that by that office. And they track what they track, whether or not you see a fireworks activity in a specific address.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They also track whether or not you hear what you think is a firework, and they will note that it sounds like a firework. So we track all of the data related to what we think are fireworks calls. Now, I wasn't clear that I hear you ask a question about confiscation of fireworks or fireworks sales, because that is'",
        "'speaker_1': 'something that PD also that was one of the other priorities that we were asked to look at to see if a police could step up the efforts to confiscate fireworks. And I know since the beginning of this year, there have been a couple of confiscations, and I think the chief is on the line and he could probably'",
        "'speaker_1': 'speak to that a little bit more specifically. I'm thinking. Yes, I thank you very much, Linda, for that explanation. I think that it would be great to share what what the conflict station successes have been. So, Chief, I might have to cue in again, but I'd like to give you time to answer that and to share that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'with our residents. And this is Linda Tatum again. Our staff is also finalizing a report, I think we mentioned during last week's meeting that we are preparing a report so that council can see since the the the that the working group came together last July, there have been a number of successes and a number of new, new'",
        "'speaker_1': 'initiatives that were done by this group. And we'd like to just lay those all out for for the the city council. And that report will be coming out to you within the next within the next ten days. And that will include the confiscations data as well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Wonderful. Did, Chief, that you want to share, Chief Luna? Did you want to share about your lust confiscations or. Or should we wait for that report? And I think. Not available.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Stafford I think Stafford mentioned that they wanted to they're still putting a major report together that they. Mr. Modica, I know you had mentioned that you guys were putting together a report that will include the PD involved. Yes, we we are planning.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'A written report that will have a lot of information that you can share with the community. So we can do a quick oral report and our wait for the written report later.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilwoman.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Did you want do you want a quick oral report now?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. If possible, please. Just a small one. That would be great.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Can you give a quick report? Yes, sir. Robert Luna here. Mayor and members of the City Council. So we were allotted funding that all of you made sure that we had. And part of our strategy was to give this money to some of our narcotic teams and directed enforcement teams.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And and this is a warning to everyone who's listening out there. We're doing by bus. That means if you're out there selling fireworks. Our intent is to arrest you or cite you and confiscate the fireworks. And our teams have been doing that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We've confiscated close to 1,000 of fireworks thus far, and we plan on doing many more. So, again, just a warning to anybody who's out there. You're going to get a very heavy fine for trying to sell fireworks in the city of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much, Chief. And I know that you had a commander also in New Hampshire that with me, as well as city manager. And, you know, I that's one of the reasons I wanted our residents to hear that we have been confiscating fireworks.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'With that said, one last question, and I may have to queue up right back up, but hopefully I have enough time to ask this question. I know that using your time is up. I will come back. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'By Summer Richardson. Thanks, Mr. Mayor. Just a couple comments. You know, this is a difficult issue every year. You know, it's a cultural issue within our city. Fireworks. And every year the city council demonstrates that they're working on it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And city staff also brings their best foot forward as it relates to policy and enforcement, culture, education. And so I want to just acknowledge the city attorney's office, the police department and city staff for really taking the feedback from the council over the course of the past few years on this issue and coming forward with a new'",
        "'speaker_2': 'tool in our quiver. I think it's important every year that we do let the residents know that it is a process, but we are continuing to work on this issue. It is frustrating. We know that, you know, veterans, folks with animals or people who just want, you know, calm and quiet in the neighborhood, it's that it's a'",
        "'speaker_2': 'difficult issue and we need to continue to figure it out. The one thing the one question, one request that I would make to staff is I know and I am supportive of the strategy around block parties this year that Councilman Mongo Councilmember Mongo talked about supportive of that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We do those things in the ninth District and the culture here, too. But I would like to know, as we approach particularly the 4th of July, if we need to do more outreach in key areas or, you know, if folks don't know about the program, about the the way fee waiver or if they're not particularly engaging at'",
        "'speaker_2': 'some of the high fireworks neighborhoods, if we can just, you know, give some periodic updates, a city manager memo or two from for just on how we're going by district, that would be helpful, particularly for me to understand what's happening in the community that I represent.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I just wanted to just chime in. I know it's an important issue. I want to thank staff and I want to just offer encouragement to the residents that will continue working on this. Thanks a lot. One mango.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. My comments actually fall in line with this. Mary Richardson So when I look at the high firework areas, we know what streets typically have calls and these are the streets that have calls all year round. So I guess my call to action and we only have 30 days is we know the addresses of the property'",
        "'speaker_1': 'owners of those properties on those streets and I would love to see a notice seen to those communities and to those groups. The Situs address is the address that the property owner requests that property tax paperwork is mailed to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'A lot of mailing list by those from the assessor's office regularly to solicit them with advertisements about refinancing and such. But we as a city can work with the County of Los Angeles to get that download of the this addresses for the whole city.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We could easily gioco those pretty quickly or have they have a GIS guy in the assessor's office. If you ask them to geo code the specific areas you want and download those addresses, you then have the exact addresses of the property owners, you know, the addresses of the renters because they live in the addresses that you were'",
        "'speaker_1': 'searching and you'd be able to mail out those notices and alternatives, including if your neighbor is someone who you believe to be someone who interacts with illegal fireworks, perhaps we offer a reward and or we say, here's a tool in the free block party to ensure that you and your neighbors are out in the community, all watching'",
        "'speaker_1': 'to be good witnesses and prevent, through peer pressure, the use of fireworks. And as Councilman Sun has said, all fireworks are illegal in Long Beach. So I say illegal fireworks. All fireworks are illegal in Long Beach and they do terrorize our community.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I just want to make sure that we work with the resources available for notice that I know that today or last night, I should say in my newsletter, it was sent out to thousands of people about these resources.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But again, 50% of the block parties are already on the east side. And I think that it's been an effective tool for keeping illegal fireworks down as I've driven around the city on the 4th of July. And I hope to partner with any councilmember who wants to help their neighborhoods get those tools and resources to make sure'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that every single block in this city has a chance at a peaceful 4th of July. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Go back to customers in their house and then we'll go for a vote. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mayor and City Council Member Members for bearing with me. You all know how passionate I am about this item. My last question is let me get to it real quick. My last question is, are we expecting to have on the go Long Beach are activated?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I know that I heard that we were working on being able to have that available for our our residents to be able to report the fireworks that are being lit. Do we know if this is a function that will be available to us before the 4th of July?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilwoman. This is Linda Tatum's responding. The the go Long Beach app is still in development. But given that we still have some work to do to marry or to make sure that the Go Long Beach app is compatible with the prosecutors website, we are not going to attempt to do that prior to the fourth.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Rather, we are driving all of the the complaints right now directly to the prosecutors website. That website is up, is familiar. Residents know about it already, so we'd like to not confuse them and have two separate websites that they could report to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But shortly after the fourth, we will we'll continue to work on that so that we can somehow make the two compatible and speak to each other so that they both essentially do the same function or we'll somehow combine them.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But but we're looking at all of the options. But for this coming forth, we want to make sure we're driving all of the traffic to the prosecutor's website because they've had some successes with prosecution as a result of the uploaded video and other data that provides evidence for them to follow up with actual court filings.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we're hopeful that we'll see a lot more of that activity this this holiday. Thank you, Miss Tatum. Thank you very much for the that information. I know that I get a little bit anxious and I want things done right away raised.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I think the best thing to do is to do it accurately and efficiently. So if we have to wait a little bit longer to make sure that we have a successful go Long Beach up where we can really, you know, report through there, I'm I'm really looking forward to seeing that in the coming months, hopefully before'",
        "'speaker_1': 'New Year's. But thank you very much, Miss Tatum. Thank you, everybody, for answering my questions. This is something that has been very important to me, you know, since before I was on council. I want to give a huge, huge thanks to city staff for your willingness to address this issue continuously.'",

And I think that that is been a lifesaver and I'm very happy that we have had success with that.'",

And I just could not could not pass up this opportunity to also give thanks to our amazing Facebook group, Long Beach against the illegal fireworks. Thank you for all the input that you have given us throughout this past year and a half.'",

The city has received numerous requests from potential developers and property owners regarding development of habitable and non habitable structures in the vicinity of oil gas wells. Methane leaks from abandoned wells, pipelines or processing equipment can occur and result in hazardous conditions for adjacent uses while substantially increasing greenhouse'",

This ordinance will allow the use of only three cement plugs. It also allows building directly over abandoned wells with only a membrane barrier to contain the methane.'",

One is to authorize the city manager to enter into a contract for the immediate operations and caretaking of the ship while it's closed.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'So I'm going to start with a quick overview, just to give you a sense of who evolution hospitality is. They are a trusted partner of the city. Over the last 11 years, they've been the on ship operator with approximately 500 employees.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They helped to manage about $65 million in annual revenue related activities for the 347 hotel rooms, five different restaurants, all the amazing banqueting, catering, etc. special events, tours, attractions, parking, property, engineering, maintenance and security. And so they're really are a full service operator.'",

They operate some of the most high end hotels in Marriot and Hilton and the Curios and some of the boutique hotels that you're familiar with as well as resorts.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So they're very, very capable and they have a very large organization behind them, which is based in Dallas. But Hospitality, Evolution, Hospitality is based right here in San Clemente. So we know their their leadership. And we actually will be meeting with their leadership on the ship this week as they take over this caretaker agreement between the city'",
        "'speaker_5': 'and evolution. So real quick about this actual agreement. This is this is remember, the ship is closed right now. So there are no hotel guests, there are no banquets or Sunday brunches. And this is really about a short term, six month agreement with the option for just a16 month extension.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Our goal is to address some of the repairs and a longer term solution for the reopening of the ship. We're estimating $300,000 per month. This is a 1 million square foot facility. This is a big building in any rate.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so ultimately, six months would give us not only all the utilities payments, the security, the maintenance, running those big systems to make sure that nothing goes wrong out there. But it also provides us with some contingency funds to deal with some one time issues.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We need to freshen up some of those systems. And of course, there's publicly facing landscaping and and things like that that we need to repair to make sure that the parks and other things surrounding the ship look good.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This is also what we call basic and limited safeguard services. While close to the public I mentioned, we're trying to minimize damage in ways that that might occur with a large facility like that being in in sort of a closed mode.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But the operator is not required to provide any additional services at the property unless we request it and unless we specifically approve it. So this will not be money available to the operator unless it's approved every single month will also approve their management expenses and these payments.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So the city manager recommendation on this caretaker agreement with Evolution Hospitality of San Clemente, California, is up to and not to exceed $2 million for this six month period and one optional renewal period for the city manager for up to six months.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We'll provide regular updates to the Council about activities on the ship related to this caretaker agreement as we move along. We do that typically in written memos already, and so that way the public and the city council are aware of how we're doing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The second recommendation here is, is really about moving quickly with the critical repairs that have been identified by our engineers and recent inspection reports. And so this is about design services. We won't be swinging any hammers over the next few weeks.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We'll really be focused on getting what are called the construction bids back together, really doing some additional investigation in inspection. And that way we will work with our own public works department now, our own capital improvement project managers, to provide them with the right kinds of designs to do temporary.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'These are temporary immediate repairs that can be completed within about 180 days. Now, these we're not asking for the construct construction costs tonight. We are simply asking for the the design work. This will be for these these five key projects.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So temporary build systems would help to pump out water from the bottom of the ship. Remember decades ago. Previous administration removed the bilge pump systems which would remove water from the hole of the ship. If there was a flooding event, we need to get some temporary systems back in there as soon as possible.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Also, an alarm system for water intrusion will help us. There is no leaking right now. We we were in the hole yesterday. It's it's very dry down there. But but ultimately, we want to have an early warning system that would notify not only our fire department, who is prepared to deal with all hazards responses, but also to'",
        "'speaker_5': 'help us to trigger some of those pumping systems and other things that might be needed in the faster we move. The more we can prevent. There's also something called bulkhead. These are the barriers that separate the different compartments at the bottom of this.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This ship and some of those bulkheads have been removed or compromised as as we've converted it to a hotel, you know, decades ago. But we need to we need to make some temporary improvements. We need to do some testing and some modeling.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so this this funding will help us to do that. And then removing our lifeboats, those lifeboats are very heavy. And ultimately, we need to start removing those to take some of the pressure off what we call the sideshow or the the walls of the ship.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so this funding will not remove those lifeboats, but what it'll do is it'll put together the plans to efficiently, safely and with an eye toward restoration of the two original lifeboats, of course, to deal to put those plans in place so that we can move quickly once the courts have made final decisions.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then finally, some of these systems need an electrical source. So we need to to rebuild portions of the electric electrical system, as well as secure a new emergency generator. And we're talking about a very large generator that will actually sit on the land but serve the ships so that those big pumps and other things that we'",
        "'speaker_5': 'need to protect the ship are are powered. So essentially, the design work and construction bids, we can complete those immediately while we wait for some of the legal issues to be settled by the judge. But temporary work can commence immediately after the city receives final decisions from the lease termination and bankruptcy court.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Construction for some of these repairs will be defined more, more specifically during these design design process. But right now our engineers are saying we can get these temporary fixes done in six months, 180 days, and the ship will remain closed.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We we actually can move more quickly and get a lot more done when we don't have, you know, large events to move around. Or we can be as loud as we need to be to get the stuff done quickly and efficiently.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And the goal is to complete these emergency repairs by the end of the year. The funding decisions now will be based on the specifications and the bids. So once we're able to build this construction, we'll know specifically what those those actual prices will be.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then the funding sources, the city manager, our financial management team will bring back some some options for the city council. So this recommendation is, is to of to to authorize the city manager up to $500,000. And we'll work with our current engineering consultant, Moftah Nicole.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Our public works department, our CIP program, and ultimately come back to the city council with some funding sources at a later time. And this one will be paid for by our our critical Tidelands Operating Fund. With that of Robert, my report and happy to answer any questions and turn it back over to Tom.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, mayor and council. That's what we're doing now. We will be back later. Expected right now at the end of July to really have a fuller discussion about the Queen Mary, about the future, about some of the the things that we're looking at for a potential partnership through alternatives.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we'll be scheduling that with the public and the council in July.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. America. Let me first go to the council. I have Councilman Allen.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm. Yes, I'd like to first make a motion that we approve these two contracts.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The staff recommendation OC she a second by Councilwoman Sara Councilman Allen?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. I just want to first say thank you, John, for the concise, informative and, you know, the detailing of exactly what these contracts will accomplish. I think that is going to be absolutely critical that we continue regular operations and maintenance on the ship as we take back ownership for the first time in decades.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Evolution has been the hotel operator for years and has performed well. I had an opportunity to tour the ship yesterday and I definitely have a first hand knowledge and stay on the scale and understand the scope of the necessary repairs.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The Queen Mary has been a world symbol of Lumbee speech, and I think it is important that we maintain the ship. I move that we approve these two contracts and until further discussion in July. I do have a question for staff.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Just for clarification, John. For the critical repair work that you're referring to, that's going to happen on the ship. Can you talk about who is going to be entering those those those repairs or who's going to be overseeing those repairs?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Councilmember Allen. So so we're we're really happy that our public works capital improvement projects team manages most all city infrastructure projects. And now that we're able to step in and do these repairs ourselves, our engineers Moffitt and Nicole and some of their expert subcontractors will help to to design and provide input to the actual specifications'",
        "'speaker_5': 'for the for the approach and the construction. But these these projects will be managed in-house by our capital improvement projects managers from public works.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. Thank you, John. And then also, will any of the bids as we go out and look for folks that can do this repairs? Who's going to be managing that those those bids and that process?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Absolutely. So. So we have a very rigorous internal competitive bid process with, you know, certain policies and procedures that we have to follow. So this work will be bid by our public works capital improvement projects team as well, following all of our city financial policies and procedures and all the controls that are required not only for bidding'",
        "'speaker_5': 'the work, awarding the work, potentially bringing those contracts back to council depending on their size, but also then managing the review of of payments and invoicing, collecting the documentation and ensuring that that all the work is completed in the ways that the contractors have have documented.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. All right. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Councilwoman. Councilwoman Sara.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. I want to thank Mr. Kaiser for the presentation on the two contract, and I I'm in support of it. I think, you know, there's certainly been a lot that's gone on with this Queen Mary, but I think this is the next best step for it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that's why I support this item. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilwoman. Councilwoman Price. I think things are.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm here, Mr. Mayor. Hold on one sec.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. We can hear you, too. You're good.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I am actually in an airport, so I want to thank everyone for indulging me and allowing me the opportunity to share a few comments on this very important item. I want to thank, first of all, staff for the presentation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think it was very valuable to hear what the scope of tonight's item is. But I do believe that there are a few points that we need to make sure that we fully discuss as we approve this item.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If I can just have one moment to pull up my notes here. Okay. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'My apologies.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Just give me 1/2 here. Okay. I'm literally just walking off of an airplane. So just so everyone knows, I'm accompanying our Long Beach Youth, the National Youth Rowing Competition in Florida. And our plane just landed in the middle of a major rainstorm.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So the item before us tonight was certainly a foreseeable item, although the timing of it was sudden and unexpected. There is no doubt that the Queen Mary is an icon for the city of Long Beach, and it is certainly an asset that is universally recognizable in the city of Long Beach, is connected to the image of the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'ship. It is a part of our city and a part of our history. The many efforts have failed to invest in the ship and make sure that it is maintained. Time and time again, the efforts have failed. We are now in a situation where the ship's operation and maintenance responsibilities have fallen to the city.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'While the total city asset that includes the vast coastline property as well as the ship, presents a new opportunity for the city, the cost of true historic preservation of this ship is significant and it is an unrealistic expenditure for the city at this time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I am in support of tonight's item, which dedicates a specific amount of tidelands funds to be used at this time. And these are for the immediate needs of the ship. But as I have done in the past, I must express concern about leveraging any tidelands or general funds moneys should that be requested in the future towards.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The maintenance and operation of the ship. In 2016, I voted against an item that leveraged the Tidelands Fund to support the effort of urban commons to conduct maintenance and repairs on the ship. I was concerned at the time about a worst case scenario that we were told would be unlikely and unforeseeable.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Unfortunately, that turned out to be exactly what happened, and the Tidelands Fund has already had to cover the debt service at a level of approximately $2.5 million. We have a fiduciary duty to protect the public's money. If any significant moneys were needed in the future to support the maintenance and repair of this ship.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I would want the public to weigh in on that decision. There are many competing projects that the city is currently working on, and it's likely most, if not all of them, would have to be deferred in order to meet the maintenance demands of the ship.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's certainly a decision the public would have to weigh in on how that input would be provided. It's not before us, though, yet. And that decision for us to take over the ship, allow alone without partners is still premature.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'For now, I am hopeful that the opportunity presented from this asset as a whole, including the waterfront property, make this a desirable site for future investment for any entity that is equipped to oversee the preservation of the ship and to closely monitor the future development of the site adjacent to the ship.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I hope that creativity and the preservation of the ship as a monument and in streamlining the ship's current operations are considered as part of the process. The ship's current location seems to be contributing to its rapid demise. I think there are tremendous opportunities for this site, given its location and the totality of the opportunities that accompany the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'city assets. I look forward to hopefully seeing those opportunities materialize in the coming months. For now, I would like to ask city staff if it's possible for us to reach out to the federal government to see if the Queen Mary would possibly qualify as a national monument similar to other attractions throughout the country.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm curious as to what that process would be and whether or not the Queen Mary is a feasible consideration. So I would request, if it's acceptable to the maker of the motion, that city staff consider that as an option when they come back to us in July.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mr. Mayor, can you hear me?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah, I do. For me, the last part cut off some. Can you repeat the friendly Councilman Price?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sure. If city staff can take a look at the process with the federal government to assess the feasibility of the Queen Mary being considered a national monument such that it would be treated similarly to other monuments throughout the country.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So it's looking at national monument status, I think, for staff to look at that. Is that correct, Councilwoman?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Much better articulated. Yes. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Great. Thank you. So that would be added to the act? Yeah. I mean, I think that's it's always good to look at that. I think Councilman Price. Councilman Price made a friendly councilman Alan.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes, I would. Absolutely.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. And Councilman, sorry, I'm assuming you accept that as well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Thank you. Next up, I have counselors and de Haas.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mary, and thank you for the comments from my colleagues. I think of the comic too, very, very important. And I, for one, am very happy that as a city we now have control of our beloved Queen Mary and the Queen Mary, such an integral part of our city's identity.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And it is a great value to many of our lifelong residents who perhaps were able to take pictures of their quinceaneras, their graduations, their proms, you know, with the with the Queen Mary in the background. Or maybe they even had their events there, like their weddings.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Or like me, I had my prom there at the Queen Mary many years ago. But, you know, it holds a lot of wonderful, wonderful memories. And so I'm very thankful that we have it and that we're going to be able to take care of that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I know that it has a lot of repairs that it needs. And thank you. Thank you, John, so much for the detailed and transparent presentation that you gave us. I know that on one of my last visits at the Queen Mary, I the elevator broke.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I had to take an adventure in getting to know the Queen Mary very intimately, where they escorted me out through a very different and very closed off way. But I know firsthand some of those repairs that need to be taken.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I really appreciate the transparent with the companies that we're using and the, you know, how we're moving forward, where the money is coming from. And I really think it's a great idea to actually look into it further and see if if we can be seen as a as the national monument.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Because anywhere we we go, Long Beach or the Queen Mary represents Long Beach. And so I think that's something that we all need to be very, very proud of. Nobody is going to be able to take care of the Queen Mary as much as we can now that we have it back in our hands.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And and now we have the ability to do so. So I'm really looking forward to being able to support the motion on the floor.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilmember Supernova. Thank you. I stand in support of tonight's item, but I just had a couple of questions because I think I heard it the wrong way that I clarified before July and I can ask all the questions and Christ, you can answer them all at once if he'd like.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I think I heard that the votes were to be removed, but then not to be removed. So if you can explain that, it's that just before July. Another point was, I think Elliot Page is saying group was referred to as a contractor.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Technically they're a subcontractor to Moffett Nicol. And so my question would be, would they come back? What's the likelihood of them coming back for a re-inspection or a more robust inspection before we get underway? That's it. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Councilmember super supernova, certainly. So short answer to the lifeboat question is we'd like to get them down over the next six months. So we would start the design process planning, how we would do that logistically immediately. And then over the next couple of months we'd remove them and begin the restoration of the two that are originals.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'To the second question about subcontracting, yes. Elliott Bay Design Group has some specific expertize with regard to these historic vessels that Moffitt and Nicole subcontracts for. They serve as an expert witness, but they also do engineering work, design and investigation modeling.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Flood modeling is a is a really important thing they do. And so they would be coming back as part of this agreement under Moffitt and Nicole as a subcontractor, simply because they have some very, very specific expertize.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Thank you. Thank you. That concludes council. Actually, Councilman Allen, I'm going to make some comments as well. But Councilman Allen, just some additional comments.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'No, I do not. That was my question was answered.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay, great. Let me make some comments. And I think we may have a public comment and we'll go go to go to the vote. Well, first, I just want to first, I actually I think I know everyone has I think had really good comments or I agree with what everyone has said all ultimately all of our colleagues'",
        "'speaker_2': 'on the council, this is a very, I think, unique opportunity for the city to really have this this chance to have not just the ownership of the ship, but have no lease in place. That is really, you know, causing the challenges for our ability to fully control kind of the future of the ship in front of us'",
        "'speaker_2': '. And so I think Mr. Morgan mentioned it's been over 40 years and and here we are for the first time in many decades where we have this very unique opportunity. I want to also just just know, I think I mean, I've said this publicly many times.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Preservation has to be at the center of what we do moving forward. Councilman Price mentioned this as as a national monument. I think that's fantastic. I believe currently the Queen Mary. It is, of course, a historic icon. We made a commitment to to to take care of and to preserve this piece of history.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think I believe the designation the Queen Mary has, I mean, similar to the designation of the Statue of Liberty as a historical place. Is that right, Mr. Keisler?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Mr. Mayor, I believe it's it's a national historic register for historic hotels. So I will confirm that in their report. Back to the council.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah, I thought there was a similar other type of designation as well, but let us know in the report back. And I'd be curious if I've heard that from a lot of residents that have approached me about the topic.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think obviously the preservation is really important as we as we as we move forward. I want to add something and I think a customer super now I know will agree with me on this. One thing that I'm really hoping that when we get back to the public discussion at the council is just the importance of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'having a actual public foundation for any major project, those being involved in the community hospital work and really the just saving of that amazing resource for the community. The council member will tell you that the foundation was just an important part, not just of community support, but also, of course, of funding important projects.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I know that there have been attempts in the past on kind of structuring a foundation board for the Queen Mary. I just want to make sure that the council and I receive a little bit of a historical perspective of what what how the foundations work.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I know there have been numerous groups that some that have had conditions or wanted to start foundations. I believe that there was a foundation in place recently that was just getting off the ground, but forming a community foundation that can be a source of of of fundraising, of support, of oversight, I think is going to be important'",
        "'speaker_2': 'in the short and long term. And so there's no need to, you know, to give in to that tonight. But I would like to see Mr. Murdoch. Mr. Keiser, let me come back just a further discussion about what the foundation could look like in the future and those that have shown interest.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They've also received interest from folks that want to be involved or have been involved in the past. Is that possible?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Absolutely. Yes, you're right. There have been some foundations in the past, some of which were not very successful. And there is one underway right now that we believe will be very successful. And we can certainly give you an update on that as well as how for people to get engaged involved.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's a great addition to our report back in January. In July.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Thank you. And then in addition to that, I think I'm very supportive of the critical repairs. So I'm really glad that that's where the focus is. That is that is obviously really, really important. And and I'm just to all of you just thankful that you that we got on this really quick.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And just also, more broadly speaking, I think it's important to kind of sit back and also just I think folks who have been involved, the truth is, is that and I told this to our city auditor over the weekend, I just also want to publicly thank our our city auditor, Laura Dowd, who has been on issues around'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the Queen Mary now for many years. And it's a lot of her audit work is also what led us to this point. And so I just want to publicly thank her for her kind of continuous oversight of the Queen Mary and and her oversight of the future of it as well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It has made and will make what happens in the future better. And so I just want to publicly thank her for her for her work on that. And so with that, I look forward to the one. I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'One more thing. Just wanted to also just convey I know that just earlier today and yesterday, the port leadership has conveyed to me and to our no competitor, to the city manager as well, that they view what happened with the city having the least as a very positive development in their conversations with the city as far as'",
        "'speaker_2': 'all of Pier H. And so I know that when the city session comes back to to us, it's sounding like Mr. City Manager in July will be able to have a robust conversation about kind of where things are at with that port analysis on Pier H as well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I look, I think we all look forward to those to those discussions. And I do agree that that the what Councilman Price and others talked about, the partnership, you know, whoever that partner ends up being is is critical as we move forward.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that's, I think, what we're all moving towards right now. So thank you all for for for that and for all the all the leadership on behalf of staff as well. And with that, I think there may be one public comment and then we'll go ahead and go to a roll call vote and control.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes. This is in control. And I appreciate this report and I appreciate the. The city attempting to hold on to the Queen Mary. I think it's known around the world as the icon of Long Beach. I do have some questions about.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Why we are making a contract with evolution hospitality, which I understand is a hotel business. When? As I understood it, there's going to be no one allowed on the Queen Mary except workers. For six months. Or at least six months while the repairs are being done.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And it sounded like we are. Promising. Asked to pay a revolution. Hospitality, $2 million. And I'm wondering what for? It sounds like Moffat Nicholls Public Works. The City staff will be working on this. What will Evolution Hospitality be doing?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Can somebody answer my question? Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. That concludes public comment for The Sentinel.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. I think, Mr. Kaiser, I think you had a slide that kind of listed some of the work that that what happened. Do you want to just briefly, again, just kind of review some of the work that that evolution evolution would be doing?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah, absolutely. So, um, there actually on, on staff, um, while the ship has closed over the past year, in fact, there's an entire security team. So not just on the perimeter of the ship, but there has not been one break in in the in the in the ship over the period of this last year.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Remember, we're also protecting the historic assets. It there's many, many historic assets on the ships that security is important and involves a whole team rotating 24 seven. It also covers all of our engineering team and maintenance team. And so in firing up those systems, even replacing belts and in light bulbs and turning things on and making sure'",
        "'speaker_5': 'that things are working. There's there's mechanical systems, plumbing, electrical warning systems, fire systems. All that stuff has to be run and managed on a day to day basis. And then, of course, there's there's basic custodial and other work that that happens, and that's pretty extensive.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so we have landscapers. We have with painting all that is happening even though the ship is closed. They're working every single day and making sure that that large facility is taken care of. So we also have huge electricity and power bills.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Believe it or not, there's a million square feet out there and powering it and and making sure that all our hookup fees, the technology, the power, anything that you have in your home, multiply that by about a thousand and those bills have to be paid as well.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I can get into further detail in a report to the council, if you like, but I was pretty impressed. It's pretty extensive and ultimately evolution is doing all that while the ship is closed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. Castro. And I'll add one last thing to that. And I know that evolution is also I'm ensuring that John Thomas is retained as kind of a historical preservation officer on during this time, and he has, of course, in the past.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And there's probably nobody in the city or very few people that know more about the Queen Mary than John Thomas does. And certainly his love for the ship, I think, is well known across the city. So that I know that evolution is also, I believe, has John as part of their team to kind of oversee some of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that preservation. And so with that, thank you very much. Got to take a roll call.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilwoman Sun has. I'm Councilwoman Allen. I Councilwoman Pryce. I councilman's subpoena.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'High.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilwoman mongo.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilwoman Sara.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Austin Vice Mayor Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Motion carried.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. I think that concludes the agenda. I don't see anyone signed up for any new business or announcements. So with that, I will go ahead and close the meeting and we'll adjourned until the next one. Thank you very much, everyone.'"
