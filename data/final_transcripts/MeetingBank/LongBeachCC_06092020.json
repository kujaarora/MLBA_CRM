In March, when the city the city council declared a state of emergency, the staff was asked to take a look at their operations and look for ways to develop resiliency, measures to assist the city residents and business leaders to return to normal life amid the economic the pandemic.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So this request tonight is for city council to adopt an ordinance that extends the expiration date for land use entitlements. These entitlements are essentially the city's approval to allow land to be developed in compliance with code regulations. And when they are approved, they are granted either by the Director of Development Services, the Zoning Administrator, Planning Commission, the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'City Council or the the Coastal Commission. They also include an expiration date whereby the the uses that are approved must be either developed or the use must be vested. And if they aren't vested within those expiration timeframes, the the entitlement is voided.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And if it's if an any entitlement is voided, it essentially means that the developer or the applicant has to start from scratch and file a new application because entitlements are costly to acquire both in dollars and in time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They are a significant they have significant value to the applicant, but they also serve an important public purpose. They encourage timely development of projects that are approved, and they also ensure that development approvals can be reevaluated if conditions on the ground change before the project is built.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So in times of economic stress, so just what we're experiencing right now, property owners may not be able to utilize their entitlements as quickly as they would under normal economic conditions. And the city's interest in these entitlements shifts to providing a more flexible approach for developers in order to encourage new development.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So staff is recommending with this action that all entitlements be extended for a period of two years and that this provision be retroactive to January 1st of 2020. There is a range of of different entitlement timeframes for various city approvals.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It could be anywhere from 12 months for the certificates of appropriateness that are approved by the Cultural Heritage Commission up to three years for track maps that are approved by the City Council. So what this action would do, it would essentially extend the the entitlement time period for approximately two years, but it would make a consistent three'",
        "'speaker_1': 'year entitlement across the board for any entitlement that the city council approved or that the city approves. We think that this is an appropriate action because it can take anywhere from 8 to 12 months to get an entitlement and then an additional 18 to 24 months for a developer to secure plans, get building permits and the like'",
        "'speaker_1': '. So we think it's a business friendly approach that also continues to protect the city because none of the approval processes will change, nor will any of the development standards change. So with that action, staff is recommending that City Council approved both of the ordinance, both for the Cultural Heritage Commission approvals, as well as for the land use'",

This item is a request for approval of the city's in an amendment to the city's consolidated plan to accept the federal COVID 19 CDBG and emergency shelter grant for COVID, the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'stimulus funds that were allocated to 34 of four COVID response.

        "'speaker_1': 'For shelter. Available to jurisdictions for their 2020 city BG allocations. So of this federal allocation, the city will receive $3.6 million in CDBG funds for COVID relief, as well as $1.8 million in emergency shelter grant funding specifically for COVID.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think I just want to point out that this is an immediate allocation. This funding that we're going to be talking about tonight is a is available immediately. It is only a portion of the approximately $9 billion that was allocated by the federal government.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we do we learned today that we will be receiving additional funding under both of these programs, both the emergency shelter grant, as well as the CDBG grants, specifically for COVID. So this is part one. Again, the proposal that I will be walking through tonight, talk specifically about the rental assistance, but with the subsequent funding, we are'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hoping to be more expansive in terms of the programs that we would be bringing back to this Council for consideration. Okay. What? Essentially, what the CARES Act does is it eliminates some of the provisions that cities would normally have to go through to expand their city by defunding.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I'll give you the broad categories under which the city can expend these COVID funds. They can spend it on building or public facilities. They can also use it for business and economic development, and they can also improve or enhance public services.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that's the category under which we are proposing staff implement the rental assistance program. The fourth category that it could be used for is for planning and technical assistance. And I think I would actually point out that there is an administrative component to these fees that's also included in this grant.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So as I talk about this program, I didn't mention it, but it will be all of the staffing costs associated with the implementation would be covered under the grant funding. So again, in early April, staff, once we received word of this allocation, we began looking at potential program areas with the objective to focus on areas or areas'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that weren't currently being served either by other state or federal programs or by local programs that have been put in place by by this council. With that in April, about April 21st, the city council, as the city manager mentioned, we got direction from the council to take a look at the county's rental assistance program.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we did so. And we were also, through the mayor's action, pursuing additional funding from the county. This program, however, reflects the city's very specific allocation, specifically for use in the south, in the city of Long Beach, because the county's program and their funding was available specifically for unincorporated county residents.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'However, we did look closely and confer with the county staff in terms of looking at how they administered their program. And we realized that because we could not share their program and nor their funding, we had to develop our own program.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But we wanted to make sure that we were at least looking at the components of their program, especially given that we were going to receive funding or we had anticipated getting some assistance from the county through Supervisor Hahn.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. As I mentioned earlier, there are three actions that the county's being that the city council is being asked to take. We are amending our current CDBG documents and these the amendment of these three documents, the citizen participation plan, our five year consolidated plan and our current fiscal year action plans.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The city will amend these documents as a basis to receive and implement the and expand the CARES Act funds. So I talked earlier about this being a special allocation and and HUD has seen fit to waive some of these standard requirements.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Those requirements that they waived are listed here. And I think it's been particularly helpful because the idea was so that we can get the money in hand and get it out to the to the community needs as quickly as possible.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So these these waivers essentially enable us to develop a program quickly and to get I guess, to just get it underway as quickly as possible. So I'll talk really briefly about the program elements. I mentioned earlier that the the $9 billion Federal Cares Funding Act of the the amount that's available to us currently there are 3.6 in'",
        "'speaker_1': 'city B g funds specifically for community development related activities under the federal objectives. There is also 1.8 for the emergency shelter grant and those funds are being currently implemented by the the city's Health and Human Services Department in addition to the federal funds.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Staff was asked to look to see if we could supplement this program funding with additional funds to to stretch it a little bit further. And we've been able to do so and are proposing an additional $2 million in CDBG funds to extend the the number of households that we can reach with this funding.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I'll walk you through really a highlight of the program proposals we are proposing to provide up to $1,000 in monthly rental assistance, up to $1,000 and up to three months. So a maximum of 3000 for any any one household.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And this would be for households, low income households earning 80% or less of the area, median income. And the criteria are that they would have to have experienced homelessness I'm sorry, experienced income loss due to COVID 19 or and they also have to make sure that the payments are made directly to the landlord.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And this was a part of the reason why staff thought that this was an appropriate spending mechanism, because there are currently no other programs that puts money directly into the hands of the landlord, specifically for rental payment and any of the other direct federal programs.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we thought that it would also be assisting landlords because they are in some cases small business owners at will as well. So we felt that this was hitting kind of hitting two areas of need in the community.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'As I mentioned, we modeled our program after the L.A. County program and adding the 2 million. In addition to the 3 million allocated by HUD, we will have a total of $5 million program. And if City Council adopts the program recommended by staff at 3000, a maximum of 3000, we could serve up to 1600 households.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If Council determines that they'd like to see some other financial allocation of these dollars. There are some options available and I'll just throw out a couple. For example, if we allocated up to $800 per month, that would serve approximately 2083 households.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And if you did something as as low as $500, that would allow us to serve even even more households up to just over 3300. But staff is recommending the $1,000. We do want to model it and be consistent with the county program because we are receiving an additional $300,000 in county funds from Supervisor Hahn.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I would just note that I mentioned earlier that the emergency shelter grant funds are being administered by the Health Department. And I would like to just point out that all the funds have to be expended by December of 2020.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I've included an income and a household size just for your reference, so you can get a sense of the eligibility for the program. And I just want to really briefly wrap it up by talking about how SAP would roll out the program.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We think that it's important that we spend an adequate amount of time marketing the program in the community. Appropriate noticing. We're thinking of a program of approximately a minimum of two weeks to make sure that we get the noticing out to the community.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We would work with stakeholders and others, including our economic development department, to get the word out to the communities as well as council offices. We will make sure that the application materials are available online, but we would provide direct staff assistance to mail the applications to anyone who would like to apply for the program.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Lastly, we are recommending that we use a lottery system to receive the applications that we receive in the mail. We would ask for a minimum of 2000 lottery spots be given and then we would work through those to identify the qualifying households and again proceed to implement the program.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We would do a very strong language access component just to make sure that the the applications as well as all of the program information are available in multiple languages in the community. We do have staffing to complete this task and we are ready and anxious to move forward with Council's recommendation of this program.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I again just highlighting that we did receive funding from Supervisor Hon and this funding of 300,000 will enable us to support an additional 100 households. So if we go with staff's recommendation, that would be approximately 1700 households.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This concludes staff's presentation and I'm available to answer any questions. I will leave up on the board the next steps. And that's a rough schedule of how the program would be rolled out. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. And thank you to the team for that. That's a great, great update. I want to I do have a motion in a second already. I'll go to those in a minute. I just want to add how important it is for the city to give direct financial assistance to to renters and to tenants.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Essentially, this is a program that's going to give tenants in Long Beach that are were affected by COVID 19 with direct rental assistance. And we're talking about $1,000 a month. We know that for many that is not enough.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But that is going to be that is going to help a lot of working people and working families in our community that need that support. So I want to thank First Councilwoman Janice Hahn for adding to our our program.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's significant. We're still asking and seeking for more dollars so we can make this program even more robust. Also want to thank Councilman Austin, who is kind of leading this effort at the at the council here as well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I know he's queued up to speak next. And so I want to thank him and his work. And I've heard from from from renters across the city, they need this additional support. And and I'm really proud that the city was able to put this program together.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Let's get it done and let's get it and let's get folks the support that they need. So with that, I want to turn this over to Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And I want to thank staff for their quick response and quick work on this particular item. We brought this forward maybe three weeks ago. I'm going to I'm really amazed at how quickly our city can respond under crisis.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We asked if this was feasible, if this was possible to be able to develop a rental assistance program. And you guys came through in a big way. $5.4 million is nothing to sneeze at. It will help a lot of working families.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The mayor said it will also help a lot of housing providers, property owners who are behind on their mortgages as well. I believe this these funds will go directly to the landlords and I'm encouraged after our state led committee and know that our city, our lobbyists in Washington, D.C., are working very diligently to get more resources in'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the next round of Cares and Hero program. And so with that said, I'm thrilled to have been able to bring this forward. I'm even more elated that we are able to provide this assistance to many families in our city.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Of course, not enough, but we'll work to continue to get the funding as it comes available in the next weeks and months to come. And so with that, I'd like to make the motion to support the staff recommendation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Of $1,000 a month of up to $1,000 a month. But before I do that, I do want to ask what the up to actually means because probably less.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And yes, it means that because they will have to show the actual arrears of the rent as well as what their monthly rent payments are, they would get up to whatever their standard rent payment is, up to a maximum of 100.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So it could actually, in theory, be less if their rent is less than 1000 per month.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Thank you for that clarification. With that, I make the motion. Thank you. And ask for my colleagues to support as well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilmember Austin. Excellent work. I love this program. I think that it's exactly what's needed at this time. I do appreciate the thoughtfulness that came from staff in setting this up. I would only say that if I were a tenant or a landlord and I was waiting for a lottery to determine my ability to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In my apartment or my housing. It just seems to me like a big risk. I guess my question for staff is if you were to take a guess at how many applicants we would receive, what would be your thoughts?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We don't have a really good idea. I think in large part it depends upon how how exuberant we are with the advertising and we are going to try to do that is as widely as possible. I think it will be.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I would just throw it a wild guess and say probably 3000. And I will tell you that the need in the community is far greater than that. I mean, if you look at the need based upon incomes in the community, the impact of COVID, if you look at overcrowding, if you look at overpayment of rent, all of'",
        "'speaker_1': 'those are factors that determine need. So we know that the need is great. It's it's just hard to to guesstimate. But if I had to throw out a number, I'd say upwards of 3000 applications. And then for. Your process?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Will we be providing technical assistance to individuals who'd like to apply? You said they would mail in their application. What does that look like? Is it simple? We have a hotline established to provide technical assistance to applicants, and we will be providing assistance.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We will mail applications out to those who don't have direct computer access to download the applications. So in short, we'll be doing everything we can to encourage a very robust outreach for this program, as well as a robust support system, as well for applicants who want to submit.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I'm not making a friendly amendment or anything. I'm just going to throw some ideas out there if the city staff think we'll be receiving up to 3000 applications. My thought would be that we would look for a way to be able to meet 100% of the need.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Meaning that. Of course, we'd like to receive another $5.3 million, which would get us up to 3400 homes. That up to $1,000, but we don't have that today. And so my only thought would be that we do have today it's $5.3 million.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And if we gave 50% rent to 3200 people and then a second payment came in for $5.3 million, we would already have everyone pre-qualified and ready to potentially get a second payment and then everyone theoretically who applies could get help.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Now, I'm not the main guru of this idea, and I didn't write the program. I didn't do the research. I really would love to hear from my colleagues, not my motion. I appreciate the opportunity to secure it and be a part of it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I want to make sure that the idea, though, that if I were one of the applicants, I would rather receive 50% of the money than a 5050 chance of getting zero. That would just be my initial gut reaction.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Let me just keep going down. I have a few more speakers. Councilmember Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Thank you. Councilmember Austin and staff for all of your work on this. I have a couple of questions for Linda and then a couple questions for our city attorney. I really, really appreciate this. The need is great and we know that even the people that have received unemployment, it's not enough for them to pay all'",
        "'speaker_2': 'their bills and pay all their rent. So my first clarifying question is, is this money going to the tenants or the landlords? Because I thought last time it was directly to the landlords.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The Court The criteria that are specified by HUD will require the payment be made directly to the landlord. So we work with the tenant to qualify the tenant, and once the tenant is qualified, the actual payment will go directly to the landlord.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Great. That's what I thought. The second point, Stacie Councilmember Margo, I know you mentioned it's not. We don't have to get into a back and forth. But my concern with that would be that some people might get a job by, say, you know, September or October and then they wouldn't qualify for the second part of the payment'",
        "'speaker_2': '. So I would just worry about people not being able to get the rent assistance that they need. You know, if it is one or two months instead of the full three months. So that is that point. And then I have questions for our city attorney.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we this council, we I'm really proud of all the work that we've done on this council around renter issues and tenant issues. And I think, you know, while some of us, more than others, would like to see programs in place around, you know, prohibiting rent increases in their fault evictions, but we're not going to do that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'for the entire city. We know that. And my question for the city attorney is here we are giving city funds or county funds and CDBG funds. Could we say that for those landlords that accept this funding, where their tenant qualifies for this funding, that they then would agree to a temporary prohibition on rent increases, say, until the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'end of when tenants are paying their rent. So like July 31st, is that something that could be done with these funds?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm going to ask Rich Anthony to respond to that question.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Over.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hey, can people hear me? This is Rich Anthony.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, Rich. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sorry about that, Billy. If what you're. I think the answer is maybe. Let me understand what you're asking a little better.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I don't think.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That the city can say if a tenant applies for.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This assistance and qualifies that the landlord.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Is.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Or then to not raise rent or to not.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Engage in a no fault eviction.'",

And since then, every indication our city is that we're heading in the right direction. Are police statistics the things that we've doing is heading the right direction.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This moment calls for us to accelerate and reform and commit to meaningful policy change, meaningful systems change consistent with this moment, consistent with our values for the future. So tonight, I'm asking my colleagues to support this framework. I'm asking them to commit to the framework, but throw into the kitchen sink the types of things you're you've heard'",
        "'speaker_5': ', the types of things you want to see reviewed. We want to make sure we have high level staff ready to receive these things and make sure they're considered into this process. If you have thoughts on what needs to be reformed in our city, throw it into the kitchen sink, throw it all into this kitchen sink.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And and immediately following this, we want to be clear, and I encourage my colleagues to echo if echo and let the city manager know that this is a top priority for the city council and that is urgent and should be treated as an emergency.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That said, those conclude my comments. I would like to hear from my colleagues on what reforms they like to see within this come out of this framework or what types of things we want to evaluate, what are the things that we want to commit to explore and what types of reforms that our intentions are clear at the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'very beginning. Thank you for your time.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Next up is council member Austin.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And first of all, I want to acknowledge Councilmember Rich and his team for putting together a very, very comprehensive item. That I think of the covers most of it. I mean, that's a very good job of doing that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so so I salute him in his esteem for doing that. I was happy to sign on to go on sponsor of this item. Obviously also want to acknowledge my colleagues, the rest of the city staff for their acknowledgment and understanding of this very pivotal time that we are in.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I want to thank you all for your collective commitment to change on Long Beach, but also being a catalyst for change for our entire country. We can show people how it's done. We are a special city. And this also I want to acknowledge those who are taking action today and have been taking action over the last ten'",
        "'speaker_4': 'or 12 days or so of protesting for change. Outraged by what they have seen. Today we are grieved as a nation of the horrific death of George Floyd. May he rest in peace. Today we began a difficult and we begin a difficult process of preparing for reconciliation, which will frame the pathway to justice, the systemic change.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Today, Long Beach has a responsibility to George Floyd, his family, really every black person in this city in America to acknowledge that his life mattered, that all black lives matter. This tragic event has awakened the world to this country's ugly truth.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Nation. With white supremacy at its foundation, a nation that is not equal to everyone. A nation with great wealth. Where oppressive black people and poor people are. Nor a nation that is and is fatally flawed. And has fatally flawed systems.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Economic systems, health care systems, education systems and policing and in 2020 still do not afford liberty and justice for all. Today in our city, we have a duty to advance equity and opportunity and to create a place where every resident has opportunities and feels respected regardless of their race or socioeconomic status.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'As a city council, we have a duty to be smarter and more intentional with our decisions. The resource allocation. My responsibility today is to help lead this city through this moment. Then my life experiences perspective, I believe, has prepared me for very well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I feel like our work presence on this council at this time more purposeful than ever with the work before us. And so I don't take this duty casually in any way because I recognize that this is. Arguably the most impactful work they will do.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Together as elected leaders in this city. We've made progress certainly in this city. We have lot to be proud of. But in light of what we are experiencing today, it's put a light sunshine and we still have much work to do to improve conditions for a large percentage of our city.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And to the community. I would like to say I'm accepting this charge. I'm prepared to listen and listen more than I speak. I want to learn. I want to act accordingly. My actions on this council do advocacy with our state and federal partners officials, because that is where a lot of change will come as well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We won't be able to breathe it as a city until we deliver and deliver on the promise of liberty and justice for all. So we deliver on the promise of racial equity. And we work to truly. Change the systems that have oppressed so many for so long.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And, you know, like I said, this is a a major moment in our city's history. No more wrecks you challenged us to will throw everything at the kitchen sink. And I have an item coming up which I think will be a great first step because we have a civilian oversight process.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That I'm not sure that everybody is aware of. I'm not sure that everybody has full confidence in. But that is one area that I want to see us immediately tackle from an administrative standpoint. And then talk about opportunities to to change potentially change the charter in doing so.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so I'm going to reserve my comments for now because I want to hear from my colleagues as well. But I'm fully in support of this item, happy to second it and look forward to the discussion and the progress that we will make together collectively as a city, as a city team, but as a community to really'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Yes. Thank you, Mayor. You know, if you were at the city hall today at 9 a.m.. I just want to see Tom. And they said came. It was the beginning of some transformation. Having lived through three rides in the city, the inequities have occurred across the country.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I find it very hard to form words. So I'm just going to talk about the issues that bothers me and the things that I fought for in my community every day. I don't really talk on this subject that much.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I believe that being on the stage is about opening the doors to the community and the respect we have, the privilege and the honor to be voted in. And I want to share the battle and the challenge. I see because this is a listening tour reunion, the stakeholders coming forward.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There are things I would like to see Long Beach do better, and I am committed to doing my part to see the change. I mean, no disrespect to any of my colleagues. If some of these issues seem foreign to you, the kind of issues that affect the success and the community of color and you may have to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'do not have to deal with them. But I brought up. Against these issues every day. And I drive in my community and sometimes I feel I'm the only one. How is it that the minorities make up the large part?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The Refuge Team. I'll get. Okay. And it is a career that gets many people with their record in the door to be part of a city team. How can we do more to bring local and diverse hiring practices for permanent positions with the benefit to the community of corporate?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'How is it that someone can live in our community but still don't have experience working in certain parts and dealing with that of the community? Yet they continue to accept a supervisor position because they do not have a college degree.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'How is it that our Workforce Development Department and Youth Workforce Office is one of the most provincial areas of the city? And we started by saying we can't issue people that live in the inner city bus passes to get there.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'How is it that we have a nonprofit that simply asked to help relocate and do work in partnership with workforce partners? And we cannot come up with additional aid. How is it that we. Yes. Now I'm trying to strive for the African American culture in.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'How did the city police complaint in Michigan? Does that have an opportunity to have someone who's actually been arrested to serve on it? How? That we can take away community watch programs like Grit. How is it that we do not have a gang unit yet?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We continue to see our black and Latinos get. While under arrest in Japan, getting watches on this list. How is the world going to work with our city prosecutor in city attorney office and talk about expanding the level of the playing field and make it a level playing field?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'How would you say we are going to, you know, incorporate all the commissions like the Civil Service Commission to be involved, the change that we're going to do? Are we going to work with the school district to start these conversations about community and policies?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Are we going to diversify our budget so that the rate does not have to do the work? They don't have the current staffing for. I did set up standup outreaches in the Mecca and even go to knock on someone's door because their neighbors has a problem.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There was a time when it came out the police would play basketball with former gang members. And because we wanted to we wanted to brag about this because those conversations and get away from this people that you are we grew up that we did not we do not fight this we we did not.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But just to go ahead. Why are we having these kind of policemen if we need that in our justice? The policy caused this policy cause we look at My Brother's Keeper and what about my sister's keeper? Let's talk about women and about elevating something like that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I know I've talked a little more than usual, but this is a great item. I want to highlight that even though Rhett and I do not always see eye to eye, our hearts are way in the right place.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Just do up by community and not forget where we came from. We are from three different areas, but we are brothers and it is an honor to serve with them on this diocese. And I want to thank everyone for giving me a chance to speak on this island.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor. I wanted to make sure. Of course. I don't think it's lost on anyone. Of course that we have three three amazing council members, of course, three members from the black community that have long histories in the city and and a history of leadership.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I want to thank the three of you, Councilman Richardson, Vice Mayor Andrews, Councilmember Austin, for all, of course, coauthoring the item and for the leadership that you guys are all displaying in this crisis and in the past as well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I know we have everyone queued up to speak. Most folks get up to speak. And so I want to before I get to that, I'm going to make some some general comments and then I know we're going to get into more of a discussion.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Just let me just begin by saying that they said also last week, I join the the peaceful protesters in expressing my grief, my outrage over the death of George Floyd. This has been a very, very difficult time for not just Long Beach, for our country and for our community.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'What we're seeing in America's streets is a call for action and demands for justice and racial equity. And there's no question we still have a long way to go to achieve Dr. King's dream of equality for all of racial justice for black Americans.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so it's up to us, I think, first and foremost, to acknowledge that we have a problem. And that's how you begin a fixing are the systemic issues that we have in our institutions by acknowledging that we have a problem.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We know that for far too long. And then really every aspect of American life, black Americans have not experienced equal treatment. I mean, this is the case not just in government institutions, which we run, obviously the city, but it's true in our education system, too, and workforce.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's true in in the nonprofit world, black Americans have not experienced equal treatment. This is not that Long Beach is not accepted. Accepted by that. We Long Beach is no exception to that and there are no exceptions to that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We know that the peaceful demonstrations that we've seen are an important part of our local history and the civil rights movement across the country as well. And we also know what is what we're hearing out in the community.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It is demands and action is being asked of us as a city. I want to commend this. This concept of a framework for the city. This framework for reconciliation. I think the most important part of this is that it's been obviously put there's a lot of thought that has gone into this framework.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I know that the key piece of this, of course, is acknowledging the existence of systemic racism in this country, that we all know that to be true. And the listening piece and I think that is something that I think is really important for us.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'One thing that I've heard from our black friends, from black organizers and community members is before we get too far ahead of what we think should happen, it's important for us to listen to the community as to what actions need to happen.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so I respect and honor that. And we started that work. And just I just yesterday I was with a variety of young people and youth that were sharing their stories with me. And I want to thank them.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And, and those young, young people from the YMCA and the youth that really shared their stories of growing up in Long Beach and their challenges and fears. And I want to uplift that and continue to do that. Listening.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think what's great about the opportunity to listen is it gives then us an opportunity to really ensure that the entire city is part of that process, including our management team and our staff. And I want to thank I know, Councilman Richardson, you uplifted that and mentioned that, and I support that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In this process. And in the listening piece, of course, you listen to bring people together and then to to have action. And there needs to, of course, be assurances from the community that we are going to have an action plan out of this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think that's part of this process. I also want to go back to something that Councilmember Richardson was alluding to, which I think and I think he's right. I think, you know, we we we know that the Long Beach Police Department has come a long way in in reforms.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You think about just the last five years there we have every officer that's trained in de-escalation. We know that mental health and racial equity are now trained within the department, and there's a lot more accountability measures in place.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This council has been a leader on body worn cameras, and so has our rank and file officers who've been involved in that process. And if you look at issues just around use of force, for example, use of force incidents just last year, I believe, were the lowest they've probably been in many years, and including the use of'",
        "'speaker_3': 'force, which has declined, but also the officer involved shootings have dramatically declined. And so that tells me that at the rank and that there is progress. And like any organization, when you have progress, you still have more and more to do.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'All of us, all our institutions have a long way to go to get better and to meet the needs of our community. I want to I wanted to say that and it's important and it's important to note this as this discussion has been going on, that all aspects of American life and our institutions need to be reviewed'",
        "'speaker_3': '. It's something that all of us as a city need to listen to and uplift. We know that we are committed as a community to reforms. We want to strengthen them. And I look forward to the conversations in the weeks ahead with the community, with black organizers, with students to address this crisis facing our nation.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We will listen. We will dialog, and then we will act. And so I know our community and our country are counting on us. And I look forward to discussion ahead this evening. And so thank you, Councilmember Richardson, for and I'm taking a leadership role in the framework.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And to the other members that have put this this agenda item together with the community. So thank you for that. And with that, I want to turn this over to the other members of the council. Next up is council.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Councilwoman Pryce. Actually, I think you remember that. Senator Pearce, I know you were an agenda agenda item this week next or did you want to wait?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'd love to be able, sir. I see you. Go ahead also.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Are you sure? I don't mind. I can wait.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah. Let me go. I thought I was next so I would go.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Go ahead, please. I'll go after you. No problem.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Think about the system as that. You never know where you are in the queue. So you only lie on point like. Can I go to the bathroom? No, not yet. Okay. Thank you, guys. Really, I want to ground us in the words that were said before you and I, Mayor and I really appreciate the leadership and the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'big picture vision that Councilmember Richardson has put in front of us. And that really is process. And anybody that knows me, I always talk about process and how important it is to listen. And so to hear each of the areas of deep concern for our African-American council members, it's really important that we root this conversation and that'",
        "'speaker_2': '. And so I want to thank you for that. Of this item. You know, I know it kind of moved fast and so many pieces of it are critical. The acknowledging, which was powerful to hear council council member, powerful to see the work that Tom Modica has done to really make sure that our city employees, possibly for the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'first time ever, have been told race matters, you matter. And I'm here to listen to you this morning was very powerful to see all of the words and the thoughts, to hear from our own city employees that have said, my brother was arrested.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'My cousin was this I experienced this oppression. And it really is when we talk about the whole city. It is systematic oppression. When we think back to how this country was started, it was formed. In a way that was built on oppression.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Our railroads are built on oppression. A lot of our buildings are built with that. Our roads, our cities, the foundation of them were built on believing that somebody else was less than us. And I, when we ground ourselves in that, I think it gets really emotional because I don't think that anybody on this council or in the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'city government believes in that model. We all want to believe that we're not racist. We all want to believe that the system is fair because we've had the 13th Amendment, because we've gotten out of what we would call Jim Crow era.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But we haven't. And the way that we know that we haven't is in our very own numbers. L.A. County alone. Councilmember Richardson spoke to COVID. So the numbers of COVID in L.A. County alone yesterday were blacks are dying 2 to 1 to whites.'",
        "'speaker_2': '2 to 1. Two to me. In our county. We know that these numbers are real. We know that black women are spending 63% of their income on rent. Can each of you out there listening think about spending 63% of your income on rent and maybe you're a single mom, maybe you have a kid, maybe you have two'",
        "'speaker_2': '. What that means for us and why we've been fighting in this city for so long on some of these issues, we know that in the city of Long Beach, we have a life expectancy difference of 17 years. That's from our own city report.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilmembers Richardson, Austin and Dee mentioned, we know we've got the tools in Long Beach to address these issues, whether it's everyone in, whether it's the Office of Equity, whether it's issues around our housing. My Brother's Keeper. My Sister's Keeper.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But it's been it's helped. And I don't want to diminish the work that it's done. But until our entire city says racism exists within our bones, we will not change it. So we realized that in 2014, blacks were arrested four times more than whites.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In 2015, we were the most violent. In 2016. One which had a killing rate of 10.6 persons per year. And I agree, Mayor, that this city, from the time that I got on the council to today, I feel like our numbers are probably really great.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But telling my community members and my neighbors that our block or my neighbors that have had their kids go through some part of the system, hey, guess what? We're better today without any facts in front of me. It's really hard.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so as we talk about listening, it's taking those stories of our black community with us into every meeting that we take. Even if we think nothing about race in that meeting and I'll lift up health and our climate.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We got a lengthy letter today that was authored by SONA. One of our environmental committee members are Sustainable Commission. And she lifts up these numbers about health, the fact that African-Americans don't have the same level of access to health care, that the number one cause of death for many of them are diseases that are caused by poor'",
        "'speaker_2': 'environmental quality. Like heart disease, like asthma. These are the numbers that tell our story, Long Beach. Our story is not, hey, we're doing better in this one department. Our story has to be that we're doing better for everyone because we know whenever the person that is the most oppressed in the city is doing well, that we're all'",
        "'speaker_2': 'doing well. We should all all of us in the city of Long Beach be thriving to make sure that the person that is the most oppressed that is on the streets of this city have every access to better health care, housing, education, because we know for them this moment is the moment that's going to matter most for'",
        "'speaker_2': 'them. So when we talk about what to throw in the kitchen sink? Councilmember Richardson The first thing that we have to do is we have to get data and it has to be transparent. I have said many emails to many people inside City Hall asking for numbers, and I've been told that we were going to get numbers'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and that we would have a report. Over the last ten years. For. I think in my heart that we have done better in Long Beach PD. But I'm a data person and I don't see those numbers. And so the first, I want to make sure that we are building transparency and trust with our police department.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that's going to take them sharing everything that they can. The numbers of use of force, the demographics of who has been involved in those, both on the officer side and on the public side. We want to know the best practices in the country.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'What are the best practices in the city that in cities that have made sure that these numbers have gone down so that our police officers can walk down the street proud? Because I'm sure right now this is probably a really tough time for all of them, but it's been a really tough time for our black community for'",
        "'speaker_2': '400 years. And so we're going to have to go through an uncomfortable process, and it has to be genuine. I want us to make sure that we're talking about, as mentioned by also by Councilmember Richardson. The four areas of our city where we can really make structural change.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Our budget. There's a lot of words being thrown out there. The first thing I want to say is we need to know what's in our budget. I have personally, I don't have the details of what's in our police budget.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I don't know what even to say about that. Right. And I know that we've got youth that we've fought to get $200,000 for youth funding for them, which we got, which was great. We've got a youth strategic plan that needs to make sure it has a race lens on it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Right. And that we're talking about how do we how do we make sure that crime doesn't happen in the first place to make an excuse to be able to have more officers than we might need? How do we make sure we're investing on the front end in our health department, in our kids and our job program, and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that we're really thinking outside the box. To do that, we need data. And I've said that since I've been on this council. And so I'm very excited about this opportunity to hopefully be really transparent with our city budget.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I know this budget year is tough and it's going to be fast. I'm looking forward to our charter conversations, but I understand that charter changes are going to have to wait because we don't have an election coming up that we can put charter changes on.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So then I'm really going to ask staff to put everything and every thought into it. Whenever we talk about the muni code, what are we doing on the muni code that we can really make sure we have some community oversight because every city is funded by the taxpayers and the taxpayers are undocumented residents.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There are people that come through our city and our tourists, their residents. And I've lived here forever and they're tenants that have lived here. And so what are we making sure that in our muni code that we are creating, if possible, a civilian oversight committee that is free from the city structure that we have.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I want to see what that looks like. I want to see the best practices in the whole country for how we can make sure we do that and have real, clear transparency. Because when we have situations like today, people are speaking up that we never thought would speak up.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We have commissioners and almost every single commission that the city has, it has said something about how they want the city to be moving forward and we have to listen to them. And Tom, I know that sometimes I get a little mushy with you because hiring you was a big deal to me.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It was my what I thought was going to be the last big step that I took as a council member. And one of the biggest things that was an issue for me as a white woman was you being white and being in the city for so long.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I am so proud of the courage and the dedication that you have made to everybody in the city. And when I say that comment, I hope it doesn't trigger anybody, but it's just diversifying. Our leadership is important so that we can have black stories leading the conversation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But we also have to recognize that you are extremely skilled. You're extremely thoughtful. I think you've been great for the city, and I think you're going to be wonderful leading us through this process. So I'm so proud. So those four areas being able to look at them and really talk about them is the most important.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We have transparency that we're talking about budget items that we're talking about our use, that we're making sure that our conversation goes outside the city walls and we're talking with educational institutions and business improvement districts. I know one of my birds is so excited about going through this reconciliation process with their own community members.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We have to do this not just for George Floyd, but we have to do it for Tyler Woods, for Hector. Or Dante. I'm sorry for Hector. Moran for Dante. Jordan or for Ross. Moran for Noel Aguilera. For Aerial Smith, Vermonters.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'For Martin. Corrado for Berry. Brock for Jason. I know Gibson for Kerry. Michael found some for Louis Ramirez. For Jordan. Michael Griffin for Katherine Gomez. And for Marcella Byrd. For Frederick Tapp, who was killed by a white supremacist.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We owe it to these people to make sure that we root out systematic racism and acknowledge our own racism within ourselves. Thank you, Councilmember Richardson, often, Andy, for bringing this item forward.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Thank you, Councilmember. I know I've got obviously everyone queued up, so when I get to those, I want to just to clarify something also, I think that I think Councilmember Pearce, you you and I both asked this question on data.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think just so that you get one of those answers now, I think that the police department is working on. My understanding is, remember, they've done back now, I think about five years. They're trying to go back ten years.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So, Mr. Modica, I think that's something from I heard earlier today that the request that's being made by the Council is coming to the council pretty soon. Is that right? Yes, Mr..'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Mayor. So we see this and we we hear loud and clear that data is important. We couldn't agree more. There is a lot that we have to share, and that data does take some time to get together. We have started already.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We can provide some of the use of force statistics and officer involved shooting statistics. But we do understand and you know, there are some requests from the council, but we're really going to be launching into kind of a review of the data.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We're going to be asking our innovation team to help us with that and to actually help display it and make it understandable and transparent and have have that available for this part of the discussion. So we we are going to be making a commitment on that and and providing a lot of those data.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. Modica. Thank you. And I hope that also answers whatever comes your questions. Let me go to the queue and I know some people are queue to back up, so we'll get to everybody first and then we'll go back around.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Councilwoman Price.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Can you hear me?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. I want to thank my colleagues who have brought this item forward, especially my African-American colleagues, because no matter how many experiences we share in common, there are many experiences that we don't share in common because of our backgrounds.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They may not ever know the experience of a child who came to America during a revolution in her own country and learned to speak the language with her mother as they made their way in the new world. And I may not ever know the conversations that each of them had at their dinner table with their families and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'their children that I may not ever have to have with my own children. And I want to thank our city manager, because he did. Right. Send an email that was just so profound and had a few points in it that really I've thought a lot about over the last few days.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that was one of those points. I'm grateful for this opportunity to listen and to learn. And I like what Vice Mayor Andrews shared earlier in his comments, which was acknowledging that we may not always agree or see eye to eye on every issue.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I think having worked with this group of people for six years that I can say whole heartedly with every fiber in my body that every member of this council is a good person and cares about this city.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Even if we don't agree on every issue. But this is an opportunity where I think we are all aligned and we all will be focused as we move forward as a city. The events we have seen locally and throughout the nation require that we be on the right side of history and take this moment seriously and focus'",
        "'speaker_1': 'on the important issues of justice, accountability and fairness. These are issues that should be at the heart of everything that we do. That should always be the case. And it's very tragic that it took the life of George George Floyd to remind us of that important value.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We must make significant progress to ensure that our city is at the forefront of responsible and accountable policing, as well as on the focus of residents in the city of Long Beach. Every single one of them knowing that they are protected by our police and can trust in the integrity of our system.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Nationally, we have seen the devastating misuse of power by a minneapolis police officer against George Floyd. The impacts of that officer's actions were, of course, devastating and unconscionable for the Floyd family. But the impact has been so much broader.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I can tell you that as a prosecutor of 20 years, that is not the type of justice I signed up for. Like most people in this country, I, too, have been able to reflect on the tragic and violent events that we have all seen, highlighting the need for more action.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And as Councilman Richardson said, an opportunity to listen and meaningfully dialog. One of the things I really enjoyed from reading our city manager's email is an ask that he made of the city employees that we have honest dialog without fear of saying the wrong thing or without fear of being judged.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I know that his council members. There are times when we have very passionate people inside the council chambers advocating for something that's very important to them and a simple disagreement, even though it might be stated in the most respectable way, respectful way can be misinterpreted as not caring about an issue of the fundamental heart of a discussion'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that we're having. And I'm hoping that this opportunity is one where we allow one another to speak our minds and be heard and ask questions without judgment. I am saddened, deeply saddened by the police officer related tragedy that resulted in George Floyd's death in Minnesota.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I have also spent hours and days and years, decades working with police officers as well as victims and their families. Dedicating my entire career to seeking justice and to ensuring that families who are victims of crimes get closure that they deserve when they are the victim of a gang crime, sexual assault, or a homicide, which are my'",
        "'speaker_1': 'personal areas of specialty. My life is devoted to the pursuit of justice. And when we see real acts of injustice perpetrated by those meant to serve and protect, it shines a further light on the vast divides we see throughout America today.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think most Americans can understand the frustration and sense of anger felt by many protesters as they pursue this nation's goal of a more perfect union. I cannot support riots, vandalism or burglaries at any level while local small businesses are struggling during this pandemic.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I understand the deep feelings of fatigue and frustration in protesters throughout this country that have not seen the prosperity that's been promised to them in the American dream, and instead may feel a sense of an ongoing injustice.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have recently seen a significant moment in Long Beach develop into a historic movement around the nation to confront real issues and seize on opportunities to improve our existing systems. We have the opportunity to evaluate our current models and make necessary changes for our system to improve.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But we have to do that as we also continue to run our city. We do want residents to feel trust and not be fearful of officers. And we cannot allow for a system that protects those, misuse their powers as defined under the laws and the protections of this nation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'As the city of Long Beach depends on the trust and faith in our police officers and their commitment to working with the community every day to keep us safe. As a councilmember, I'm committed to help our city every day with justice as my guiding principle.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'As the Chair of the Public Safety Committee, I will continue to do my part to shine a light on these issues. And in addition to pushing for body worn cameras with my fellow committee members. Councilman Austin and Councilman Super Doll.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And before that, Councilwoman Mango and other tools such as public outreach and education and community policing, which have been topics we have discussed. Our committee is committed to looking at best practices and helping our police department continue to adopt best practices.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I will say that it's been stated a number of occasions already tonight that our police department has continued to evolve and develop best practices in the six years that I have been here. This is reflected in their current statistics, and in my personal opinion, the improvements in the statistics is a direct result of the investment that we'",
        "'speaker_1': 'have made in our police department. The commuting, community, policing and transparency measures that we have employed throughout our department has been significant in terms of budget impacts. But those investments have resulted. And better statistics and improvement all around.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There is still a lot more to do. We are a community of many races, ethnicities, life experiences and beliefs. But from this varied spectrum, we share one community, we share one city. And people often talk about this term.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'A Tale of Two Cities. I'll be honest, I don't like that because I think it unnecessarily divides us. We are one city with opportunities and challenges in each area of the city. And areas that we need to help promote, build up and support so that we can continue to be better as a city together.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We share a common desire to see our homes safe. Our families protected and representing the needs of everyone, regardless of what part of town they live in. Everyone should expect basic services and protections from their city. Long Beach is a strong community and the peaceful protests we have seen in every corner.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Of this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'City brings so many residents together to support our city, charting a course towards positive changes in the future. I believe that we are one family. Yes, all nine of us, as well as our mayor on this council. We have served together, many of us, for six years.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I believe that together we can honor the message of needed and prudent and realistic progress. We must act deliberately and with purpose, while bearing in mind that public safety and protection of every resident in this city remains a core responsibility for our city.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I want to say that we are going to, as a public safety committee, start this conversation, this listening, this educating and this exploration of best practices adopted throughout this nation. On June 23rd, when we have our public safety meeting.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I expect to have a number of proposals that I won't be asking the police department to evaluate and consider in terms of adopting some changes for our own public safety teams. This item read beautifully. Councilman Richardson The item was written beautifully and I appreciated the elephant comments of many of my colleagues.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'As I shared with Councilwoman Richardson, I do have some questions about some of the specifics of this item. So I'll put it out there, and I'm sure somewhere it'll come back to Councilman Richardson or perhaps the city attorney to weigh in on what exactly are we voting on tonight.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Because, for example, when it comes to the ballot measure, I really don't have any idea about what the ballot ballot measure. Well, I don't even really know what the subject matter of it would be. So that was discussed and I missed it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I apologize, but I do want to have a conversation about that because I don't feel comfortable voting on something that I've never seen. And we're going to need to do public outreach and communication. And I know that it was referred to the ballot measure being maybe a placeholder so that we can bring a ballot measure in the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'future. But I'm not sure from talking with the city attorney whether that's possible without some substance to the item. So with that, I want to thank you, Mr. Mayor, for giving me the opportunity to talk on this topic.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I look forward to hearing from my colleagues and a little bit more specificity on what exactly we're voting on tonight. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Next up is council member Ringo.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mayor. And everyone is so eloquent tonight in their comments because it's speaking from the heart, just like I was speaking from the heart, just to put a little bit of our historical perspective on things. Of course, remember, again, Vice Mayor Rudy Andrews somewhat brought it up about being involved and having experienced other.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Riots, if you want to call that disturbances that we've had in the past. We certainly had hours here in Long Beach this time around, but we also had one in back in 92 of the Rodney King situation. And then when I was a kid growing up in East Los Angeles, there were the Watts riots that that I'",
        "'speaker_4': 'lived through. So we've all had our experiences. But what I can say about Long Beach is that when we had our disturbances here in 92, there were some positive things that came out of the African-American, Latino, Asian communities came out and work together.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We got together to say that, you know, we have issues here in Long Beach we need to work at. We need to do better. We need to improve on it. We can only do it as one community working together.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Oh. As a result of that, we had a new police chief at the time, Tony Batts, and that was the beginning of community policing back in those days and that was strong. We also established back in those days of Community Advisory Committee to the Chief of Police and fire and to the city manager, where we had people'",
        "'speaker_4': 'from the community actually meet with police, with police chief and with the city manager to talk about issues of great concern to our communities. And each one was important and added to that. We're the LGBTQ Advisory Group of Seniors Group and other various stakeholders who also met with the police chief and city manager to determine what is'",
        "'speaker_4': 'going on and what is it that we need to change in our community to make it better? And we are at a crucial moment now in this point of our history where what's being put at the table today and what we're going to be looking at is an opportunity.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And the opportunity is to once again visit a lot of the the changes that we're implementing before and see how we can make them better or improve upon them or at this time, things that we weren't able to add before because we're in a different era now.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'What I discovered the last couple of well, the last week or so that we've been experiencing all these these. Events is that is different. I know we're in the social media age and what's going on is that this this these protests have been much more peaceful, much more peaceful than we've had in the past.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes. We've had our moments of of looting and rioting, that sort of. Goes with with everything else but the protests themselves. The protesters in cells were focused and they and they were they were poignant in what they were bringing about and being very attuned to what changes are out there.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we've now come to accept the fact that a lot of the biases and prejudices that we meet, that we're confronted with are systemic. They've been around for a long time and they've come to the surface. I was reminded this morning of our issue that I marched on and protested back in 1996, which was a proposition to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'name the anti-Affirmative Action Program. Our proposal for Proposition eight was put forward by then Governor Pete Wilson. I marched against that. I fought against it. And I wanted to I wanted to get it down because I knew it was wrong.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And what they tried to do was basically saying that affirmative action programs were were illegal and did not serve any purpose. And and getting rid of those kinds of programs would level the playing field. Well, what have we learned in the 26 years between then and now that the level of the playing field is still not level'",
        "'speaker_4': '? In fact, it is even more a level now than it was even then. And there's an effort now with another bill that's being is which is legislature is to repeal to only because it's still on the books. And that's part of the systemic issues that we're dealing with, is that there are still items on the books that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'are counterproductive to where we need to be, to where we need to get. So I'm saying that in providing the historical perspective in the sense that we still have a lot of growing to do, we still have systemic bills and pieces of the legislature that are in need, dire need of change and repeal and new ones to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'go forward. And this is our opportunity to do such. I know Councilwoman Pryce mentioned that it was very unclear as to what specifically we might be looking at. But that's I think that's the whole point, is that we need to have that discussion.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We need to look at what we're going to do in the future to make us better, to make the city a lot stronger. We need we are a strong city and I believe in this. I love this town.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm not going anywhere. I love every aspect of my community that I've been here, been able to build lifelong friendships since I came to Long Beach as a freshman and Long Beach State and made many of them. And like I say, one of the other one of the other things that we want to look at and it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'wasn't institutionalized then, but perhaps this is an opportunity we can do that now, is to institutionalize these advisory committees or advisory groups that we're looking at, because they seem to come and go with whoever is on the sits on the chief's chair or whoever sits on the city manager's chair.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And they and they and they ebb and flow with something that's more permanent or stable so that these discussions are ongoing from here on out, that we don't have to have these types of services and nobody and nobody has to die in order to bring this to the forefront.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We say their names. And Janine, thank you for mentioning seeing all those names because they're a part of our history. And as sad as it makes me feel and at times angry, to want to go out and do something about it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But we have to do it with logic. We have to do it with data. We have to do it in a way that's such that we is going to be effective. And I have been as an example of great proponent of institutionalizing our health department, for one.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But we also need to look at institutionalizing these types of committees as well, these types of groups that would be provide a voice and a venue for people to come forward and voice your concerns. And it has the city council or manager or the police chief move on them.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So it's this is a beginning. I see this as a start. And it's and it's also, at the same time, a continuation of where we've been before and what we need to get. So please look at this as a as a way of.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Growing as a way of learning and as a way to also. Go again. To get to a place where we need to be. With that, I guess some. Done here. And if I if I had to come back and say something more might come back to me, I don't know.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But at the same time is let's work together. And one of the most proudest moments that I've had thus far is that we have, if not the most, one of the most diverse city councils around. Basically unique. You name a.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'A community and is represented in our city council. We have immigrants, sons of immigrants, daughters of immigrants, African-Americans and LGBTQ. We're all represented here. And we are we ourselves are a reflection of our community. And that's what makes us strong.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that's what's going to keep us strong as long as we keep that focus that we know we have a large community here where half a million people, you're probably grown a little bit more. And it's going to be again for the people out there who are listening.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Important to fill out the census. It's going to be important for us as a city where we apply for these grants and we apply for federal funds that we need to. To move forward with with. With getting getting the sense is that we account for our son.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So with that, I'll leave it. I'll leave it there. I'm sure there's going to be more discussion. And as we move forward with this, we decided we're going to be having a lot more a lot more discussions. And hopefully when we continue these discussions, there'll be we'll be in a better place than we were last week.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilmember. Next up is Councilman and Diaz.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You. May I? Thank you very much. First and foremost, I like every American. In the past weeks, I've been absolutely devastated to see another video of an armed, unarmed black person being killed by a officer who is sworn to protect their community.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This is just one of the small pieces of our country's long and violent history of systemic racism and white supremacy, a legacy that continues today to impact every aspect of our society. The revelation so many people have experienced over the past few days.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think the black community has known and organized the girls for decades, and I think that it's important that we recognize that some of these steps are going or some of the steps were taken right now are long overdue.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm so heartened to see the parts of the items that request concrete action in the face of racism and injustice, as we have seen in our streets and around the country. It's not only time to acknowledge the problem, but also to implement solutions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I look forward to working with my colleagues and staff to create reform in our city from the way we are governing to the way we are policing, to the way we allocate resources to our community. I am proud to stand with each of you in this first step, but I know that there are many more steps to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'come and eager to get started. I want to absolutely thank our my council colleagues, council members Richardson, Austin and Andrews for Vice Mayor Andrews for bringing this item forward and also for their their contribution to our city as African American from the black community.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think it's very important that we see. Them as role models for other generations, them that were elected into these positions and and are able to make certain changes within our city. This is what we need. And I'm very proud to serve on a very diverse city council.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I, like it's been said by my colleagues before me at times that we may not see eye to eye with each other. But I do believe in from the bottom of my heart that today we stand here before you all in agreeance that something needs to be done.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I'm I'm very, very proud to be on the city council. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, councilman and de haas councilmember supernova.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. And I'd like to first thank those who brought this item forward. And I'd also like to thank Councilman Richardson, Councilman Austin and Vice Mayor Andrews for their eloquent and heartfelt remarks. I think they serve as a perfect opening to this discussion.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm like Vice Mayor Druse and Councilman, you rank. This, too, is my third episode of Civil Unrest involving Long Beach. Um, and I can say that this. The aftermath of this feels very different to me. Uh, Councilman Franco referenced social media.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Perhaps that's it. But this is the first time I.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'See this broad.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Recognition of systematic.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Racism. And obviously.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The killing of George Floyd has served as a catalyst to bring us to this moment. Um, I think we have, um, we should be very hopeful. And again, I don't mean to sound repetitious, but maybe it's because we've lived through it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Councilman here. You were going to mention how there were many changes made after 92. And I'll go back to 1965 and the Watts riots. And, um, in the aftermath of that civil unrest, money flowed to Los Angeles.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Federal dollars flowed in Sacramento.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Dollars flowed in. I'm not sure how many of those dollars made it to what. But I think we can improve upon that. Now, as Councilman Frank said, so many improvements after 92. And maybe this is it. Maybe this is the time where we see everything, the discussions happen, the plans in place.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And as I referenced, we just need systems in place on an ongoing basis to make sure that the changes we enact are sustainable. I don't think it is. Just from my background, I know the coffee of the the chair of the Sustainable City Commission was mentioned.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Having served on that commission for seven years and also served as chair, I think the topic that was brought up generally is environmental justice. So to concentrate just on the things that we're going to throw in the mix here.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Not that that's the only thing, but I feel an obligation to bring that forward. With my background also, I currently serve on the Public Safety Committee and we will be working on that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'As well as Chair Price.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Mentioned on the 23rd. So those are some of the things we'll be bringing forward. For those of you who don't hear me, normally my my signature is brevity. I just didn't want anyone to think that because of my style, that reflects at all on on my position on that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I choose. This is one of the. Critical moments for our council. One of the most important things that has ever come before us, and I look forward to helping shape these changes for the future. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilmember. Councilwoman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. I want to start by thanking both Mary Andrews, Councilman Austin and Councilman Richardson for your continued leadership in our city. I appreciate the heartfelt comments of all my colleagues. So much has already been said and I won't repeat what has been said.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I will say that over the last few weeks I continue to listen. I believe that true wisdom comes from listening and that we as a council need to continue to keep listening at the forefront of the policies that we will work towards and develop over the next several months.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The only thing that I have to add is in reading the items and in listening to what? Government agencies and community partners are doing across the country. I see some significant value in coordination and I think that institutionalizing that coordination would be imperative.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We can't do it without our partners. And so if there was a way to ensure that we. As we work through this process, make presentations to our partners, the school boards, the trustees, and for them to make presentations to us on where they're headed so that we can ensure that where our agencies progress crosses, that we institutionalize'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the solutions across all of the groups together so that the investment goes the farthest by ensuring it. That we build on each other and their successes and the listening. So with that, I want to thank everyone for their peaceful demonstrations over the last several days.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And. I think that it is poignant that our city is on the forefront of this as we have been on so many things. And it would not be possible without the community leaders that have supported this and so many other equity and equality issues.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Next up, I have I'm going to go back to I think everyone has. Has made their comments. Let me go back to Councilmember Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thanks. Mayor, I wanted to just I realize that I left out a part that I wanted to talk about as far as the city's thinking about process. And when we acknowledge structural racism, we acknowledge that so often the black community has not felt like spaces were safe for them, that they were not safe for them to speak'",
        "'speaker_2': 'up, that they're not safe for them to participate in. And I reflect back to the land use element and what those spaces were like and also what those spaces were like for our African-American staff. And so I am not sure that Thomas spent a lot of time thinking about what the process will look like in dealing with'",
        "'speaker_2': 'this this health emergency. But it is so important that black voices are heard. I would say first that if organizations, even if they seem like organizations that the city has never worked for before, like Black Lives Matter or anybody else says, Hey, City, we're ready.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We're ready to talk and we want to listen that we go to them and that we make sure we engage them in a space that is safe and that they can and work in and that we do that with our youth.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I appreciate that you visited our youth yesterday, but really recognizing that for so many this the city isn't the same across the whole city and that we really have to get ourselves out of our comfort zone to hear these these black voices so that we can, you know, change where where we put our priorities.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we do that with our resources. And that includes city staff time and how we function as a city. So really wanting to make sure that the black community that is diverse is the one leading on this reconciliation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Otherwise we will not have the trust of our diverse black community and all of this will be just a process. So that's my thoughts. Thanks, guys.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Councilman Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Sorry. It's muted. Okay. So I want to take a minute and just so earlier, I needed to kind of just make sure that I presented the framework correctly. And now I want to just take this opportunity to kind of refocus on what we're trying to do here.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So so one, the reason we put acknowledgment out there first is because what we do and what we say from this moment forward, we can either acknowledge or we cannot acknowledge. And we have to be a model and be an example of how we do that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we yes, we are one city and name, but the reality is our systems perpetuate two realities and two different commitments from our city to a race. That experience is not the way to start this process. Ignoring that point means we're not grappling with real issues, which is what this moment demands and is what Long Beach is'",
        "'speaker_5': 'clearly demanding. We need to focus on inequities in order to bring equity. If we are truly one city and we and we do not want to be divided. Then we have to look at the disparities and data that divide us and put in strategies to close gaps and bring us closer together.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So yes, we are one city, but this conversation is not about that. This conversation is about the differences so that we can truly be one city. Secondly, in terms of acknowledging history, I think it's important to acknowledge on the front end that we haven't even in the last last five years, we haven't truly acknowledged this stuff.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You know, we're a city that like, it's okay to acknowledge our history and acknowledge that the KKK marched down Ocean Boulevard and Long Beach three years ago. We commissioned a report on economic equity in Long Beach. I commissioned this report.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It acknowledged that history, that language was removed from the report by our city staff. That simple action in and of itself is an example of institutional racism. Therefore, it needs to be called out in that process so that in this process there is integrity.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I want to say that as professionals, we should not be neutral on certain things. Embracing racial equity should be a professional standard, just like acknowledging sexual harassment is a passive professional standard. That standard has evolved over time. Acknowledging sexual harassment in the nineties 1870s looks different than it looks today with MeToo and Time's Up.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This is one of those moments we need to, as professionals, acknowledge that we cannot advance in our organization. You cannot be advancing your career. We can't advance moving forward from this moment without mastering it. And mastering it takes training and acknowledgment.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Acknowledge that institutional racism needs to be named and called out. This is our chance as leaders to change the direction structurally and meaningfully. Also, we should acknowledge that we have. Due to COVID 19, we haven't been able to take public comment.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There are people and voices that want to be heard right now. So we are I know we are taking steps to get back open, but it is important that this listening process is public and on the record. It was mentioned earlier the land use element, when there were a lot of anger around the land use element, the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'city stepped forward. The city put up tents and listened to people and let them vent. And that process in and of itself was stand up. And that process had its own integrity. Separate from the speeches that we give as politicians.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The staff owned that process and they listened and they created the work plan from that. Next, we need to clarify the integrity of this process. There are a lot of separate process taking on and off the state legislatures doing things.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I know the federal government is doing things and we are going to watch and track all of those efforts. And that means sometimes our committees, state ledge, fat ledge, public safety committee, all of those have individual committee work directed by individuals, directed by committee members and elected officials.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And those are important and they are relevant to the discussion. But it's important to note that the framework in this motion is directing city staff to have a process separately from all the other processes that are happening. And that process needs to maintain its integrity all the way through and be centered on input from the public listening'",
        "'speaker_5': 'process on the record and the convening process that is important to clarify next. I think just, you know, this is a moment where we are redefining what resiliency means is no longer just about preparing for an earthquake. When I walk through Artesia Boulevard, if I look down on Pine Avenue, I see businesses closed due to a pandemic'",
        "'speaker_5': '. When I walk down pineapple today and see board businesses boarded up and murals on there, it tells me that this is is a public health issue, that public health and racial equity, if not addressed, can be as dangerous to our community as an earthquake.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So this is a moment for us to redefine and be an example for our region on how to redefine resiliency and prioritize. Public health, economic inclusion and racial equity is a process that we're setting forward today. It's about translating the voices, the demands of the protests in our community into a strategy for local action.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And that's why public comment on the record is important, that we capture this moment in our city's history, that we acknowledge this moment, we acknowledge our past, and we move forward together. That is incredibly important in this process.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. The last thing I want to say is I want it reflected in this motion. I want it reflected in this motion that this is the city council making a statement that this is considered a public health emergency.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. I'm Tom Richardson, and thank you to the entire council for the comments. And it certainly is a a public health emergency. With that, we've concluded our council comments. We have, of course, some other items that are related.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so if I can, please go ahead and get a roll call. Actually, Councilman Price.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I just want some clarification either from Councilman Richardson or or the city attorney in regards to the ballot measure. Are we voting? Is there anything we're doing tonight in regards to a ballot measure?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I can clarify intent, if that's okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sure. Perfect.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. So, as I mentioned in my comments, all of this should be able to land in systems change. And system change to me is defined as changes to charter, changes to the municipal code, changes to city manager pilot policies as well as budget.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'All of those are the systems in which guide our government. And so whatever recommendations may come out of that, the instruments to train, change, those all have different requirements, for example, charter change. So we know that the PCC requires a change to the charter.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'If you want to eliminate it, if you want to reform it, it requires those things. And so they would have to be preparation for an election if if that is something the city council chooses to do separately. We know that there are certain things, some things that require changes to the municipal code by ballot.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'For example, some of our cannabis laws, you know, we don't have a reputation of having a cannabis equity law that is as progressive as it should be due to the limitations placed on us by the voters and how they did that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That is one example of something we can place on to truly ensure that of the cannabis businesses reinvesting in communities have been impacted by that industry for many, many years. Those are the types of things, types of strategies that may come out of this process, looking at reinvestment of cannabis equity and and looking at barriers in our'",
        "'speaker_5': 'system that stop that from happening. And so this motion says, look what the city council in a position based on whatever comes out of this process to take action, don't let the deadlines of ballot measures and all of those things.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Don't let this process stop any of those opportunities for reform. And so we know we have two immediate opportunities in front of us. One is our budget. Two is the upcoming election. And we also know that some things we can just enact outright as a city council, we have the power in some ways to do that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So that's the the reason I mentioned ballot measure, because that may be a requirement in order to change some systems.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay, I get it. That seems pretty clear to me and I thank you for clarifying that. So we're going to do this listening process. We're going to engage in meetings and we're going to talk. And if there are some best practices that we think we want to employ, then we might propose some specific ballot measure, but we'",
        "'speaker_1': 'don't know yet what that's going to look like.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We don't know what to make of it. We don't think that's going to be of the process. True.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Got it. Okay. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Councilmember Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thanks, Mayor. I wanted to just reflect, Councilmember Richardson, when you asked that your motion be clear that this is a health priority in crisis, that there's also the resolution attached. And I'm not sure when that's going to come back, but I think that it was included in there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But more importantly, my my question is for staff, there's one piece, you know. Councilmember Supernormal mentioned it. I mentioned it. The health inequities around our environmental piece, the city has done an excellent job of preparing our plan. It has sat on a shelf now for a year.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I know part of that debate because the cap basically says that in order to reach our environmental goals, we have to have a CPA in place. And so it's it's been sitting there for a little bit. When is the timeline coming back on the two from four on the CAP plan?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Because it has a you know, it directly impacts our black community and communities of color. A question for Tom on the Climate Adaptation Action Plan.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah, looking to see if Linda Tatum, she was here just a second ago. Linda, there's a question about the cap plan and when that might be coming back. So Linda Tatum will answer that question.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. We are preparing a24 from. That'll go out. It'll be sent up to the city manager's office. I have a draft now. We're looking to get that out either this week or next week. And in that, it will outline the the remaining schedule to complete the cap and bring it back to the city council.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Great. Thanks. Didn't want to get us too far off topic, but just recognizing that we have some tools and toolbox. Thank you guys. Very excited to take this vote.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Councilmember Pearce, before we go to a vote, I know that the the city attorney, I think had a had a clarification. I think I know the answer. I know that as far as the city attorney think, you're you're you're you're wondering about the the declaration of emergency.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I understand that that's not a formal action that the council can take tonight. But I think that Councilman Richardson, correct me if I'm wrong, is talking about this in general terms, that that's what the moment that we're in.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is that correct? Councilman Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah. There's a few things. One, it mentions the priority and urgency of the moment. Two, we're already in a COVID 19 pandemic. We know that we're operating under a state of emergency. We have we're connecting based on data.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We know it has a disproportionately disproportionate impact on from the health standpoint in African-Americans, as well as the economic fallout is disproportionately impacting African-Americans and many, many people. So there is a direct connection to the emergency we have.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Those are important in local government to declare and to and to define. So that's what we're doing. So we're not saying declare a new emergency, to be clear. This is directly connected to the emergency you're in and it should be received with the same level of urgency.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That is my point.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah, I hope that I hope that I'm interested in turning to that. Clarify it for you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I believe so. I think that the way I understand the motion is it is not an actual declaration of a health emergency. The council member is saying it could be and some of these actions taken could help assist in the current emergency.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But those emergencies have to be declared by the health officer. And so if if the health officer makes that declaration, then it would come back to council for approval of that declaration. So there's not a formal process that would come back to you unless the health officer declares it a formal emergency.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So as I understand it, the motion tonight are your four items, and there's definitely several items that will be coming back to the council as staff progresses through these phases of the resolution articulating it. The public statement, I think, has already been made the formal listening and then convening the stakeholders and out of that then there'll be'",
        "'speaker_6': 'items maybe separately or all at once, depending on how the city manager does it comes back to you for further action. And this is time just to add to that. I think that's right. The way I'm understanding the sense of the council and the motion is you want us to consider this to be one of our absolute'",
        "'speaker_6': 'top priorities that we were working on that was loud and clear today. We are committed. We're ready. I do want to point out that that comes with a price. When we put this ahead, we put other things behind.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so we are going to be taking that action. We will move things around. We will treat this with urgency. You're asking a lot in this motion. I think it's very good. I think it gives us some good structure.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And it's an it is a very aggressive timeline. So we will be putting together structures to to treat it with the importance with which you have all spoken so eloquently tonight. And it is our job then to let you know what the other things that we will have to manage around and we will ask for the council's'",
        "'speaker_6': 'patients on that as we prioritize really this our COVID response and our budget, those are our three main things. And I think the point that Councilmember Richardson was making is that there are shared themes in all three of those that can be interwoven together, and we will be looking for those.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Modica. And then as we as we turn to the vote, I would also add this is something that Councilmember Richardson and I have talked about, and I and I agree, and I think we've mentioned this as well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Mr. Murdoch, I think as you begin to put together this plan, and I think you've acknowledged the importance and the urgency of the plan by the Council, we have incredible talent in this organization. We have incredible our rank and file employees in every single department in the city and managers and leaders that that love this community, that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'are part of this community and that and feel the same pain that we talked about tonight. We have a members in our public works crews. We have librarians. We have firefighters. We have all types of employees that really can help lead on this issue.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm thinking about our our black or black employees or black managers that really have, I think, a unique perspective. So as we move forward in this process and we move forward to to really put together this framework. I'm also hopeful that we can tap into their immense talent and commitment to our city, because they're going to have'",
        "'speaker_3': 'a very unique perspective on the work ahead of us. And so I thank you, Mr. City Manager and the council and to Councilmember Richardson kind of for spearheading this and certainly to Vice Mayor de Andrews, to Councilmember Al Austin for your leadership and Councilmember Pierce for helping also in the coauthoring this item.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We know this was a lot of work and we look forward to getting to work after that. After listening. So thank you all. And with that, we're now going to have the clerk do the roll call vote, please.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Great. Thank you. Much information carries you counsel. We do have a couple of items are still a part of this broader discussion. And thank you all for that conversation on the on the general framework. So now we're going to take up item 26.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Communication from Councilman Austin, Councilwoman Price, Vice Mayor Andrews, Councilmember Richardson recommendation to request city manager to report back within 30 days on the Citizens Police Complaint Commission.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Let me turn this over to Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I thank you, Mayor, and I want to thank my colleagues who signed on to this item. And before I start, I want to just preface that I got my start in public service here in the city of Long Beach with the city of Long Beach as a commissioner on a Citizen Police Complaint Commission.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I was appointed in 2003 by then Mayor Beverly O'Neill. I was very deliberate about getting on that commission because at the time I was a lot younger and I saw things and many of the issues that we're talking about today were prevalent then it was and I worked on staff were state senator who.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Had authored the original racial profiling bill. Driving while Black Bill. And so this was it was intentional for me to get on that commission. I worked to get on it. I talked to my city council member. I talked to the mayor.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I realized that there was nobody who looked like me, who was in my demographic at that time, being of young black male. You served on that commission. And so it was it's been this is this was a hard work for me.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so just a little bit of a background. The Citizen Police Complaints Commission was established by the voters in Long Beach in 1990. It came following another high profile incident of police violence against a black man in this case.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'His name was Don Jackson, and ironically, he was an off duty police officer here in Long Beach, not with a lot of his police department, but in 1989, he had been beaten and thrown through a plate glass window by one of these police officers in an incident that was captured on video.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'At the time, the CPC. CPC was a pioneering effort that was approved by the voters, where anybody, any person has a right to make a complaint against any employee of the London Police Department, whether it be an allegation of police misconduct with emphasis on excessive force or false arrest complaints with racial or sexual overtones.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'These complaints are investigated and the CPC PCC was charged to make findings resulting in the recommendations that accused personnel be disciplined, trained or exonerated. Here we are 30 years later. Time for us to look ways at the CPC can be updated and improve accountability, transparency and confidence in the relationship between the community and our police department.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It is important that we have a timely conversation now on how to improve the efficacy of the PCC. I would like to thank the IPCC commissioners, many who have served the city over the last 30 years. As a former commissioner myself, I know how much work that goes into reviewing these cases, how many late nights people put'",
        "'speaker_4': 'into it studying these cases. And and and I will tell you, as council members, you know, their agendas oftentimes resemble ours in terms of the volume of reading that goes into these cases that come before the P.C.C. Their meeting packets are thick.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And like I said, it's not thicker than many of our our council agenda packets. I've also had the opportunity to speak with several former and current commissioners over the past few days to get their feedback on this item.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'd like to thank the London Police Department also for their cooperation and collaboration. Understanding that the PCC is an independent entity in the Charter Commission and it is governed by the people. It's been mentioned earlier. If there are any changes to come to this commission, it would require well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Any any functional changes would require a vote of the people. But I believe that there are also opportunities for us to work with the city manager's office because the PCC is under the office of the City Manager. I believe there's an opportunity for us to make some administrative changes as well and make some immediate short term improvements'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that can improve efficacy, that improve the operations of the Commission, that could add value to all the work that they do. For example, there are staffing concerns with the independent investigators who handle case loads. I'm told that there are two part time investigators that handle case loads.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm told that we have temporary administrative staff who will prepare the cases and deal with the database, work for that commission. The question arises, should there be more training for the commissioners? Should there be more community? Engagement in in the Commission.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'When I was chair of the Commission 2004 to 2005, I instituted a community training which brought in people to the police academy, residents to the police academy, along with the commissioners, to learn more about police practices and training so that when they were reading these cases, we were reading these cases, we would have a greater understanding about'",
        "'speaker_4': 'what is in the mindset of an officer. Right. How are they trained? Can we make recommendations on on on on on on on on training? Obviously, as citizens, we're not police officers. We don't have the same level of training.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But we should, when looking and reviewing their cases, have an understanding of their work. So I thought that that was very good. And at the time to try to foster greater community relations, I brought in the organizations that were oftentimes at odds or questions, a lot of these police tactics.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And at that time, in 2005, we brought in the Fruit of Islam, the captains from the Fruit of Islam to participate in that. And there was. There was was a great understanding and relationship building during that period of time.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There should also be timely reports for the City Council, including the briefing of Office of the Office of the Council of Officer Involved Shootings. And I would say at this point, moving forward, any officer involved shooting can be a source of complaint from a they go through the PCC.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I would say that every officer involved shooting should come to the council for briefings and review. We are at that time. We need greater oversight and we can do a better job as a city council. We should always we should also look at allowing video testimony from complainants and witnesses rather than just written reports.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The way the Citizen's Police Complaints Commission works is that these cases are investigated. As I mentioned, there are major packets where commissioners have to go through text and review statements from complainants, witnesses. But also offer some statements are not included in that because they're not compelled to give statements, statements.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's something that we probably should be looking at as well. I have questions. How, how, what access to the P.C.C. Now have to have you feel footage from body worn cameras. While CB, S.C. has subpoena authority. I mentioned they cannot compel statements from officers.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That is something we might want to consider. The state legislation. I'd like to hear from my colleagues as well. The CPC, I believe, is an important tool for accountability and transparency when it comes to our community's confidence in our police department and and it holds officers accountable.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I look forward to a review of reforms that we can make, make the PCC more effective. And I'd like to just also say that, you know, I've heard from a number of commissioners. They are submitting recommendations on a format, like I said, existing in former commissioners.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They are submitting recommendations for or or potential reform. And this is just a start to the conversation. I want to be very clear on that. I'm laying this out there. I've asked the city manager to review this and come back in 30 days.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I'm also open to allowing this and layering this with the previous agenda item as part of the community conversation. That needs to happen as well as the city manager needs more than 30 days, or if we can make that happen with that within that 30 day window.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That would be great. But I'm going to be also forwarding the city manager recommendations from other commissioners that that I have received an email and also phone calls. And again, I think we're up to about two dozen recommendations on a potential reforms to that commission and how we can improve its its work.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I don't want to. Devalue the importance of that commission when, as I mentioned before, you look at the National Organization for Civilian Oversight Commissions, you know, at least when I served on the commission, it was Long Beach was was one of the model commissions.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Right. Civilian oversight has changed significantly over the last 30 years. And so because of that, I think it merits a review and potential reform of our commission. So with that, I would look forward to hearing from our colleagues and hearing your comments.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Again, it's not a perfect system. It's our system. It's one that we've had for 30 years. When Ferguson broke out, we were this was one of the first solutions that they pointed to us as as is a need there.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that was just a few years ago, I would say, within the last 3 to 5 years. L.A. County, just the sheriffs just were. Just became subject to civilian oversight. So it's very, very important that we have this conversation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Again, I'm happy to bring this item forward. I think it's timely and in light of everything that is going on. And I look forward to my colleague's comments. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Vice Mayor Andrews, you're the second.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah. Thank you, ma'am. First of all, I've got a lot of people going forward. You know, as we look at this commission, we really need to use our equity lens now, only reporting bad press. And we have the conversations.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm looking on the city's website and it says that basically learning opportunity. Long Beach resident speak of equity and have served our communities. Oh, that sounds great. We need to talk about the purpose of this. This commission has the ability to determine here and obviously get trained, but dismissed.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This is not a commission one can serve on an entire. You have to take someone complaints and become aware of appropriate and that occurs. And it is a serious problem that needs to consider the side of the story and try to find the best possible timeline of the event and the Act before guidance recommendations.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You can not continue to be a boss which when reviewing play. I cannot be just another commission. He place somewhere on this. Yes, James. That is. We have been completely honest. I have never heard it from a single commissioner or this commission.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'More than one I have ever had a brief briefing from them, like Father Thomas Maser. They swear to do so. This is not a reflection on the commission for this year. It is a reflection on the work that we all need to do to get away from my colleagues.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I am looking forward to the report coming back. Thank you again.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor. Councilman Price.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. I want to thank Councilman Orson for bringing this forward. This is an example of a very clear and tangible item that we can start looking at and adopting best practices for. So I want to thank you for bringing that forward.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilman Austin, you have a lot more in-depth knowledge of the workings of this commission than I think at least certainly more than me. I can't speak for my other council colleagues, but you're very well versed in this. So I think it's it's going to be very helpful for us to have that insight.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I will tell you that this is the one commission that I have received a lot of concern and recommendations or, let's say, opportunities for improvement on over the last six years. And there have been a lot of questions over the years asked.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I think just even understanding the framework for the Commission and what they're tasked with and what tools they have at their disposal would be a really helpful educational tool for the Council. In the six years that I've been on, we've never really had, you know, a staff reporter presentation on what they're supposed to do.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I think this is a great first step. And I want to thank you, Councilman Austin, for bringing this forward. And certainly this could be something that we could discuss even further if the opportunity arises at our public safety committee and a committee in a public or an a subcommittee type setting so that we can allow for'",
        "'speaker_1': 'more dialog. Since I know sometimes at council comments are limited to such a short period of time and there's not as much opportunity for a dialog, but that's another venue for you to think about since you know the workings of this commission.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Better that better than I do. But if that's something you want to think about, but it's a great item. I wholeheartedly support it and I hope the rest of the council does as well. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilmember Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mayor, and thank you, Councilmember. Awesome for bringing this forward. I know you and I have talked about this commission in the past and it's unfortunate that this moment took this moment to get movement on it. But I'm glad that that you've taken the leadership to get it here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I, too, have over the years had a lot of people talk about the effectiveness or the clarity, the transparency of this committee. And I also had the great opportunity to talk to Congressmember Lowenthal about this commission. And, you know, someone that brought this commission forward and him today saying that it needs a great overhaul is also a'",
        "'speaker_2': 'reflection of how far we've come as a state and as a city. I had a question for the city attorney as we talk about the last item with some of the civilian oversight process and then this commission. I have one commissioners, actually, two commissioners that have been very outspoken about feeling like if we even start on this'",
        "'speaker_2': 'commission, that it's going to be very difficult. And that making sure that we have a civilian oversight that's really separate of the city would be important. So my question is for the city attorney and to review this and put some changes in if we're able to do that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But what changes require the charter changes? Like what is the trigger for putting this on the ballot? And then my second question is, are there other ways to get civilian oversight quicker than, say, two years that really have teeth that are separate and independent from the city?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That does not require charter? And if you could just share with the public those two things.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Mayor, members of the council. I will try the basically the charter as described by Council member Austin, who did a great job describing the PCC, was established by the vote of the people in 1990 as a charter committee and so any changes to the powers and duties of that committee require a vote of the people to either'",
        "'speaker_6': 'repeal it or to amend it or to change it. So as we as I anticipated what this item would be, we would come back with a report that would describe the history of the PCC. And in the Charter it identifies the duties that the and the responsibilities of that commission.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then if there are proposed changes and it sounds like there are already a number of suggested modifications to that committee, those would all require a vote of the people to amend the PCC as it currently exists. If that answers your question.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Then it is my first question. So my second question is how are there ways that the city can get an independent oversight police commission that is independent of the city without going to the vote of the people or without a charter change?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They're there. Your. I we'd have to look at what what it is you'd want to establish. And if I understand your question correctly, an oversight body of the of the Long Beach Police Department. There could be a under the municipal code, you could establish an advisory committee to determine and to advise the city manager or the city'",
        "'speaker_6': 'council on proposed changes or policy decisions. That would be the council purview. The I think you do need a vote of the people to establish some sort of a charter amendment, because currently under the charter, the authority for the discipline lies with the police of the chief of police and ultimately with the city manager as your executive'",
        "'speaker_6': 'director of the of the city. So in order to take those. It sounds like you're suggesting that you would possibly want to remove those two and put them in place with a body. And that would require a charter amendment to to make that happen.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It could be done, but it would need a charter amendment. If. If I understood your question correctly, again, it's going to be specific on what it is you would like to do, and we'd like an opportunity to research it and report back.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah, I appreciate that. I was asking just because I know that we've all thrown out a lot of dates and a lot of great ideas and we're trying to figure out like, okay, so November, have we missed the deadline for charter amendment for November?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That is correct. The under state law, there is a specific, very specific notice provision and period which requires three public notices with certain dates days in between those notices. And that time has passed for the November 2020 election.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Right. So that was why I had the other question was just to be having you think about it and I know that we already have the other item, but just publicly talking about like what are ways that we can not only with PD, because I firmly believe that PD is a body of the city and that we'",
        "'speaker_2': 'need to have some oversight and structure around race and policing in general. So just thinking and letting the public kind of hear that there are other options that aren't charter reform, we need to be specific about that and we'll work with staff to get that back.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But that right now we can't do charter reform on November's ballot.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That is correct. And just for for clarification, you do have oversight and and review of the police department is currently with the chief and with the city manager. I think you didn't mean to say there is no oversight or review of that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That and the CPCB makes recommendations to the city manager pursuant to their authority under the charter also.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you for that. And I would I would say that. As Councilmember often mentioned, we have not had a report, at least from one of the commission of reports that I had an email from in the last three years to the city council, at least not one that's been publicly discussed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so, you know, looking at areas that we need to tighten up and make sure that we're abiding by the law that's in front of us in our own charter, and to is that we, the Council, have oversight over our city manager, but our city manager is the one that has oversight over everyone else.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I personally only meet with our commanders and I don't meet with our police chief on a regular basis. We've tried over the last four years, but I don't. And so it it it makes it difficult, you know.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so these are all the issues of transparency and access that are important for this committee for us to all be thinking about. The one last part I wanted to just publicly recognize is, you know, I also led the efforts with Councilmember Austin and others around our H.R. practices.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we know that there's a lot of great changes there that need to be made. What I'm hearing from our commissioners is also that they they don't feel like and they have not been presented with at least the chair that I've talked to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Policies and procedures for them as commissioners and for understanding what the policies and procedures are for the staff that's supposed to be working with them. And so basic things like that, I look forward to having a conversation with that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I don't think would require charter reform, but just basic, you know, keeping our house tidy. And so I hope to to hear from from staff and from city attorney on on some of those. And then my one last question.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'As you look to bring this back, are there ways for independent attorneys to be involved with the PCC as it exists right now?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'No. The under the charter, the city attorney's office is a sole and exclusive legal adviser to the city and its boards and commissions, and we advise the PCC.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Those are my questions. Think again. Trying to move forward to a fuller discussion when it's brought back. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Next up is Council Member Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I just want to acknowledge. Acknowledge this effort. Thank you. Councilman Orson, I know you spent a lot of time on the KPCC. Probably more experience with it than anyone else on the council. You know?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I want to I want to say the framework we just voted on separately, we're very clear that, you know, everything needs to be on the table. So reform to see PCC, independent oversight, all of those needs to be evaluated.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think since KPCC is there and we know its charter, I think the questions about how it works now that that's low hanging fruit, they can start now. I think everybody points points to it that it can be know look at the issues with it, but it could arrive at, you know, the charter and they need to'",
        "'speaker_5': 'change it or the charter may need to like eliminate it in favor of a new process or a different type of process. And so that's what these conversations are. And I want to just encourage people, not the rest of the solution, to let it play out.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Let's let's bring up the issues are understanding it and be open to what whatever form this might look like and know that. Those are my comments. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilmember. Councilmember Ringo.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mayor, and thank you all, councilmember, also for bringing this forward. It has been 30 years since this commission has been put in place and reviewed. Whether the things that came out of it was also that it is to be in conjunction with each other and with civil service.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Most officers that are disciplined are classified employees, and there's a process. They go through civil service, through a hearing. The recommendation the PCC makes is to the city manager. In the city manager makes his decision as to where it goes from there and then it goes to Civil Service Commission if there's a disciplinary action.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'One of the things that came out of that, that the event that you're talking about comes from Ross in 1989 with Don Jackson was that those two officers, Ramsey and Mickey, called it the Marx Brothers. And they were Mark Ramsey and Mark.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Mark Dickey. They they were disciplined. And but one of the things that really came out of it was, for me, shameful is that they were allowed to disability, retire. They were not dismissed or terminated, which means that as a disability, retired retiree, their pension, they receive their pension and they don't get taxed on it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So basically they were. They left because they said they were stressed. They created that stress by pushing Mr. Jackson's head through that plate glass window and and in the subsequent events he took after that. So we look at it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We also have to look at a charge role and the Civil Service Department's role or commissions role in this whole process as well. So if we're going to look at the PCC and its role in reviewing of cases of abuse or misuse of honor under the color of our uniform, we also have to look at those other'",
        "'speaker_4': 'entities that are involved with that as well. Would that require a charter change? I don't know, but it would certainly determine how the other two commission, the whole of the department and the Civil Service Commission relates to it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we also have to look at and take that into consideration as well. And what's the what's the end game that we want with the PCC? We want to give it more teeth. Or do you want to just change how it functions as a whole?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'One of the things that that was that has come over the years to me my attention anyway. Is that the CPC has no teeth. It has recommendations, but it doesn't have any authority to deal with the word officers if that in fact is what comes out of the investigation, that that lies directly with the city manager.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And and and the chief of police. So we we need also need to look at the role that it plays with the other hiring authorities, h.r. And the civil service commission, which basically is a body that that deals with classified employees when there's any kind of disciplinary action.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Just throwing it out there that we need to include that review as well in terms of the role that they play with the CPC and the CPC interacts with those other two entities as well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, councilmember councilmembers. And.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I just want to echo the comments of my colleagues, and I think this is a really good step in the right direction. And thank you so much, council member Austin, for bringing this item forward. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Councilwoman, I think that has been I think the entire council have made comments. I'm going to come to conclude and close out this this item as we move on to some other ones. Well, let me just first begin just by thanking council member Austin especially for bringing this forward.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think it does tie in with the framework that was also adopted by the City Council and and like most of the council, I've also received a lot of it, a lot of ideas, suggestions from from commissioners and from community members as well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I want to just mention a couple of things. I think the first thing that's important is I want to uplift. I know there's been a lot of conversation about the commission. The commission was, of course, created by the vote of the people, the people of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And it's clear that, you know, decades later, it's time to revisit that commission and and revisit how it works, how it functions, how it can be more community oriented and how we can improve it. I think that's important.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Any time that this that the city and the voters create something, there's always opportunities to revisit it and to to make them stronger and to meet the moment that we are in. And so I support this initiative at looking at the PCC.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I want to also thank those that serve. I think certainly it's easy to for us to acknowledge or for folks to criticize and maybe the commission might work or the way it's set up. The way it works is laid out in the charter.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so we certainly can change the charter or we can make changes to the way it's governed. I think that's maybe an opportunity for the city manager and the staff to see it. Are there ways to improve it that are outside of the mandated functions of the charter?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But we've had a I mean, just dozens and dozens of people from all across our community who have honorably served in that commission. And I want to thank them tonight for for serving for for their commitment to to this voter approved body.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm from that was created. But I also want to be very clear moving forward that I do believe it's time for change. And I do believe that we have an opportunity and a unique opportunity to look at really creating a model commission or system.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think that what we've heard tonight is a variety of of different ways of doing it. I think you heard that certainly we could go to to the route of of improving it internally through through staff process.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There's certainly opportunities to look at is this the right type of body that should it should exist in in this area should be different. And certainly the the one that I think is the most democratic, which is a change at the ballot box, which makes something very permanent, is a is a charter change or a municipal code'",
        "'speaker_3': 'change that would really change the way this commission functions and the way that the people on the commission interact with the body. And I will just say that I think this you know, this council has a has a record of a charter changes in charter commissions.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We just went through a process last year where this city went all in on on charter change, on creating a new city ethics commission on on on redistricting, on so many issues. And so I think that if we do this and as we begin this process, I encourage us to listen.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Let's go to the community. Let's hear from our staff and from our departments what works, what doesn't work. And then let's and then let's really make create something that's a model and that we can really be proud of as a city and really meet the legacy of Congressman Lowenthal, of of then Councilman Lowenthal, who began this work'",
        "'speaker_3': 'with with the mission of really community oriented oversight and engagement. So I think I believe that we can do that and and we'll be all in on this process and make sure that we get it just right. So, Councilman Austin, I also trust that as as the one councilmember that has served on this commission, you're going to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'have valuable insight as well. So I look forward to your leadership in this process. And so with that, let's go out and take a roll call vote. Thank you. District by.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Right before that or the previous weekend. From all the news reports and things that were happening across the nation. We were monitoring all of the activities. So our police department, actually, weeks before due to COVID, started to enhance our civil unrest training, whether it was training for command staff all the way down to the the street level'",
        "'speaker_3': 'officers equipment and everything else that we may need. So going into that previous weekend, to be exact, that Friday, if you guys all recall, there was a lot of unrest not only across the country but here locally in the city of Los Angeles, which caused us to significantly upgrade our response plan.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We actually activated our department operations center that Friday before the 31st and also activated our incident management team that Friday as well as we went into that Saturday. Previous to that Sunday, the 31st, we brought in additional police officers.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And luckily for us as a city, we didn't experience any activity or any protest activity. And but the city of Los Angeles did extensively so through the L.A. County Sheriff's Department Emergency Operations Bureau, they asked for mutual aid.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we sent several dozen officers to the city of Los Angeles. They served up there very well. It came back. Everybody came back safe. And then came Sunday. On Sunday. We got information again that we were going to get some protest out in front of 400 West Broadway, although we didn't have any numbers associated with it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And in getting ready for that day, we brought in hundreds of additional police officers so that we can be ready for almost anything that happened. And I can almost tell you that based on the information we had, we actually overstaffed for what we thought was going to happen.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But unfortunately for us, what started to happen is you've got a lot of protesters that came in. And I want to emphasize that the majority of the protesters that were here were peaceful. They're doing the right thing, protesting for the right reasons.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And although the majority of the protesters were peaceful, there were many others who were specifically there looking for a confrontation with the police. And there was other smaller groups that were there, unfortunately, just to commit acts of theft and and some of them fed off of each other.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And what really appears to be a coordinated attack on our city with thousands of protesters, three or four different groups doing different things and. So when you look at the whole thing, obviously we had some damage to some of our businesses, which I got to tell you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And there was a lot of conversation in the last couple of hours about our police department, our police officers and the way they respond. I couldn't have been more proud of the way our officers responded. And no one's more upset than they are, other than probably the business owners themselves who lost a lot that day because they'",
        "'speaker_3': 'feel like they should have done a better job of protecting them. And so do we. So I guess I can kind of wrap that up by saying that our biggest win that evening was not having anyone get critically injured or killed, because that was our top priority, is to make sure no one got injured or killed.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But our biggest disappointment was feeling that we failed some of our individual business owners. So like anything else or everything else in the police department, we will go back. We're still under a state of emergency. We're still deployed with a lot of police officers out in the field.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So the first opportunity we get, we are going to go back, have a critical incident debrief and make sure that we go over everything. All the good and anything. Lessons learned from us. But I want to stress this, that just like being involved in any event for anything that we may have fallen short on, we immediately made'",

And I want to say that since then, we have had 24 protest in the last nine days, ranging from small protest to ones that contained several thousand people.

They didn't hesitate to get on the front lines and took abuse like you would not believe from name calling to getting urine and feces, feces thrown on them to being attacked with'",
        "'speaker_3': 'bottles, rocks and more than hundreds. And most of them are still working straight with no days off. So as we talk about our police officers, the defense, the defenders of our community, I hope we don't forget the job they've done this last week.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Now, switching gears on you, I'm going to turn it over to Assistant Chief Jeb Bush, who's going to talk about the second part of your question. Thank you, Councilmember.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And thank you, Chief Luna. So the second.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Part of the question about the the photograph of the of the baton, we learned of that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Photograph on June 4th.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And immediately began investigating.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The circumstances surrounding the photograph. We found that a probationary police officer had taken the photo and posted it on a social media site. In reviewing the.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Photo and the image.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Depicted there, I realized it wasn't consistent with our policies or procedures.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Or the core values of this organization, and it really impacted.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Those same very same officers the chief had just mentioned. So we subsequently subsequently relieved the probationary officer of duty on June 5th that Friday.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So my question was not about the about that photo. My question was about the officers that used use of force that that had use of force situations. Curious about the timeline for those investigations and more specifically, the public and myself, we don't know what that process looks like.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So my very first question really is, are officers that use force like that, do they remain in the field? Are they pulled from the field? How long is an investigation? When can community expect, you know, some response on that?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's more my question or question.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I don't know what's up. Robert Luna here again, Councilwoman, I don't know what specific use of force you're talking about.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If your bullets, the rubber bullets.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There were less lethal munitions that were utilized from launchers out specifically at third and pine after the officers were attacked. Like I just stated, with the rocks, bottles and M-1 hundreds those launchers are used there target specific at only individuals who are attacking the officers.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And absolutely, yes, any time any officer on this police department utilizes any form of force, they are required to write a report. That report is to be reviewed by each line of supervisor, sergeant, lieutenant, all the way up to the deputy chief level.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And if somebody files a complaint, that would end up going to Internal Affairs, where it gets further scrutinized about everything that they did from the beginning of making that decision to make sure that it was well within our policy procedures and training guidelines.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And is that the point that something would end up at the CPAC? Like if it goes to the deputy chief and then it's being reviewed. And I'm asking just because people don't know, you know, and and if we can be transparent and upfront whenever these situations happen, it relieves it relieves a lot of stress in the community'",
        "'speaker_2': '. And that's why I'm trying to drill down and really understand the line by line questioning.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, thank you, Councilwoman. This is assistant chief. Michigan we're talking about, I think two different things. We're talking about complaints that would go to the P.C.C. And the.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Use of force.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Within our organization and internal review. Not every ever use of force is a complaint. So if we received a complaint associated.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'With a use of force, that information would then be provided.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To the PCC so they could conduct an independent investigation based.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'On the citizen complaint that we receive associated with the force that was used.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And the reason I clarified on that was because the Chief mentioned the process, but I didn't hear him mentioned the PCC and so I just wanted to know where that was in that process. My thank you for that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'My, my other, my other question was when we were at the press conference with you, Chief, after this Sunday's event, you mentioned that there was going to be a report about the, uh, the arrests that were made, the type of arrests that were made and what happened with those arrests.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I know that the prosecutor's office is involved as well, but unfortunately, I did talk to a business owner in the second district that was arrested that night and released because he was arrested and not there was no proof of what they were claiming happened.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I think it's important that as we go through this process, when we talk about transparency and accountability, while it's difficult, you guys are, you know, doing great about talking about your process. But really the data points are so important.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so when can we expect that report about the arrests that were made that night?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We're still gathering the information, as you can imagine, with the entire department deployed, even our administrative staff getting some of these reports are going to be delayed some. And even as of today's date, I got more information about more arrests that took place back on the 31st of May.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Between noon on the 31st and noon on June 1st, which were up to a total of 98, which included 71 citations. Now, just for clarification, when I talk about a misdemeanor citation, that's equivalent to an arrest. So somebody may have been cited.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And technically, it's a misdemeanor arrest, but they may have been released. But I know that that night we also had several arrests for either looting or what we call commercial burglaries, individuals that were breaking into businesses and stealing things as part, unfortunately, of the the protest that was going on.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And. So my question is not that I need a report today, it's that are we looking at two weeks? Are we looking at four weeks? Are we looking at eight weeks? Being in progress doesn't help anybody understand where we are.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I'm fine if it's it will take six weeks to get a report. But having some in timeline, I don't you know, I, I think that that is the least that we could do for a community that has been through a trauma, just like your police officers have been through trauma.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If we did make arrests for looting, that word, which I still don't know the better word to use, but if there were arrests made for that, my constituents that are asking me where were police during this instance? We would be able to say 40 arrests were made that night in the case of looting.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I'm not I'm not asking for a lot of information, asking for very like, here's the numbers, here's the types basic and I know that everybody and is exhausted and tired and you guys are working around the clock.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I don't need a report right away, but a timeline, a deadline. I do not think it's too much to ask. So I hear you and I and I hear you standing up for the police officers that serve this great city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And gosh knows I've called them and needed a police officer. But I also, while thinking about what it's like to be them, I was in this protest on Sunday and I walked past six of our police officers at the Renaissance that stood proud and did not budge when some of the people walked by and yelled at them'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and threw things at them. And I was I was proud and I was happy at that moment. While it was hard to see, I thought to myself, you know, I'm told that we have de-escalation and it looks like it's paying off.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I can't imagine the anger, what it takes to get somebody to go up to a police officer and yell in their face. I cannot imagine what that takes. I really appreciate everybody's efforts in the end. Thank you for sitting with me asking some of these questions.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I know they're not easy. One last question that I have to get a more specific answer for, for some of my constituents is one that has already been answered publicly. If you could answer one more time and the mayors mentioned this is in order to get the National Guard here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's my understanding we have to exhaust all other resources before we can do that. What time did we exhaust all other resources and what time did we call in the National Guard?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If you allow me a second to look at a specific timeline. That I have in regards to the process and the way it works. Within an hour of the time that the protests started, our incident commander called for mutual aid.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The way the mutual aid system works for the Long Beach Police Department is we go directly to, again, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department Emergency Operations Bureau. They determine, one, what the need is and how they're going to fulfill it if they're going to fulfill your need.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If you remember on that Sunday, the entire region was impacted by civil unrest. All of L.A. County, almost all of L.A. County, the city of L.A. and other surrounding jurisdictions, I believe both the city of Beverly Hills and Santa monica was significantly impacted, which drew a lot of the sheriff's resources up that direction.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So when we called for mutual aid, we got an extended ETA from an outside another law outside law enforcement agency that was enroute to the city. At that point, we continuously were asking for more resources. And it was at that time that the local area had expanded their law enforcement resources and then had to turn to the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'National Guard for assistance. So eventually the the Guard got here. I want to say they got here around midnight. I'm looking at my timeline here and my eyes weren't so bad. I can quickly identify it here. But yeah, if you don't mind, let me get back to you on the specific time.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I know we called for mutual aid probably between four and 430 ish that afternoon. So that's when the mutual aid process started. And it was, again, the sheriff's department who determines who we get. And within that process, that's how eventually the National Guard came to Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Does that answer your question or would you like more detail?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And this is Tom. I'll add to that as well. I remember that very clearly. It was around 840 or 845, and we got the word that it had been exhausted, that there was nothing else coming. They had asked, you know, would you accept the National Guard?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And one minute later we said yes, and that's how it happened.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right, thank you. And hopefully you mentioned, Mr. Modica, that this item will be back on the agenda next Tuesday. If by next Tuesday we could get an answer to the specific timeline for the report on the arrest.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I would be greatly appreciative. That is all of my constituent questions that I committed to asking tonight.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So let me I'll add one thing, Councilman Pierce, also to that. I think it's good and I think it's a good question. And I think that the I've been asked the same question about the National Guard, and a lot of folks asked why was it, you know, why was the National Guard called in earlier?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think that what you're hearing from the chief and city manager is the national. There is a process. I mean, the city of Miami does not control the National Guard. Obviously, that and that the resources directed through the state of of course and and and through the mutual aid system.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so we we're very aware that folks have that question and that once only when mutual aid is then exhausted can the National Guard then begin to come. And I'll just say and I'm not sure if I've shared this with with with you, councilwoman, with others.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And just to ensure that that once the you know, within minutes that I was told that mutual aid was exhausted and that we were calling in the Guard. I also personally put in a call to the governor and let him and his team know that that request was in and that we needed assistance immediately.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so I think the process, as the chief laid out, is, is one that I think is important for folks to know that it was it was done as soon as we were able to do so. And with that, let me turn it over to our customers and ask.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The questions were answered earlier. So thank you for that. And I just want to say, on behalf of the business owners, how this was really devastating for them. But I'm looking forward and I'm committed to helping them through this process, being a district that was one of the districts that was hit the most by the looting and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and the devastation that happened on Sunday night. I do believe that we're going to come out stronger out of this. And I just want to say publicly that I look forward to working together to rebuild these businesses in my district that were affected.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. I'd like to first start by saying that I don't speak on behalf of any particular agency, but I will say that I might be able to bring a little bit of context to some of the questions I think Councilman Pearce is asking.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Many agencies, fire, police, others are all plugged into similar deployment systems. There was a presentation a few years ago, and I believe Chief Avila was at the same presentation that I was at. I was there on behalf of my day job.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'He was there. I represented Long Beach PD. But there are systems that talk about and deploy resources. And so when you talk about have you drilled down and deployed all the resources available? Part of the challenge for whoever is monitoring and rolling the operations center from the county level, the regional level is that as was witnessed throughout'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the more than 20 protests in Long Beach over the last nine days, even the organizers do not know the size of the peaceful protest, and organizers are not notified by criminals who have intent to come and take away from the messaging of the peaceful protest.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so the region doesn't know where those individuals are going to target, and they could go anywhere very quickly. But typically they just target areas that have a high utilization of police officers. And social media has really changed the way in which criminals can communicate and move around the region and really cause havoc and havoc and despair'",
        "'speaker_1': '. So I just want to say that. I'm not saying the system works. I think perhaps on a regional level or on a federal legislative level, we may want to discuss and potentially invest in the systems that are funded through some of the federal grants that come down for mass gathering and mass event management.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Because those resources and the way in which they interact between different agencies at the local, state and federal level are very different. So I'm going to leave it at that because I don't want to have Charlie Perkins tell me that I'm too off topic, but I'm happy to discuss more of what I've learned through working with these'",
        "'speaker_1': 'systems. And then I hear the frustration in Chief Luna's voice, because, of course, he wants. The most resources available at a moment's notice. And. You, of course, would want them here in advance, but. Because of the way the system works.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'He's he's in a position where we as council members need to learn those systems and then we need to advocate for change, change that protects our protesters, change that protects our First Amendment, and change that doesn't allow people who are distracting from those messages to come and vandalize and loot and terrorize our city and our residents.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I'm happy to work with you on an agenda item for that, if you're interested.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilwoman Pryce.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You, Mr. Mayor, and I appreciate the conversations and the questions that were asked. I think we've all received questions of that nature from our residents. So the answers were very helpful. I did agenda is this issue for our June 23rd public safety meeting.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think our first agenda item. That's for police and fire. Because let's not forget that our firefighters were super busy that night putting out tons and tons and large fires and the team really relied on each other, police and fire, and they were united, at least from what I could see from the updates that we were all'",
        "'speaker_1': 'getting and communicating and also what I was seeing on TV. So the item that we're bringing to Public Safety Committee will be a report from both chiefs on lessons learned as a result of the unrest that occurred after the protests.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Being very mindful that that those individuals, in my opinion or not, part of the protest, I don't consider them part of the process. So I've been trying to be very mindful of when I'm using the language that refers to those who really were not there for the same purpose as the protesters.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Because I think that's a whole different category of. Public safety threat that police had to deal with that was very different than interacting with the protesters. So we will get our report back. And I put it for June 23rd because I knew that the Chiefs probably need to get some data in order and have a moment to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'breathe before they can answer a lot of these questions. But I appreciate the information that we've heard tonight. And I do want to say, Chief, I'm appreciative of your leadership with your officers. What you said tonight at our meeting I think will go a long way for all of them because I don't know about the rest of'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you, but I have asked myself many times over the last week. We need good police officers. We need police officers who are. Ethically, morally principled and and have values that honor the oath of service that they have. And a lot of things that we're seeing and hearing, it's just made me wonder what kind of quality of people'",
        "'speaker_1': 'are going to want to go into this profession, because we need high quality people with good morals and good ethics and good values in regards to respect and justice and fair application of the law to be the ones that want to enter into this profession.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I want to support we talk, we spend a lot of time talking about the bad actors and there are bad actors in every profession. But I really appreciate, Chief, that you took a moment to acknowledge the good actors, the ones that were standing tall, the ones that were allowing people to be able to protest in their'",
        "'speaker_1': 'anger, in their grief and in their sadness, and weren't taking it personally and were there in a spirit of protection, but also in a spirit of respect. And and I think that is the majority of the officers that we have in this city.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I'm so grateful, Chief, that you recognize that. Are there lessons to be learned about Sunday? Absolutely. I had no idea how many really skilled Monday morning quarterbacks we have all around us, including myself. There's a lot of things that we think I should have done this or would have done that, but we've also implemented a lot'",
        "'speaker_1': 'of lessons learned very quickly, and we're able to have a lot of peaceful protests in the city throughout the week. And Chief, I want to thank you for being the kind of man who's not afraid to stand up and say there were lessons learned and those lessons were implemented and will be implemented as part of our future'",
        "'speaker_1': 'operations, because that's what this whole conversation is about, accepting where there could be improvements and incorporating those into our practice. So thank you, Chief, for being willing to do that, because to me, it's more important to have a leader who's willing to do that and to have a leader who's doing everything perfectly.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So thank you, Chief.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you councilwoman councilman Sunday has that I have you cued back up or I'm sorry about that. I did I really call on you for this item? It's not clear.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That you did. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Thank you, Councilmember Richardson. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I just want to take a minute and. And I acknowledge a few things that have come up. So, one, I think Chief Luna, I think it was the right call to privatize life of the property.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It could have gone very, very differently if we overreacted in the situation. So I want to acknowledge the composure that many of those involved, the local police showed during that moment of prioritizing life or property. It's important to note that my constituents that attended the protest, they've told me that the majority that this protest majority protests were'",
        "'speaker_5': 'peaceful. Certainly any uses of force. I acknowledge the photos and all those things and they certainly need to be investigated. And I've seen you take action on those behaviors. So it's very, you know, so we need to acknowledge that many of our city staff in all departments, even this morning, as well as the police department, many people'",
        "'speaker_5': 'feel the same way about reform at the same rate, about the direction we should be heading. So we should acknowledge the distinction between how you treat uses of force and actions that are outside of policy and recognize the hard work of our entire city team.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think it's important that comes from our leadership. A question here. Are the National Guard officers still here in our city?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Councilman Richards They are not. They left several days ago and we went down to thank them all for their service to our community. They did a great job while they were here. A lot of people were walking up, wanted to take pictures with them, and they really enjoyed their time here.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They were treated very well, not only by our city employees, but our community.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I think that's that's good to know. The reason I ask is because, you know, when the National Guard initially came in, it was to help with the humanitarian efforts with respect to COVID 19. And we were very public about, hey, they're in plainclothes and they're here to help with our response to COVID 19.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'When this moment happened and they returned in military clothes, it sort of changed the tone in the community about it. And I think it's time we acknowledge, you know, the protests have been peaceful. It's time to demilitarize. It's you know, it's time to sort of, you know, acknowledge that it's been it's been it's it's been peaceful, largely'",
        "'speaker_5': '. So thank you so much for for for your answers.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm sorry. I think I was on mute also. Customer supernova. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Mayor. It's been mentioned that these issues will come to the Public Safety Committee on the 23rd, and I serve on that committee, so I'll save my questions for that venue. But I just had one item and I communicated with Tom Modica on it today, and that is on Monday, June 1st, we requested a list of businesses that'",
        "'speaker_5': 'had been looted. Victims of commercial burglar vandalized. We thought it'd be a good idea to reach out to those businesses and to assist with forward ups or whatever other help that they might have. As of today, we still don't have that list.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And the reason I'm bringing up tonight is if there's anything we.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Could do to expedite that, there are some.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Folks out there who are still looking for help that our office would love to reach out and help them. I'm not criticizing anyone for this taking so long. I just was unclear on why it would take so long.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But I'm not saying it's not justified, but moving forward, that is certainly something I think we should realize that the victims of crime could really use some help to get back on their on their feet in this situation.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We'd like to help in that process. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes, Councilmember. And we believe that list is going to be ready very shortly. The reason that it's taken some time is that it keeps getting added to, as we hear about more, as people are calling it in, as they're filing insurance claims.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Our economic development department has been reaching out and asking specifically for businesses to share that so that we can get an accurate accounting for all of the processes we're going through with the state for reimbursement and to help them as much as we possibly can.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We're educating businesses on how to, you know, keep receipts and file for their insurance and those types of things. So that number has been changing. We wanted to make sure we have an accurate estimate and we don't have businesses saying, you know, you didn't know about a whole bunch of different businesses that we had, you know, that'",
        "'speaker_6': 'we had left off the list. So that number is coming and we will provide that. Thank you. And the chief has sent wants to add to that as well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'General Austin. Sorry, go ahead. I'm sorry, Mayor. I just wanted to add to something the city manager just stated, because it's very important and it's along with the arrest data that Councilwoman Pierce was asking for, the information is changing every day.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And what I mean by that, even with the whether it's looting or commercial burglary, a lot of the information we're getting is not all activity that occurred on Sunday night. So we've had activity occurring periodically and a lot of it not even associated with protest.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But people are calling and they may say it was associated with their not to argue with them. They're still a victim of a crime. And as Councilman Super now stated, we need to take care of them. But the information's being added.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's different areas of the city and it's not all from the same night. It's actually been happening continuous as we were being challenged with a commercial burglary problem before the protests started and a lot of that attributed to the zero bail challenge that we've been facing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Councilmember Austin.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. And Chief, I appreciate the very candid report. And I want to acknowledge the also acknowledge the work done of the very difficult work done over the last several days. I understand how your department, the men and women of your department have been taxed.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I have been in constant contact with the commander in the North Division, as well as lieutenant acting commander over the course of the last few weeks. And and they have demonstrated great professionalism. I think for the most part.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Your officers, I mean, have have exemplified great professionalism in this during this time. And I think your leadership speaks for itself in that regard. I will say that that. Like Councilmember Richardson. I'm glad that life was preserved. You know, we had no serious injuries, injuries officers or members of the public.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We know life was lost and the damage with All Things Considered could have been much worse. A couple of my colleagues have talked about living through civil unrest in the past. I. I remember very well the 1982 riots or civil unrest and things were or were not didn't turn out as well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Right. And so all things considered, I think the matter was handled as well as it could have been handled and great composure was was was exemplified by a lot of these PD now, some who were questioning the tactics and of course, things were being sensationalized and looped over and over on the news.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And and, yes, property damage happened throughout our city. I want to say that, you know, at least a couple of dozen businesses or more in my district were hit that evening. And it appeared to be most of the people who did this came from outside of the city.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The question that I have in it and that reoccurs with several of the business owners that I have interacted with. As many of them are trying to now get insurance claims for losses and they are having a hard time getting police reports for work for that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Will we will officers be freed up to. Do you foresee officers being freed up to give those reports to help those businesses in the near future?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Councilman Austin The answer to that is absolutely. We have as things are slowing down on the protest front, we have many officers out there who are going to be doing exactly that. So if any of you in any of their districts hear of challenges there, please let us know.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Start off by communicating with your division commander and we'll try and rectify that as soon as possible. And I want to give credit also to a deputy chief, Eric Herzog, who's sitting here in the audience. They've put together a task force that's dealing with a lot of the looting information that we had from starting Sunday.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So for many people who think they may have gotten away with stealing from our businesses here in Long Beach, they got a surprise coming to this task. Force of investigators and officers will be out making sure that they follow up on every clue we're getting from video to social media feedback so that people know they can't do'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that. They can't conduct themselves that way in our city. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilman Mongo. I think you're up again.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. I just wanted to use this opportunity to say a couple of quick thank you. When the National Guard did move in, many of these individuals had to pack quickly and move into a facility in our city. I want to give a thank you to the CVB who reached out and helped them with some supplies that weren't'",
