        "'speaker_2': 'Sorry. I was enjoying the whoppers. A report from Economic and Property Development and Development Services. Recommendation to adopt specifications for the purchase and development opportunity at Third Street and Pacific Avenue. Declare the city owned property as surplus and authorize the city manager to execute all necessary documents with ensemble investments for the sale of the property in the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'amount of $6 million. District one.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Staff report first and then I'll turn over to Councilwoman. Staff Report Mr. WEST.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Mr. Mayor, council members, as you know, we've been rapidly disposing of our successor agency, former redevelopment agency parcels over the last month or so. We have several more to go tonight. We're doing the one at third and Pacific.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I'm going to turn this over to Director Mike Conaway. Mayor Garcia and members of the city council. The property located at the northeast corner of Third and Pacific is a vacant lot containing 52,500 square feet of land and is being temporarily used as a surface parking lot for the city's code enforcement division and for monthly parking'",
        "'speaker_7': 'for the public. The property is former redevelopment agency property and is categorized as future development in the long range property management plan, which properties are disposed through a request for proposal process? An RFP was issued and five responses were received, which are proposed developments including hotel, residential, restaurant, retail and Creative Loft Live workspace.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'All proposals were of extremely high caliber and offered a variety of excellent development alternatives. The review panel, consisting of representatives from the Departments of Development, Services and Economic and Property Development and an outside real estate economic firm, Kaiser Master and reviewed the proposals and interviewed key proposers.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The panel unanimously selected the proposal submitted by Ensemble Real Estate Investments to be recommended to City Council for the purchase and development of the property. Ensemble's proposal includes an 18 story high rise development and a seven storey mid-rise development, providing 325 residential units and 27,800 square feet of retail and amenity space.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The proposed purchase price is not the highest priced offered, but the total development cost is substantially higher than any other proposal. Over 1500 temporary and permanent jobs are estimated to be generated as a result of the project. It is important to understand that the recommended action in front of City Council this evening is to select a proposed'",

Nonetheless, it is anticipated the project eventually heard by the Planning Commission and possibly by City Council, may have a high rise element in the high rise element of the proposal has created concern from residents of nearby historic buildings such as Kress Lofts, the Walker Building and'",
        "'speaker_7': 'the Dolly Barton Hotel staff has reached out to these specific parties ahead of the traditional entitlement outreach efforts to hear their concerns and concerns were raised regarding shade and shadow traffic and parking and noise and dust. Staff and ensemble have committed to a vigorous entitlement process that will include enhanced outreach, where all neighboring concerns will be heard'",
        "'speaker_7': 'and to the extent feasible, mitigated. A purchase and sale agreement. Is in near-final form, which includes certain entitlements and development performance milestones which are detailed in the staff report. Is anticipated that entitlement require 12 months and project construction will take an additional 22 months to complete.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'However, staff requests some flexibility in these timelines for unanticipated delays and with that staff request that City Council adopt specifications number RFP CRM 15 Dash 162 for the purchase and development of property located at Third Street and Pacific Avenue.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Gonzales.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes, thank you, Mike, for the report. I just want to say that, you know, I have the residents here from the Walker building, as well as Cress, I believe some other residents as well from downtown. And so I have a few questions to ask, Mike, because I know at first there was some confusion that this was in'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the second district. And then now, of course, it's we all know it's in the first district. So what? So I had been getting some questions around the historic buildings, First Congregational Church specifically. It is another block away, but there and other residents as well had questions related to mitigation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So for construction and dust and noise, I know some of this may be addressed in the downtown plan, but can you go a little bit further with answering those questions?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'd be happy to. The agenda item before council this evening is selection of the developer and purchaser of the property. This starts essentially the entitlement process. There's been no application submitted to the city at this time. Once an application is submitted and we understand the scope of the project, outreach to the adjoining property owners and other stakeholders'",
        "'speaker_7': 'surrounding the property will commence and ensemble will be part of that outreach effort and they will hear and respond to the issues raised by the community members.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I guess we'll pull back a bit because you do bring up a really good point, is that this is obviously the point of this is this just the sale of the of the land? And so no design, although the design we've seen is just in concept, pure concept.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's correct. Nothing is set in stone, although it looks, you know, pretty, you know, drastic for the downtown area. It is just a concept at this point. And I've met with ensemble, I've met with a few others just to talk about what the ideas are a revolving around.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But would you say we would include community input? I mean, we've done that already with the two meetings we've had with both Kress and Walker. And I understand the developer is also interested in having meetings with community members once that process begins.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That's correct. And actually, at our meeting with some of the stakeholders, so we committed to a pretty intense outreach program. And so we expect a number of meetings with both representatives of the Walker building, the Kress Lofts and other historic buildings in the downtown area.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay, great. And let's see if I have any other questions. I know parking has also been an issue. It's always going to be an issue in downtown. There is certainly quite a number of spaces of parking. We've done downtown parking studies, but what is the situation?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Should we have an 18 storey high rise? What is the parking plan?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The parking plan, as currently proposed in their submittal, is both subterranean and subterranean and to a certain element. Podium parking and parking as a requirement under the downtown plan is proposed to be included in the development proposal and any parking shortfalls will be addressed through the entitlement process.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay, thank you. And then I know density as well is it was brought up as a concern depending on who you talk to. You know, that's a good thing or a bad thing. But density, what is our perspective on density?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I know that that is some of the metrics that were was included in our criteria for choosing a developer. So what what would you say the density will? Do for our city. I mean, in terms of retail and and other items.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The density as proposed is 270 density units per acre. That is pretty dense. But the downtown plan, I think, supports this type of density. We are looking to create a sufficient critical mass of residents in the downtown in order to support a variety of our retail uses.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I think retail in combination with residential development is a good mixture for downtown. And I think the downtown plan anticipated this level of development and density and identified mitigation measures to address that density.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Great. And I think those are all of the questions I know I have. As I mentioned, some residents here that I know will speak as well. But I'll just overall say that, you know, I am supporting this item again because it is a sale.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It is a sale for this for this land. That's, you know, been for a long time just fleet services for the corner. And so as we've often talked about increasing density or adding more people to ensure that our economy gets better, but also to be able to make a stake for better retail.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I remember six or seven years ago when we were talking about the refresh project for Pine Avenue, a lot of us were talking about getting a Trader Joe's and a Target and even local retailers, and we can't do that unless we have the density in downtown.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Now, how that will look like, we don't know yet because it's just a concept at this point. But I assure you, I have full faith in our city staff. I have full faith in the developers that I've met with, that this will be a really good project for downtown.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I don't think that this will be a project that will go sideways. They've talked about local retail, including not just the big box, but just the local Long Beach way of retail open and public space mixed with private space, rooftop gardens.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I mean, those are the things that we dream of in such a big corner like this. And I don't think we can get that unless we have some sort of density or some sort of project of this large scale magnitude.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I think city staff are being open to meeting with the Kress Lofts as well as the Walker Building. I know they've met with the Dolly Varden as well, who's been in support and some other residents and we're open.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So this again, is not anything that is set in stone. So if there are additional questions, concerns, I ask any resident whether downtown or not to write my office, to contact my office, because we're certainly available and willing to listen.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So with that, I will end and I hope to get the support of my colleagues as well. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Councilmember Christen, you had your second. Councilor Richardson the Joe anything has a second or. No, no. Okay. I have Vice Mayor Lowenthal. And then if there's no other comment from council, we will go to the public.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And I wanted to thank Councilwoman Gonzalez for her leadership on this particular project and the staff for. Hanging in there and waiting for the right development, I think I don't know how many years ago it was, but Thieves Market was a spot that we had.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'See, I remember the names of these places. So there was a place called Thieves Market Third and Pine, and we invited a team from Portland, a pretty amazing development team from Portland to look at it. And they were very honest with us.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They indicated that there is no way that they could have a building taller than three or five stories that would be supported by the area at the time. And and by honest, it's something that we all knew, which is we didn't have the density.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We didn't have necessarily the right mix for the downtown to support that kind of development at the time. And that was nearly ten years ago. And so this is what we were hoping to have at Thieves Market ten years ago, knowing that we would be a downtown one day that would be rich in that kind of urbanist'",
        "'speaker_6': 'texture that we need. And for those of us who had lived in the downtown since, whether it's the eighties or the nineties, we wanted all the things that all great downtowns had and understood that we also had to fulfill a municipal promise in order to have those things.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And one such promise is density and quality development. And I see that this project can have that potential. It's 18 stories, I believe, including the podium style parking. Mr. CONWAY Is that correct? That's what the downtown plan calls for.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I lived in the cross lofts for seven years and know what concerns might exist for other residents that might be very close to this property. But we also have to understand that we don't have air rights, even though we may have been the only tall building in town for decades.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Over time, the success of downtown means that we fill in those spaces. And so I'm very encouraged by this. When we open the tort lot or broke ground for the tot lot at the promenade, as well as some other developments throughout the Second District.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'A couple of Saturdays ago, one of the statements that the mayor and I both made is that we have filled in all of these different urban promises that we've made to our city and residents for the better part of a decade in order to ready ourselves for developments like this.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so while this could not have happened ten years ago, and Ms.. Burdick and I desperately tried to have something like this happen despite our efforts, we, I think, had to acknowledge that we didn't quite do our part yet.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So now the city has done its part. Residents have moved in and followed along with their own investment and promise. And this is just really the next step. And so I'm very happy to see this and delighted and really glad that it's happening on third and Pacific.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Pryce.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I just had a couple questions from the staff report. I'll be supporting this project and thank my colleagues who spoke before me for their insight. But I did have a question regarding page three of the staff report where you talk about this not having been the highest price offered for the property, but being the best project in'",
        "'speaker_1': 'terms of meeting the needs of the city. Could you expand on that a little bit more? What was the highest price for the property? And and what is this price per square foot in comparison to other property sales that we've had in the area?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes, I'd be happy to provide that information. The ensemble is offering $6 million per square foot I'm sorry, $6 million, which is $117 a square foot. We had a pretty tall building at the highest price offered for the property was $9.8 million or $192 a square foot.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'However, the total development costs were only 71 million compared to 128 million for ensemble. And so we had to keep in, in our minds the ongoing property tax revenue that will be generated by this property would be significantly higher with that higher development cost of $128 million.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Great. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Councilman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I just wanted to applaud the city team and the council for putting us in a position where this kind of investment can take place. And I think that this is a remarkable step in showing the community how we have turned around and been more business friendly and development friendly while still balancing the important constituent needs and quality'",
        "'speaker_2': 'of life of our residents. And I just think that this is a glowing example of what we all can accomplish when we put all the factors at play and work together to make sure that something can be done.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So acclaims to both of you downtown and the work that you've done in the community. This could not have been done, not even four years ago. I'm just so proud to serve with both of you. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. We'll take public comment now, please, before we come back and close up. Please come forward. And as you come forward, just please state your name for the record and make your comments. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hi. My name is.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Ravi Banda Puti. I've been before this council several times to talk about this property. I wanted.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To. Leena, I'm glad that we clarified this to remind myself some of. Talking points I have because I have a very different view about this project I wanted to tell you about. Actually, I'm going to show it to everybody first.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'First of all, I'm one of the bidders. I'm a real estate developer, and I've been up to the hour in a company here called First Hill.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sir, if you can make the. Can you make the comments on the mikes? Sure.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sure. First Hill, LLC. I proposed to put a Trader Joe's or.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Specialty retail, a specialty supermarket at that site. I'm going to also put 123 apartment units.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. This is what I proposed. What I have there also includes ample parking and affordable housing, have 5% affordable housing. Okay, I got to tell you, ensemble's project, contrary to what.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Everybody has been saying.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We can't recorded if you don't keep talking to the mike.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'm sorry. Contrary to what everybody's been saying, ensemble's.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Proposal is an absolute disaster for this city. And this applies not just Lina to your district, but to everybody in downtown. The city of Long Beach depends upon small businesses.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Particularly businesses located.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In historic properties. That's where the vibrancy of our community comes from. When we build new projects without sufficient parking, what's going to happen is we're going to create a traffic, environmental, social disaster where you have people driving around and we've all seen people do this driving around looking for parking that doesn't exist because the developer didn't build'",
        "'speaker_0': 'enough parking. This project that ensemble is proposing has less than ratio of 1 to 1 parking. The city requires 1 to 1.2 5 to 1. I'm proposing to build 2 to 1 because I want to make sure that we're building for the future.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'When I build this project, I want to make sure that as we grow as a community, people will always be able to come to get their groceries with their car. Because, Leanna, you brought up a good point about this project.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What we want is we want to attract good retailers. As a developer, I know the way you attract good retailers is by building parking. You have to build parking. Okay. So me and my partner, Alan Kazdin, we've we've he built a Trader Joe's in Westwood that has 2 to 1 parking just like mine.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We know how to do it. We've done it before. The people who submitted this ensemble proposal do not have anything in here to accommodate the environmental impact of this project. It's going to be really, really bad for downtown.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's going to kill downtown businesses. It's going to kill small businesses. And it's a really bad idea. And I think that really you want I urge his council to to reconsider this.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I mean.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You know, send it back to the committee, do whatever but reconsiders. Do not vote for the ensemble proposal. Vote for First Hill, LLC. That's the company.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, sir. Time's up.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'My name's Leela Noble. I live in the Walker building and we appreciated the fact that we were able to meet actually with the developer and also with city staff recently. And what I have done is prepared in writing and I'll have multiple copies, basically a summary of the laundry list of concerns that came out of this meeting'",
        "'speaker_1': '. And it's a combination of concern about the process. And we understand that we were very patiently there, was explained to us the process around redevelopment and that this is indeed starting an escrow process. So we get it about what your decision is going to be tonight.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We're concerned in not from a NIMBY point of view. We all chose to live in downtown. We like the idea of being in an urban environment and we also get it about density. But dang, this is a lot of density in a corner of a block.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And what we are saying is that the concerns that we have are not just during construction, but they are literally concerns about the impact. And a couple of you've talked about the balance between the density and the business development and the residents.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, we are here and our whole way is concerned about this. And we want to be an active part of this process because as residents, we are the ones that are going to live with this, with the retail, with the quality of jobs or lack of quality of jobs, with the traffic problems.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we want to be a part of the process and we don't mean just being listened to. Our understanding is that there can be specific mitigations and that there can be changes, that this is the concept and that's what's motivating us to participate.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We don't want to participate just as window dressing, and we are taking you at your word that in fact, this can be a collaborative process. So I've got our list. I'm going to leave it with the clerk, and I'm sure that our councilwoman will share it with the rest of you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But we are very concerned about the level of density and all of the different impacts that is going to have on us, on our streets, on our kids, on the traffic, on the quality of life. If we're going to make downtown a dynamic place, it has to have quality of life.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm Richard Gere, also live in the Walker building. I've been there for ten years. We were really very shocked to learn of this project. We know that we're not going to stop development. We chose to live downtown. We support development.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But at this time, we feel that the community is not aware of this project and the council is going to vote on it. And we just think everything is moving too quickly. Just this week, I ran into a local business person who knew nothing about the project.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Now he probably supports it at this point, but as of a few days ago he wasn't aware of it. Additionally, many of the hope. Merchants are not here tonight because they called a meeting concerning safety in downtown. So we would we would like an opportunity to get in touch with more downtown residents, more downtown merchants and businesspeople'",
        "'speaker_0': '. Also, we have some questions about the complete development process. We understand that in this case there were five proposed developments. We would like to know more about that. We'd like to know what those developments were and have an opportunity to express our opinion about them.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Also, what are the criteria that the Development Department is using to eliminate certain projects? I understand the importance of property taxes, but there are other concerns as well. And finally, I think the council members, as our elected officials, should have sufficient information about all those proposals to make solid decisions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This is a good time to review the process before any damage is done to our wonderful and successful city. Thank you for your time.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The new mayor and members of the council. I just want to say for the record that I agree with the previous speaker that I think we need to look at all the other development proposals because I think we're rushing into this one.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Um, specifically, I was looking at the RFP provided by ensemble and you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Know, sir.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Your name Abraham. Abraham Sandoval. Um, and I was looking at the RFP provided and they specifically state verbatim and I quote, we consider the ample surface parking and street parking within the downtown district potentially sufficient to serve the need.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So potentially sufficient meaning they are not going to provide the parking that is necessary for their project. They're looking to other areas in the downtown area to suffice. And I've been driving around the downtown area and there's not enough parking.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So where do we expect to get all this parking that doesn't exist? Um, I did have a chance to look at first Hill's proposal, and they're providing way more parking than is necessary for their project. So I think we do need to look at all the other development proposals and look at which one is actually going to'",
        "'speaker_0': 'benefit the city. You know, just putting what is a 198,000 square feet of housing in one tower and 72,500 square feet of housing in another tower and not providing enough parking. I just think that's ridiculous. And I think we need to look in greater detail about what we really are approving here today.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'My name is Steve McIsaac and I am a resident in the Walker building and have lived there for the last 11 years. And one of the councilmembers, I think it might have been, Dr. Lowenthal mentioned how they had tried to put it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They did scoped out doing a development in that specific site about ten years ago or so, and that the only project that they could get was maybe like about a.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Five.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Story building or so. And so they felt, I'm paraphrasing, but it seemed like they were happy that we were finally worthy of getting a project of this scope, that we'd sort of finally arrived enough to get someone to pitch us something substantial.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I guess my perception of Long Beach real estate development over the last 11 years, just watching it as just a citizen, someone who lives here, it sometimes reeks of that kind of desperation that finally someone's looking at us, someone's noticing, and we are worthy of their attention.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I would propose that they're actually lucky to get to pitch to us, not the other way around. This is a vibrant, wonderful community, and we don't have to take the first project that comes along just because it's big.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The Long Beach Courthouse is a wonderful example of architecture that fits on its site nicely. It fits into the local environment. It's a beautiful building and we don't need something.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Big just because.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's big. There's a lot of ways to achieve density. We can look at density sites throughout the entire downtown over like a 5 to 10 year period. We don't need it all in one shot. And so just.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Because it's big.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Doesn't mean it's going to achieve the city's.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Goals.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Particularly when we haven't looked at data collection about how many people actually live downtown versus working. There's a lot of assumptions about how people will deal with the lack of parking, including biking to work. And there was a lot of stuff that was based on suppositions and projections, and they may be very well be true, but we'",
        "'speaker_4': 'don't necessarily have data to support those suppositions. So before you build 18 stories on the assumption that everybody's going to be in a live workspace and bike to their bike to their job, I'd like to see some data that would support that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's all. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, sir. As our final speaker, I want to close the speakers list. No.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Larry. Good. Okay.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'Remember it because it was handed out in the event for a dollar. The Boardwalk, the old Broadway Hotel. A 62nd walk from Ocean Boulevard for $1. It's always easy to remember that because that happened at the same time that the ladies of Cartagena were holding on, holding their firm on their price at the Secret Service, didn't want'",

        "'speaker_7': 'And then a few weeks later, they found a a orphan. A cousin of that orphan must have been but ugly because he only got something like $0.09 an acre profit. So if you have enough confidence in your attorney, turn it over to your professional city auditor and let her put a seal of approval on that.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. And what is the criteria that we're you know, you touched on it a bit, but what when we're looking to choose ensemble for this location, what specifically were you looking at to make that selection?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We were looking at compliance with the Downtown Plan, Innovative architecture. We are particularly interested in density and the downtown plan and of course the price per square foot and the total investment value as well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. And what other developments, obviously, civic center that those developments are happening? What other large developments with density that are? I mean, we just approved some a couple of weeks ago. Can you talk about what is around us?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Because it's not just this location, correct?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'If I'm understanding you correctly, are you asking for other redevelopment agency projects in the downtown?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So we have third and Pacific.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Mike, I think I think she also asked about other projects that have density that are being developed in the downtown currently. What are other that are in the pipeline?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So Broadway and Promenade has a density of 127 density units per acre. Broadway and Long Beach Boulevard 161 density units per acre. Ocean and Pine up to 427 hotel rooms. And I think that's. That's all of the downtown projects that I have currently.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. And again, I know that the concept, the design isn't set, but I know we've we've talked to residents about maybe. You know, juxtaposing the the design to make the larger portion on the other side. And there's been some I, you know, talk on on some other items.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Does it have to will it will have to be a max of 18 stories. Is that what was discussed or are we looking at possibly less?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'A few responses to that. Question one. No, it doesn't have to be 18 stories, and we will work to address mitigation measures that might result in a building less than 18 stories. I'd like to point out that ensemble has really put in some significant time in analyzing the site and how best to develop the property in context'",
        "'speaker_7': 'of the surrounding historic buildings. And in that regard, they have rotated the taller building in a way to give the narrowest visual impact on the Walker building, and that is intended hopefully to reduce shade and shadow relative to the impacts to the to the historic structures.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But again, community input will also, I think, help inform and direct the ultimate development scenario that's being proposed to the property through the traditional sequel process.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Great. And I again, I do hope that we continue discussions about mitigation as if this process should go through, go forward, and as we get closer to that 18 month and construction, etc.. Another quick question. If you know off the top of your head how many parking spaces we have in the downtown kind of area?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I know we have quite a few spaces in the city place lot that are available, but what other spaces do we have? Do we have a number to identify the spaces?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I don't have a number off the top of my head. I know City Place Garage is typically 50% full at any particular time. I think there's 1500 or 1800 spaces in those three parking structures. And there's other redevelopment, former redevelopment agency controlled parking spaces nearby as well in the 100 Broadway space.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Can we building. So I'll request that we have a to if we can get a two from Ford that just basically identifies the parking spaces. I know we've done the parking study and there's a lot of talk about parking.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I believe that there is parking available. We just have to pay for it oftentimes. And I know that's a tough pill to swallow sometimes, but I live right off Pine Avenue and I know how wholeheartedly, how hard it is to find parking sometimes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I think that if we had a good measure of how many spaces were in that adjacent area, it would be helpful for residents to identify where those spaces are, you know, going forward with development.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Just to confirm, you're looking for public spaces available for the public to park.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. Or even private spaces that we've, you know, connected with private owners to be able to offer for our residents. If we can provide that, that would be great. So again, I think the residents for being here, I know that there's a lot of concerns, but I do stress and I promise you that we will be speaking'",
        "'speaker_1': 'with you quite frequently on the mitigation parking, any concerns you may have? I know that this looked like a very drastic and striking project, and it is. But these are the types of projects we're looking to, you know, really kind of reinvigorate the great investment.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So it's not necessarily that this is happening tomorrow, but a lot of investment I know will come from many of these properties and these developments similar to this. However, mitigation, parking, construction issues will be discussed, I assure you that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we'll leave it at that. Again, support this item and I think everybody for being here.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Before we go to a vote, I just want to say a couple couple comments first. I want to just want to just echo what Councilwoman Gonzales and the vice mayor said.

And so you're seeing, I think, a lot of a lot of projects that are much more dense than we than we've had in the past.

        "'speaker_3': 'are either in the pipeline or being planned. And so as we as these projects move forward, I think there's there's clearly some concern from some of the residents that I used to represent as well over at the at the crest and the walker.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so I'm happy to hear there'll be a you know, the community process will be thorough and that folks will have a chance to weigh in. But as a downtown, we're going to be having this conversation over and over again in the in the years ahead, because there's going to be an influx of projects that are happening'",
        "'speaker_3': 'not just at this site, but across the downtown. The one thing I wanted to to add for those who had concern about about what the process is, just to reiterate, the process that we went through for this is actually mandated by the state.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so the state we have to follow a very, very careful list, just a checklist, an order of what we have to do through the governor's office for us to get rid of these properties. And so that's what we're going through right now.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Once the this isn't a typical process where the city brings in the developer and then we're working on developing a project together, which is what almost always happens in projects. This is us having to sell the project per the governor's mandate, and then at that point it's in the hands of the developer, and then we begin to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'work on developing a project together. So it's a little different. I know it's not how it typically is, but that's also what happened when all these properties went went on sale. And so regardless, I think we all want to end up with a home run project on the site that makes it downtown an even better place to'",

        "'speaker_10': 'And I guess really over a year, if you look at the release of the proposals and pre proposal conferences, proposals were due last January 1st, 2015, and we did review all aspects, aspects of this process in our in our report.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So I want to take a little time. I'm not going to spend a lot of time going through this, but want to hit the the issues and findings related to first the Republic Services letter of protest and then to the echo comment letter.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So going down, these are the these are the points that Republic Services made. One analysis of proposals misrepresented the proposed fixed monthly fee to be charged to the city. We I do believe after spending a lot of time looking at the cost proposals and talking with the Republic and talking with H.F. and H, that is an accurate'",
        "'speaker_10': 'statement that that there was confusion by republic on how these should be filled out. There was some I think, some lack of clarity in the in the instructions and how they should be filled out. But at the end, the Republic Services consistently was the third lowest cost vendor and that the the misrepresent misunderstanding out there is misrepresented'",
        "'speaker_10': '. There is misunderstood way that they are proposing to provide services are the cost of their providing services did not change what the recommendations would be in the end and staff did look at that in the very end. Additionally, there are several times that republic they said they were confused about what this meant theirself.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'They had several opportunities to challenge that and they never did get proper clarification, even as they're asked to give additional cost cost measures. They were asked to the city would allow respondents to submit a proposals for a ten year contract term.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The city did say last spring, no, we're going to stand pat. City later changed their mind to do that. About six months later, after they had looked at the proposals, looked at the review, and we're seeing that there could be opportunities to to save monies for the city in doing so.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And they did change their mind even though they initially said no to republic. And that was within the context and confines of what they're allowed to do based on the RFP and what was put out to the vendors.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The request for alternative cost proposals received after July one were out of the. Took place outside the process described in the RFP. And the main the main really response to that is the RFP said that the city could change the process and asked for additional information if in the best interests of the city.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And that that appears to be what the reason the city did this and the and the motivation behind these changes was to reduce cost in the best interest of the city. Number four would be although the city indicated there would be no changes to the RFP in the June questions, staff selected recommended a vendor with changes to'",
        "'speaker_10': 'their RFP in the long term. And again, the city said, we will make changes, we will change, you know what our requirements are if in our best interests and everyone was given an opportunity to make these two to respond to all these changes as they went along, no one vendor was given preference over another in terms of'",
        "'speaker_10': 'making those opportunities. And the city also had the opportunity to choose a vendor and negotiate different terms as well, and they chose to let all vendor stay in the process as long as possible. So for public services, it doesn't.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'They wanted to clarify that the criteria using the evaluation process at that time, when they asked this question, the final report was not out. It now is out. We do believe that that considered all aspects of the RFP and the final recommendations based on the cost proposals and the impact from transitioning to the vendors.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'There was no wait, but an evaluation which is now out did respond to those factors. Republic Services requested the city only review the initial sealed cost proposals. And again, the staff if that that was the case that. Republic was still lower than ateco and and waste management at that time.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'They are still third on that. The summary matrices did not show the full services enhancements of the proposal. I think that is accurate. Steph did change that, but the full service enhancements were considered in the evaluation process by H.F. and H and Republic Services believe the proposed recyclable revenues remitted to the city were not given sufficient weight'",
        "'speaker_10': 'and evaluation process. And this is a key finding. One because the. The recyclable, recyclable revenues are included in the overall cost proposal. And effectively what the city did in their cost proposal is shift the risk of recycling revenues being lower than assumed because the city is asking for direct, you know, a single cost per year or cost'",
        "'speaker_10': 'per month annualized for these services. So the one the revenues are included in the overall cost and to those revenues are not guaranteed. They're not guaranteed to the vendor in terms that they're going to get. And the revenues they say they're going to provide for the city are also not guaranteed.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So those will float to the market. Additionally, if you look at the the way that higher assuming higher revenues in their cost proposal actually came to reduce their cost and they're still not the low cost vendor. All right.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Ateco comment letter Ateco had similar comments. They had several comments on the cards which these all relate to. The card issue gets very complicated. The city did not accept Ed Co's responses on cards, which all these three. They're asking for a different way of doing the cards.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The city did not agree with that, and nor are they required to. There is. Ed Koch noted that there's $70 million in revenue. I think that's not. It's not net revenue. But that really is irrelevant to the overall choice of who was chosen.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Annette, go ask the city to clarify the decision to request alternative cost proposals on an as needed basis. And the city, you know, I think they looked at Echo's responses. Echo didn't respond exactly as the city requested, and that made it more difficult for the city to to include them.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Still, they're the lowest cost vendor throughout on all of the recommendations. So talk about little recommendations to, to improve the process. Um, which is primarily these are, I think again, maintaining the boundaries and guidelines outlined in RFP provisions is, is important and should be held to a little more strictly in the future the misrepresentation of financial data'",
        "'speaker_10': 'that was the issue. Really there needs to be clear instructions provided everyone else seemed to understand what they were, but what those instructions were. But they did not, I think, just clarify the instructions. The perceived lack of consideration of all proposal evaluation criteria.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We would recommend some kind of weighted criteria. So there's some sense of how each proposal came in and they have that provides transparency throughout the process and then the need for an independent evaluation of proposals. We suggest you continue engaging consultants like H.f. and H who have, especially on these proposals, requiring technical knowledge and expert support.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And we think they did a reasonable job in their support of the city in this process. So in conclusion, um, we think the proposal actually outlined a very logical process. The city staff did go outside of some of the RFP processes in order to complete the evaluation in too short of a time frame.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And that's resulted in having a longer time frame. Um, and although irregular irregularities in the process occurred, we do not feel that hindered the proposal or the evaluation process. There was a fair evaluation process and do not believe we need to re-issue the RFP.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Our recommendation was that you follow H.f. and his recommendation to either choose Ed Co based on a low cost proposal or a waste management based on their long term relationship. The city lack of vendor transition and second lowest cost proposal.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So if that, I'd be happy to answer any questions.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Mr. West, do you have anything additional before we go to. No, sir. Okay. Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you and thank you. Mr..'",
        "'speaker_0': 'BRANSON That's right.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Mr.. BRANSON. Another consultant for a PR firm for a very thorough presentation. I have my reservations about moving forward with the independent study when this issue was before us, but I'm certainly glad we did because I think it was a responsible action.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And based on the work that you've done, it's, I think, provided a lot more clarity, hopefully for this council. This process has been long and complicated, and it seems that we are now back at square one. Of course, we did this, went forward with this based on recommendations from our city auditor who weighed in on this, as'",
        "'speaker_5': 'well as the city manager's office. Who. It's recommended that the council exercise prudence and caution. And so we did the independent study. The PFM findings, in my opinion, validate our staff recommendations a few months ago. And so with that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You know, I see no other option. I think the most responsible action is to make a motion to accept the staff recommendations, to award the recycling services to waste management.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That's why the council on the item before you this evening. That is on the floor at this time is to receive and file the report from this next item. You will have the option to either accept staff's recommendation or to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Reject.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It just to receive and find the report. Next item to get a chance to accept. Mr. Austin you can make that the next item.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay, so I will revise my motion to receive a further report.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There's a motion received from the report concerned from range of things. On the second.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think I will hold my comments further on the contract when we go to the next. The next item on the agenda.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Councilor on Price.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Q I do have a few questions on the report. I want to thank our consultant for being here. So thank you. And I want to thank our City Attorney's Office for facilitating the additional report and Amy Webber's role and seeing this process through.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think that helped, at least in my mind, have another layer of oversight, which I think was very good. As the report has highlighted by PFM, you know, two out of the three vendors that really became part of the relevant discussions had raised issues with the process.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And this is a very, very highly technical subject matter. And at least for me, I know it was, I believe, the prudent thing to do to have an objective analysis done. I did have a couple of questions regarding and I have said from the very beginning, we have.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Excellent companies that are bidding for this for this contract. All of them have really great resources, municipal resources. To me, it has always been more about the process of how we get to the recommendation than who actually gets the contract.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's that's always been my position and and all. I'm a fan of big data, so I appreciate the additional data you've provided us. I do have a couple of questions. The the options that you've provided for council, are those prioritized in the enumerated order or are they just the three options?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'They're the three options. I have no opinion on how council should move forward. But just those are the three options that I the only opinion is I don't believe there is any any reason that you that I'd say you have to throw out the RFP, but that is still an option.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But I don't believe it's necessary to to make a choice on a fair process.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then this may be a question that's better posed to city staff. I'm not sure if maybe our public works department or the city manager. Mr. McDonald. I don't know if anyone has given any thought to the option of rebidding.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'What would the costs and the timeline for such a process look like?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Here comes James McDonald. He can respond to that. Council member just quickly estimating based on the time and complexity, we would start with at least six months and based on this timeline, on this process and hoping that we've cured the recommendations as provided by PFM, that I think that would be a realistic starting point.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And what do you think about the cost? Because I'm going to talk about a few things that were highlighted in the report. But what would the cost be to your team to facilitate this type of a process?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Councilmember Price just to address the cost as information.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We engaged in the initial RFP.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Process and that cost.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Roughly $100,000.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I would want to point out as well that if the direction tonight.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To go to a new RFP, we would need to take action.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'On item 28 and extend the current contract as that concludes at the end of this month.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I appreciate that. And these are just really informational questions because three options have been provided. And unless we know the pros and cons of each option, I don't think it's, in my opinion, prudent to weigh the options without having all the data.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I want to go through the report just just a little bit, because I had a few areas of inquiry. First of all, I thought the report was really good and moving forward. I mean, this is a this was a significant contract for the city of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And while I do know that there are often. Glitches and irregularities that occur in any process. I was understandably. But yet. Reasonably disappointed in some of the irregularities that we saw unfold here because they led to the appearance of something more this this, you know, appearance of impropriety sometimes can come in to a contract process and really'",
        "'speaker_1': 'taint an otherwise solid process. And that was the part that was disappointing to me. And one of the things I note, I appreciate that you've come up with some recommendations for the future. But one of the areas that I think we really need to focus on moving forward is that there was a lack of clarity in terms'",
        "'speaker_1': 'of what types of responses were expected. And so that resulted in a little bit of confusion in a highly technical area in regards to how people were responding to the additional augmentation requests. And that created really not a level playing field because everybody was operating from a different standpoint and that was disappointing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The other thing that I found that was a little bit disappointing and and this is not a negative whatsoever on Mr. McDonald or his shop because I know they were working very diligently on this and it was a resource issue, but having to change the point of contact so that the contact person for the city was somehow'",
        "'speaker_1': 'changed in the process due to a lack of resources, created some speculation on the part of the companies that were bidding that was really unjustified. It sounds like that, you know, there was this change of contact person and that resulted in people thinking there was more to it than there really was, it sounds like, from the report'",
        "'speaker_1': '. So those are two areas where, you know, this is a very significant contract. And moving forward, we want to make sure that we have adequate resources so that we're criticism, proof when it comes to those kinds of changes in the process.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And again, I've worked with Mr. McDonald now for for two years. He does excellent work. His team does excellent work. This was just a huge contract. And it sounds like there were some staffing resources issues that came up in the middle of this very lengthy process that may have contributed to the confusion on page 17 of the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'report. There is a reference to a figure, and I'm hoping that someone can give me a little bit more explanation on what's outlined in the last paragraph of page 17. The savings by vendor in each.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Yes. Yeah. Yeah. So the savings by vendor. So and this was in response to looking at the fact that the on the alternative cost proposals, especially the ten year cost proposal, there wasn't a requirement to to give detailed, detailed analysis of your costs for the vendors to give detailed outs to the cost on page 18, which is'",
        "'speaker_10': 'where Figure one is located. It just is really looking at the difference because you went from a seven year contract with carts as needed. You start with the seven year contract carts replaced in year four. Waste management included in their initial proposal, a seven year contract with carts replacement as needed.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And then later on, the city. And the city requested that same cost from everybody because there are a significant reduction in cost for waste management. The city then in late September said We'd also like to know what your cost would be for ten year contract, right?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'With or without carts. Carts place near for as needed. So the the point in this was that one of the difficulties in looking at this or one of the things that didn't happen was that there was no requirement requirement on the ten year contract to also give the detailed cost proposals.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And so when you're looking at just some of the changes, the differences between what happened to the seven year and ten year contract, there was a question, especially, you know, waste management said continually higher savings for each for each contract.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And it was just it was hard to tell where that was coming. And one of the reasons the city asked for in the RFP, the detailed cost numbers, was to make sure that the costs were feasible. But I think what you also have here is you have a guaranteed cost that that if there's something going on with'",
        "'speaker_10': 'waste management, that they either haven't cost it a ride or there's some, you know, some factor that's not going on that's not clear for them that they continually provided lower cost options. And and they would have to stick to that cost proposal.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And they're able to do that. Right. So all all of these vendors have very large balance sheets and are able to do that. But there's this is really pointing out the difficulty there. So because there's some, you know, some strange numbers here and that it's hard to understand all the numbers if you're not asking for that information'",
        "'speaker_10': 'consistently. But but again, they're getting to what they're willing to give this the city these services for. And so the number they provide is valid.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Did you did I hear you correctly that the h f an h report was released?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That's what I'm told. It was released. Yes, that is I didn't I did not provide it. But I think that's out there for the vendors to receive.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that's an 11 page report.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's on the website. It's been made available on the website. And I believe it's an 11 page report.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It sounds about. Right.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. I don't want to reference anything I'm not supposed to. The question that I have is at some point was a seven year contract term analyzed and what, if any, were the recommendations regarding a seven year contract term?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I think H said if if you go a seven year contract term, you should go that go. And if you go with a ten year contract term, good waste management. I believe that was their recommendation. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And in regards to your analysis in your review, did you make any recommendations or have any findings in regards to the term of the contract?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I'd say after after talking to both all of the vendors and and staff and H.f. and H, everybody kind of agreed a ten year contract makes the most sense. And the reason it makes the most sense is that the the recycling work that you're contracting for here, that is a very capital intensive endeavor with both the processing'",
        "'speaker_10': 'plants as well as the trucks. And the longer you have that, you know, you can amortize that capital, the better price you can give the city and the more able you are to provide services on an ongoing basis.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. I do want to say, looking at your recommendations to improve the processes outlined in your PowerPoint presentation, I really thought the one that I heard a lot during this process was the weighted evaluation criteria as opposed to a pass fail.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That seemed to be something that everybody was in. Agreement would lead to a more consistent and assessment ultimately. So I hope that staff and our city manager take that to heart in terms of future contract proposal evaluations, because I think that's a critical one.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then finally, in terms of my questions, you noted in your report that there was in fact, probably there always would be an incumbent advantage in any term, in any any time we've got a vendor of this this length and relationship, but that there were things that the city could have done to not have facilitated a further'",
        "'speaker_1': 'advantage. What are some of the things that you have pointed out that we can kind of take note of in the future because that wasn't included in your recommendations, but I did see it included it throughout the report.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Yes. So I think the the primary there is an incumbent advantage. The city knows that there can be advantage or disadvantage based on the relationship, the city and how that vendor is perceived. This case, it appears to be advantage waste managers, good relationship and long term relationship with the city.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'You know, this is just my my point of view. And I didn't get this from my interviews, but it appeared that asking for a seven or a ten year contract with carts replaced in year four puts everybody on an equal footing in terms of cost in changing to a car to replace to at.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Yeah. Whereas needed gives a greater advantage to the incumbent vendor just because.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Because they know the status.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'You know the status of all of those carts at the same time, they still weren't even with that. They weren't the lowest cost vendor. And so that's, you know, so it didn't give them such an advantage that they were able to to be the low cost vendor.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But that because because you could have that perception of maybe thinking a little more upfront about what options you might want to provide and if you're going to provide an option for on this case carts as needed vendors probably needed a little more information about the current state of the carts, and I didn't hear that from the'",
        "'speaker_10': 'vendors. It's something more that I saw in terms of as I went through this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Now, just one final question, and because you're probably familiar with this more based on what you do than than any of us are, but is there any way to you know, in the legal field, we have a way of walling off somebody that may have an interest in an outcome and a case or some sort of an'",
        "'speaker_1': 'interest where we don't want their input to be involved in how we handle the case. Is there any way that the city could have maybe walled off any staff members that would have been working with the incumbents or any departments that would have been working with the incumbents in order to make the process truly objective?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is that even feasible?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Yeah. I mean, I think there was I think the city tried to put in place a process that, you know, they're not talking to vendors, vendors, not talking to staff or counsel or other people. So some kind of, you know, kind of the gag order, don't talk about this.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Let us do our let us do our work there. I think the process in terms of staff members do have relationships. I mean, they have relationships not just with waste management, though I'm sure they have relationships with other vendors as well.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And vendors have relationships with different people. So there's, you know, there's an I think there's an ethical duty and I. I said nothing and I heard nothing. That that ethical duty was violated of not talking to an existing vendor about, let's say, anyone else's process or what the costs are coming in or any or anything like that'",
        "'speaker_10': '. The you know, the only I guess the only way to do it is to have somebody completely outside of the city do this. And that may not be in the best interests of the city either. Right. Sometimes you can create more problems by trying to solve a problem.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But there's definitely an ethical I think there's an. You know that the city not talk to vendors about this. And I saw no evidence that they did. And I heard no evidence that they did.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Great. Well, thank you for your report. I look forward to hearing what my colleagues have to say about the report and the recommendations. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Kate. We're going to keep going. Just as a reminder, we're still on the report and have yet yet gotten to the item. So, Councilman Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I was hoping that the debate on the item could happen now so we don't have to re debate it. That would be great. So. So let me just say thank you to PFM Public Financial Management for stepping in and doing this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I certainly understand what is at stake in this contract. And when this came up, the logic was questions were raised. We wanted to take an additional step of due diligence to make sure the city council felt confident in staff's recommendation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we inquired for the city attorney to get involved with selecting the third party vendor and to conduct this this review and to tell us whether or not there was a foul and whether that foul influenced the process.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So my first question would be, given that we offered this to the city manager, city attorney to step in. My first question is, what was your process for selecting this vendor? This consultant.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Mayor Morris, Councilman Councilman Richardson. We obtained through our own office, we got the name of of a couple of firms. We talked with city management, if they had vendors. I also talked to the city auditor. From that, we created a short list and we interviewed three firms.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'All three, we believe, were highly qualified. And out of that RFP or interview process, we selected PFM.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Great. So you would say through that process, the this was the most qualified, most credible third party consultants that you considered?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That's correct. There were a number of factors that we considered in the selection, and PFM was at the top of that list.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. I see that a number of issues were raised, which I would consider a foul. Now, my question is, I understand these issues and I understand the the the final recommendation. So help me walk me through and walk the public through how these issues do not did not impact the final recommendation.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So, yes, as we looked at all these issues and again, I think it's hard to have this kind of process without having any any kind of issues. What I what I looked at in terms of these issues and how they related to the final recommendation was, one, did they did was anyone left out of the process or'",
        "'speaker_10': 'unduly not able to provide reasonable cost or bids for this process? I do not believe that was the case. Everyone was given equal time. In fact, even after the city had narrowed down to two vendors, which was Ateco and waste management for full interviews, when they decided to do a ten year contract option, they opened that back'",
        "'speaker_10': 'up to all four vendors and interviewed the other two vendors as well on their on their proposal. So I think the city city did go out of its way to try to be inclusive with all the vendors as they made changes, which I don't believe they had to do as it related to their the requirements of the'",
        "'speaker_10': 'RFP that the city was trying to make, you know, its best efforts in getting this done in a timely process and also at the same time getting the best, best cost for the city. So they felt in the city's best interest, it was helpful to kind of continue moving this forward.'",

        "'speaker_10': 'So really what I looked at, the kind of the what I filtered through is did any of these items did they show a lack of, you know, I think ethical judgment of the city? I do not I did not see that.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Did they. Did they show a lack of ability for each vendor to properly get their, you know, provide their credentials and provide their costs? I did not see that. And did it. Did it, you know, effectively change the what the recommendation would have been from the start?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I don't believe it did either, especially given that waste management had come out with you know, they came with two options in their original proposal, which spurred the first the first request for everyone to also give that same cost proposal.'",

Or was there anything that happened in this process that significantly disadvantaged one of the you know, one of the partners that should have been considered in that top two?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I do not believe so. I think in any event, the top two vendors would be ateco and waste management. And I think there's a question of, you know, there's other issues that come to bear on cost that city staff has brought forward.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I think that is outside of the purview of this review in terms of what is the city value, what does the city want to move forward with. But I did not feel that the process that happened and even some of the misunderstandings, which I do believe were misunderstandings on both sides, had any impact in what the'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. So so and I understand that that clearly and thank you for conducting this review. And I do see that a number of issues were raised. So my question at this point to the city manager is there are four recommendations here in terms of.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'Councilmember We've already talked about that internally with the Public Works Director and we certainly will take all of these to heart and we will again when we select consultants to do our RFP. In this case, we would talk to them.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I can't pronounce their H and H to guarantee that they put those things in place. When we do our piece to get the consultant will put those things in place so that the consultant works with us on that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. So I will just end with we conducted this process to make sure that the Council felt confident in the process and that the process at the end of the at the end of the day was valid, legally valid.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And based on this report, although there were problems, I don't know that we crossed the threshold of the process being invalid. So should you know, you know, if there's a motion at the next step to approve staff recommendation, that's what I'm going to support tonight.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Councilman Hooper now.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. And my question is for Mr. Branson. Great final report, by the way, but referring to tonight's report. You used the, you know, avoidance of traditional cost or impact of transitioning that was mentioned a few times. And excuse me, if it appears in your other report, I didn't see it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But is that is that an intangible or is there a way to quantify that number?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Yeah, I think it's it's primarily intangible. I did talk to staff about the transition cost issue and the intangible primarily relates to I mean, it's tangible in terms of if you think if there's a if there's a major transition and vendors, there will be missed missed pick ups, you know, as one vendor gets used to what the'",
        "'speaker_10': 'roots are when they are, how they work and kind of special, you know, special streets or cul de sacs or whatever that is.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'All right. So so you're saying it's a. It's real, but it's not a known quantity.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It's a real but not a known quantity.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. And the conversation about the cards, that would be a transition cost if the existing vendor had cards out there that they didn't need to replace. Would that be part of that? Or you didn't you wouldn't consider that normally.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Well, in terms of that, you know, the cart issue is is a more complex issue. Right. And going from fixed to as as needed. And I had several conversations with vendors about the card issue. It is a very that could have been you know, that could have been a whole nother study by the staff as they looked'",
        "'speaker_10': 'at it themselves. But the I think one of the things staff was looking at was that the current practice is as needed. That has worked well for the city. There's not been issues with that. And they felt by changing from a fixed replacement to an as needed, that could result in some overall savings.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. And then you mentioned the weighted system. So I think what you're saying is no matter how many matrices there are, they should be weighted with some type of numerical system.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Yes. That there's some you know, they're one of the I think one of the issues for the vendors and what's required by the RFP to have a weighted system. The city said they weren't going to do a weighted system.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'They did a system where it says, are you qualified or not? At the same point is this was a this is a complicated service. And there's both, you know, the collection as well as the processing. And there could have been some of those factors could have been taken into consideration where if you had a weighted system as'",
        "'speaker_10': 'opposed to do you meet that scale or not? Again, it wasn't required by the RFP. We don't if that's not an issue, but for the future, that I think would help in giving the council information as well as to what they're choosing and what their options are.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Thank you. And just one last point to follow up on what Councilmember Richardson was saying, to quote the late, great Chick Hearn, no harm, no foul. So what Councilmember Richardson was describing as a foul, you're saying if there was no harm done, there was no foul.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I'm saying that's the result. At the same time, you're looking at the process, there is no, you know, nothing that rose to the level in terms of any kind of staff malfeasance or staff, you know, mismanagement of this that would say what, you really should do this over.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So what happened was, you know, the irregularities were there and you should avoid those. But they did not, in my opinion, just reach to a level of saying you should throw the whole.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I got it. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Gentlemen, your ringa.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Very well. In the spirit of no harm, no foul. There was some harm, I guess. How much gets to staff? How much should we pay for? For this review? For this.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Report? I think the estimate was not to exceed 30,000.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Well, because it's an additional 30,000. But, you know, based on some of the comments that I've heard today, I guess it was a money well spent. This report, as was mentioned before, validated what I really knew back in the beginning in terms of staff, did its diligence, it did its job.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They reviewed all the materials as it was submitted to them. Granted, we did discover now this report and it's and it's and it's a it's okay that there were some other. Things that they could have done to make it stronger.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The point system obviously is a good recommendation, and I would certainly support that. But I think that in the end, staff did what they were supposed to do, and this report validates that. And so I will be supporting the staff recommendations.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. And Councilman Andrews.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I think after listening to these various reports and for my colleagues, you know, at one time I had reservations about all of it. I really needed to hear all the reports from the staff and from my colleagues, because I think that this gives me a better picture of how I can stand on these various issues'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. I'm I'm proud of us for making the step to do this review. And the reason I think it's important is that while we always want to trust that our staff are doing the right thing occasionally in any large government organization, that things can happen.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I think that this keeps everyone aware that we as a council are here to protect the public interest and ensure that each and every group of individuals, if a mistake is made, that we're here to review it and move forward and take the recommendations.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But had something been terrible, we would also be the the guardians of the public trust to look into that and ensure that everything is okay. So I'm proud of us for taking that step. And I'm even more proud that anything that was done was not something that needs us to throw the whole thing out.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Because one of the other components of this is that businesses spend a considerable amount of money putting forward the documentation and participating in the interviews and going through the processes to become a partner with our city. And so I hope that they value that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We wanted the process to be reviewed and ensure its fairness because this is a very expensive contract that I think is going to be with us for a very long time and it is our responsibility to ensure that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I too will be supporting the staff recommendation and thankful for the amazing team that we have here at the city who are appreciative of most of the staff are also residents. So I think that they appreciate that we're here to look into things because things happen and sometimes it's an accident and sometimes it's not.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'priority in looking at this as a city councilmember for the whole city, not just the first District, is that no service interruption happens for our residents because first and foremost, that is most important to ensure that we're continuing with the exceptional service that we've had so far, but also doing so in a way that is a streamlined'",

        "'speaker_1': 'So I believe I too will be supporting the staff's recommendation. I think it's fair. I think we've gone through and exhausted many of the questions that have been answered to my satisfaction. And if there's anything else, I'm sure we'll we'll we'll raise that again.'",
