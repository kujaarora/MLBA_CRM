A previously adopted urgency ordinance relating to the temporary limitation on the issuance of building or construction permits for new residential standalone construction along commercial and transportation corridors in West Long Beach.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'And there are two votes required for this item.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. City Manager.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. I'd like to introduce our acting.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Planning manager, Allison Spindler.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'She will do a presentation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'On this item.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening, Honorable Mayor and City Council. The item before you today is a presentation on the extension of a moratorium for new construction of residential housing units on major corridors in West Long Beach. A bit of background on the moratorium.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'A year ago, the Council originally enacted a moratorium for new standalone residential development along Willow Street and Santa Fe Ave in West Long Beach. This was because the existing zoning code regulations for the West Willow and Santa Fe corridors predate adoption of the general plan land use element and do not allow for mixed use development.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That would be consistent with the adopted land use element, which designates the aforementioned corridors as neighborhoods serving. You can see said corridors on the maps shown in blue. The moratorium was set to expire June 15th and SAFF is recommending that it be extended to allow for the requisite zoning code update and related economic study to be completed'",
        "'speaker_3': '. As mentioned, staff is still working on the requisite technical work to ensure new zoning districts not only implement the land development place type guidelines, but also reflect community priorities and are informed by market research on the area. Community outreach to date, including a May 14th Virtual Open House, is being incorporated into the zoning proposal.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Moving forward, staff from the Economic Development Department will begin outreach and data collection next month for economic empowerment zones in key areas of the city, including West Palm Beach. The zoning code districts are also being developed with community feedback reflected in the drafts, with the goal of preparing the zones for adoption by the end of the year'",
        "'speaker_3': '. Therefore, staff is requesting an extension of the urgency ordinance to ensure the zoning and economic study work is completed. The municipal code requires an urgency ordinance extension to be a full year, but again, it's anticipated the new zones will come back at the end of 22 2022.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'With that staff request, the one year extension of the moratorium on the issuance of building permits and entitlements for new residential standalone construction and the project area are available to answer any questions that you might have.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. That concludes the staff report as any public comment on item 21.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There are three public comment speakers Gilbert Oliveira, Robert Bachman and Sand. I can say thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Please come forward.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'What? Robert Bachmann. I'm real. You know, I represent Mr. Real. I'm an attorney. Basically, Mr.. I purchased property back in June of 2020 and waited about six months to start the development process on property in this area. At the time of the first moratorium he firewall he had, it was about six months after he purchased the property'",
        "'speaker_2': '. It took him time to develop a plan. And I understand the intent of the what's going on as far as a mixed use and that type of thing. He developed two duplexes and it's about a 6500 square foot property.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It was an ugly parking lot and he spent quite a bit of money on the property and obtaining the necessary permits. He was well into the permitting process, including soils and architectural and civil and everything else that had to be done.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'He was refining his final architectural plans and the first moratorium, which was a year ago. And now we're asking for an extension with the financial situations that are in position. That would be another three quarter percent increase tomorrow in the financing cost through the Federal Reserve.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It would be, you know, a great hardship for someone like him. And I don't know how many others there are in this city that had started to develop prior to the first moratorium. And we're not told anything about it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I just it's it's his position. Well, of course, I believe the moratorium is probably going to pass, but if it could be finished within 90 to 180 days and made sure that it's at the end of the year and no longer than that, I think another year is way too long and the 90 days would even'",
        "'speaker_2': 'be better because then you've had 15 months and I don't know how long it takes to develop a study like this, but certainly it could have been done, I would think well within a year, which would be right now.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So basically that's the situation. And we're asking if rather than getting into an adversarial situation, that the one year extension be reduced to 90 days, 280 days maximum. Thank you. I just want to say that I don't know if there's a theory for all of my fault, but I got mislead by the by the start.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'When I first look into the property, I was told that the property was on four apartments or a commercial property either way, and that the city wanted maximize units because the city was in need of low income housing or apartment units.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I bought the property under the information that I received from the city. You know, I spent money on blueprints, architectural drawings, soil reports. I, you know, I spent a lot of money on the property and I don't think it's fair for it not is not fair for me because I follow all the guidelines that the city'",
        "'speaker_2': 'gave me to follow. And I think I should be compensated for all the money that I spent on my property. I even included building permits. I mean, a blank check. You know, I was almost ready to pull the permit when when the moratorium came along.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Speaking as a property owner from the Santa Fe. I'm in the Watson area. Um, what we're finding, what a lot of these zoning, um, projects, uh, whether it's, you know, those new plan, there's, I know there's a zone in one that happened right now in the central area where I live in is there's not enough public, uh'",
        "'speaker_2': ', response occurring. Um, you played was pretty good people. It was pretty good. But in other parts of the city, there's literally none zero the public response occurring. You know, you have trusted partners and nonprofits who are engaging as consultants, but little to no community feedback.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I do not think one year is is enough time. I think I think 2 to 3 years is enough time. Um, we're finding that there's a lot of concentration of capital moving into these areas that are major commercial corridor, as if this was not the west side of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Uh, this would be a major corridor that has hundreds of millions of capital investment going into it. And I think that a lot of people, both minor, uh, and on the larger end, are very much aware of this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They're very much aware of what the Caltrans and infrastructure projects are looking like on the state side. And they're trying to, uh, catch that, you know, when investing into these areas. I think anyone buying in the COVID period is very clearly aware of that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And it's unfortunate that we don't necessarily have an inclusionary housing element connected to any of these recent developments, which is why the moratorium exists in the first place, to kind of slow down this this rash stampede, you know, all a scramble of Africa or something to invest into these areas right before all the big boys start coming'",
        "'speaker_2': 'in. So I think and I'm speaking as someone that owns in the area, I think that this should be maintained, it should be pushed further. And we should really involve a conversation about what this small business look like with these types of commercial corridors.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'How are we protecting them? And what are the the the housing protections really for for low income people? Because people can say that low income is the emphasis of them. But, you know, then if it's a new residential one, it's going to be market rate and market rate, you know, as we know today, is not appropriate to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'what the average per income of a per capita income is in these zip codes. So I hope that we can extend this further and really slow down over, you know, development of these areas. Uh, because with SB nine, you know, we can't really control what comes into these, into our communities.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. I think that concludes public comment. So now we'll take you back behind the wheel.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Councilmember Iran activates marin and i want to thank the gentleman who came up in spokane to speak on this item. It's important that we get those perspectives as well in terms of what's going on here with this moratorium.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Basically, the moratorium is to look at all the corridor, not just one site or two is to look at the sites from Pacific Coast Highway to Wardlow, from the border to the river. There's a lot of properties there that need to be revisited.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The land use element that is currently in place does not address a lot of issues that we have with mixed use. And there are some properties there that are non-conforming that create other types of issues that are not neighborhood saving properties.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I want to ask Steph, excuse me about, you know, how if we can address the gentleman's concerns regarding his current position and the effects of the moratorium, is there something that we can work with him with? Is there something that maybe staff can address or meet with him separately to address those specific issues?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilmember. I'm glad to exchange information with the attorney for that individual and meet with them this week or next. So we're glad that those discussions I can't commit that we can resolve this issue necessarily, but we're glad to have those further discussions.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then, as Alison explained in her presentation, it's a municipal code reference to a year. But our our expectation and commitment is to have this work done by December 31st. So we'll continue to meet with you and your staff and provide monthly updates to that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I appreciate that. I think I appreciate staff for having taken this on. It's a very important item for the West Palm Beach area. We need to get some more activity out there. We need to activate those two streets.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They are major corridors in West Palm Beach that need to be developed and activated in more of a way to be more neighborhood serving. So I really appreciate the work you've been doing there, and I also appreciate the fact that we're going to be having these community input meetings where we're going to have people come and and'",
        "'speaker_5': 'address the commission or at least the issues that they feel are important in those two corridors, so that we can come up with a plan that would be amenable not only to those developers or landowners who are interested in developing those properties.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But also to the community in regards to what goes on those properties that our community serving, some neighborhood serving I'm sorry. So with that that all my comments of vice mayor.'",

You know, COVID 19 pandemic has really highlighted the importance of our health care workers, particularly our low wage health care workers who've worked alongside our doctors and nurses who have also risked their lives in the process.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Well. And all who've worked to keep our hospital and health care facility going are all our who we have called our heroes during that very difficult period. And a large percentage of those workers have left the health care industry.'",

And so this request to increase the health care minimum wage has come from the people, has come from those who have signed and submitted a petition for the health care workers wage ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so the purpose of this item is to request the impact economic impact report so that we're better able to understand how it impact the city, the industry, the local economy, as well as the workers. How would that also?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So overall, the impact and so before I think I just want to ask a few question about the process around the petition. So I know that there's probably a lot of question, which is the point of this economic impact report.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I just wanted to at least get the basics around how many signatures are needed and, and to qualify for this to be on the November ballot. And how many have been submitted so far?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I think our city clerk is coming back out. So that will be something that she would be in the best position to answer. She's been working directly with the L.A. County to do the actual vote count and can give us some more information.'",

So the petition needs approximately 27,000 signatures, 28,000 signatures, which is 10% of the registered voters in the city of Long Beach for the petition to be successful. And they submitted their petitions and they have approximately 47,000 over 47,000 signatures that need to be verified by the county.'",

I think it's important that we understand the possible impacts, both positive and negative, of broad measures like this one, especially when we're dealing with essential services like health care staffing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I understand that the county is examining the signatures that have been submitted for the petition to be eligible for the November ballot. Thank you for answering the question. 47,000. I think the last I heard we were like a fourth.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They were at 41,000. So 47,000 is a significant number. So thank you for that report. It seems to me so far that the community is is ready to stand up for health care workers. And these workers have put themselves in harm's way for the rest of us.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And they've endangered themselves and their family members as they're taking care of so many people in our community that were being hospitalized. I know from many of my conversations with them, they're often overworked and understaffed and often make barely more than minimum wage for their sacrifices.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They have acted heroically through the last several years. And I know that so many of us are very grateful for all their efforts. So I look forward to hearing back from our staff on the estimated effects of this potential ballot measure.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And I echo the comments of the councilwoman who authored this item and brought it forth in terms of our support of health care workers and obviously all of those in the medical profession during COVID.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think that's definitely something we all agree on. As a council, I love that we're doing this report. I think that's a great idea, and I think that's more information as we move forward with this potential ballot measure.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I'm wondering if the report can also include a couple of other items and. To the city manager who would be who would be conducting the report? Would we be contracting out for that or is that internal?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes, we would certainly be contracting out. We are trying right now to get a sense from our internal contracting or groups that we have already on retainer if they are available and have the ability to do this. This is a very large report that we're asking for them in a very, very short period of time.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So tonight, we'd like to really get your input on the things you'd like to get studied, but it really is going to come down to how much can we physically get done within the 30 to maybe 60 days to have this come back to you by August 9th?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. And so what do we know how much the report is going to cost? Because. We don't have any idea how much it's going to cost.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We don't have a firm number. Right now, we're estimating that it's probably in the hundred thousand dollars range. Could be a little less. Could be a little more. You know, normally it's scope dependent. We already have the rate set through our internal contractors, but it's it's how much work we want them to do and how much capacity'",
        "'speaker_6': 'they have to do it or bring on other people to help them do that work within the compressed time frame. And then we also need to do some legal analysis as well through the city attorney's office to make sure we understand the legal implications, which would be part of this report.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The legal implications on the city.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, we understand just we got a lot of questions. Who does it apply to who? You know, what is the definition of worker? What is the city's role? So all those questions would be answered as well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Got it. So I think some of the questions that I have then might be answered by our own city attorney as opposed to needing to go to outside. So the question I had was what the impact on the city might be, because the measure could potentially place upon the city the requirement for enforcement.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I don't know if that's financial, human resources, probably both. So what would the impact to the city be? And so review should definitely include that so that we're mindful of that because obviously we're going into some difficult years financially and we want to make sure we have an understanding of what additional responsibilities we'd have to take on'",
        "'speaker_4': 'as a city. The second question that I would want included and again, I think again this might go to exactly what you just said to the city manager in terms of who's actually included. I just would be curious what percentage of Long Beach health care workers are excluded versus included when we consider, you know, community clinics, skilled'",
        "'speaker_4': 'nursing facilities, you know, other facilities that might be excluded. It's very technical. So I would like to know, you know, what percentage of Long Beach health care workers, you know, would be included ultimately? And I think that if we can include that in the report and then obviously this is a report that we had budgeted for.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So where do you anticipate the money for this report? What what part is that coming out of?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah, I'll do my best to answer those for the impact on enforcement. It certainly is written in the measure that that the city would enforce. So that means we would have to come up with a staffing model or or contract with somebody like L.A. County to do that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So that would be part of this study is trying to determine the workload. We do imagine that would be, you know, you know, several employees because we're now taking complaints and also investigating them and following up with the legal forces to to make sure that the wage is paid appropriately.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The other question was.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so it was about the report of the $100,000 or so to do this.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So normally when you we get asked for reports like this, we take the report, we come back to you with a report on what it will cost and how long it is and where we think we might find the money or ask you for direction.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This is different because this is something coming directly from from proponents. We are required to put it onto the ballot potentially there you'll see will walk through the options in a little bit. But we need to if you're going to ask for a study, I do need to move forward like right away.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we would essentially make this a priority expense item that would come out of a year end fund balance. Whatever savings there are from salaries, savings or others, this would have kind of first call on those dollars. And we believe they will be there.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They just, you know, it would be money we wouldn't spend on something else.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Well, I fully support doing an economic impact report. I think any time we have a big policy like this, whether it's on the ballot or before the city council, having that economic impact report is a very good idea because it allows us to inform voters.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman, Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. I think that this is been a a great group of people who have come forward. And I've learned a lot in talking with individuals. And I think that some of the discussions that we've had, people have learned a little bit about me and my background, and many people don't know that I worked on the nursing'",
        "'speaker_3': 'pay plan for L.A. County, and I'm really committed to knowing and understanding how we can best support our health care workers. I think it's really important that we talk through who's covered and who's not covered. And I really appreciate that the perspective is to do a study, and I would really find it valuable to ensure that it's'",
        "'speaker_3': 'a broad review of the potential health care costs as well. I know that when we in L.A. County looked at what positions needed to be adjusted back in, gosh. 0508 we really took a hard look at which additional positions needed to be included.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I, I worry that there are some people who are left out that we don't want to leave out. So I would just request that the report include the potential impacts and health care costs related to the variance.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Not all hospitals are included. What does that mean on uninsured? What does it mean on disadvantaged and underserved communities? If you go to one hospital versus another hospital, how are insurance companies impacted? What does that look like for a system of care?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think I would be more supportive of a health care worker living wage where we know that it's broadly applied across all areas. I know that in talking with my colleagues today, we kind of talked even about like, what about a chiropractor?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Are there workers included? What about a dentist? Are there workers included? I mean, they are part of the health care system, but they're not really included in this measure. And so who are we to pick winners and losers?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We want to make sure that if we're lifting up an industry and that industry is all within the context of the purpose that we're we're doing it fairly and equitably across the board. So I would just ask that the economic analysis include a clear explanation of or a clear recommendation, I would say, on who else should be'",
        "'speaker_3': 'included. If we as a council want to come forward and and bring an item to have approval for the for the council to approve instead of having to go to the voters, what does that look like and who else should we include?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I would also ask that we just seriously look at the impact on our uninsured and disadvantaged and underserved communities working for the fire department of L.A. County. Our statistics consistently show that individuals and you'll see in a television show that's coming out in the fall, a lot of our patients don't even want to go to the hospital'",
        "'speaker_3': 'because of the costs. And so if this is only going to be an additional burden on our most disadvantaged communities, I have serious concerns about that because we're already having a huge challenge getting them to take medical care.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so how can we either. Make up for that. How can we make sure that this doesn't impact it negatively? So if Councilman Soros open to it, I don't know if I need to get a friendly or if if I see City Manager Modica taking notes, are we just generally giving some feedback and ideas and the consultant'",
        "'speaker_3': 'will do the work? Or do we need to actually move that into the item?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'He's an American.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So what would you respond to that scope?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I think tonight we can hear some of the general thoughts. I think at the end of the night, it would be helpful to hear from the maker of the motion that the things discussed and generally meet the items that she's putting forward.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If they don't, then I think we would need to go through some parliamentary procedure to accept friendlies. I do want to speak at the end about expectations, about how much we can actually get done. These studies could take months and months and months, and we did our own minimum wage study.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We contracted with the LDC and that process took almost a year to go through all the different economic studies and get all the public input. And this is something we're trying to do in 30 days to maybe 45.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we'll have to set some expectations about what we can do. And a lot of it's going to be the capacity of our consultants to to do that work within that short time frame.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So since it is a short time frame, it sounds like you would pull from a consultant pool that you already have available to you. And are there any consultant pools that have already done studies like this that could be a deeper dove and applicability to Long Beach specifically?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We haven't come across that yet. We've already reached out to our our local pool and we've had a number declined, saying that they don't believe that they could meet the task. So we are going to have to continue to find ways to narrow the scope to give them a little bit more time.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Again, we're just getting into this because we haven't gotten formal direction yet to start. But I was getting the sense that the council is going to want to have some sort of study. So after today, tonight really is going to be important to get the general idea of how much how much public involvement, how much scope the'",
        "'speaker_6': 'general terms. And then we really need to put our nose to the grindstone to find someone who can help us do this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, I appreciate that. I think it's it's really important to also understand the impact on our non-covered entities, because we talk a lot about the shortages in health care right now. I know that many of you know, I've been in and out of Memorial Hospital caring for a family member.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we're borrowing nurses from all over the region. And the hospitals that we're borrowing them from are in a really tough position. And we want to be in a good position in Long Beach, but we also recognize that are part of a bigger system of care.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so I want to make sure that we know the the broader impact on. Private hospitals at a time when they're already struggling and also on the business community and what that looks like for wages of all businesses and how that will change the marketplace.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Councilwoman. Councilman Allen.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mayor. So, Mr. Modoc, I heard you say that this is a large report in a short period of time and it's compressed and, you know, working with your contractor, working with the city attorney's office. So it sounds like even having your contractors say they're not interested this 30 days is 60 days.'",
        "'speaker_3': '90 days. What what are you what are you thinking? That you need to get this done?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we're somewhat constrained by the the election schedule. So by 88 days before the election, the item you'll need to make a decision to move that item to the city or to the county. So really, we're looking at August 9th as the very, very last day, Tuesday before the 12th, that you're going to have time to make'",
        "'speaker_6': 'decisions. So that's what we're shooting for. That's a little less than 60 days, if that helps, that would help a lot if we didn't have a 30 day time frame. But we could use as much as that time as we can.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Gearing up to the August 9th meeting, if we can get it done a week earlier, we'd prefer to do all this a week earlier so that you don't have all that action happening just with two or three days before the deadline.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay, so I'd like to make it friendly for a 60 day.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But not to exceed the the county deadline.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Got it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes, I said.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But thanks. So I'm next. Just a couple of things. I would first just acknowledge that this is, you know, a citizen driven petition process. And there are options, only a few options. And the city council even has once that process has begun.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So. Mr. City Manager, could you just walk us through what you understand is those options?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'To be sure, I can try to summarize and then I can ask the city clerk or city attorney to jump in if I missed something.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sure.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we understand your option. Once you get the the ballot back and knowing that it actually qualified, you have the option to just adopt it as it is. So you can say as a body, we are going to adopt it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You can't make any changes but just adopt it. And that would not go to the voters, but it would become kind of the law in Long Beach. A second option is you can forward that on to the county and put it on the ballot for the voters to decide.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Again, in that scenario, you may not change any of the wording, you may not make any any adjustments. It's just passing it on and the voters vote on it as it is written that signatures were collected. You have the option that we mentioned before to study it, at which point then you have to make some decisions.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I and Monique can probably explain that a little bit better than I can. And then the fourth option is one that is sort of a hybrid. You can pass your own companion measure so you can forward on their measure, but have your own measure that you have voters consider.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Or alternatively, you can propose something at the council as an ordinance, and the the proponent can actually withdraw their item if they believe that that is, you know, in their interest. But it is solely at their discretion. It is not at the city's discretion as Charlie or Mo, if I missed anything there.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'No, I think I think he covered it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The the the council could put on a competing measure, a measure that is similar but different. And then if both items go to the ballot, the one with the most votes would control. Other than that, I think Tom covered it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay, great. Just a just a few questions that we evaluated. How much the election would cost to add this question on the ballot.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Adam Clark.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So each additional ballot measure after the citywide office of mayor is on the ballot is approximately 100 to 150000. So if we were to add another measure, it would be approximately 100, 250,000.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. And in I would just say, particularly after what we just went through, I think, you know, lifting up our health care workers as much as we can is incredibly important. And we also should acknowledge that a significant job driver in our region, in our city, is the health care industry.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we we need to make sure that we listen to and acknowledge that sector that we want it to be healthy. I think I've heard good and bad with the measure, but I think we need to as a council, we absolutely have to study it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think we everything that's come forward, we've always done a study. So thank you, Councilman Ciro, for doing that. I think that's incredibly important. I think we also need to look at what our options are in terms of options for if there is an opportunity to fix some of the issues that were raised and look at option'",
        "'speaker_1': 'four. So I know we can't do that tonight, but that's something that I'm interested in exploring. But thank you so much. And those are my thoughts.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. We're going to go ahead and actually before we show a couple more comments, but without objection, I'm going to turn over for public comment that will come back to Councilwoman Sara. So if there's any public comment and Madam Clerk, please go ahead and go through those.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Will the following speakers people line up at the podium Suzanne Jimenez, Dave Shukla, Adina Tessler and Braden Phillips? Can you please line up at the podium? Suzanne Jimenez, Dave Shukla, Adina Tessler and Braden Phillips.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening, counsel.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'My name is Suzanne Jimenez. I am the.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Proponent of the measure that you guys are speaking about.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And, you know, I really.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Want to thank Councilmember Zero and Councilmember Allen for requesting this impact report. We think it's an important part of this process so that we can show this is desperately needed for our patients, our communities here in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You're going to hear from health care workers today about what they've been through the last two and a half years. And it's just gut wrenching. And so, you know, I think it's important for us to do this this report.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I also want you all to really consider what health care workers have been through. And I appreciate you all. And just for the record, I am a Long Beach resident. Obviously, I'm the proponent and I live in District three.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening. Dave Shukla, Third District. I'd like to speak in support of the motion as well as to ask a couple of specific questions on what the report will do. Hopefully the point of the report or the study is to understand the risks, the costs, the liabilities not only to the city, but to to the workforce or'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to affected parts of the industry. I appreciate the staff the way the item was written, and I'd like to highlight the last sentence of the size of this. Low wage health care workforce exceeds the size of most other occupational groups and includes more people than transportation and warehousing and twice as many grocery workers.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It would be helpful specifically to know if we can get good data on which employment sites, not just what types of workers, but which sites. In Long Beach, as written, the already submitted ballot measure will effect, one hopes that an alternative put forth by the city at cost 100 158 cost won't be just to compete with it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'or to try and confuse voters. Hopefully, a study will include not only the four scenarios laid out by the city manager just express adoption or modification or an alternative ordinance. But also. The cost of not doing some kind of wage increase.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean, West Hollywood as of July 1st is increasing health care sorry. A hotel worker paid $18 an hour, San Francisco City and countywide $17 an hour. Santa monica as of July four, it's also $16 an hour. Health care wages, especially for the groups that were mentioned in the staff report, have not increased city wide.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It would be great to see support for actually raising their wages. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hello.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'My name is Adina Tessler and I'm here on behalf of the Hospital Association of Southern California. We are comprised of over 180 member hospitals and 35 health systems, plus numerous professional associations and associate members, all with the common goal to improve the operating environment for hospitals.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And the health status of.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The communities that we serve. Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you all today on this very important matter. We've also submitted a letter to the city clerk that should be before you. We strongly urge the City Council to conduct an economic analysis prior to acting on the $25 minimum wage ordinance for certain health care workers'",
        "'speaker_3': '. The $25 an hour minimum wage measure would set a standard for certain workers only at private hospitals, hospital owned facilities and dialysis clinics, but completely excludes workers who do the exact same jobs at public hospitals, community clinics and health care facilities, including all of the University of California and county hospitals, federal qualified health centers, and Planned Parenthood'",
        "'speaker_3': '. In fact, the majority of health care workers throughout the city of Long Beach are excluded by this measure. We all agree health care workers are heroes. But this measure measure is not a way to show our gratitude because it is deeply flawed.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Inequitable.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And will ultimately hurt the health care workforce. It will create deep divides. There are.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Many unintended.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Consequences of the proposal, and it is vital that we understand the potential impact for the city workers, health care providers and communities. For instance, understanding which health care workers would benefit and which are excluded is central to understanding the measure.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'For example, at the facilities being targeted only non-clinical, workers are actually going to get a benefit. We're talking about very important members of the hospital community, like food service workers, security receptionists, not clinical workers. It also applies unequally to different types of providers.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The city should understand which health care providers are required to meet the new provisions and which are not, and what the fiscal impact and staffing impact will be on both covered and non-covered facilities. This analysis should include a broader.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Review of the potential impact on health.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Care costs and access to health care in the city of Long Beach, including the impact on uninsured, disadvantaged and underserved communities. The measure requires the city to enforce its new requirements. A comprehensive analysis should be done to determine the feasibility and cost to the city for enforcement and implementation.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'For these reasons, we encourage the City Council to require an economic study prior to acting on this measure. Thank you for your time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'After Braden Phelps, if we could have Alex Mercado, Kate Gutierrez, Jessica Hondo and Gregory Shorter, thank you.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'life, truly are heroes worthy of our unending gratitude and continued recognition. Unfortunately, the proposed measure to increase the minimum wage of private health care workers is not the way to go. It is deeply flawed, inequitable and would ultimately hurt access to care, especially for the disadvantaged communities.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The measure picks winners and losers losers among the essential workers, even among health care workers. This initiative specifically targets only private hospitals and dialysis centers in ten California cities. At the same time, it excludes similar workers at public hospitals, community clinics, federal qualified health centers, Planned Parenthood clinics, nursing homes, medical centers, and many other health care facilities'",
        "'speaker_2': 'which represent the vast majority of health care workers. These arbitrary omissions are inequitable. Furthermore, this ballot measure does not does nothing for those essential workers in our city, including those who work for the city of Long Beach in every customer serving department.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'While I think this proposal is not in the best interest of our hospitals or community, I applaud the City Council recommendation to conduct an economic analysis to better understand the negative and inflationary impact it will have on our health care.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Our city and its workers. Singling out private health care workers could have a profoundly negative impact on meeting the employment needs for similar employees throughout our local economy. I also urge the City Council to include in the proposed economic analysis the impact of the wage increase on private and public hospitals and health care facilities in our city'",

        "'speaker_2': 'While our employees are sorry. While our employers are making record profits, I have seen coworkers leave from other jobs and many others are considering the same. That leaves us understaffed and overworked. This measure would actually help many health care workers be able to afford homes, be able to pay their rent, be able to pay for gas, be'",
        "'speaker_2': 'able to actually support their families. This measure is important to me because even as someone who is working in health care, the cost of living is so high, just paying for food, like I said, and rent is a struggle for so many workers, people like me.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'My daughter is also a health care worker and it is hard to see her struggle to afford an apartment, let alone a car and all the other things she needs. It's been horrible being a health care worker lately that are call that call that we are so-called heroes while we are working in hazardous condition and risking infection'",
        "'speaker_2': 'from COVID. At the very least, we should be paid fair wages. This minimum wage increase will help a lot of people to survive in this time of this pandemic and this crisis. I urge you to support the healthcare workers, the minimum wage, to retain and recognize outstanding health care workers in this beautiful city of Long Beach.'",

I just got a couple of just brief comments, a question, and then I'm back to the council. First, I do want to thank everyone that spoke on this issue, particularly, of course, the health care workers.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think there's no one in this room that doesn't admire or uplift the work that our health care system, our workers have done, particularly in these last two years. And it's been incredible and heroic to see what folks have gone through and what they've done for our community and getting us past the the most difficult moments of'",
        "'speaker_7': 'this pandemic and are still working every single day to keep people healthy and safe. So a huge thank you to our workers. Also, one thing that's that's I think we're proud of in our community and our city is of our health care system.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We have an incredible hospital system. We have an incredible group of nurses and doctors and technicians and health care workers that make up. I try to remember, but Mr. Murdoch, I think it's the second or third largest industry as it relates to jobs in the city of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so when you talk about any time you talk about health care in our community, you're actually talking about not just a sector of our economy and of workers. You're talking about a sector that impacts our city greatly from economic development to jobs to workforce training.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so the discussions around health care are are really important to our community and certainly have impacts in many ways across not just here, but across the region. And I think those numbers are probably correct, Mr. Murdoch. I think from if I remember from the last economic report.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Sounds about right.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And and so I want to thank everyone. I also just want to I just want to note, of course, as a as a son of a health care worker, I know. And I just wanted to to the particular healthcare workers that spoke.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I just want to just thank you personally. I hear a lot of of some of the struggles my own mother went through and my own family members have gone through. And I just thank you for your courage in speaking at any time a community.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And this has happened multiple times here at this body. But any time a community or a collection of workers organization is able to collect and bring forward the amount of signatures to put a petition in front of the people of the city is an important discussion that this council should have.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I do commend and thank all the members of the Council, including members of the public on all sides of the issue that want to see and want to encourage a study and to ensure that we're getting all the information that is necessary to make good decisions based on the facts in front of us.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I also just want to remind the public that Mr. Modica did lay out some of the options, but at the at the end of the day, if signatures are collected and a ballot measure qualifies, if it is placed on the ballot is up to the people of Long Beach to make those those decisions.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There are, of course, other options which I'm sure we will discuss as a body. But those are those are things that are important to to highlight in this process. With that, I had a question. I know there were a couple of comments about and I don't know, honestly, all the details of what's been submitted yet.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'm sure we'll all learn in the weeks ahead. Mr. Marquette, I know that there was some discussion about private versus public hospitals in Long Beach. We don't have do we have public hospitals in Long Beach? I don't think.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Besides besides, we're.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm not recalling any besides the VA.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. And so. But maybe I can get them more information. I think when the discussion about private and public at around the region. There are there are similar efforts in other cities or other communities where there, of course, are additional public hospitals or the county system in other systems.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I think there'll be what are called the federally qualified health centers, which actually are more like public institutions. So those are will be ones that we would need to study of. We know which ones are they? Are they covered?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Are they not covered in private versus public? So that's what we would look at in the state.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And that's the information that the some of the information that you would bring back to the council as far as what exactly what's covered or not covered?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes, I think we would get a legal definition from read the measure through our legal team of who is covered and who is not. And then we can start looking at what are those businesses and language, the ones that would be covered, the ones that would be not, and try to get some basic economic information from them'",
        "'speaker_6': 'to to get some magnitude of of who is covered, who is not, and what the impacts would be.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Right. Well, thank I appreciate that. Well, thank you. I do want to think, of course, councilman sorry. And Councilman Allen, for for bringing this forward for us to take a look at this. It's absolutely the right the right step for and I'm grateful the council for also weighing in on this process.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So let me turn this over to Councilwoman Sara. I think the city manager is also looking for some for some direction to ensure that the study is done as presented. Mr. Monica, do you want to make some comments first?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Would you want Councilman Sara to first make a comments?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'What I'd like to hear from Councilman Bizzaro, and then I can make some comments at the end. Just I'd like to help set expectations of what we can do and can't do and get some direction from council.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Great, Councilman.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mayor. I just want to thank everyone for their comment, my colleague, as well as the public comments made. I just wanted to share that, you know, if we had more time, as Tom has shared, our city manager shared, I would love to have been able to include not only private, but the nonprofit, all of the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'health care workers possible. But because we only have such a short window, I decided to at least narrow the scope in order to be able to get something in return for us to be able to make a decision when it comes before us in August.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So rather US have had something that could be narrowed, but obviously I think we're going to do our best to include others. That is my initial desire, but I just wanted to clarify that it had to be narrow based on the timeline that we had and locating somebody that could do this in such a short period of'",
        "'speaker_4': 'time. So I, I also agree with our city manager that we would love to be able to include so many information to be able to inform voters as well as our council members. But I know that we're going to get as much info as we can to make a decision by by August.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I just want to thank everyone.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'For their.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Feedback and their comments.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Councilman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I just want to request I appreciate the councilman's urgency, and I think it's really important that we come back quickly because we do need information to do the analysis. But are you stating that you're excluding, including the broader impact on the business community and wages for all businesses that are in the competitive hiring market?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Or are you open to that being included in the narrow scope that you have?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, I think that there are different levels of impact to be considered. I think for the purpose of how we will have to make our decision, I like to be able to make sure that we prioritize it. So, of course, I'd love to see how this would impact our local economy, how it impact our, you know, our'",
        "'speaker_4': 'business community. But I just want to make sure that we're able to get the crucial information that's needed for us to make a decision as a council body.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So does that mean that if it's possible to get it within the timeline and the vendor is able to do that, Mr. Modica would be given that direction.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes. If there's time to include all of that within 30 to 60 days, if we're able to find somebody that can do it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I appreciate that because the loss of talent and the recruitment and retention issues that could become a part of this, which we're seeing in the market now with the shortage of workers, is is critical, especially on the health care side.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We need to be able to provide health care in all different ways. And so I just want to, again, coming from a place of wanting to broaden the measure and recognizing that we can't really change the wording, as Mr. Modica said of their measure, unless we were to put up a different measure and then they were to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'withdraw their measure. I think that that could at least help us to understand and potentially broaden the measure appropriately. So I appreciate you including those two things for me.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. Councilman. Anything additional before I turn to Mr. Modica?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes, I just wanted to clarify that as much as I do hear Councilmember Mongo wanting to broaden the measure, that is not up to us as a council body as far as why it is at least laid out in the petition.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I was focusing the economic report in order for us to be able to make a decision around the measure that is before us. And I have you know, I agree with all the council members that we as well as others, that we'd like as much information as possible to make our most informed decision.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But again, it's back to the timeline that we have. I just wanted to share earlier, the city manager share took a year to be able to get an economic analysis of their minimum wage. We have 30 to 60 days, if not less than 60 days to get a report back.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I just want to make sure we're being realistic. So I'd like to hear from the city manager what's a realistic scope of work we can get done?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'All right. Thank you, Councilmember. So I did go back and had a chance to look a little bit about what we did back on minimum wage back in 2015, 2016, which I think will be helpful. So my memory said it was around a year.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It was it probably felt like a year, but it was a little more compressed than that. So I, I want to let you know the timeline. So this was a process that the city started. So we had a different process.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This is now being brought to us by an outside group. So we're reacting to their proposal. When the city did this process, it was proposed in about July or August of 2015. We got direction in August of 2015 to do the study.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We hired the L.A. EDC, who is already doing studies like this for other agencies. So they were already kind of the main contractor and had a scope of work that took about four months. So we got the report back.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Having them already had done this for other cities in about four months. Then we did about two and a half months of really solid community outreach and getting lots and lots of input through the Economic Development Commission. So they held multiple, multiple meetings, hours and hours in order to get that to craft recommendations that came back to'",
        "'speaker_6': 'the council in in January. So that process, the total was about six months. So obviously that is a different process. That's one that we were in control of and we created. So what I think what we can do, because we do have that that slightly less than 60 days in total, you will need to make decisions by'",
        "'speaker_6': 'August 9th at the very, very latest. So within that time, we will need to create a scope very quickly and start the work and identify the group will be looking to our internal bench that we already have qualified to do that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If at all possible. We will include a legal analysis and spend some of the dollars to get an outside firm to come in and help us really do that. Legal analysis. I do believe the questions we heard your night are the general economic data.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You know, what is a wage like that, you know, due to the worker? What does a wage like that due to the business to try to get some general sense. And we would be following the metrics that we outlined in the L.A. EDC report, which I think was kind of considered by both sides, as has information that'",
        "'speaker_6': 'was helpful. We will do an analysis of industries covered and facilities covered and not covered so we can get a sense of of who would be in and who would be out, as well as if we have the ability and the time to do some economic data on those.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We would do a study of the cities enforcement model because there is a provision in the in the in the item saying that the city would enforce it and give you some ranges there. I do think public input is is an important part of your item.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We will likely, just given the timeframe, probably have the time to do one input meeting with the Economic Development Commission to have input all there that will gather. And then we'll need to schedule one for them to actually make recommendations, which, you know, maybe right before the council hears it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So in a typical system, we are giving like, you know, two weeks notice between those. In this case, it might be one or two days between some of these steps in order to stay on schedule. We then I do recommend that we keep it at $100,000 or less, because that is the extent of the city manager's purchasing'",
        "'speaker_6': 'authority. Anything above that, we're going to have to spend a couple of weeks to get it to council, and that's time that we will lose. So that is kind of my summary. I'll turn it to Charlie if I missed anything that he would want to add.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'No, I think he covered it. We would be doing a help.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'On the legal analysis to help define who's in the legal provisions of the of the measure so that we can help the city manager under defining the scope of the of the economics.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And the one thing I do want to add is like the L.A. EDC report, that was not a report that really provided recommendations. That was one that provided facts. And then it was the Economic Development Commission that kind of took it and provided some of their input that would then come to the council.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we would follow that model as well.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. I do have a couple more council members. Council. Councilman Supernova.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. I do have a couple of questions because as this discussion started, we weren't in the friendly amendment mode. And I would just like clarification on whether Councilwoman Price's ideas or requests are incorporated in this. Also, I'd just like to make a comment on the concept of limiting the study.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We're paying 100 grand for a study and we don't know what the impacts are going to be. That's why we're paying so much for it. For example, we don't know if this wage increase would impact home health care workers.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'For example, we don't know if they will be taking from that industry into, you know, an area where they will get a higher wage. I'm not speculating that. I'm just saying we have no clue what the impacts will be.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So any type of limitation from this body as to the study, that doesn't work for me. So I don't know if that's where we are, but that would be my my friendly to say, look, let's not limit the study in scope because we don't know the territory we're getting into.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So to respond to that, councilmember. Yes. The items that Mrs. Price put out there are I had those down as what is the impact on city enforcement? Who does it cover? What are the workforces? Who's included and not?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And the cost of the study. So all of that would would be included to the question of who would be included or not. I do believe we'll get a good answer from our legal analysis of who is included.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'What I think might be harder is the level of sufficient detail on the exact economic impact of all the different subpopulations, you know, so we will get try to cover all sectors at the same level. But the deeper we go, the more, you know, granular information you need, the longer the study actually takes.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think, Councilman. Vice Mayor Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. So I think what I'm hearing is you can include the feedback that you got from the council. You have limited time, less than two months, and you're going to go as far as you can with whoever is going to take on this job, because so far everyone's said no.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think it's I think we should be clear, this is very, very different than when we proposed minimum wage increase at city council. It's about the path to $15. We had months to go when it's a ballot initiative.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have a very limited amount of time because we have to meet certain deadlines to place it on the on the ballot. So I think it's fair to understand that you're going to give it like Pat Wetzel, say, the good old college try.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You're going to give it the college try. You're going to include everything if you heard up here. You're going to do the legal analysis. You're going to do the analysis on who you know, who does include what is the fiscal analysis, who, you know, the impact of the city, all of those things you would include?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I would I would just say we have actually had a minimum wage measure in in Long Beach in recent history. Measure in now, I believe the city council did a did an economic study on measure and before it went to the ballot.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that just took a short period of time. Did I am I right? I think I seem to remember there was an economic study. The council did.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I don't remember, but I believe it was when we had measure in and.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Oh, right. I think that's more similar to this than the larger $15 minimum wage because that was targeted to one group as opposed to, you know, the entire workforce. And whatever approach we took then because we were able to get a report, I would imagine we would take that that same approach.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's a great idea. I did not I can't recall one way or the other what we did on that one. So we will certainly look that up as an idea.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. So just just clarifying, it sounds like what most folks have asked for up here. You're going to give it the you're going to try to include that in the scope of it. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilmember, if I could, I think the scope this evening is going to be a little bit broader because if I recall correctly, the measure in study was asked for out of the election code option that the council has when it comes before you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And in the vote there were you had a shorter periods, you had a shorter period of time and you had a more.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Of a limited scope because.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Of that code section. Tonight's item is not limited by that, so it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Will be a little bit broader than.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That. But it's a good point.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. I just want to clarify. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Councilman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. I want to appreciate Councilmember Supernova's comment. $100,000 is a lot of money. I don't know what it takes to ensure that all of our questions are answered because it is a very serious question and we are spending this amount of money.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We want to make sure to get everything that we need. Is there a way to make an amendment on the floor tonight to give you the discretion that's necessary to make sure that all of our questions are answered, and if a little bit more money needed to be spent because whether it's 100, 110 and obviously everyone who'",
        "'speaker_3': 'wants to potentially bid on this contract is then. Seeing this meeting tonight and knowing what's available to bid. So it's a it's a very uncomfortable potential situation for that. Thoughts, Mr. Manager.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Anything over 100 and 100,000 is going to be is going to just take time to get to your will. We could make that as fast as possible, but you're going to have to declare, you know, a sole source.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You're going to have to get that on an item.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Couldn't even do it tonight if we want to do.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah. And I think we're going to our our consultants who had already bid on fixed prices. So it's really just more of time and materials, how long it takes them to do that rather than, you know, and then putting in a competitor like just adding in profit, that type of thing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I would just say that if it's necessary and I would obviously yield to Council Member zero if it needs to be broken into two pieces and sourced out at lower amounts to each of them that get put together at the end because you have to use two different vendors or whatever.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's not allowed either. Okay, good to know. Thank you. I see the I see the head shakes over there just trying to come up with solutions, less barriers.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Councilman Price.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So just for the record, I think spending $100,000 on an economic impact report is a significant amount of money. I think it's important that we're doing the report. I want to do the report, but we have so many competing interests right now at the city.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm just thinking about the hundreds of projects that residents bring to our attention with potholes and street paving and sidewalk repairs. And I mean, we're having to say no to people for $5,000 as Ali repair. So I'm not in favor of spending more than $100,000 on on this economic impact report.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I'm hoping we can get it done for $100,000, which I believe is already way significant. But if it goes beyond that, I would like it to come to council for approval, because we we just this is we're not just talking about the economic impact report.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We're also talking about the analysis of what our future costs and commitments will be if the measure passes and couple all of that up. That's a significant amount of money. And I just think we need to be very mindful of that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes. And what it would have to come to council so it would not be more than 100,000. And if again, if we can do it less, we would. The the study with L.A. EDC was about 65,000 and that was in 2015.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we're we're using that as a as a benchmark. It may be a slightly less complicated study. If we can do it for less, we would do it for less.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you very much. I think that concludes council comments. There is a motion and a second. We did public comment already. I think, Mr. Murdoch, I think you're aware of where this landed as far as the requests. Mr. Murdoch, any of the final questions?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Are we ready to vote?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'No. Thank you. That's very helpful.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. Members, please cast your votes on the motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Motion is carried out through.'"

        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening, Mr. Mayor. Members of the Council, thank you for this opportunity to make a presentation tonight. As you are aware, about two years ago, the City Council approved an Open Streets initiative that allowed for the installation of temporary parklets to assist certain businesses such as restaurants in continuing their operations.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'While indoor dining was restricted at the time. Indoor dining was then brought back, but in a limited capacity. The council extended the life of the temporary program and it is currently scheduled to sunset at the end of this month in June.'",

As Deckard mentioned, the original intent, as you may recall, was to install Parklets temporary parklets in response to COVID 19 to help businesses to support businesses in their efforts.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It was a citywide effort to support the economic recovery for businesses and health order and physical distancing requirements. The first temporary parklets were installed in May of 2020 at the program's peak. There were 112 temporary parklet locations citywide.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'There were 124 participating businesses. What that means is that in some cases, businesses shared parklets. There were 176 outdoor activity permits or EPS, as we refer to them, and there were ten sidewalk dining permits. Currently, there are 80 temporary parklet locations.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Citywide 91 participating businesses. Again, some timesharing parklets 12 parklets have been removed since January of 22 alone. There are currently 27 outdoor activity permits and there are nine sidewalk dining permits. That's where we stand currently. The picture there you can see one of our PSB members refilling the parklets the corrals with water.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Currently we're going to we're going to look at the number of temporary parklets. Per council district. You can see at the height of the program there were 112 on the far left column there, again helping 124 businesses. We have since removed 32 parklets overall.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Currently we have 80 assisting 91 businesses again and you can kind of see the breakdown for each council district. CD1 has 17, currently CD2 23, CD3 34, etc. on down the list. I'll leave that for a couple of seconds there.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Now regarding BP's broken down again by district. Originally, there were 176, and now we have a total of only 27. Once again, CD one for CD two has one, T three has 11, etc. on down the list. Currently there are 27.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The one in the picture there is the Reno Room 3400 block of East Broadway, and you can see how it is installed really in the parking area. It's not in the public area. The plan is right now that the ops will sunset on June 30th of this year, regardless of the outcome of the temporary parklet discussion that'",
        "'speaker_8': 'we're having this evening. Now because Belmont Shore has so many temporary Parklets I wanted to take a minute to kind of focus on what's going on there. And the really the focus is on Second Street between Livingston and Bayshore.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Currently, there are 23 temporary parklet locations helping 28 participating businesses. Ten temporary parklets have been removed to date. And regarding parking in that entire stretch of roadway, there are 517 parking stalls available, 351 are on street, 166 are on the public lots nearby on the adjacent streets.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And right now, we have 52 parking stalls that have been converted to temporary parklets. Basically, that boils down to approximately 10% of the parking is now dedicated to temporary parklets. 6% on Second Street and 4% on the side streets.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Now when we talk about temporary park, that's from engineering point of view. We do have many elements that we have to consider. And really, a lot of this has to do with safety. First of all, we have to have an object marker on the corner.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'There you see that white and black sign. It's sort of like an arrow that helps keep drivers away from the park. But we want to make sure we have a 12 foot travel way on the outside of the park, that minimum for a driver about driving vehicular lane.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'There are many structural elements within the Parklet that have to be strong enough to absorb impact from a vehicle. That's why we have the water filled corrals within the parklets. There are many concerns regarding the stormwater drainage, safe pedestrian passage.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Utility conflicts. We are really concerned about putting parklets on top of gas lines, waterlines, electrical vaults, sewer manholes, just to name a few. And we are concerned about parking impacts and accessibility. And I wanted to point out that existing temporary parklets cannot convert automatically to a permanent status.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Now maintaining the integrity of temporary Parklets we've been dealing with this now for about 25 months. The staff and transportation and mobility, we try to address every situation on a case by case basis. There is no one size fix for any of these parklets.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We remove Parklets by request of business owners when they decide that, you know, they don't want to to to have it out in front of their business anymore. We're constantly having to reduce or adjust the part that footprints.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'What we've found is that businesses are slowly but surely trying to slowly expand their parklet space. So we're trying constantly to adjust that. We need to reaffirm that consent from businesses neighboring a temporary parklet because of frontage overlap.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'What that means is, is that parklets are meant to be installed in the front and the frontage of that the business that has the permit. And in many cases it can expand in front of the nearby business only with the approval from that nearby business.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And we've been working hard to maintain maintain insurance compliance, and we also do many inspections. City staff, we go out regularly to inspect what's going on with the parklets. Now, we've had a lot of outreach regarding the PARKLET program.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We have had virtual meetings, public and business surveys. We've coordinated regularly with the council districts. We do field inspections and business visits, as I mentioned. We receive emails, phone calls, daily. People concerned are asking questions. And we regularly, you know, recommend that residents go to certain websites if they have a complaint to go to L.B..'",
        "'speaker_8': 'L.B. must I'm sorry, go active. Long Beach. There's a survey there on the upper right side of the slide there. You can't quite see it. But that's a that's a checklist that we have and I'm sorry, not a survey, a checklist where when we go out, we want to make sure we're checking the drainage, the signage, whether'",
        "'speaker_8': 'we have accessibility, which is the platform firm. Are there structural elements in place? That's the example of the the checklist that we have. And then there's a small card there that we use to advertise the survey that we did last year in November.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That was for folks in CD3. And we'll get to some of those results in a second here on Belmont Shore. Here are some of the results. We have 584 total responses from CD3. These were responses from businesses, residents, customers.'",
        "'speaker_8': '12 of the responses were from business owners themselves. Of those 584 comments, 38% supported the program 11 support, but with some sort of restriction. 12% were concerned about parking. 6% traffic sight line. 14 Congestion and parking. 9% were concerned about accessibility and esthetic concerns.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Again, on the right there, there's some of the redundant list there of what the concerns were parking impacts, sidewalk access, esthetics, sightlines noise, quality of life issues. So we did get some positive feedback from the surveys. Many value the outdoor dining option that was available, and many people thought that, you know, the parklets improve the walkability of'",
        "'speaker_8': 'the area or made it feel more friendly, pedestrian friendly. There was an enhanced experience or character of Belmont Shore that was felt as well. Those were some of the results that we got and there was a website for part of the results.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Now when we talk about permanent parklets again, I want to stress existing temporary parklets are not approved or designed to be permanent. Temporary parklets are managed and permitted separately from the Permanent Parklet program, which predates COVID 19. We do have a sidewalk dining and Parklet handbook that was finalized in 2018.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Permanent Parklet permits have been available through the city's existing Sidewalk Dining and Parks handbook. Permanent. I'm sorry. Permit requires design and construction of new new structures that meet permit requirements. And there can be local coastal zone requirements that apply as well.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The current status of permanent parklet applications right now, only for businesses with a temporary parklet have established a permanent parklet through the formal process and guidelines that I showed to earn CD1 one in CD two and one in CD five.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'There are four businesses that have applied for a permanent parklet permit that are currently in the review process three in CD, one and one in CD. 730 Businesses have expressed only interest in the formal establishment of a permanent Parklet seven in CD two and 23 in CD3.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And what this means is that they've come down and they've talked to our permit technicians, or they've made a phone call or sent in an email just asking for information they have not done or started any of the formal process, only expressed interest.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'No permanent parklets will not be allowed for the following reasons. There are some cases where we have temporary parklets with businesses, and right now they're not complying with the rules of the game right now. So if they're not complying with the safety requirements, insurance requirements or the refill of the crowd requirements, we want to discourage them from'",
        "'speaker_8': 'applying for a permanent parklet if they're not going to follow the rules. If a if an applicant has a business condition that has safety concerns or documented issues that have been determined by the city traffic engineer to be detrimental to the quality of life of nearby businesses and or residents.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That's going to be an issue as well. Number three, all businesses located in the coastal zone will be required to obtain a local Coastal Commission approval. This is an internal city process. The picture there is a shot from Fourth Street.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Now when we talk about permanent parklets, this is a really good example of a permanent parklet. On fourth, it is on the main street, not on a side street, and there's a good drawing there that comes out of the guidelines.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Again, it kind of explains a general idea of what a permanent parklet should look like on a main street. Next, an idea for a permanent parklet on a side street again. There is a drawing for this in the permanent parklet guidelines.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And this location is at the Socialist on fourth where they actually have the permanent parklet or a permanent design on the side street. Now the Open Streets Initiative, we do have recommendations. The first option is that current Open Streets Initiative and temporary parklet program sunsets June 30th, 2022.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The second option is a current Open Streets initiative and temporary parklet program Sunsets on June 30th, 2022, with the exception that any business that has applied for a permanent parklet by August 1st shall be allowed to continue utilizing their temporary parklet until September 30th of 22.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Now, if we decided to go with option number two, we do have a couple of conditions. First, a business must formally apply for a permanent parklet permit per the existing city permanent PARKLET Program no later than August 1st, 2022.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Now, when a business comes in, they will be notified at the time of the application that the proposed permanent parklet may not be feasible because of safety or quality of life concerns. We don't want businesses going through the trouble of getting their plans, talking to engineers, etc., paying the fees when really we're not going to allow that'",
        "'speaker_8': 'part of it to happen anyway. For those reasons stated, if the application is accepted, the business must adhere to all temporary parklet permit conditions as the formal approval of the permanent parklet is determined. This includes review of criminal activity and neighborhood quality of life concerns.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Third, the business must comply with all safety insurance and creel refill requirements that is of their temporary parklets. Parks will be removed starting June 30th 22 if businesses fail to comply. Lastly, temporary parking that's allowed on minor side streets after June 30th, 2022.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Only after a case by case review by the city traffic engineer. So that is the extent of the presentation will be welcome to answer any questions you might have.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you very much, Mayor, and members of the Council. So we're available to answer questions. I do want to point out that was a lot of information. We focused a lot on Parklets. We're also looking for direction tonight on the apps.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Right now, the council direction is that those end on June 30th. If you want to take any other action on that, we want to hear that. And again, all these dates can be discussed. The August 1st date was really designed to be people who are going to do a permanent parklet.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We would then work with them and they'd be able to stay open a little bit longer. But the ones that are either not technically feasible or not, we would basically let them know quickly and then those parklets would need to go away.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They would not get an extension through September 30th. So with that, we are available to answer questions and get direction from the council.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Good Councilwoman that change, Councilman Price.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you very much. I know there are a lot of members of the public here who have comments, and I want to hear from all of those. But before we start, I want to just ask a couple of questions so that we all have the same framework that might help inform some public comment.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'First of all, can you a mr. Heckman, can you put slide number 14 back up? Because I'm going to have a couple of questions about that and why you're doing that. Mr. Heckman, during your presentation, one of the first comments you made was The Peace Will Sunset, regardless of what we do tonight.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But then I heard the city manager say he's looking for some direction on apes. Can I get a little bit of clarification on that?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I'll clarify. So regardless of what you do, if you do nothing tonight, the parklets technically go away on June 30th, as do the OLP. So that was the decision this council made back in December is to only provide a certain amount of extension to to really work to remove other parklets and have this all end June'",
        "'speaker_6': '30th because of the item that we got last night last month. We're here tonight to give you a presentation. So I'm just reminding everybody that I think there's been a lot of focus on the parklets and everyone knows about those.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think a lot of businesses have not been paying attention that their app goes away in two weeks. So if that's the will, the council will implement that if if there is a desire to have that part be extended.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I really would like direction tonight so that we don't have miscommunication with businesses.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. So I'll probably address OJP specifically after I hear from everyone because I want to hear the comments, but I know I have some recommendations on apps. The second thing I wanted to ask about is looking at. Well, let me let me back up here.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'When we implemented the Open Streets Initiative. We did not, in my opinion, communicate. To the residents, the process that would be required for them to lodge concerns about a particular parklet operation to petition its removal or modification. And there is a process.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I've learned through talking with the city attorney that there is a process involved. And I'm wondering if someone from the city attorney's office can talk a little bit about is is there a process? What is that process?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I know personally that we're involved in some of those discussions, but I don't know that we've readily shared the process. And if if staff will remember the last time this item came to council, I specifically asked as part of the extension that there be a process outlined that residents could have an opportunity to lodge objections to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'a particular operation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So to answer your question, the Council on Women Prices we had during the pandemic, we had the venue task force and so that venue task force to go out and seek enforcement of the emergency health order. In addition, they would go out and monitor some of the parklets that were out when they're out and visiting businesses.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so as part of that task force, we would receive complaints. And as a result of those complaints, we would contact businesses that had parklets. If there was an issue, we would communicate with the business owners. Some of them were cited in the past and usually the citations would handle whatever activity was occurring or whatever the problem'",
        "'speaker_2': 'was in relation to the PARKLET as far as removal of the PARKLET. There's only been one that's been removed and that was involving restoration and that involved violations related to the health order. And we did removed out, but we noticed the business of the decision to remove the parklet.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They were provided with 72 hours notice that it would be removed and they were also provided with an opportunity to have an administrative hearing. If they were if they wanted to appeal that decision to remove it, which they did.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we had the appeal and the appeal was denied in the park that was removed. So that's kind of the process that we had. If there's something else or would you have another question specific to any other area?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I can't answer that as well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, I will, but I'll have to save it to later. So I don't want to run out of time. But in looking at option number two on slide number 14. So first of all, our permanent parklet application process is lengthy.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And one of the things that I talked to the city manager about is if we're going to meaningfully allow people to apply for permanent parklets, we need that and give them this timeline of August 1st. We need that turnaround to be faster.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And if we only have a select architects that they can choose from, they can't pick their own architect and they have to go through the city process and wait for city staff to be able to review things. And how can we ensure that we're able to meet these timelines?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think that's a legitimate question, Councilwoman. And, you know, it will take time for businesses to contact an engineer or a architect to design these permanent structures. You know, we will be telling businesses right upfront if they're not going to be eligible for this program at all because of safety reasons.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But, yes, you are correct that they will have to quickly, you know, figure out what they want to do, make contact. And we're going to have to expedite our review of these permanent parklet permits as they come in with the designs to make those turnarounds and formal approvals happen.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'If you need to change the dates again, we're looking for council's direction. If we need to give them more time.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I will point out that none of this is really new. They business is really new. Back in December of 2021 that this was going away in June of 30 of 2022. So council was pretty specific that that was the time.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The reason that we're just doing this now is if somebody is almost done and they've done their work and all they need to do is submit it. You know, that's kind of what we're looking for. We don't think someone who has who has waited all this time and is just today starting is going to qualify.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And that is kind of a business decision that they had to make.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. I'm going to my time is up, so I'm going to queue back up. Before we go to public comments, there's a couple other foundational questions I want to ask Councilman Allen.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. It's okay, Mira. I'd like to wait until I hear from the public before my comments.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Councilman. Sorry. Did you want to go now? First the public.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes. I just have a really quick question because I'm trying to understand option two does. What about I mean, I don't think opioids are going to be able to apply for anything permanent. So would they have a different option to be able to extend out a few more months out?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Because I do have one in my district.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes. So Opie's right now in the staff recommendation, it's it is that they would end June 30th. We would be looking for a motion from you to help provide us just with a time of how long you would want piece to be extended to.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And who would it cover? Would it be the ones that are on private property? Would it be the ones that are on public property? Is it none of them. And we can help. You know, the one that you're talking about, for example, Councilmember is on would be on private property.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So. And those are going to be very hard to apply for permanently because you'd have to change the underlying zoning in order to apply for that where a parklet there is an established process picking a park, but there really is not an established process to to do what many of them are doing currently.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Could I didn't do a motion to extend the lapse to September 30th of 2022. They're on private property just so that they have some time. If they have stuff on there too, knowing that it they can't make it permanent.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That could be a motion. And then we would want to get some input on public versus private as well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I would accept that as a friendly. Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And that was for all EPS or public or private.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, I think that her motion was for the the privates. I would be okay extending it for public. But I want to hear from the public. There is one particular PE in the third district that needs to be modified because it is.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Abutting a neighboring business and needs that the footprint needs to be modified. But if they want to apply for permanent OHIP. Is that even an option now? Oh, no. So there's no option for permanent OHIP. At all.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's correct. There's no option currently for dedication of a permanent o.p.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You'd have to change zoning.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There's a lot of different changes you would have to change.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Well, that's a good clarification question. Okay. So for this so going. Oh, I'm sorry, Councilwoman Sarah, it's still your. Oh, yeah. No, I'm done. That was it. I just wanted to offer that motion. Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Back to you, Councilwoman.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Okay, so. So regarding this process being streamlined, streamlined. So we have commitment from city staff that you will expedite your process if there are applications.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That is correct.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Looking here, you mentioned this language of they will be notified that they it may not be feasible because of safety or quality of life concerns. At what point will they. It's one thing to say to someone it may not be feasible.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Go through the application process anyway and keep your parklet open. It's another to say we have determined, based on what we already know, this location is not feasible. Therefore you need to shut the parklet down now. What? What is the answer?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'There will be cases where we know a certain parklet is maybe not being a good neighbor where they may be impacting the quality of life of the nearby residents. And in those cases, there is wording in a let me get the right number here in the municipal code that gives the city traffic engineer and the city engineer'",
        "'speaker_8': 'a little bit of authority to basically shut that parklet down or not allow a permanent parklet. So some of that authority is there. You know, it doesn't have to be a safety item. It doesn't have to be something that is that is quantitative.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It can be just where we have lots of complaints, where the complaints are documented, where we know there are problems. Again, these are quality of life issues that definitely impact the safety of the area.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And if I'm hearing you correctly, Councilmember, I think you want us to be a little more definitive and not, you know, maybe this, maybe that. So. I totally agree with that. I think we just need to make a decision.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We've got two years of data here. And I think if it's that one is lots of complaints is not going to be feasible. We need to just give them the answer that it is not feasible. There may be somewhere with a one foot change in your boundary you could become feasible.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think that is in a different category.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And if I may. Councilmember Price. Yes. Is Aaron with the city attorney's office. We are in a unique scenario here because we've had temporary parklets operating for almost for over two years where we have a parklet, a permanent parklet program that exists exists under our municipal code.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so specifically, what our traffic engineer is referring to is there's a section in 14.1 5.0 30b that specifically gives the opportunity and requires that to the satisfaction of the director of public works.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Before a.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Permit, a permanent parklet permit can be issued. There has to be written consent from the applicable community organizations and building associations, providing evidence of the organization's approval or lack of objection to a Park Parklet installation. So that's the process by which those quality of life considerations come forward in the permanent parklet process.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay, good. And I wanted to talk about that because we referenced community organizations, but that is as a very broad definition. A community organization can be a group of neighbors on a street who call themselves the Blanc residents because their community, you know, engaged in community activities as a block in Belmont Shores.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Specifically, there is a business association. There's two residents associations. There's no highways, but there's community organizations. So I just want to make sure that that process involves feedback from not a particular organization per se, but whether it's neighbors, community members, business association, that that feedback is obtained.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Absolutely. And specifically, that section of the municipal code says that it's to the satisfaction of the director of public works, which gives that ability to to ensure that the appropriate folks are having the opportunity to chime in in the process.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. And what about an appeals process? So I imagine that business owners have a right to appeal or do they have a right to appeal? Well, there's a vested right. There's been the extension of of an appeal or due process.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Right. So, for example, for folks that are engaged in our temporary PARKLET program, our temporary PARKLET permit includes an an appeal. Right. And that was something that Deputy City Attorney Art Sanchez explained in relation to the restoration parklet removal in our code section under this permanent parklet program.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That right right to vests when the parklet right vests. And that's covered in section. Sorry. 1/2. 14.1 5.110. And that's when you have a. Parklet permit that has been extended and you're going to have some significant change or revocation of that permit, and that's where the appeal arises.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. So the right requires both due process of documenting the allegations, following through a certain process, and then the right of appeal. In relation to the permanent Parklet program? That's correct. In relation to sorry, in relation to the temporary PARKLET program?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's correct. In relation to the appeal rights under the Long Beach Municipal Code for the Permanent Parklet program. There needs to be that vested right in the permit. It's in the Parklet itself. Got it. Okay. All right. I think I have enough questions right now that I've asked that might help answer some of the questions, but would'",
        "'speaker_4': 'if it's OC. Vice Mayor, I'm sorry, the mayor's back to go to public comment.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yeah, we're going to go go to public comment. We do have a significant number of folks who have signed up for public comment. So it's more than than the ten threshold. So that'll go that will be the 92nd clock automatically for the council rules.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So if you want to go ahead and read the first set of five folks and then we'll just go through the public comment. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Will the following speakers please line up at the podium? Heather Carlile. Mark Carlisle. Bill Sheehan. Rita Santos. Oceana and Kelly MacLean.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hello. I'm Heather Carlisle. I'm the owner of the Belmont Shore Children's Center, located at Terminal Avenue in Olympic Plaza. The park put in front of my business was put there without my consent. There has been a gross lack of enforcement of violations.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'members of Iconix Fitness. Under an amended Iconix, fitness would still be granted the structure that currently occupies 175 square feet, 175 feet of Olympic Plaza between their property lines, as well as the continued use of the entire Olympic Plaza Park itself.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In addition, iconic fitness has 4169 square feet of outdoor space available on its rooftop. The only thing that would change would be the removal of the structure in front of our property that has become brutally inappropriate and is without our consideration.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'A sizable portion of the site line looking west is blocked by Parklets.

        "'speaker_2': 'I have personally gone through this already and Coastal Commission and the permitting process are not cohesive at all.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Jenny Holbrook, Long Beach resident. Mayor Garcia and council members. I'm asking you to terminate the temporary parklets.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'As of June 30th. This was your.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'December decision, and I see no.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Reason why you should change your.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Mind today. The businesses have had months to apply.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'For and build permanent parklets through.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The established process.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'As was outlined by Mr. Modica.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Parklet on Second Street in Belmont Shore or the Parklets at the pier do not make sense for many.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Reasons, including.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Negative impacts to parking, traffic flow, esthetics and noise. But most importantly is the negative impact they.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Have had on access.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'For the disability community. The reach required five feet of clear pedestrian.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Access on sidewalks is not.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Maintained by many of the PARKLET operators and this requirement has.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Not been enforced by public works either.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The Long Beach Citizens Advisory Commission on Disabilities has outlined these concerns in detail in a.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Memo that all of you received and also Mr. Modica received, and that was stated on five 1222. Please read it. Please do not extend.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'A temporary parklets.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Beyond June 30th. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening, Mayor and council members. My name is Melinda Cotton and I live in Belmont Shore. We were told when the temporary Parklet program was designed to help restaurants survive COVID 19 restrictions. But somehow the iconic private gym and fitness business was allowed.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In the summer of 2020 to take over half of a two way street to Olympic Plaza Drive near the Belmont Pier, closing one lane of traffic and taking over some 20 free public parking spaces near the beach. Iconix was given a special advance permit at OJP and the Public Works Department installed Orange K rails or barricades down'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the middle of the public street. Iconix then installed tall chain link fencing around this barricaded street and parking spaces, filling it with gym equipment and a storage container. For the past two years, only Iconix paid members and staff have been allowed this former public space.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There are no longer any restrictions on Iconix, but it still has possession of this space. The takeover of Olympic Plaza Drive is unnecessary and unconscionable. The city should remove those barricades and return this public street and public parking spaces for coastal visitors and the families and children trying to escape inland summer heat.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It was an inexpensive day at the beach and.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Your time has expired. Jeff Miller and brian cochran.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening, mayor. And members of the council and the residents of belmont shore. 100 more than 100 of them who are not able to be here tonight, but signed a petition asking that the parklets be terminated. I live in Belmont Shore, half a block from Second Street.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'My comments are concerning only the Belmont Shore Parklets. Belmont Shore has had the reputation of a great neighborhood. It's a nice place to live, to visit, to shop, to dine, to take visitors. Don't we all want to preserve that image?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Isn't that important for the image of Belmont Shore? This image has been hurt by the parklets, and there's a danger of that becoming permanent. The substantial loss of parking has been mentioned. It's now a danger to vehicles pedestrians at intersections because of the lack of visibility.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The walkability of the neighborhood has been lost. There are sidewalk obstructions. It's impossible to stroll leisurely and converse. The sidewalks are filled with dining tables, signage, servers, patrons waiting. The appearance is terrible. So to keep parklets or not, they should be decided by neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And they may be okay in some neighborhoods, but they're not appropriate in Belmont. Sure, it would be a decision only to profit.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sorry. Your time has expired. Well, the following five speakers please line up. Julie Dean, Rita see Estella to door. Geoffrey Mozart. Dimitrios So if you can line up at the podium, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Are and council members. How was your day? How was your morning? Pleasant, I hope. Mine started with five trucks and half a dozen workmen doing loud construction at Belmont Brewing Company, 100 feet from the bedrooms and living spaces of some 140 residents in my condo complex.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'My morning included someone who drove in their car through a public walkway to the foot of the nearby pier and decided to blast their music for 30 minutes. It included another 2 hours of those workmen sawing, drilling, hammering and dropping heavy items on the walkway meant for pedestrians, bicyclists and runners.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Had there been an emergency, no fire truck or ambulance could have gotten through. My month has included illegally parked motorcyclists throwing debris at my window, spurred on by the owner of an adjacent catering business operating within OCP, who routinely parks his vehicles in the public walkway.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It also included the same owner at 10 p.m. on a weekend, interrupting his noisy, unloading supplies on the public walkway to stand under my balcony and ask if I was watching porn on my phone because I was documenting his violations for the police.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'He asked in front of dozens of my neighbors if I was a pedophile. Owners and managers of these businesses haven't just encroached on public space. They've treated it as our exclusive domain. They've been contemptuous of residents outreach and all efforts to mitigate.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They let their employees, vendors and customers do whatever they want. They lied to police and city officials. There are daily and weekly occurrences in my neighborhood. Does that happen in your area? I hope not. It's time to end these parklets or sweeps and sweeps.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's truly time.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hello, Mayor and council members. My name is Julie Dean. I live in Belmont Shore and I've been there for 25 years. There's been or there was a certified class action suit filed against the city of Long Beach on behalf of persons with mobility disabilities.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The parties reached a settlement in 2017 that's been entered as a binding order of the Federal Court and has a 30 year term through 2047. The law firm involved submitted a letter to the mayor and council members sorry, addressing sidewalk access for persons with mobility disabilities as it relates to the city's temporary and permanent parklet programs.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They have photographs showing tables, chairs, signs, planters, and even some semi-permanent structures that reduce the clear width of the pedestrian right of way adjacent to park, located on and around Second Street in the Belmont Shore neighborhood. The photographs show bar and restaurant patrons congregating on sidewalks near the Parklets subject.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Such obstructions deny access to persons with mobility disabilities. And I know this firsthand. The city has a binding court enforceable obligation to ensure the accessibility of its pedestrians. Right of way. In addition, the requirements of State and federal disability and discrimination laws.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The settlement requires the city to maintain the accessible features of its pedestrian facilities so that persons with mobility disabilities will be able to use such safely and independently. Thank you very much. Good evening. Mayor Garcia and council members.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I am ready to write. And I have been a resident of Belmont Shores since 1972, and I am still thrilled that I can stand on my corner and have the choice of at least a half dozen restaurants within one block in either direction.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Living half a block from Second Street. My husband and I have frequented the restaurants and businesses there since the days of the Belmont Theater and Hops Hub. However, today, these days, many of the current restaurants are overreaching and they are encroaching on public property.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They are taking up valuable parking places and they are placing tables on the sidewalks, impeding pedestrian traffic and parklets. On second, continue to be a safety hazard and an impediment to the to the vital thoroughfare for local residents, for the commuters and for visitors.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In 1996. 97. Sidewalks were widened to accommodate for the specific purpose of accommodating outdoor dining. And since the new restaurants have been moving in, many of them have opened up the entire front of their estab.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Your time has expired, ma'am. Name. Your time has expired.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Two weeks ago, our resident group made an impassioned plea to city council to not allow permanent parklets in Belmont. Sure, we shared a data based presentation explaining how Belmont sure is too dense in population and Second Street has is too busy a thoroughfare to host parklets.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And now we see that public works is bending over backwards to allow restaurants to request by requesting a permanent status by August 1st. With that request, the restaurant can keep their so-called temporary parklets. The temporary parklets were to sunset June 30th.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'After three prior extensions, they were not constructed to last two years. Second Street now looks like a shantytown. The street smells like an alley. The sidewalks are filthy. And now we have to endure this. Three more months. We no longer have a situation of need on the part of the restaurant.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The two year old Long Beach Restaurant Association, which has been crying, need somehow afforded a highly paid executive director to get city deals in its members favor. The borough has been laying the foundation for widespread permanent parklets since its inception in 2020 and using the cover of the pandemic to advance its goals.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You have a chance tonight to make the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Ma'am, your time has expired.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening. My name's Jeff Cozart, and I'm coming to you tonight from a little bit different perspective. I'm not a resident of Belmont. I live in the fourth District, but I owned the Belmont Athletic Club that is in the third district.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And my concern with the Parklets speaks directly to the mature. When they first came about, I was 100% behind that program. It was needed. We were all fighting for our survival. Um. Now there are tons of businesses in Belmont Shore that are still fighting.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And one of the things that we desperately need is our parking back. I have friends here tonight who are pro parklet. They are some of my friends. Clients. They owned restaurants down there and I get it for them.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I probably want to keep it too. But this issue is very, very simple. It's just about what's fair. They needed help two years ago. I'm glad they got that help. But now the rest of us need what we all share back.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's really just that simple. Thank you. Mr. Mayor. Members of the city council. I'm Jimmy Lloyd, the owner of George's Greek Cafe in Belmont Shore, along with my sister, Nicky. You know, the Parker thing did save us. And it and still to this day does save a lot of people still in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Don't want to sit inside yet. They're concerned, rightfully so. Everybody has a right to feel the way they do. We we have had a hard time this year with getting customers in staffing, cost of goods going up over 20% for our our specific needs.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think if we had the opportunity to get a permanent parklet, a lot of these concerns that came up before me would be probably be addressed in the process. I have hired Perkovic and Ruth, who has brought, I believe, two or three of the Parklets, and they've had no headway in trying to get the process into public'",
        "'speaker_2': 'works and get it done. So my concern is if yes, if there's a process to get to a permanent park that make them look nice, make sure they're safe, make sure that there's access for handicapped people and that's more walkable, then that process should be in place and we should be allowed to at least try to apply'",
        "'speaker_2': 'for it. I try to play it in 15 and it was shot down and now have been told even today I was texting with my architect that it's still not a real process to get a permanent parklet. These things can all be addressed and bad players can be excluded.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And the ones that I want to do the good job and be good neighbors should be rewarded. Thank you for your time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Will the following speakers please line up the podium? Nicky Clare. Pete Marsh. Rod Farentino. Jenny Cuevas. Sandy Watson. Nikki Clare. Pete Marsh. Rod Farentino. Jenny Cuevas and Sandy Watson.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening, mayor, vice mayor and council members. I think my brother just spoke for me. Oddly enough, I'm going right after him and I. I agree with what he's saying. We have been trying for a long time to go through the proper channels to get a permanent parklet with no headway, nobody getting back to us.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I've read some of the articles in The Grunion and I understand and I agree with what people are saying. They're frustrated that we're not getting back to them and saying backing up what we're saying that we're going to help out and clean up and make it safe and make them and beautify them.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But it's hard to to put that into play when we don't get any answers back and we can't. It doesn't make financial sense to spend an exorbitant amount of money to bring parklets up to standard of what's expected to be safe and esthetically pleasing at the expense of a temporary solution.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So if we can get some headway in that, I know that that would take care of a lot of the problems, and there's certain guidelines that everybody has to follow. So thank you for tearing us out.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Pete Marsh. Rod Farentino.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening, Mayor. Council and city staff. My name is Rod Farentino. I'm a Long Beach resident, born and raised here. I'm also a restaurant owner and I am a member of the Long Beach Restaurant Association. To my knowledge, the agenda item this evening is not about Parklet or no PARKLET.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It actually relates to terminating the temporary outdoor Parklet program on June 30th, or potentially extending the temporary outdoor dining period to some date in the future. And in this case, until September, September 30th, only for those that apply for permanency.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The state of California still has its state of emergency in effect. I see many of you wearing mask here tonight. COVID is still here. Cases are rising once again. L.A. County is on the verge of a mask mandate.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Also, the Alcohol Beverage Control has extended their outdoor drinking in these temporary spaces for one year after the California state of emergency ends. Folks, the state is still in a state of emergency. So if many people here tonight, I want to tell you that we're not in a state of emergency as it relates to COVID.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I disagree. It is still here. Many members of the public still only dine outdoors. I get reservations. Online. Daily. Outdoor dining only. The city is considering terminating our outdoor dining program with no expedited, expedited plan to to get us through the process.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We need the city to tell us what to do. By June 30th.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Next week. Your police.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'My name is Jennifer Cuevas. I o Taco Shaw in Belmont. Shaw And I would like to thank you for letting us have the parklet throwing all this awful time in COVID, however, were not recovered. We do need the help still.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We do have a lot of residents coming in loving the parklets. They just don't come to the meetings here. But we always we always get those feedback that they love it. It's important for us to keep at it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Where? At the beach. Beach. They absolutely just help us survive. We have I have 23 employees that depend on my decisions and your decisions and that actually help us keep on with the community and bring works back. And it's just important for us to keep the Parklets I understand that a lot of residents are not happy with'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the way that some owners are managing their stores, penalize them, do something with them. But Don, don't do it to all of us. It's not fair that we are doing what we are supposed to. We are following all the protocols.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Help us survive. Help us keep going with, you know, the business and then just keep it open. Thank you. Hi. My name is Sandy Watson and I am a resident of the third district. I'm a retired schoolteacher from Albany, USD.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'When I think of when I think of Long Beach, we were in Beach City and we are beaches and walking on the shores and sunsets and outdoor dining. I love the outdoor dining. I think it's made a really great impact to downtown or to Second Street.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I, I just am so impressed that you guys were able to get together and think out of the box. As a teacher, I think that's what we encourage our kids to do all the time and sneak out of the box.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And together with the restaurant, you've come up with a way to do that. Let's not punish them now because they're not out of the whole thing. Started saying that they did it for economic recovery. You can't tell me the restaurants have recovered now when they're just starting to have their summer season, when they can have their their'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and their customers sit outside, which is what we want to do as residents. We don't want to be sitting inside. As the other gentleman said, it's outside dining that we're looking for. So I just hope that you will at least extend this parklets to the end of the summer to help those cuts in the restaurants and the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'residents. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, the following five speakers, please. Lineup. Katie Fahey. Anna Christiansen, Darryl Burns. Kieran Gow. Jeff Roe. Oh, thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening, Mayor Garcia. Council members. Fellow citizens. Pete Marsh, District two. I'm a climate advocate. And so I rode my bike here today. I rode my bike this morning to a restaurant that we, my business partner and I chose because we wanted to eat outdoors.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we ate in a parklet. And my wife and I have only been we've only been indoors maybe three times in the last two and a half years. We still look for outdoor seating. So both for the health reasons, I agree with the folks who have said, you know, the pandemic is not over yet.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We're fooling ourselves if we just say that. More, more big picture. I'm thinking about the future. We've got a good program in this city for establishing bike lanes and bike routes and bike ways. I'm just. Just learning. We've had our electric bikes for less than a month.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm trying to replace a second car. I think we need to think about that in all aspects of urban planning to make our cities denser, more walkable, bikeable and livable. And so this discussion tonight, I think, is a microcosm of many bigger discussions to come as we try to increase the the vibrancy of this great city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thanks very much.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening. My name is Katie Fahy. I live in the third district and have lived there over 20 years. I am not against all parklets. I feel that they have enhanced our area on Second Street and people have been responsible for what they have.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The owners, the managers. I can speak. I want to speak specifically to what affects me daily and my family. I live in Glendora. And when I was here, I was here back in December and told you having it on the sidewalk or having on the side street has brought dogs into my living room.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I am the first line of defense. My yard and house have essentially become dog smoking section and bathroom. We can't make a blanket rule or policy. We need to do it individually and by people's actions and how they are responsible for their area.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Dogs has shown time and time again they could care less of how they integrate into the community. People stand in the street, hanging on the parklet, watching the TVs, dog pastries, patrons hang out in the dry, cleaner parking lot, yelling back and forth at their friends.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I have been told that they're adding new security. They're the ones who are smoking pot in the parking lot. Just this Saturday, I had someone peeing on the wall in my house and had to call the police. And I have kids that are watching this and it's not right.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So you need to take responsibility and manage the parklets as well as. I hope the traffic directors listening to this because it is about.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Your time is beginning, Ms. Christiansen.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Fine. Just a comment. The Sierra Club most serious task force, third district resident born in Long Beach. Yada, yada, yada. On this issue, I'm concerned about two people that are violating what I think is just common courtesy and public safety.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I noticed that the traffic director said that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They're going to assess who gets to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Stay and who gets to go.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Based on a lot of complaints. And then he also said that people don't know how to complain. So I think there's a little.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Bit of a.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Break here. And I hope that people who learn how to complain and this can be expressed sooner rather than later will be able to be taken seriously, even if it's not hasn't occurred over a long period of time.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm concerned about, I think, the word park. That's kind of strange. But anyway, I totally understand what Ms.. Cotton is saying about Down by the beach there, where an entire street has been taken over for a gym. And it's not just the street they take.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The gym takes over the park and even the beach and even the bicycle path. You can't ride a bicycle down the path. They do classes on the bike path. So this particular business owner is pretty out of control and and has his own outdoor deck.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So what I find is interesting. You know.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'As Christiansen, your times expired.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening. My name's Darryl Burns. I live on a glendora street in Belmont. Sure. And, you know, I think I came and spoke here a few months ago, and I was very frustrated with one establishment down the street, Doug's bar.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And but at that point in time, I was really very supportive of all the other parklets supportive of this effort and really felt like, you know, how do we hold some some places accountable? I guess what I've learned is you can't hold them accountable once they have a parklet.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so my concern about extending where I was very flexible in the beginning, I would say I really encourage you to not extend the parklets as far as permanent parklets. I hope you put a process in place where there is a grievance process.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'What I have found is a huge burden falls on the community to have to hold them accountable. I know there are some inspections and some things done when there's complaints. Those folks are probably not out there one in the morning.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I know people say the parklets are closed at that point in time. Patrons still go out and hang out there. As one of the previous speakers said, you know, we had someone come and just urinate right in front of us.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know, we had another person later in the evening, he walked by, fell down on all fours. I went over to check on him. He said he drank too much, got up, stumbled around, and then went back to the bar.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So, you know, I think the quality of life. Good evening, everyone. My name is Karen Goff on the 908 restaurant El Ultimo Pizzeria. And then I'm the president of the Long Beach Restaurant Association. Oakland. San Luis Obispo. San Francisco.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Manhattan Beach. Claremont. Santa monica. Most of Orange County cities. A bunch of cities and San Diego have all decided to extend the temporary permit process for Parklets. That's like what? Somehow in Long Beach we can only do it for 30 days.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We've asked for over a year for an easier path towards what the permanent parklet process is, and we haven't really gotten any movement on that. It's cumbersome. It's 27 pages. There's only two architecture firms that you can hire.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's like they're backed up. The city is short staffed. We've heard that from all of you. That's like so we can't even get the parklets approved in a timely fashion. All we're asking for is that we get a we get a path towards temporary being extended into such a time to where we have a permanent parklet process'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that works for the entire city and the restaurant community. We know there's a lot of people from downtown. Sure. That have an issue with Parklets. We get it. We thank them for their patience and helping us through this whole time and COVID.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'However, Bellman sure doesn't dictate policy for the entire city, so we need to take that into consideration and go from there. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, the following speakers, please line up the podium. Susan Row. Nadia Tushnet. Michael Neufeld. Kurt Schneider.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening, council members and Mayor Garcia. When I heard that on January, on January 1st, we were going to have to end the PARKLET program on June 30th. Two weeks later, I started applying for the process. I went to an architecture firm.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I got told. We'll get to you when we get to you. It's been five and a half months. I've had one meeting with the architecture firm. No quote, except for him to tell me it's going to be 40 to $60000 to put a permanent parklet in and to lose two thirds of them.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Excuse me, one third of my current parklet. I don't know how people say that this is not a survival instinct for us. We're all we've all made do during COVID. We have started to come out of it. COVID is not over.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mask mandates are coming back. And I don't think that anybody has also considered that for every park that closes, at least 1 to 2 employees will be losing their jobs from our restaurants because we have nothing to give them for shifts.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So please consider extending and making the process for us to go permanent for us who are doing the right thing easier. We want to do the right thing. We want to make our parklets beautiful. We want to make Long Beach beautiful.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hi. I'm Susan Rowe. And I actually lived in Belmont Heights about three blocks off of Second Street. Second Street used to be a destination that I would go to frequently with my daughter for Christmas parades and the Halloween candy walk, the stroll and savors.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I can't imagine any of that stuff happening now. There are shuttered businesses there. I wouldn't put a business on that street right now because you can't even see the businesses with all of the parklets. I have a prepared statement, but I did want to say I didn't get a survey and it's not more walkable.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I rarely go there anymore. So it's time to end the temporary parklets. The bars and restaurants have received hundreds of thousands of dollars of loans that were forgiven. Dogs alone, one of the worst offenders of community standards and frequent violator of Parklet rules, got 370,000.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Belmont Brewing Company got $923,000. Iconix Fitness $717,000. The bars and restaurants have received extensive state aid. Even now, the city continues to dole out its remaining relief funds. To them, permit fees were way for the entirety of the pandemic.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To date, the Libra won extra funds up to $10,000 for bars and restaurants to create outdoor dining and thousands more to update their technology. No other sector of city businesses has received aid anywhere close to these amounts. No individual resident received rescue funds that lasted more than a month.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Rust.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Ma'am, your time has expired.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hello. My name's Nadir Tushnet, and I've been living in Long Beach for almost 40 years. Not quite at the shore. But when I first moved here, one of the things I liked to do was I'm a great wanderer and wandered around the businesses in the shore.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I want to talk about I understand the economic impact of the cost of COVID on on restaurants. But right now, there was two other economic impacts that we should take into account. First of all, there is a high cost to the city of oversight and accountability around the existing parklets we heard it described.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So that's a cost that should be taken into account as we move on with this. There's also the economic impact on the non restaurant businesses. If you can't wander down the street, which you can't, I'll tell you, then those businesses suffer.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We talk a lot. I hear a lot of talk about choosing winners and losers. If we're going to choose restaurants over other kinds of businesses as the winners and the other businesses are the losers, I'm not sure that that's actually fair.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening, everybody. Mayor Council. Uh, with respect, first of all, to Mr. America's admonishment of what we've been doing for six months in terms of not a lot of us being able to get the paperwork. And I think there was a comment in the back there what we've been doing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think I can speak on behalf of all the restaurant owners in the room. We've been washing our own dishes and cooking all the food for the guests because we can't seem to find workers to do that. That's what we've been doing for six months, in addition to running our businesses and losing money.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So the reality is, is that and I have an IP, I don't have a parklet clip, but I'm certainly speaking as a fiduciary on behalf of the other the other restaurant owners here. City of L.A. just extended this to March for a variety of reasons.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And this shouldn't be a permanent situation. We know that. But there's just not enough time. It's premature. You've heard enough about the process with respect to permanent parklets. We need more time. We need more time to work with you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We need more time to clean up the Parklets you know, we need to address that. It's a real problem and we get it. And you know, as a founding member of the borough, you have our commitment that we want to work with you and we want to understand what we need to do to improve it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's not a perfect program. It's not a perfect process. But we've been just trying to survive and keep 20,000 restaurant workers employed in the city of Long Beach. So we ask for a little bit more time and a little bit more clarity and a little bit more communication so that we can help you have the city that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you vision here and help us stay in business. Thank you. Good evening, Mayor Garcia. City Council people and the well-behaved baby. Tonight, I'd like to address as the president of the Belmont Shore Business Association to thank all of you and city staff for what you've done, letting us have these parklets as long as we've had.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I don't want to reiterate everything everybody else has already said. So many great comments have made. There's been falsities as well, but I'm here for positivity. What I will say today is that if the city enforces the municipal codes, the ADA rules, we will be forced to adhere.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I am here to be your biggest advocate. As a president of the Belmont Shore Business Association, five feet. We have to have five feet. I want to see anybody with ADA issues to never have a problem in Belmont Shore.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I want you to come to Belmont Shore and know that we care for you and want you to visit our restaurants and our retail. That is nobody's intent but a poor operator. They should be fined. They should be warned first and then find.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I am here to back you 100%. What I will tell you right now is that to extend this would be a godsend to some. We are not through this. The permanency is an issue. I have my plans ready from my own place and so many of the other people are ready to go.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If Mr. Hickman and DeKoe do this, we will help you. We will work well with you. Thank you so much. Your staff has been fantastic.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Your time has expired. Thank you. That concludes public comment.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. I'm going I also have some a couple questions as well, but I'm going to turn it back over to Councilman Price and then we'll go. Go then, councilman.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. So a couple of issues. Can someone please address the ADA concerns? And let me just make one thing very clear that I have been consistent across the board both to the restaurants and non restaurants that have parklets as well as the residents that I absolutely believe that Belmont Shore is in a different situation than Parklets throughout'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the city and that Belmont Shaw needs to be considered differently and separately for a couple of reasons. One, the proximity of homes to the residences, given the density, is different in Belmont Shaw than some other business corridors that have parklets.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'One of the residents here talked about her house literally on the alley that is adjacent to one of the businesses. That's an unusual situation and an unusual dynamic. And I've been very clear with every entity that has asked me repeatedly that Belmont Shore is differently situated and that because of parking issues, because it's in the coastal zone'",
        "'speaker_4': ', that it's going to have to be treated differently. I've been very consistent with that in terms of the traffic engineers determination. Also, the traffic speeds and volumes on Belmont Shore are different. We don't have the option to close down a lane.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I know people have suggested that in the past to allow for parklets the volume on that street is just too great. We can't close down a lane. I wish we could consider that, but we can't even consider that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It would be horrific for traffic. The second thing that I think is is very clear is obviously because we have a lot going on in Belmont. Sure, the ADA issues might be different in Belmont Shore than other places given the number of Parklets.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So can someone speak to that? Are we. Is it currently are we not in compliance? Have we considered that? What's the status.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Councilwoman, we do have a group of people who work in the transportation mobility team. We do go out and walk the entire corridor from Bayshore to Livingston, both sides of the road on multiple occasions. I've been out there four or five times myself.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'When we do these walks and inspections, we're checking for a variety of things, including ADA clearances that we have to maintain. We do talk to businesses, managers, whoever is on site that can make the adjustment with tables, chairs, or maybe even keeping the patrons out of the walkway.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We also have a task force that goes out and responds to similar issues as well. The problem is, is that we can't be out there 24 seven. So as we walk away from that business after clearing up whatever that particular issue is, you know, one hour later, it could rise up again.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So we just don't have that constant presence there. But we are checking on that issue constantly regarding ADA accessibility.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. I want to talk a little bit about. I know that we said that there's no permanent options for Opie's, but my understanding is some of the Opie's that are on private property have been advised that they may be able to stay if, for example, they're able to find sufficient parking.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'For example, row is one of those where the Opie is in the back and they've been advised that if parking can be found that that's possibly and an avenue. And I would just want to confirm that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Council Member Christopher We are working with that business row and have spoken to others. So in those circumstances, a a property owner can always come into the city and discuss improvements. And that particular location, they are going to secure offsite parking and then remove parking spaces from their site plan.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But that will be a permanent condition on private property that is permitted through development services, as building any structure would be. So it's not that they will have a permanent OCP, the O p will go away, and they will have secured a way to have outdoor dining on their private property as a permanent feature of their restaurant'",
        "'speaker_4': '. Okay. Thank you. So I have a motion regarding. I know that Councilwoman Sara made a motion to extend the ops till September 30th, but I want to ask about a modification to that. What I'd like to do is for the ops, I would like a process for the ops whereby if they're requesting an extension that they apply'",
        "'speaker_4': 'for that extension to our public works department and that a decision be made on a case by case basis regarding whether or not that PARKLET or that OPI can be extended till September 30th. And for considerations such as parking impacts, residential impacts, impact on adjoining businesses, that those be considered in that decision process.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Councilwoman Sara, are you okay with that? So I just want to clarify said that if they if they wanted to extend it, they would have to apply for that extension for just three months, though. I don't know that they have to go through an application process, but an expression of interest is what we have right now for'",
        "'speaker_4': 'those businesses that are on a list. I just didn't want to make it onerous. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Just a point of clarification to move forward. My understanding was that the AP exemption was for only apps issued on private property. That's how I understood it. So I don't know if that's changing. Now to the opens would go through the Special Events Office and not the Public Works Department.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I defer to Tasha Day to discuss the impact on an application that it would have on staff.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So most of them would have to reapply. Council member as they would have to turn in current drawings for those new structures or modified structures as well as the proper insurance to maintain those they are sent to sun.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They are set to sunset on June 30th.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we would have to go through that entire process of collecting all that data. It's doable, but they would all.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Have to reapply.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They would all have to reapply to go beyond June 30th.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes, they would have to reapply and we would.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Have to vet all of their insurance requirements again. And that's regardless of what we do tonight. Yes. Oh, okay. No, no, no. Only if you agree with them.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If you extend them past the 30th.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They would have to do that. If we extend them past the 30th, they would have to do that for private and private property. And public property. Yes. Can. My motion wasn't to extend beyond September 30. I think it's June 30th.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'All right. Which 30th are we talking about?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'June 30th. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So to extend them beyond June 30th, they'd have to apply. That's correct. So I don't. So that we couldn't automatically extend them beyond June 30th. They would have to apply to go beyond June 30th.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They would reapply like they have been. So they've been doing this this whole time.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So every time the APIs are extended.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We contact everyone and they have to resubmit their information.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. So they would have to reapply and then you would do an evaluation as to whether you grant it based on that application? That is correct. Okay. So we would be saying if they're currently an existing AP, they could apply to go till September 30th, but they still have to go through the application process.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes. And that application process would involve presumably consideration of the comments that have been expressed tonight in terms of parking impacts and other impacts. Yes, that's correct. And encroachment on other businesses. Yes. Okay. So they would have to apply even weaker.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So what we're saying now is you could apply up to September. You could apply to extend up to September 30th. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's the motion.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. All right. I may want to come back to that. I'm out of time, so I'll come back up. Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think Councilman Allen was next.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. Thank you, Mayor. I do appreciate everyone that came out to talk, but I do think that these temporary parklets need to come to an end. I know that we have done everything that we can do. When these when the restaurants really needed our help, I think we all rallied around.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think we did as council. We did as as patrons. And I absolutely love the outdoor dining. And but I do have concerns with these temporary parklets. All the concerns that a lot of people expressed tonight. I'm also.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Wondering, you know, we've had these the restaurants have had a really long time to get these these applications in. But what I've heard from some of these businesses that they haven't we haven't gotten back to them for their permanent.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So that's concerning to me because it's if we're saying you have this time period to to apply and they're seeing that they haven't got backs, I really need to understand what's happening there because that's that's problematic. And I also wonder if there's a good number of businesses that have expressed interest but yet haven't moved forward.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I don't know what's happening there either. If someone can speak on that, perhaps they're going to keep the temporary parklets as long as they can. I mean, I would imagine it's good for their business and it's kind of, you know, free space.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But why are they not applying for this permanent position? So permanent a parklet. So if someone can help me understand what's happening there, I appreciate it.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes, Councilwoman, let me point out that we we have had permanent parklet permits issued recently. I mentioned that we have four that are currently in the review process, three are in CD1 and one is in CD seven. And we have also already converted four temporary parklets to permanent two and CD1 one in CD two and one in'",
        "'speaker_8': 'CD five. So, so when we do have locations that are meeting their requirements, paying the fees, putting in their applications and their their plans, a complete application, those permits move forward. We do have some businesses who are who have talked to the permit technicians.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'They submit packages and they're not complete. They're missing an engineer stamp. They're missing a signature. So those processes are deemed incomplete. But recently we've had a lot of discussion about this meeting and the outcome of this meeting and the fact that many folks who are thinking about going permanent, they still need Coastal Commission approval to make that'",
        "'speaker_8': 'approval and the reality of the permanent park that happen. So it's still a bit of a process, but we're not just stopping the entire program. That's not that's not the case.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we heard a business say that they have applied and haven't heard back from our team. So what do you say to that? Like, how does that happen?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'When I hear something like that, I really want to talk to that business and find out who they are, where they are, and what they where they are in the process. Most of our permit technicians are very reliable.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'They contact the businesses. So I would I would like to just follow up and see what we can do to make that process more efficient.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Come tomorrow, Ringo.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. And thank you. Because remember, Alan, you brought up a slide here that I was looking at right now, and I was going to ask a question about it. And that's slide 11, where you mentioned that the the four businesses that went from temporary and permanent to a silly one, one, two, three, two, one and C'",
        "'speaker_5': 'five. The four businesses that applied for that are currently under review, three in CD1 and one in CD seven and in the 30 businesses that only expressed interest in the formal establishment, the Parklets seven in CD2 and 23 in CD3 in three.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But obviously the, the, the one item here that put my ears was the, the businesses that are located in the coastal zone and needing a coastal development permit. How many of those businesses that we have are those 30 of fit within that the coastal zone that you know of?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Councilman. That's a very good question. Right now, we have 30 businesses that have expressed interest only in obtaining a permanent parklet permit. And I would say approximately half of those between 15 and 20 at the most are actually within a local Coastal Commission jurisdiction.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So they will need a local permit, which we do here at the city. They don't have to go to Sacramento for that project. I mean, for that permit.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It was part of the LCP as well.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But you're correct. But the thing is, is that, you know, when businesses show interest, that doesn't mean that they've committed fully to the process. And we don't anticipate that we're going to have 30 businesses knocking on our door right now to get a permit.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You know, as I was in the case, I was only interested in how many do you think are in the coastal zone that would have to apply? What I'm basically looking at is it appears that those businesses that are in the coastal zone would have to go through another layer or another process of getting a permanent parklet'",
        "'speaker_5': '. Would that be correct?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That's correct. I would say that the final step in the process is that coastal, local coastal commission approval. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. Well, good luck with that. It takes so long with the Coastal Commission, though, I'll tell you. I know experience. Yes. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So and just to just to clarify that that would be an LCP that would not be going to the the full coastal commission. So when they're at that process, we're deeming them pretty much complete. So they have a couple more things to do.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They in our mind would be deemed feasible. They'd be eligible for this extension. There's a small handful of those right now. It's the ones that haven't gotten through the architect yet that haven't been able to put up the dollars and the investment to make something like this occur.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'If we're purposes of the audience, LCP is a local coastal program will permit that the city has already established in terms of rules of how businesses can go into the coastal zone. So just to put clarification on that, that's all I have.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, councilmember. With screening still loading here, the councilman price is next.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Okay, so on that note. The 17 or so businesses that are in Belmont Shore, Naples that are fall in the coastal zone, who have expressed an interest, have not been given an application process. At least some of them have been told there is no application process.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So that's where I feel like there's a little bit of unfairness here. We're saying if you've applied we were saying they had all this time to apply, okay, but they haven't been given a meaningful application process. So those that are on the list should be given an opportunity to actually apply so that they can get a permanent'",
        "'speaker_4': 'parklet because and maybe the city attorney needs to weigh in here, our current permanent PARKLET program. Which was established in 2018. Does not have a carve out for Belmont Shore. So if you're a business owner. In a different district and you are given the opportunity to apply for a permanent parklet and you're a business owner in Belmont'",
        "'speaker_4': '. Sure, you still have the same opportunity to apply for a permanent parklet because our own rules don't carve out the coastal zone, correct? That's correct. Councilmember Price. There is no carve out for the second for second Street or for Belmont Shore.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There are safety considerations and those considerations are applied on a case by case basis for every parklet. Exactly. And I've been very clear with all the businesses in Belmont. Sure. That want to convert to permanent that is going to be a decision that the traffic engineer is going to make based on the traffic and the parking situation'",
        "'speaker_4': 'in Belmont. Sure. So my problem is they haven't been given an opportunity. So what I would like to make a motion tonight is if they have expressed an interest. By June 30th. And they're going to go through the application process.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And it's they are deemed feasible to go through the application process. Then I'm okay with option B, which means they need to complete their process by August 1st. Okay. What I don't want is if there are businesses that the traffic engineer has already deemed are infeasible.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'For whatever reason, traffic concerns, blind spots, neighborhood concerns, whatever. I don't want to wait until August 1st if we've already made that determination. So what I would like is by June 30th, the traffic engineer to let those people that are on the list are still interested in having a permanent parklet.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They need to notify our public works department by June 30th. Our Public Works Department by June 30th needs to let them know if they are deemed a feasible applicant or not. If they are deemed feasible, then they can go forward with the application process, which we have not afforded them meaningfully up until this point.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'For those businesses in the coastal area and they can go through that process under option B, if they are deemed infeasible, then they must tear down their temporary PARKLET By July 15th, we give them two weeks to tear it down.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If they have an appeal process, then they can go through the appeal process. But that's the timeline that I would like connected to option B. Is that possible?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I'd like the team to explain or to respond to that. I think that is possible. I'd like to hear from them. I do want them also to give a little bit of information on that. They have not had a process available.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We do believe they have had a process available and this is changing it slightly. They have them do interest and then a process. So I'd like to turn to Christopher Coons and to Karl to talk through the can we do this and what process have they had available so far?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So Councilmember, I'm going to start and then.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Carl is going to.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Take over.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So there's two departments that touch these potential permanent parklets and maybe no one in this room. But we have had applicants that have.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Tried to do the process out of.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Order and have been directed not to do that. So development services is not has not will not process any of these permits until they've obtained their public works approval. The public works process, for good reasons is extensive and it requires a lot of materials that have to be turned into.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Carl We have had applicants attempt to skip that step entirely and lodge an application with development services. We've rejected a number of those because they have to obtain their safety related approval first before we can look at the suitability and the cost or so on.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So Carl is going to talk about his process.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes, we have a process where we look at, you know, the location, exactly the footprint, many of the things that we've already talked about as far as sightlines accessibility, whether they're over utilities, a lot of research, an investigation goes into whether we're going to approve one of these locations.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And of course, we're taking into consideration the neighborhood quality of life questions that come into play. But again, we don't expect to see 30 businesses rushing to us to install permanent parklets. Again, it's a major financial commitment as one of the speakers mentioned.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And we feel that regardless of how many come in, we're going to be able to make the process more efficient, address their concerns and, you know, put them on the right path to getting this approval if they are deemed feasible.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay, so my time is up, so I'll come back up.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If I could add something to that for what I heard you say, Councilmember, is that businesses be allowed to have until June 30th to express their interest and then city staff will respond by June 30th. And that's not possible.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We would need if we have 510 people apply at June 30th, we can't guarantee that we'll get back to them on the same day. Additionally, if we find that a business is not feasible, we can claim that they're not feasible, have their temporary parklet removed, but we cannot stop them from applying for a permanent parklet down the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'road.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Of course. Of course. And you're absolutely right. My understanding was that if they're not on the interest list right now. They're not going to be able to apply, but that's why I was saying the June 30th. But we can make it express interest by June 20th and a decision will be made by June 30th.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's just what we need is a date by which you can apply for it. Either we don't allow any more beyond the 30 that have already talked to us, or we determine a date in the future to get your your interest letter in.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. So I'm going to queue back up because my time is up.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Councilman's in the house.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Just for clarification, one of the things that I see with the PARKLETS is that even though we're trying to terminate the the temporary parklets, we're also giving the opportunity to make those.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Parklets.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Permanent, those that are feasible. I think that if we could actually look at the ad, all of the parklets that we have right now and really work with the owners of those that are not feasible to let them know that it's not going to be possible because of many things that Mr. Karl may me foresee.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think that's important to let them know and not lead them on that. It might be possible because I'm sure that there's some that are very, very easy to see that that wouldn't work for many reasons. So I think that, you know, I would like to say and encourage you to please, please look at those and address'",
        "'speaker_4': 'those and and make sure that the businesses know.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Also, I.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Feel that being in the downtown, the Parklets have been great for so many reasons. I mean, we are downtown. I do I do think we're different from other districts and stuff, but I think that being able to help the businesses establish or go through the process of applying.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'For a parklet.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And actually looking at certain barriers that have been preventing them to make.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That park.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Parklet permanent. I think it's.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Also important to look.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'At and work with each business on a business to business basis to see what we can do as a city to help them make that that parklet permanent. So I know that's a lot of work, and I know that we're really trying to help everyone here.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So thank you for all the work that you've already done and the work that is ahead.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. Next up is Councilman Allen and we have Councilman Prescott. I have some you guys might have a couple questions. Thank you. And then we'll we'll get back to the speaker's list. So I just have a couple of questions for staff and just some general comments.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I want to just go back just one, one step and think the council certainly I have been a supporter of our Open Streets program, which a parklets were a part of since day one. For me, it was always first and foremost about the pandemic, making sure that people were safe, making sure that people had options to be'",
        "'speaker_7': 'outdoors, and also to ensure that we didn't lose our restaurants and small businesses across our city. And there is no question that the open space and the PARKLET program has been a lifeline for small businesses, for restaurants and for workers.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I also agree and understand that there are businesses and there are parklets or in some cases some of the parking lot programs that have been a nuisance. I think one was mentioned in particular that I have noticed as well that have been problematic.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There have there have been in some cases media issues. And also all of that is also true. And certainly I think everyone senses of the the the frustration of many members of community, particularly in Belmont Shore. So I think all of that is is is true.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'At the same time, I just want to make sure what I'm also hearing is I have heard an unconvincing argument that we have set up a system that's been accessible and successful for our small business owners to actually go through and apply for a permanent process.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Is it is it true that there are only two architectural firms that they can actually use? That's what I heard. That can't be true.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So Karl and I were just conversing. There's two firms that do a lot of this work and are advertising to clients that they could provide these services to them. What the city is looking for is that it's a license designed professional that you're working with a licensed architect and a licensed engineer.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There's hundreds of thousands of those available and we don't discriminate. There was one firm referenced in the public testimony, but there's no requirement from the city that the application be prepared by that firm.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So so so there's we've got a variety of architects and firms and other folks to go.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And Carl has a it's on our website, a guide, a parklet guide that we developed together a few.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Years ago that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Takes businesses.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Step by step through the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Application process. So we can always do better. But I think here at the staff table. To us that the process is pretty straightforward, but that process just may simply a permanent parklet may be inappropriate for many of the businesses that have a temporary one.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so so I appreciate that. And so let me can I ask also because on most issues, when it comes to business issues or planning or permitting issues, you know, you oftentimes hear from business owners who are having a hard time.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And that's that happens for whatever reason in this particular issue. It seems to be more overwhelmingly, at least what I hear from business folks. That is a very difficult process, even more so than other processes that we have in the city.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So that's where my concerns stem from. Can I ask you this question also on the because I agree with a lot of what Councilman Price said about just fairness and making sure that those that have shown interest have an actual opportunity to apply and go through a process.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think that's very fair. I think I hope that's where the council heads tonight. There are areas so and I'm just and I maybe and maybe the staff knows or doesn't know this just by those that have been permitted already, have determinations already been made that certain corridors cannot have any parklets.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well, Mr. Mayor, the the fact is, is that we are trying to discourage the installation of permanent parklets on any roadway where the speed limit is posted above 20 miles an hour at 25 miles an hour. Now, there are some exceptions on some corridors where maybe the speed limit is 30 miles an hour on a certain section'",
        "'speaker_8': '. And we can make accommodations depending on different engineering designs, ball boats and things like that to make that parklets safe for permanent installation. But for the most part, if it's not 25 miles an hour, we're not going to recommend a permanent parklet.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I, of course, operate. I'm not a traffic engineer. So I you know, I understand the safety rules that are set up for for for that. So, for example, because I don't on the top of my head know what streets are eligible or not.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So let's say I am on on Second Street over in Naples, Nico's you other restaurants and in the neighborhood we heard a couple a couple tonight. Are they eligible or are they just are we telling folks who are just not eligible for a parklet if it's if they're eligible or not?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'What we're telling businesses is that if they're on a roadway where this posted speed limit is, let's say, 45 miles an hour, there's not much you can do from a designs standpoint to make that permanent parklet safe. However, you mentioned Naples Island.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We are in the process of not only trying to lower the speed limit there, but Naples is very unique that that will call it eastbound roadways, very wide. There's a large parking zone, there's a large buffer and there's a large bike lane.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So there's a large distance between the travel lane and the curb line. So in Naples Island, it's a little unique. So even though it's posted 35 and we're in the process of trying to drop that speed limits of 30, we will be willing to entertain an application from one of those businesses on Naples Island.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So those those businesses would be considered. So if one of those businesses on the island was interested or showed interest, they would be put on this interest category.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes, that's.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Correct. And then how about for applicants for restaurants on Second Street in Beaumont? Sure.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The same thing has already taken place where they've notified us their interest. I have a list of 30 of them. And again, it's just interest only. Right. And that's the next step that allows them to take to the next step to determine, you know, is this feasible for them?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Are they committed to the process financially as well?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And then those those are those 30 that are on that list would be all eligible to continue their process if they would like to.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well, currently, there's about ten on this list that I have already looked at, investigated, and I've already deemed them not feasible for installation for various reasons.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. And then I'm assuming that if those that are not feasible for installation, we're letting them know right away.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That's correct. So if they make contact with us again with the permit team, we would immediately notify them, hey, this is the problem, this is the situation. We don't think you're feasible now. You can apply if you want to.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We're telling you right upfront it's not going to be an easy go.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. Because I think one of the things that's that's fair to the business owner also is that we're proactively honest with them. If it's not going to be feasible from a traffic perspective, from a safety perspective, I'm just hoping that we're being honest and telling them this is not going to work and that we're being that we're'",
        "'speaker_7': 'that at least is giving them the the information that we the best submission that we have at that moment.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That is our intention.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so so we haven't it's our intention or we haven't done that yet, or we're going to do that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We're going to do that. And when we take the next step and let's say ten of those businesses that have shown interest, let's say they come in to our permit technicians and they say we want to take the next step and put in our application, pay the initial fees and put their their design plans.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We're going to say, hey, you know, this may not be a good installation for X, Y, Z. This is why the traffic engineers already looked at this. I won't name the business, but there's some that are that have a very small frontage right on the side of a corner of a of a side street.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It's not going to work. It's unsafe.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So we I think my time is probably up to. But have we my last time finally have we at any point told any businesses yet that they are not going to be eligible? Or is that something that is in the next step?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We have not done that yet.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And that's probably part of the issue here, I imagine, is that there's a lot of uncertainty. Okay. I appreciate that. Come back to me. But let me go back to Councilman Price and we'll and we'll keep going.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. You hit on all the right questions. Let me just say. The information that you guys are sharing tonight. With all due respect, is not consistent with what was shared with the businesses. I have multiple emails here where they were told they couldn't apply because they're in the coastal zone.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We didn't have a process yet because they're in the coastal zone. It's there's all sorts of confusion. So and let me also make it very clear, if I didn't already. We're a city with a lot of diversity and a lot of diverse business corridors.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So if this is not an issue in other business corridors and people want to extend till March then and it's a different district or different business quarter, then that's fine. I'm just. My motion is based on the observations of the residents that came tonight and what I hear every single day.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I have said from day one that Belmont Shore is different because of the proximity to homes, because of the traffic volumes, because of the parking.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'With 52.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Parking spaces right now that are lost due to parklets. That's a huge impact in Belmont. Sure. And it's a huge impact for the Coastal Commission. This is a major priority for the Coastal Commission. And I think it's it's important for us to try to to shrink it down.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So. Right now, of the 30 that have expressed an interest, I believe about 17 of them are in the Belmont Shore corridor. And other than those 17, all the other ones that have not expressed an interest would go away automatically on June the 30th of the 17 or so that have already expressed an interest or any others'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that would express interest by June 20th. The public works department, through the traffic engineer, will notify them by June 30th whether or not they are feasible to move forward because we don't want them to spend any money if we're deeming them to be not feasible.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's not fair. They will have an opportunity to appeal that decision, as my understanding will go through that process. But. Is that correct, that they have an opportunity to appeal the word process or no?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I wouldn't say it's a formal appeal process, but they would have the opportunity to have a discussion with us to learn why it is it wouldn't be feasible.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And they might say to you, okay, what if I change the design here? What if I move it there?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Correct. And that's where we would rely on the design to show us what they're actually proposing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Got it. But I just want them to know by June 30th, if they're not feasible, they need to go away that that parklet needs to go away if it's deemed not feasible and you go through your process.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Ah.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I understand.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Sounds good. Okay. Perfect. And then this streamlining. I mean, I want to also make sure that everybody understands that we've got to have we cannot talk about being business friendly if we cannot offer a process that's easy to follow and expedited.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I already heard staff say it was going to be expedited. And I appreciate that. And I'm going to I realize this is a lot to put on staff. And look, we did the very best we could with open streets to try to accommodate some sort of outdoor dining option.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I know this is a burden on city staff, but extending the process even longer frustrates the businesses and certainly it's not fair to the residents. So if this has got to be high priority until August 1st to figure out how do we process these applications and what can we do?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. I think I think I'm good on the piece. I believe the OP's. The ones on private property. You know, I don't think they should. I think they should have to get the opportunity to apply for an extension.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I think the ones on public property should get the opportunity to apply as well and go through that process. But I do not believe under any circumstances they should be encroaching in front of another business. I just don't think that's fair.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So those are my thoughts. I'm not sure if I've given enough clarity with the motion, but really it's option B. But we're moving the timeline for public works to let businesses know that they're not feasible up to June 30th, so that if they're not feasible, that parklet is eliminated.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If they are feasible, then they're allowed to go through the application process, which is outlined under option B.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Was there a date by which they have to submit their interest?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'A June 20th.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'June 20th. Okay. So then four days from now, the ones that have submitted interest, we already have that. If there's anyone else, they have basically four days to put in an interest, not an application, but just I am interested.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then we will do that analysis between then and the 30th to say you either can move forward or not. And then after that, then they can apply and then stay through August. Then they have until August 1st to submit an application.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's what yes, that's what I'm thinking. As long as Public Works thinks they can comply with that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I'll ask the team, is that a feasible timeline?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes, that's reasonable.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And what we will do is our business liaison, at least in District three, will notify all of our District three businesses that have parklets of the June 20th expression of interest timeline. But I'm hoping public works and work can work with the council offices on the others.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. I hope all that comes from an Alan Mungo and then I'll queue up again.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Councilman Allen. Okay. Thank you, Mayor. You ask a bunch of good questions. I am really concerned about this process and about if it's been really fair to these businesses after hearing some of the answers, you know, not contacting them and letting them know immediately that they that they didn't qualify, I think is concerning.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I really would like for all of those folks to be notified as soon as possible. As a former business owner myself, there are these folks are busy and we want to make sure that we are friendly and make as fair as possible.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I do have one quick question and then I'll be done. But so the permanent process I know that you've for a parklets that we've had in place for many years. If that process is like this, where people go through a whole application process and they weren't they didn't qualify, I think that we have to look at that'",
        "'speaker_3': ', too. I don't know if this process is any different, but if that is the case, we have to I think we have to step back and reevaluate the process and make sure it's fair for these businesses. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilmember, if I may respond to that. The permanent process has been in place for many years, like you mentioned. And this additional this is an additional step we've added for the benefit of the businesses. We didn't do a feasibility response prior to this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You basically had to invest about $2,000 in plans and permits, and then we would look at your proposal. This additional step is to help businesses so they don't have to make that initial investment and could come to us and say, Hey, I'm interested and we can take a, you know, a quick look at it and say not'",
        "'speaker_2': 'probably feasible because it's 40 miles an hour or not probably feasible because there's a line of sight issue or you're likely feasible. So you might want to make the investment because we don't see any initial problems. So it is a new step.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It is intended to help the businesses and avoid them having to make an initial $2,000 investment.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Come on, man. Go.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. I want to first thank everyone for showing up today. Whether you're a resident who lives next to a business or in a corridor, you made an investment in our community. We appreciate that. Same to the businesses.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We know that it has been a tough go and taking a risk to become a business owner is a big expense and you're serving the community with the products and services that you provide, and that's important. I would like to say that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'While I appreciate the staff and all the efforts you're making, it would be nice if there was a clear understanding of if you email this person, you will get a response within 24 hours of your feasible. I don't know if that's possible.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I don't know if you want to announce an email address. I know that Councilman Price is offices. They will do that. I have significantly reduced number of copies in my district so I can just pick up the phone and call all of them.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But it's a lot more in the third district, so I appreciate anything that you're able to do to simplify it and keep it in writing, because one of the things that's hard for us as councilmembers is the interpretation of what you think you're saying.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And what they think they're hearing is not always congruent. And so we work really hard to make sure that it's in writing so that we as a council office can help step in and support and advocate for both the residents and the businesses.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, everyone, for your time.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. I just have a couple more questions. So back to this. The just the question of interest from from restaurants and business owners. So would we consider we have as a city, I believe, sent in response to some folks that were interested in applying for the program, that we're not taking current applications, particularly around coastal issues'",
        "'speaker_7': '. So someone that has sent that that inquiry and we responded and said that we're not taking applications. Would they would they so be considered some of the has interest. Or they've been removed from our interest category.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Mr. Mayor, I believe that the instance that you're referring to actually was an email sent back in November of 21 where the situation was a little bit different than it is now, as we're having this entire discussion figure out, figuring out what we're going to do to move forward.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You know, we we do address questions quickly, efficiently. And, you know, if we weren't kind of in this position where we have to not only do go through the permanent, permanent parklet process, but we also have to get a Coastal Commission approval, which adds another layer of complexity to all of this.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So so as a result of waiting for what the outcome of this meeting is, we've kind of put a pause on some of those permits that are moving forward because we wanted to make sure we're making strides in the right direction.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And answer the question. I think the answer is yes, we can consider them.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And then 1/2, please, sir. What I wanted to also say, though, is that because I'm look, I have emails as of like two months ago where we're telling business owners that we're not taking. An application process and that at this time we're not accepting applications for permanent parklets or sidewalk dining within the coastal zone.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so I just want to make sure that if we sent folks an email like that. Have they been removed off the interest list?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'No, they have not been removed from the list.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'They would still be considered on the interest. Yes. Okay. That's good. That's that's good to know. And so then what it sounds like to me is I also want make sure because a lot of a lot of businesses are not going to read the newspaper tomorrow or know that, you know, they have a few days to still'",
        "'speaker_7': 'show interest or what the timeline processes are we going to proactively reach out to the businesses that have parklets?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well, we're going to reach out to the businesses that we know have interest. They've shown interest, and we'll talk to them and let them know if they do want to continue with the process, what those steps would be.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And like I mentioned earlier, there is about four or five who already turned in plans. For whatever reason, they're incomplete.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we can get to the list of everyone who has it, because that's only going to capture people who already have interest. There may be some that have interest that have been discouraged or heard from someone else. So I'd like to get to everybody who has got a parklet and say you've got basically four days to email'",
        "'speaker_6': 'this email to say I have interest in continuing. Then we give them their answer ten days after that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That's great. And then I appreciate that. And then so. On. So if a restaurant has shown interest in the room or in the process, what is it that they have to do by August 1st, just so that I understand that as well, what is their requirement by August 1st.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Where they're going to need to contact an engineer, a designer, to help develop a plan, maybe even if it's a high level plan, at least some sort of a drawing that shows what they're proposing. And then we can go out and do an evaluation to determine if it's going to be safe.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Again, safety is my number one priority, and then we'll start the process to accumulate those businesses that need to go and get a Coastal Commission approval. And then we'll work together to walk through both of those steps, those processes.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And then at the same time, the city will begin the process of contacting those businesses who are not in compliance, that are that have safety.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Issues to fire them.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes, there are traffic concerns to begin the removal of those and that would start within the next sounds like week or two, correct?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes, that's correct.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. Thank you so much, Vice Mayor Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. So I've learned a whole lot about parklets. Many of the speeds up in up in my district are a little too fast. So we've done some curb extensions, we've done some sidewalk extensions and stuff to get some patio dining.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I've certainly learned a lot. I want to understand what we're voting on right now. So I think that will be important at the end. At the end of my comments, I want to first just acknowledge the person who said, hey, I know four or five of your districts don't have any, but imagine what it would be'",
        "'speaker_1': 'like if these were, you know, on your street. And that's what I can relate to because everyone understands what a nuisance is. I think that's something that's common and quality of life is something that we all care about.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I would I would also say that, you know, typically you defer to council members to know and understand their local the dynamics of the local communities. And I that's something I try to always respect, but I want to thank everybody who's actually come out and talked to all of the council members about this specific issue.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I would encourage, like I've heard from many of the residents in this room about this specific issue to help educate me about it, I would encourage the restaurant groups to do the same. If you expect us to understand your perspective, you have to meet with all of us, because otherwise I you know, I'm going to row'",
        "'speaker_1': 'with the residents. If I don't understand what those perspectives are, I'll tell you. Additionally, I encourage better communication between all the parties. Here I It seems like you're making good progress from where it's where it's heading. The Mayor This motion is heading there was a seems like a larger group and then now there's a smaller group and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'then on the 20th and hopefully this motion will clarify this, there's an even smaller group of feasibility. So that definition is is narrowing. I think that also I think the mayor raised some really good points about if he's unclear and we don't haven't seen it in writing about the process.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think it's on us because it's so important to both sides that we see this process in writing, particularly after today, and that is communicated to that universe in writing. So we're all operating with the same set of facts moving forward because there were two accounts on whether or not we stood up a process for them or'",
        "'speaker_1': 'whether we didn't. And whenever there's a question like that, we have to err on the side of we need to do better generally. And so those are my observations from this discussion.
