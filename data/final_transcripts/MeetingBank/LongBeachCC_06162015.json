        "'speaker_1': 'Report from City Manager Parks, Recreation and Marine. Recommendation to receive supporting documentation under the record. Conclude the public hearing and adopt a resolution amending the master fee and charges schedule by adopting a public sea wall. Mooring Lease Permit Fee.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's the first item.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Have to turn this over to staff.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Members of the City Council. I'll be handling the staff report for this item. So when the city was required to or when the city put together the Naples Seawall program, it was an investment in our public sea walls.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And we went to the Coastal Commission to gain approval. The Coastal Commission put a number of requirements on the project. One of them is to create a new lease program for the private use of public waterways in the city of Long Beach, specifically as it deals with the Naples area.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There are six phases of the Naples Improvement Project. What we're really going to be talking about tonight is a program that will be created as we improve those various areas of the Naples Sea walls, creating a new fee structure for compensating the public for use of that of that space by a private entity.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And it really is designed to only affect the areas of the sea walls where the city is investing and creating a new sea wall. So what you have in front of you tonight is a new proposed lease agreement, which is, in a sense, a fee and will be replacing the current fee that we have for that that'",
        "'speaker_6': 'users, private homeowners are currently paying for their docks. I want to talk a little bit about what that structure looks like, what the process was that we went through and give you an idea of what the magnitude is of this fee.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So as we went through to create this proposed lease program to adhere to the Coastal Commission's requirement, we use the following criteria. We want to make sure this program will only affect those properties where new public seawalls are installed.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We're designing this program so that the average user will pay approximately what they're currently paying. The new new lease program should generate at least the same amount of revenue as the current fees. We did a lot of surveys to look, to see, to make sure that the program is pricing is going to be competitive.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Looking at the neighbors in the Naples area, looking at public private, looking at city of Newport Beach, looking at other market conditions, and a program will generate revenue that will cover costs associated with operations, repair and maintenance. We've had three public meetings gone out and spoke to the community about this new fee program, an ad and explaining'",
        "'speaker_6': 'that the old fee is being replaced by this new fee. To give you a magnitude of what the fee will look like currently, the the average fee, we looked at five different properties to determine an average fee. That average fee is about $205 a year.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The new average fee, when we look at those five properties, three properties actually see a slight decrease. One sees a slight increase of about $8 and the other who had no boat before, which is now this is about a fee that is for the entire use of the dock rather than just a boat parking at a dock'",
        "'speaker_6': 'that sees an increase. And so with that, the new average will be about $215 as opposed to $205. So we believe that this is a very equitable arrangement. It's very similar to what we have today. And we'll be rolling out this lease program in as we do additional seawall investments unless otherwise directed by the Coastal Commission or'",
        "'speaker_6': 'by the Council. And with that, that I stand by to answer questions and we have our team here as well to answer more specific questions.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Councilmember Price.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. Well, first of all, thank you very much to your entire team. So Rachel Tanner and Eric Lopez. I consider us a team in this project. And for those who don't know, this team has been incredibly successful at facilitating a 1900 linear feet.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'More than 1900 linear feet. Redo of the public seawalls in Naples from the Revo Alto Canal, the from the Ravenna Bridge to the eastern portion of the Toledo Bridge. The project has been on schedule, on budget, and I go out there and do periodic site visits, and I'm incredibly impressed with how efficient that team has been.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So first and foremost, for such a huge project that is very unique in its components. These these seawalls are incredibly unique. We have nothing like them anywhere else in the city. They're unique to the state, in fact, and the manner that the seawalls were actually put into place, the whole instrumentation was unique and tried out for the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'first time here. And I expect that after we finish phase one, we'll do a little presentation for my colleagues and and the public in terms of what went into the installation of these seawalls, but is an incredibly impressive operation.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I want to thank the team for being there. And most importantly, I want to thank you for the outreach that you've done with the community. As as the staff knows, outreach is it's very, very important to me.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think sometimes the best ideas get lost in the mix if you don't have sufficient outreach with the public. So thank you. This dock item is one such example. So I just want to ask a few questions before we as we move through the the presentation tonight.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The first is and this is probably addressed to Mr. Modica. Is it accurate that the fees that were mandated by Coastal Commission only apply to the phase of the Seawall project that's just been completed?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So if I remember the Coastal Commission recommendation or the condition they asked for it to be for the area of improvement for the entire Naples seawall or at the very minimum, the Naples phase one. When we put this program together, staff is recommending to just begin with the areas where this where the work is actually being done'",
        "'speaker_6': '. So there's a nexus between the new program and the actual construction work being done. That certainly can change in the future with future phases, but that's how we're approaching it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And right now, as it stands today, the fees apply only to those who have who are utilizing the space in phase one.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's correct. You only get charged a fee and you and the new lease will occur when you reinstall your dock onto the public seawall. If you choose not to install the dock, there will be no fee.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Now, some have speculated, you know, what happens in the future. Could this be applied to other areas in Naples? That's not an issue that's within the city's control. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It actually could be a city council decision should you choose it. We are doing this upon a condition from the Coastal Commission, so that's really why we have to do this phase. We could certainly we're charging fees today.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This is a different way to compensate for for public use. And it may come to a point in the future where the Coastal Commission requires it and everything else. But right now we are we are choosing or at least the recommendation before you is to do this section.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. So the mandate that's requiring us to recalculate the fees is a mandate that came from Coastal Commission, which is a statewide entity and not the city of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That is correct.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. So in terms of future application or future mandates and in terms of other areas, that's certainly something that the city could look at. But if it were to be a Coastal Commission mandate, it would come from the Coastal Commission.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That is correct.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. And then in terms of the fees, we're talking here about a fee of an average of $215 a year, is that right?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes, that's correct.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Now, what about future fees? How how would the issue be assessed in the future in terms of lease renewals and what the fee will be in the future once the lease is up for renewal?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So this fee is going to be in our master fee and charges schedule. The way it will work is we will sign a five year lease with the property owner, which will define what the fee is, how it's calculated.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But the actual rate will be considered by the council as part of the master fee and charges schedule every single year. Our master fee and charges policy from the Council is that we apply a CPI increase. So there is some when they sign the lease, they'll know what the fee is in that year and it will be'",
        "'speaker_6': 'subject to review in the future by the council, you know, should they choose to increase it or modify it in some way.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Is it fair to assume, though, that our process for determining whether or not there will be a fee increase will be the same process we use for fee increases throughout the city, for other uses of fees such as fees for the marina, etc..'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Absolutely would be the same process and frankly, it's very similar to the process that has been in effect for for 15, 20 years. As we assess the current fee, that is also a fee that is reviewed by the Council as part of the master fees and schedule master.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If he's in charge of schedule every single year.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then in terms of the lease renewal, is there going to be anything unusual about the terms of the lease or requirements for the lease renewal or anything that people should be on notice on now in anticipation of the lease renewal?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Or do we expect that the lease would be renewal barring anything unforeseen?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I believe it's the latter. It's there's a number of conditions that, you know, if that were determined to be where you were in violation of your lease, if you're operating in an unsafe manner for example and if we need to Alveda Helen and can explain what those are.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But barring that we've actually attached a sample copy of the lease in the agenda item today that's very similar to what we'll be asking everyone, one to sign and they'll see the agreement before they sign it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. I know that I personally would not want to be dealing with Alveda on a violation of any because she means business. She's very nice, but she means business and I appreciate that consistency in business. So anyway, thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I have no additional questions. Thank you, Mr. Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And one thing I'd like to point out, Councilmember, if I may, part of what was requested is that we go out and do three different community meetings and talk about it and the feedback we heard the most. Once they understood what the fee was, was to include something in the lease to help tell future homeowners that there'",
        "'speaker_6': 'are restrictions on the size of the boat. And we thought that that was a very good suggestion. And that's been incorporated into the leases that they know where to look for, that there is a restriction on the size of the boats that can be docked and can be safely navigated through the channels.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So that's been included.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. LOWENTHAL Do you have any comment? Okay. We have a motion any second on the first part of the motions or any public comment for this part of the motion hearing. CNN members, please go out and cast your votes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Seven votes. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And I'll hopefully take a motion for the second part of the vote. Okay. There's a motion any second. Is there any public comment on the second part of the hearing? CNN. Please cast your votes.'"

These are projects that are along the beaches area and they're primarily funded through oil revenue.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'At the time of the budget adoption, oil was slightly below $100 a barrel and the and the projections were really based on $100 a barrel. As we know, the price of oil has dropped significantly due to global events over the last several months.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'So thank you, Vice Mayor. I do want, just for clarification, the $400,000 that was that was going to be coming from the Marina Vista bathroom. Just to be clear, we have two bathrooms in Marina Vista Park that we're hoping to have rebuilt.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This one is actually two and which is closest to Marine Stadium, which is actually in the path of what where the open channel would go. So this is probably a bathroom that we wouldn't rebuild, at least not its current location anyway.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And it's my understanding that staff has agreed to take the remaining 230 something thousand that was allocated for this project and move that over to M.V. one, which is the bathroom that's in Marina Vista Park, to either create two separate bathrooms or a larger bathroom in order to be able to service our residents in a way that's'",
        "'speaker_5': 'consistent with the open channel plan. Is that staff's understanding as well?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes, that's.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Correct. Thank you. I do have a couple of questions and and some points I want to make. I want to start with the pool and I want to be you know, I know there's going to be here. There's going to be people here to make public comment.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I'm really looking forward to hearing their their comments. And I want to just in advance take a moment to thank Lucie Johnson, who's a resident of the Fifth and really a champion for the pool. She's really been, you know, fighting the battle for the pool.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And there have been times when Lucy and I have gotten into it on things. And, you know, she says it like it is. And we we we hammer it out and sometimes we agree to disagree. But there are some really great points that she's raised, and there are a few things that I just want to make clear'",
        "'speaker_5': 'as we go forward, because I think I want the record to be crystal clear on this when this comes up in community meetings and conversations. Mr.. MODICA Even if we had the $103 million for the pool right now, is there any part of the project that we could start that we are not already engaged in?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'No. We have still need to go through a number of steps before we can begin actual construction. We are currently in the design process working on conceptual and schematic design. We do need to release an environmental impact report and let everybody see what that design does in terms of the environmental impact.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We need to go through the entitlement process at a city level. We need to go through the Coastal Commission entitlement process. And so even if we had, as you said, for funding, we would not be ready to start today or have facilities in the ground for, I'm estimating here about 18 months to two years at the very'",
        "'speaker_6': 'least, if we were to go incredibly quickly with that process.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Now with money in hand, could we phase this project in any way other than it's currently phase, such as, for example, we're going through the design process now. Beyond that, is there any phasing of this project that could occur if we had the money in hand today?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we've looked at that and to see is are there segments of the pool that could be phase because we've done that with other projects. The Alamitos Bay Marina, for example, we've done in several phases because it's such a large project.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The difference there is that that has discrete sections that you can isolate from all the other sections so that you can repair those work on that section, and when the money is exhausted, you can stop work and then go on to the next one.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The pool that we are envisioning is trying to fit in a very tight space so that we're being cognizant of the the residents and of the cost. And we really do not see an ability to be able to phase the pool without having to shut down access to the bodies of water.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And we really want to keep bodies of water available to the public. And so we don't see an opportunity for phasing on this project.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Even if we were just, hypothetically speaking, able to phase this project, it still could not begin until we receive the necessary approvals and we're looking at 18 months on an accelerated pace.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes, the 18 months is hard to estimate because the Coastal Commission can take some time and that's a very unpredictable year. But yes, that's correct. Roughly with, you know, give or take six months.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. So, I mean, what what I want to make clear is that the pool is a major priority for this council. I know it's a major priority for Vice Mayor Lowenthal, because during our discussions, we have decided to allocate $43 million to the pool, which is more than half of the available moneys we have in the Tidelands'",
        "'speaker_5': 'budget. So the pool is definitely a high priority, but we do have a $43 million gap to get the pool to the place where it's fully funded, correct?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes, we have in total $60.1 million set aside with 43 left to be funded.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So if we were to hear in the community, people say, you know, if you if you had the money, if you funded the pool today, we could start the pool sooner. That actually is just a factually inaccurate statement because we can't start the pool any sooner.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's not about having the money in hand. It's a process that we have to go through. Was that an accurate statement?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes, that's correct.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. So in regards to the pool, you know, there have been some suggestions in regards to moving around some of the. The $43 million has already been allocated to the pool. The remaining money from the 95 million, some have said, well, could you allocate another million or 2 million or 3 million to the pool?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And looking at some of our projects, you know, one a 1 to $3 million range can fund a lot of our smaller projects because we have projects that need to be funded as low as in the mid 100,000 range to a half a million dollar range is where most of our projects seem to be.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm looking at the list. Does that sound about right?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes. And that was one of the prioritization criteria is to try to get a balance of projects, realizing that all of the money could go to one or two projects and wait until you're ready to actually do them.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But at the same time, you're losing opportunity to do some very, very needed and critical projects that are smaller dollar amount and important to the stakeholders as well.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And did staff take that all into consideration with the recommendations in the list that have been provided?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes, we did.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I want to talk a little bit about Bluff Park lighting that doesn't appear on the projects that have been funded or the projects that are outlined in Attachment D in terms of projects that were previously funded. Where does the Bluff part of Bluff Park Lighting Project stand today?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we have a third list that's not included in this packet, but it's actually a very important part of our process, and it's called the Master Needs List. The Tidelands Master needs, it varies. We add projects to that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That really is our our list of projects that we know are important that don't yet have funding. That list ranges from 200 to $300 million. So it is a large list. Attachment D is really a smaller subset showing to help the Council understand what was previously funded as a priority over the last five years that now no'",
        "'speaker_6': 'longer is able to be funded with. When you take $232 million and apply $94 million worth of need. So the Bluff Lighting Project is still very much a project that's on our radar screen. It's on our master needs list.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It will be eligible for funding if it determines that that's a high priority when we go through the next prioritization process. It won't just be attachment RD to look at. We can look at any project on the master needs list.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's a priority.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Great. Thank you. And then I want to talk ask you a little bit about Leeway Sailing Center. Can you let us know what the staff's plan is in light of our current budget, in terms of the Leeway Sailing Center, including the parking lot and the pier?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So Leeway Selling Center is definitely an important project. It was designed to be to have a number of different components funded. It is one. It has a very degraded parking lot. For example, anyone who's parked down there knows or you know, that's a very big need.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We also have the pier and the and the dock, which are in severe disrepair and need to be upgraded. And then there's the building itself. And so under our recommendation, we are trying to look at what needs to be done and what can be done with the funding resources.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And at the same time, we've had a request, request from both Parks and Rec and from some of the user groups to reevaluate the design a little. We've we've got the process and the project entitled and it's and it's available and it's ready to go forward if the funding were there.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But there's been some requests on how can we maybe tweak that design. So what we're recommending is to fund the parking lot improvements. I believe that's approximately $600,000. We would also it's 505, 95, 500. We would then also prioritize the.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The docking gangway, which would dock gangway and actually put aside about $417,000 for the classroom building rehabilitation at about $2.4 million. And then we would have the remaining actual real rebuild of the entire classroom on the list that would be funded at a future date.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Once we've worked through some of those design issues.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. I want to thank staff for your great work, especially Eric Lopez, who is our lead on Thailand's projects for the great work that you do and for your partnership. And of course, Rachel and Tom are always there to assist our staff with any issues we have with Thailand.'",

She and I have worked very closely on these projects for several months, the project lists, I should say, and and I want to thank her for her great regard for the projects up and down the Tidelands.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'You know, honestly, you know, for me, the pool is like number one, because it benefits the entire city and all aspects. People come to the beach, they swim their swim, water polo, you know, all the teams and clubs that work out there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I also listen to Mr. Modica and I see where we could probably juggle some of these other smaller projects with the money that's set aside and then come back and revisit the pool and make that a number one project.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Again, as the funds come, as we get closer to the environmental reports and all the other cost commission reviews and all that. So. Well, I'd like to say, you know, keep the pool number one and, you know, benefit the entire city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think we should also address the smaller projects throughout the city and the tidelands areas and then just reevaluate as funds come and we see what the cost of oil is doing, you know, across the markets, you know, and I know that's the big driver on that.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'I've been with the Friends of Colorado Lagoon for over 15 years. We started as a group of concerned citizens going to County, L.A. County, Terminal Avenue, drain public meetings, addressed our concerns to them, ask for a special meeting and felt snubbed by the county, ignored and ended up taking the county to court to protest their approval of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'their mitigated negative declaration. We prevailed in court and forced the county to adopt a to redo the air and to reroute the terminal, having to drain to restore the Colorado lagoon. 95% of the wetlands or more in Long Beach have been devastated by the construction and building.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And this is one of the very significant efforts in our in our city to actually do restorations of critical wetlands. I'm proud to say that we went from a competitive orientation with the can with the county and the city at that time, to moving toward a collaborative orientation with great help from Congressman Lowenthal, who was the Assembly'",
        "'speaker_2': 'member and Senate member from Amy Bodak. Eric Lopez, our assistant Tom said, Assistant City Manager Tom Modica And we're very appreciative of the support that we had from the council and especially Councilmember Price at this point. We want to we were instrumental in bringing in to the city over $15 million to do restoration of the Colorado Lagoon'",
        "'speaker_2': '. We've diverted the storm flow waters that pollute the lagoon and they're now being treated in the cities that contaminated storm flow waters that produce. We've dredged out 80 million cubic 80,000 cubic yards of contaminated sediment. All of that money was brought in by grants from outside of the city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we're delighted that the city is now allocating tidelands funds to continue that restoration. And we strongly appreciate your and support the direction you're going. Actually are happy to give up 400,000 for restroom movement to support the the the aquarium of the Pacific which is very important.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But we strongly support this and advocate that you move forward not only with the restoration within the lagoon, but with the open channel as well. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, sir. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'My name is Christine Rycroft on the current president of the Friends of Colorado Lagoon. And again, to reiterate a little bit of Ray said, we're very appreciative of funds for the Colorado Lagoon Project moving forward in all aspects of it, to continue on the different phases and to look forward towards what an open waterway will look like'",
        "'speaker_4': '. Because part of what we have there is a resource where all communities can come and use the lagoon. It's one of the few wetlands where people can access it, both in terms of educational programing and actually swimming within the lagoon.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that offers.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The sort of unique ecosystem.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And community resource that we are happy to see the city of Long Beach get behind. And we also just wanted to emphasize that putting money towards this sort of project is really funding.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'A unique.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Setting as all over California, as well as the nation are looking at what cities do with their natural resources. And in funding the Colorado Lagoon Project, the city of Long Beach has the opportunity to be that sort of leader.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So with all of the.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Resources, time, support, staff.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Time and the outside funding that the lagoon has gotten, it's essential that these two and. The faces of restoration go forward to make sure that that progress continues, because without them, the lagoon doesn't remain the healthy, vibrant ecosystem that it is now.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we wanted to thank you for the ongoing relationship between the Friends of Colorado Lagoon and the city and then acknowledge the support of the funding that will make sure this project is successful at such a timely and critical point.'",

I was at the City Council meeting in February of 2013, right after the pool was closed where there was a vote saying, we are going to rebuild the pool, we are going to put in diving, we are going to put in really everything that everybody wanted and that it was going to be a'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Yes, the pool has been knocked down. That took a year. We're talking now about having to have the environmental impact. It just feels as though in the last two years that very little has been done other than demolishing the pool and having design after design after design.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The kids that currently use that need the use of the pool are just continuing to grow and grow. And by the time this pool is built, it seems as though my daughter is going to be graduated from college.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Ma'am, just want to make sure I just clarify something. Thank you so much. The kids and I are very excited about the pool. I just want to make sure that, you know that a lot of the process, the pool is a priority.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'But I just would like to say that we as divers, we really need this pool, because right now we're at the Martin Luther King Junior Pool, and it's a very limiting area because there are not very many diving boards and there are no platforms at all.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we continually have to go to other pools to practice those platform dives. So I'm just trying to say that we would really hope to get this pool and hope that you guys consider that the pool is really important to all of the divers in the diving community.'",

There are two years older than me, and I honestly think I have a better chance to see the pool than they will ever.'",

As far as the bike path, what I would also consider bike path and pedestrian walkway, because a day doesn't go by that I see a family with baby strollers walking down Shoreline Drive because they don't want to navigate the stairs.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'You wanted to. Oh, I think. Oh, she's still here. I just wanted to make a comment regarding the the process and where it's been. I know it seems like nothing's happened, but we work on this. Regularly in June of 2014.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There was a pool study session held right here in council chambers, and at that time the community came out and strongly advocated for a stakeholder committee so that the programmatic elements of the pool could reflect the swim and diving community in the city of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'As a result of that, a stakeholder committee was formed, took a while to come up with the names of those folks. They met several times. They went through a very democratic process of voting on the programmatic elements. And I'm happy to report that after the stakeholder committee met.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Diving was recommended as a programmatic element of the pool, which it had not been previous to the stakeholder committee meeting. So even though it seems like nothing has happened, that process took several months. A lot of negotiation, a lot of discussion, a lot of back and forth, a lot of very emotional people feeling one way or the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'other that they wanted more for swim and some wanted more for water polo and some wanted more for diving. And the swimming community really came together to have a soft landing in terms of what their recommendations were going to be.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And as a result of that process, which took many, many months, the programmatic design of the pool was created. So I know it seems like nothing is happening, and I know it's frustrating to to walk by there and not see it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'My kids swim as well and they swim in the temporary pool. And so we're aware this is absolutely a priority for us. And, you know, what our options could be right now is let's say we just said we've got $95 million in our Tidelands Fund and we need 103 million to build the pool.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So let's just say hypothetically that I made a motion tonight to allocate all $95 million to the pool, which I'm not going to do. But let's just say I did that. We would still be short and we wouldn't have enough money to build a pool that we won't be permitted to start any work on for 18 months'",
        "'speaker_5': '. So we would sit here as a council with $95 million tied up for 18 months, not being able to do anything on the pool. Let's say in the alternative that we said, let's move a few, you know, let's not do the stairs and the bathrooms and the concession stands and all this stuff.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Not that we're going to do that. I'm just saying hypothetically and we cobble up another, let's say, $3 million and we say, you know what, instead of $43 million, we're going to allocate $46 million to the pool. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That closes the gap very minimally. It doesn't really get us that much closer to a pool. And now we've got six or seven projects that aren't funded and we still can't start the pool for 18 months. What I would rather see is we should share with the community that the pool remains a high priority and that it's'",
        "'speaker_5': 'getting more than half of the available money that we have, and that when more tidelands money comes in, we're able to give a significant amount of money to the pool to help close that $43 million gap. We're not going to close that gap with a million here or two millions there.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We're going to close that gap with a substantial amount of money allocated to the pool, which I think is a priority for this council. We're moving to get there. When the pool project came before and I know somebody referenced something that happened two years ago, oil was trading at a much higher dollar amount at that time.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Times have changed and our financial circumstances change. So we are doing our very best to communicate that it's a priority. But we are residents together. This is our city and we have to adjust to the change in Financial Times together with an attitude that's very collective and collaborative.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You know, we can't build the pool today, so what other projects can we do and still make the pool a priority? And I hope that on some level, pool advocates understand that because it's in my district, it's a city wide asset and it's absolutely a priority to me, as are all the projects on Thailand's that we've been'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. There is a motion in a second. We've done more public comment. Okay. We closed public comment on this item. You're for 16, not for 15. Correct. Okay. Come forward. We have to do a public comment at once.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Typically so. Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you very much for letting us have a chance to talk to you about this. My name is Sanford Simmons and we own some property in Long Beach. And I believe I've been owning property here for about 45, 50 years.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we always comply with inspectors. Inspectors come by and he says, a little paint chip over here and there's a screen here that's got a little crack in it and this and that. Or if a tenant doesn't want to pay their rent, they call the city and complain.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we take care of all the issues and meet with the inspector. I think we already have enough rules on the books. I don't know what the problem is. Do you have another problem here? That there's somebody here is not the landlords aren't doing what they're supposed to do.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There's not enough already things on the books to enforce it. What is this going on? And then I read a little bit here, there that you guys want. Whoever you guys are, want to have the tenant put the money into it like an escrow account where the tenant has control, you know, or whatever.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The city has control. The landlord doesn't have the money to do what they have to do to do to pay their bills. Something's wrong here. I was over in India and over in India. The buildings are all rundown and dilapidated.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Why? They have what's called rent control there. Yes, they have rent control there and the landlord doesn't have any money to do anything. The people inside the very well because we have a very low rent. I don't want to see this city going to rent control.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hi, my name is Matthew Simmons, and I just wanted to reiterate the comments that were just made. It's I think we do have enough rules on the books and it's just a matter of enforcing what we have. I think it's a very slippery slope as soon as you know, soon as it just seems that the momentum and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'a lot of property owners and are concerned that Long Beach is moving in the direction of rent control. And this is not.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The last stop. This is the first stop.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And and I just feel that if we continue in this direction, it actually we're going to have the opposite effect. We're going to have unintended consequences. And I know the intentions are good, but ultimately, if landlords are if the funds are kept from the landlords, ultimately they're not going to have the ability to to make the property'",
        "'speaker_3': 'nicer. In fact, I just had some tenants who are in a property that who lived there before purchased the property and and there are gang members. There were I was getting calls from employers saying you need to, you know, get rid of these tenants.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I was able to give them a 30 day notice or actually a 60 day notice. And and they moved along their way. And if there's if landlords do not have the same rights over their property to do what they need to do to help people move on, if they're not treating the property nicely, then it's going'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to have the opposite effect. So just want to I think it's in everybody's best interest to keep, you know, property is a is a fundamental right and and I and it makes sense for landlords to keep their properties nice because they earn more money.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So the slumlords, you know, nobody's for them. And, and, and I think we have the laws in place to have them move along their way. But I also feel that 90% or 99% of the people who will be affected by this are not the slumlords.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's everybody who's trying to do a good job trying to provide nice housing to the community. And I think those are the people who will be adversely affected. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Your next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening, mayor and council members. I wasn't planning on speaking tonight, but I did want to reiterate that on behalf of the Apartment Association.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's a pleasure for us to work with.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You, Mayor, and the council members meeting with you and having an open dialog. We're very supportive of the ordinance, were supportive of future endeavors where we can collaborate together with housing Long Beach if the opportunity arises and Josh and everybody else can get along with me and everybody else in the apartment association side.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I think the open dialog that we've at least initiated is a first start. I want to commend Councilwoman Lina Gonzales for adding the motions that she did. I think strengthen the ordinance is very important. The apartment association's behind that 100%.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We don't want to have slumlords in our city. I don't think anybody else does either. So I appreciate what you all are doing and concur that we move his audience forward tonight. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Josh Butler, executive director of housing Long Beach. And in a rare moment here, I'm going to just concur with Mr. Murchison and say that we look forward to working with him and the apartment association as well, and thank the council for strengthening this ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think we have work to do, but this is a really good start and thank you all very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That is a very rare moment, but I like these moments. Okay. I'm going to go back to Councilman Gonzales and we're going to go for a vote. Public speaking is closed. Councilman Gonzales.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I just want to clarify where this is, proactive rental housing inspection. And so I know we took up discussing rent escrow. So city staff. Real quick, just to clarify, can you go over that just a bit as to just real quickly as to what we're doing now versus what was mentioned with.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Few Councils Council meetings back.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we provided an.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Analysis of a program and what.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Other cities do in terms.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Of proactive code enforcement. And it was our conclusion that most cities in the state of California, with the exception of Los Angeles, rely on the proactive rental housing inspection programs to resolve the majority of their issues. We did do a cost analysis of the cost of a rent escrow account, and staff felt that it was very prohibitive'",
        "'speaker_4': '. We presented to the City Council just the proactive rental housing inspection program to codify our existing requirements under state law and then actually to augment those state requirements with local mandates that you, as the City Council directed us and approved a couple of weeks ago.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Do you want to go into more of this?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. And I just want to clarify, you know, this ordinance that we're taking up as its first hearing is a proactive, proactive rental housing inspection. And so the added amendments will be for the worst of the worst landlords.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think we can all agree here, we don't want slumlords in our in our city. And so both the apartment association housing Long Beach many other on the renter side on the property owners side we all want the same thing and I'll continue reiterating that is that these protections are after, I should say these amendments are'",
        "'speaker_1': 'for the worst of the worst. And so I just need to say that once again so we can really understand that. So thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes, ma'am. You are correct. As I said, this codifies state law. But but locally we are adding to the basic standards under state law to reflect the local needs. And so we do believe it goes far beyond what state law requires.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You're correct.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Andrews.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes, thank you. I'm here. I also like to echo that sentiments with that councilwoman. But also, Mr. Murchison, I really want to thank you for working with us and your organization, because we know that the percentage of the slumlords are very, very, you know, few because we have so many other, you know, land owners, you know, and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'they they are working to make sure that we live in a safe and clean environment. And I really want to applaud every one of you, you know, home owners, land owners, to let people know that they do have that right.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And this is why I think that you do such a good job. But those ones, you really have that compassion for the ones who stand in your on your property. Thank you, all of you, again, for working with us.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. We have a motion and a second. Please cast your votes.'",
