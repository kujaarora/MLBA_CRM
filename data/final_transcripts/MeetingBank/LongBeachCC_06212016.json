        "'speaker_1': 'Would you just take a seat in the front and then I'll call you back up?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Vice Mayor Council Members. As mandated by the State of California, we continue to work to dispose of our former redevelopment agency properties through our successor agency. We have one of the final projects in the pipeline is going to be for you tonight in the downtown.'",

The property is former redevelopment property and is categorized as future development of the city's long range property management plan that was'",
        "'speaker_5': 'approved by the state in March of 2015. Future development properties are disposed through a request for proposals process with a selection based on best value to the city rather than the highest purchase price. An RFP was issued and four proposals were received.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'A selection panel consisting of representatives from the Departments of Development, Services and Economic and Property Development and the city's real estate and economics consultant Kaiser Master reviewed the four proposals. While all proposals provided excellent opportunity for the city, the panel unanimously selected Raintree Evergreen as its preferred proposer to recommend to City Council.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Raintree proposes to develop modern luxury apartments with co-working, flexible space, retail space and an outdoor public plaza, creating a high degree of activity on the street level and providing residents with a place to live, workshop and connect. The proposal offered the highest price for the property and the highest estimated development cost and the highest density.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Raintree has also agreed to provide ten parking spaces for exclusive use by the adjoining psychic temple. On May 24th, City Council authorize the sale of property located at Broadway in the Promenade to Raintree Evergreen for a similar high density mixed use development.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'If City Council approves this item tonight, this would be the second property to be developed by Raintree in the downtown. Raintree submitted proposals for both Broadway properties and the Promenade and at Long Beach Boulevard. And their concept was to offer a cohesive and synergistic project, creating a dual campus like setting conducive to the downtown.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Staff believes that this co-branding approach has merit and the proposed development offers the best value to the city. Purchase and Sale Agreement has been prepared with certain entitlement and development performance milestones that are detailed in the staff report.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It is anticipated that entitlement required 12 months with the close of escrow, not later than 18 months, and construction is anticipated to take up to 24 months to complete. As these timelines are, estimates staff request some flexibility for unanticipated delays.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It is also important to state for the record, that council's action this evening is for the sale of property and does not approve a development on the site and without staff requests that City Council adopt specifications number of Pep 16 Dash 004 for the purchase and development of property located at the southwest corner of Broadway and Long'",

        "'speaker_0': 'High Long Beach transportation and parking solution, which is also called Tips objects to this project on the basis that the city has failed to conduct any environmental review for the project under secret. The city claims that the project is exempt from secret because it has a Class 12 exemption for the project which pertains to the sale of'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the surplus property. However, the project is not so narrowly defined. The staff report prepared. The city prepared by the city specifically states that the project includes the development of modern luxury apartments work, work, flexible space, electric vehicle charging station space and electric vehicle charging stations and retail space.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The project is not simply the sale of surplus property and therefore the Class 12 exemption does not apply. The city must conduct a secure review at the earliest possible opportunity and deferring seek review until after the purchase and sale agreement has been approved would amount to piece mealing which is prohibited under section.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Further, even if the 12th class 12th exemption were applicable, there are unusual circumstances here that render it unavailable. Namely, the project is not simply the sale of surplus property, but the proposal to build a large, multi-purpose building as described in the separate staff report.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This is not a simple real estate transaction, which is what the Class 12 exemption was designed for. There are numerous environment issues that must be considered. TAPS is particularly concerned that the environmental impacts that derive from loss of parking, from the loss of public parking due to the creation of new density with inadequate parking.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'As you know, downtown Long Beach is already severely impaired. With parking impaired, and this will exacerbate the problem by resulting in traffic and air pollution. We urge you to conduct a square review now and reject the proposed purchase and sale agreement.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Wonderful. Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Warren Lisowski. Oh, excuse me, second district resident. Just to follow up on what the previous speaker was saying, maybe to break it down a little more simple terms. We all know the council is not going to respond to any type of public input or commentary.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We can pretty much predict this will be a eight to nothing unanimous vote per the staff's recommendation. That's pretty typical around here.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But what the.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Previous speaker was saying was that city of Long Beach and their staff reports there's a law called Secure. It's a California Environmental Quality Act. And what the city has been doing as they've been disposing of these former redevelopment agencies properties is using what's called categorical exemptions.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Now, if you go ahead and look at Sequoia's website and do any research on the law, you'll find out that each of the exemptions has exemptions to them. And so the city is using their staff reports, signing one page exemptions and pushing them through to sell these properties.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There's some problems with the way they're doing it. Just to follow up on what Debbie was saying about the project, it's interesting how Mike Conway will say that we are only approving the sale of the property, not the project being developed on it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, sir, if you're not if you're not approving the project, why is there pictures of the project in the sale contract? I mean, it's pretty obvious that you guys have already approved this or are going to approve this high density project near the promenade.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The same developer has another high density project on the promenade, and whether it's parking or quality of life, by designating these properties surplus, the council would like to use the Class 12 exemption. And so we were long wondered why the council was using designating these properties as.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'As surplus property. And now the answer is because they want to use the the Class 12 exemption. As W was saying, there's problems with the Class 12 exemption and there are also exemptions to the exemptions. So we're going to go ahead and file a lawsuit against this property as well.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And when you go ahead and post the sequel exemption category exemption tomorrow, we can go ahead down to the recorder's office, take a picture of it, and we'll be filing another lawsuit against this development as well. The way that the city of Long Beach is disposing of the RDA properties is unfair to both the taxpayers.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's a noncompetitive bidding system. Just saying that you've got 3200 people looked at the RFP and four bids were put in on it. There's something wrong with the way the city of Long Beach is selling these properties and you've you'd like to quickly just kind of brush them under the rug with one page categorical exemptions.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But we're going to bring a little light to this and we're going to use the power of the courts to do so. So I'm sure you guys don't have any questions or don't want to address this now and go ahead and enjoy your vote and we'll just settle in court.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thanks so much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So, Mr. Conway, I'll ask you a few questions. But just to remind members of the audience that have followed this council for perhaps the last several years, nearly a decade, we spent about five, six, almost seven years on updating the downtown plan and in doing so conducted an ER as part of it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so the density that is approved for the downtown might not have been what certainly it was ten years ago, but that is why the downtown plan was updated. All the projects that have come before us for the second District comport with what that plan provides, and that process involved a tremendous amount of community outreach and for'",
        "'speaker_1': 'those that were not able to participate or chose not to. It is unfortunate, but it is a disrespect to those individuals who spent countless hours with this city for several years participating in updating the downtown plan. And I value that and cherish that and thank them for their time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Therefore, I am very confident in the way that we are approaching our disposition of surplus funds. If we were to follow what the State had advised us to do when redevelopment was disbanded, we would be putting up all our properties for fire sale.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So what would then happen is it would go to the highest bidder, not necessarily what is in the best interest of community development or what is in the best interest of an actual plan for an area. So I'm not only thankful for the process that we are approaching, but I am actually very proud of it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mr. Conway, would you share with us about the er confusion that the members of the audience may have?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'd be happy to give that a try. Vice Mayor Again, what council is doing this evening is selecting a developer, essentially a purchaser of property. You're not approving a project. There are concepts by which the panel made a decision on whom to select to purchase the property.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The concepts as presented in staff's estimate estimation is consistent with the downtown plan, but that is something that would be determined through the secret process once an actual development proposal is submitted to the city for review. And when that occurs, they'll be a full scale review consistent with square guidelines and hopefully consistent with the downtown plan.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. There's been a motion and a second, and I want to thank you, Mr. Good. Here. Please come forward.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Very good. You. Clarke has the address. Noticeably absent at this? Of course. Is a review and position by our city auditor on his very face. If you have nothing to hide. It seems to me that on any piece of property that we're dealing with, the city auditor should be entitled to weigh in.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And perhaps the biggest piece of evidence of why this should not go forward is contained and codified well set forth in the new business section. Item 37, which goes to the issue of how woefully inadequate trained is our city staff on such matters.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I call your attention to item 37, where it says the city essentially is needing developing a training program for project managers, both employees and consultants for managing projects, preparing scope of work, reviewing the proposals, develop a training program on contract administration best practices, establish policies, procedures for overseeing, overseeing standardized city contracts.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Developing a policy to ensure our project managers are certified and certifications are current. What you're saying here and somebody is to be certainly given credit for recognizing how woefully inadequate the city staff is, as many people have pointed out over the past years.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's one of the reasons we're in the process and in the situation we find ourselves now. So I would suggest that the very first thing is request a review from the city auditor unless you have something to hide.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'If you don't have something to hide, then you should step. You should request the report from the auditor. She has nothing to gain, nothing to lose. And she has. She's biased. Would bring a bias unbiased review and I think combined with item the idea implicit in 37.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Any reason community of mind would find the issue before you today is one that you're ill prepared. To move forward on an intelligent basis. Yes, you could move forward using the disease. And in the end, it is thinking.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But if that is what you want as your legacy, I think the voters need to know that. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Goodyear. And I'd like to thank the staff for the work that they've done on putting this report together as well as the item for tonight. And I know Mr. Ruddock is not here but has spent a tremendous amount of time on redevelop this year.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sorry. That's not where you normally sit. We have our assigned seating. She has spent probably. 14 years. 13 years on making sure that the promenade is reintroduced to this city. As a splendid piece of development, but really more of a neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think we look at certain projects as just development, but what we've done is created a neighborhood and the promenade today. For those of us who have lived here, at least since the nineties, looks far different from what it was in the nineties.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I want to thank the staff for that. BLOCK by block, piece by piece, there is a cohesion to that space that isn't just retail and it isn't just residential, but it's truly mixed use with the walkability that a promenade should be.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'A lot of areas around the country are referred to as the promenade, but very few allow us that walkability among a. Set of retail options and neighborhood options. And so this is the last parcel to complete that Promenade project, and I'm very pleased with it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I want to look at the staff that's here today and also speak to those that are not here. Thank you for your commitment to redeveloping the promenade. It didn't take one or two years. It took over ten years.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I want to thank you for that. With that colleagues, I am very much in support of moving forward with this item today. Members cast your vote.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'So in its current form, I would say no. But if the if if there is a, you know, if councilman woman price and it's not as important to me to to right now do a substitute motion. I want to respect the intent of Councilwoman Price.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But if she were to, you know, make her motion more about finding information, stand alone, about the measure that the voters have voted on, the voters have signed a petition for. That's something I considered tonight.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilmember Urunga.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Senator. I can't agree with both. Arguments at this present time, and I'll tell you why. We've we've gone through this. We've gone through this since my wife was on the city council. We got through this last year.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We've argued it all. We got reports. I don't know how much staff time we've spent already on building an initiative or getting the task force together. We had people from the community participate in those task force, albeit it didn't go as smoothly as it would should have.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But it it did its job and it came back with recommendations. The proposal that was put here that that the councilwoman is putting forward. We went through that discussion. We talked about it. We did the analysis. We even talked about some of those issues that she's bringing up now in terms of further reporting and further further study'",
        "'speaker_7': '. We've done that already. I don't think that we need to go any further in regards to getting more information on this. I think the people have spoken. There was a petition that was put out there. More than 35,000 people signed it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We're in the process of validating those signatures. There is a high likelihood that those signatures are going to be valid and that there's going to be a ballot initiative. Our what we have here is an opportunity to let the voter speak.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Now, if there are members of this council who do not want to. Let me rephrase it. If there are council members here who do not support the initiative, they can they can do so. They can write an argument against it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But for us to consider a countermeasure, to put on the ballot in the name of giving them giving the voter an alternative choice, I don't think is valid. We went through all of that discussion. So I'm in favor of letting the process go through.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Put it to the voter and I would. I want to provide a substitute motion to receive and filed this item here.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is there. Does that come up? Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilwoman Price Thank you. Vice Mayor So I may have missed something in this process, but I don't recall that we've ever done an analysis of the impacts of the specifications of this proposed ordinance. We have never analyzed the impact of this many dispensaries.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This tax base is limited at capped at 6%. We've analyzed it at 10%. We've never analyzed that at 6%. We've never analyzed the impact with. No. We've never analyzed the land use implications that this ordinance proposes specifically. All of the discussions that we had regarding cups and land use and taxes are now null and void under this'",
        "'speaker_2': 'proposed initiative because nothing that we discussed was included in the current initiative. The buffers have changed. The cups have changed. The tax base has changed. The land use has changed. We have not analyzed this current proposed initiative. And in fact, yes, the voters have a right to know what that impact is going to be.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Let me be clear. Let me be absolutely clear. I am not saying let's not have marijuana. That is not what I'm saying. What I am saying is let us find choices for the voters that are more prudent than what is being proposed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And, yes, let's let let the voters decide. There is going to be a cost associated with us having this election. And the voters of the city of Long Beach should be the ones to decide what measure they're comfortable with.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm not saying that anything about the proposed initiative, other than if we find that it is not the most prudent for our city, then let's at least consider an alternative that is more prudent for our city. And yes, let's let the voters decide.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I understand that in a city of 500,000, 35,000 signed a petition. I understand that. But we have 500,000 voters in the city of Long Beach, and some of them would like to know what the choices are in regards to prudence.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Some of them may choose a measure that allows for a 2000 foot buffer or a 15 foot buffer from a school. Some of them may choose a measure that requires a C P for these operations. Some of them may choose a measure that goes up to a 10% gap, and some of them may actually think that the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'more prudent measure is better for the city of Long Beach, especially when we just passed measure a promising promising our residents that this was going to provide some relief to our police department, who has been completely stretched to the limit.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And now if we are going to add another burden to the police department, some of our residents may want to know how we're going to pay for that additional burden. This council may not be interested in that information.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I, as a resident of the city, I'm interested in that information. So if you're not interested in that information, then vote no tonight. Do it and do it proudly. You'll get a lot of cheers from the audience, but if you're a resident, you may want that information.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And as council members, we should do everything that we can to provide alternatives for the voters of this city. I yes, I am always going to pick the more prudent measure. It's not about marijuana. It is not about marijuana.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It is about a business. Any business that has elements that are associated with what we've seen in marijuana would be one that we want to have caution with. It's not the legal operators that are a problem. It is the illegal operators that are the problem.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It is the illegal operators that have cost our city millions of dollars in police resources. It's the same illegal operators that have cost some of our neighboring cities millions of dollars in police resources. It's the illegal operators that we're worried about.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And for every one legal operation that we allow in the city of Long Beach, we will see 1 to 7 illegal operations. Are we ready to take that on? That's the question. Are we ready to take that on?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That is a choice for our voters. But what I'm I'm not saying let's not have marijuana. I'm saying let's come to the table and find a compromise. I will meet with anybody who wants to meet with me. In fact, my staff has been meeting with medical marijuana companies, very, very reputable, business oriented professional people.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We've been meeting with my staff has met with them. I've met with them. We're looking forward to doing business with a lot of these people that have demonstrated maturity in the discussion.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It only took 20 years.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So my recommendation to my colleagues would be and I can I can change the motion to request an impact report on the. Fiscal land use and enforcement impacts of the proposed initiative. Because to my knowledge, and I would expect the city attorney to correct me if I'm wrong, we have not analyzed the specifics of this particular initiative'",
        "'speaker_2': '. We've never analyzed it. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We have not done so.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So? So a group of people hired signature gatherers and put together an initiative and presented it to us. That was something that was created by an outside group, not the city of Long Beach. Correct?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That is correct.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So that's not like this. It's not an offshoot of what came out of planning commission as my understanding. Correct.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'This is a citizen's initiative.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So it's a citizen's initiative. Just for a moment, let's forget that we're talking about marijuana. Any citizens initiative, if they get enough signatures, do we not as a council, have a duty to study what the impact of that is going to be to the city?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We are the only entity in the entire city of Long Beach that has the data that can answer those questions for our residents. Our residents don't know what the impacts are going to be. They don't know what the impacts are going to be.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They don't know what it's going to cost the police department. You know, who knows that information? The city of Long Beach, our police chief. So we are now proposing way more dispensaries than were proposed before with no coops, limited buffers, limited tax.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We're actually repealing the tax that the voters voted on in April of 2014 and capping it at 6%. Our residents may have something to say about that. They may want to at least know that that's what we're doing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So, you know, let's not get dramatic. And, I mean, I understand there's a lot of special interests here, but we're talking about taking a prudent approach. And I just asked my colleagues, you know, if we don't want to vote on the counter initiative or the competing initiative tonight, great.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Let's vote. Let's take it up another time. If we don't like the other competing initiative I've proposed. Great. Somebody propose another one. Give us a starting point that you like. I'm trying to get us a starting point that gives us a prudent alternative.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If you don't like my starting point, I welcome an alternative starting point. I'm reaching out to my colleagues saying, let's work on something that's prudent. Let's work on something that phases in. Let's work on something that doesn't stretch our police resources more than they already are.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We get calls and my staff can attest to this. We get calls every day from our residents talking about property crimes, talking about traffic enforcement traffic, talking about things that our police department currently with their current resources, do not have the resources to follow up on.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'How can I, as a council member, turn to them and say, we just added more work for the police department? And I don't know how to answer your question about property crimes or traffic enforcement, because not only do we not have enough money to do what you want them to do now, but we just added to their'",
        "'speaker_2': 'workload. I can't do that. I want to at least be able to say to them, You know what? You had the choice. This is what you voted. And you know what? If the voters vote for it, great, great.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If recreational marijuana pass is great, then we're in the same boat as Newport Beach SEAL Beach, Cerritos. Every city around us is all in the same boat. It's a level playing field. I don't want to put our citizens at a disadvantage.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's my duty to protect them. And when they say to me, the police isn't doing enough for me, I want to say, well, you know what? You guys voted on that initiative that's now stretching them even thinner than they were before.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I don't know what to tell you. It's kind of like Prop 47. You know, the people voted for it. We're suffering the consequences for it. And maybe with this measure, we won't suffer any consequences. I don't know. I just know that when we're voting on something, we should be voting on the most prudent thing in terms of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'giving our residents choices. And I just don't know, maybe we can have an alternative measure that says something like, this is where we're going to start. And in six months or a year, we can tweak it to expand.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We can do that if it's all going as well as we think it is. And the taxes are, you know, bringing in millions of extra dollars a year that we hadn't anticipated, then why wouldn't we expand it? So, you know, that's just something that we can think about moving forward is that there is a starting point.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And if there's any takeaway to be had, it should be that the alternative measure that was proposed, that's on agenda item 41 tonight, that measure asks for marijuana. It is not a ban. My proposal is not a ban.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'My proposal is an initiative saying let's start with a prudent measure to medical marijuana. That's the proposal. So anybody who wants to come up and complain about it, I'm not saying let's a ban. So get your facts straight.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's not what we're talking about. We're talking about starting with a prudent approach and expanding from there. So here's the deal. The main motion is to ask the city attorney's office or the city manager, whoever is going to do it for an impact report on land use taxes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Enforcement. And then I'd also like to get an overview because I don't think anybody knows the answer to this, of what's the interplay with recreational marijuana and medical marijuana. Nobody knows what happens. Who is it? But if recreation passes, is this entire discussion moot?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Because if so, I don't even know why we're having it. And I don't think anyone knows that answer. So that's my that's my that's my motion. And I'd like to move the item to July the fifth and we can talk about it further then.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If you want to vote for it, great. If you don't, great. It's a pretty simple item.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilmember Gonzales.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. So, you know, certainly listening to all of the discussion, I appreciate it. And I know we've been this is many years in the making, but I just have a question in terms of timeline and timeframe. So going, you know, understanding kind of what each council member that has spoken wants to do.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'What would be the timeline for a. Going with councilwoman prices. Option in terms of bringing. I mean, she's talking about July 5th, but what would be that like final deadline for submitting a ballot initiative?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Mayor, vice mayor and members of the council. If I understand the question correctly, what is the last date that the council could decide to put something on the ballot? And I and I'll defer to the clerk. But I believe it's August 2nd.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's correct. The August 2nd date allows for the city clerk my office to meet ballot measure deadlines that are set by the county regarding arguments, argument writers, both arguments for and against and rebuttals for and against.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. So I think that because it seems to be to me that we're a bit fragmented here. So I don't think that there's any cohesiveness at all that I see and not that we have to get there. But I would say that most often than not, this council wants to be as as judicious and as thoughtful as'",
        "'speaker_2': 'as possible in making a decision. And so I think July 5th, at least for me, puts things in to kind of a rush. And I don't see where there's, you know, we would need more data. And that's the thing I know we've been doing time and time again.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But if we are if there's any inclination of putting something on on a ballot, then, you know, July 5th is pretty it's pretty tough, I would say, for me to to at least take this all in and go forward with this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The the item itself in itself is very robust. So I don't think I'd be supporting anything coming back July 5th at this time. What I could say is that it would be great to get more information as to the land use, the taxes, enforcement and an impact report related to the initiative that's already put forward.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think that's fair to just kind of get an understanding of where we where we would be. And also, again, the interplay between medical and recreation, I think is is also fair. So that's something that I would support on that side, but not necessarily bringing anything back.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Uh.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So much so. I would support to receive and file this particular item.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilmember Andrews.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Yes. Thank you, Vice Mayor. You know, I've listened to this and that, and I think in the fairness of all of this, because I've been here since the beginning of these topics about medical marijuana, and these are individuals that's been here and it's stressed their time.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I didn't listen to everything that we had to go through with medical marijuana. I think, in fairness, every one of the individuals, not only the individual out there who've been waiting to try to get this ordinance passed, I mean, it's been a long, long haul.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'It's been a long time. And I think if anything, you know, we talk about our constituents, people in the city of Long Beach, the you know, a large it is. And what they you know, the voters you know, we vote all over the city of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And I don't kind of like the idea of certain precincts. They they're the only ones that vote when we have issues of this type, I think everyone would vote on an issue of this type because the fact that we're talking about medical marijuana and you have to understand that these individuals here have waited a long time.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And I think if nothing else about the fairness of this, you know, these individual waited. We went to this ordinance. We waited. We waited. We've given everyone a chance. I think even Mrs. Price and we've been very diligent, even with a lot of your, you know, your own interest as individuals.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Could you wait get an impact on it? I think we've already went through that. And I think at this point right now, we're going to have to do something or not just throw the whole thing out. Let's get this thing done.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Because these people waited long enough. The people have waited long enough. It's time for us to do something. If not, let's just wait on the state and see what they're going to do. I think really at this point, what do we what are we waiting on?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'What kind of impact are we looking for? We've gone through that. We've gone through everything that I think is necessary in order for us to really find out what we need to do in order to get a medical marijuana, you know, when it's on the ballot, because the people right now, I tell you, we have they have'",
        "'speaker_12': 'the vote. They have the votes for it. I'm not waiting around to see what we're going to do up here. That's the people that are the ones who we sit up here and represent. We represent the people, not this little guys.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'This is sitting up here. So what I'm looking and listening to, I think it's time for us to do what we're supposed to do, get this thing over with, and let's move on with and get to something else, because we have a long night tonight.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Mr. Liberto, I don't know when you're going to get you wallet. It might be next year. Yes. Yeah. Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I wanted to take an opportunity to make some comments as well. I think I'll do that now. And Councilmember Reyes Durango, former councilmember, is strong, is still here. So we're hoping to make sure that we wrap this up soon.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I I'm very appreciative and respectful of everyone's position on this council on the issue of medical marijuana. As Councilmember Andrews indicated, we have been at this for quite a long time. And those of us who just joined the council, you've also been at it at least for two years, and that's quite a long time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'What I want to share, and I think Councilmember Andrews may have articulated it already, we had our chance. We had our chance for many, many years. And we got it right and that was undone. And then we got close to getting it right and then that was undone.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think we need to step back and accept that we haven't done our duty. I won't speak for myself personally. I and some of the others that are here. We have desperately tried to come up with a responsible measure and as I said, we did have it right and it was undone and undone because of fear mongering'",
        "'speaker_1': ', really. If I'm truthful and honest about it, it was because of fear mongering and that kind of rhetoric and and and the politics that go behind it and the passion and forget the politics. It's really the passion that go behind it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It really does create a culture of fear mongering, which I don't think has a place in in a true democracy where dialog can take place and people can have differences of opinions, and then the voters vote or the council members vote, and then things are left as they are.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Even before our item, the original ordinance had a chance to to play out for a few years. It was undone. And so we don't know. What I do know today is that after nearly eight years of having had the trust and confidence of those of you that have been involved for a long time, we didn't do our'",
        "'speaker_1': 'jobs. So there is a voter initiative that went forward. And as Councilmember Richardson had indicated, and Councilmember Urunga and Councilmember Andrews, people did spend time and resources to do that. But let's not forget that that voter initiative took place because we did not do our jobs.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's important to note. We don't get all these bites at the apple because now there's a voter initiative and we feel we have to put a competitive item on the ballot. I think that's highly disrespectful. The item that's brought forward to consider to place on the ballot is not that different from an item that was voted down'",
        "'speaker_1': '. So why would we proffer that? I'm just mystified. I'm mystified that we would be here again at this time. This council had its chance. I think it's an abuse of our authority to go forward, to put something competitive to a voter initiative, not because I believe that every voter initiative is correct.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I don't believe that. I think a lot of those that we see up and down the state are wrong and it's an it and it goes forward because democracy really didn't work in that moment. But I don't think putting a competitive measure is the answer to that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think what we can do is educate our voters. And I do have a question for Mr. City attorney, Mr. Parkin. When we do have a voter initiative, what role can the city or council play in terms of the information about that or the analysis that would not put us crossways when it comes to electioneering?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'If the measure is certified by the city clerk pursuant to the election code, it will be brought back to the City Council. And at that time, the council have three options. One is to adopt the measure as submitted.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The second is to place it on the ballot for November. And the third option is to request a report, which you could include these items. That report is due no later than 30 days, within 30 days. To discuss the impacts of the measure on the city at that time, when the report is presented back to the council'",
        "'speaker_9': ', the council has two options to place the ballot, placed the measure on the ballot or to adopt it as submitted. So there would be that opportunity once it is on the ballot. The general election rules would apply to the city on the spending of city resources either to support or oppose a ballot initiative.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay, so that process would take place regardless of whether this council took action today or not.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It would have to be an action of the council to request that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes, at that time, absolutely. Having had experience with this council and watching other bodies, we always ask for information and we always do ask for a report. I don't see us moving forward without a proper analysis, and so I'm confident that that will take place.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'What I'm also confident about tonight is that I am not in support of moving the item to another date to forestall this discussion for another date. We do not have enough time to put a competing ballot measure on the November ballot, even if a majority of this council would be interested in doing that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If we look at the bond measure that just passed with our mayors, great leadership on it, that did not happen on a whim. That took many, many, many months of study and polling and research. It didn't happen over a three month summer period.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's what we do when we want to be responsible about putting an item on the ballot. We conduct many studies and we take the pulse of the constituency, and that's why that ballot measure was as successful as it was.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Another reason why that ballot measure was as successful as it was was because we earned the confidence of our constituency. When it comes to infrastructure projects and the needs of the city and the neighborhoods in the community. When it comes to infrastructure, it's undeniable.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We earned we earned your confidence in that area. On medical marijuana, we did not I think we lost your confidence and we lost our chance to do it right behind the dias. And I do believe that the voters should have a right to vote without our interference.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I do support. At the time that it does come back to the council. I do support us receiving information so that we may be able to share that and then take a position once once the clerk finally certifies that it is on the ballot.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Whatever decision this council makes, either adopt it on the spot or put it to the voters. Either way, we will have that information. But I am not in support of the original motion. I am in support of the motion to receive and file.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that's why I second and it and I hope my colleagues are with me on that. Councilwoman Price.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Just a couple of points. I'm not going to respond to all of them because I don't know that that would be very effective for our discussions. But the biggest difference I see in the measure that the vice mayor just referenced and this is that I'm not talking about running a campaign.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm not talking about going out and getting people to support the competitive measure and running a campaign and having city employees volunteer their time to come and work in a campaign office. I'm not talking about getting union support to go door to door.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm not talking about any of that. I'm talking about putting a competitive initiative on the ballot that lets the voters vote and choose simply giving them a choice of different alternatives. So there's a difference between having a campaign and really having a targeted effort to have what you want prevail.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's not what I'm talking about. I'm just talking about putting something on the ballot that gives the voters a choice. Let them read the material. Let them educate themselves. Let them vote. And that's really what I'm talking about.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So that's the biggest difference. I'm not talking about running a campaign, but what I would request at this time. Actually, what I'd like to do is do a substitute substitute motion based on what I'm hearing from my colleagues, to ask the city manager or the city attorney or the designee that either of them determines to be the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'appropriate department to do this, to prepare a fiscal impact report, a land use report, and an enforcement analysis of the proposed initiative, as well as an overview for Council on Recreational Marijuana and its interplay with medical marijuana. And I'd like that report by July the fifth, if possible.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm Mr. City Manager. And Mr. City Attorney. That is a week away. Two weeks away. They have. What is the likelihood of of you being able to prepare such a report and it actually being thorough and robust?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Vice Mayor Councilmembers I want to point out that we have a large history of memos to the council and to the public regarding this subject. So working with that as a foundation, we certainly would give it the college to try to bring back something as comprehensive as possible.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I can't promise it's going to answer everybody's questions, but we certainly, if asked by council, will.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Put our.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Nose to the grindstone and put as much as we can together by that time. And Vice Mayor, I'd add to that that we believe by July 5th we would be able to provide an overview of the recreational and medical.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'By June 30th, the state should hopefully determine if one of those measures qualifies.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And would council be able to ask for follow up information if there was something that was missing in the reports that they didn't have to come back the following week.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So that's my substitute substitute.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. And it's been seconded. Councilman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Do we think that this is? I guess I'd like to hear from my colleagues. I heard Councilmember Richardson say he'd be interested in hearing the study. It sounds like, from what I heard from the city attorney, a study would be necessary eventually anyway.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So this would be putting us ahead. Did I misunderstand? Is this not a study of the impacts? Yeah, it's what would be required anyway, eventually.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'No, it's not required. No. When the election, assuming the signatures are verified by the city clerk under the election code, the Council will have three options, one of which would be to request a study. It's not required.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Would you say that? Typically, I mean, I guess typically would be hard. I mean, if someone came with a ballot measure or it was an initiative that said remove all the trees in the city, it would be pretty simple to say we would lose all of our shade.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So a study wouldn't be necessary. But I guess. I don't know what the likelihood is that most citizen initiatives get studies or not. Is there any kind of.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'There's no way they tend to be individually or specific. We've had in both situations where council is elected to put it directly on the ballot and other situations where they've requested the study and then placed the item on the ballot.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Well, I think that deciding and getting that study is advancing the request in advance, which gives us some some better alternatives. So I'm always open to a study.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilmember Suber now.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Thank you. Things have changed a little bit here since I first clicked in, so bear with me. The I think we have a compromise position here, and that is for a study only. And I'm very late to this party.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'As most of you know, I wasn't elected until after the. The study group was almost done. A couple of thoughts. One is. I'm just reminded of the the airport international terminal, and I voted against that and the majority of my colleagues voted for it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I just remember the line. What's the harm in the study? We're not voting for the international terminal. So I'm kind of would be perplexed if if my colleagues would go against a study on this. But I'd like to hear from the public.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The other thing that occurs to me, and that is almost daily, I receive emails about a delivery model and I don't I don't have the exact count since our last vote, but probably 100 emails asking us to support delivery.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I think that should be a part of the study to. That's it for now. I'll wait for public comment.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So that wasn't part of the Motion Councilmember Supernova. Were you asking the maker of the motion to consider that?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, I guess what I'm saying is that we don't know what the initiatives is going to be. I can ask the city attorney if if the initiative would include that. Have we studied the initiative? Where are we with that?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we do know what the initiative language is that was submitted. So if the city attorney would like to speak to that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Councilmember Bowl is the is the question regarding the initiative that's being reviewed by the city clerk at this time. Correct. And it does allow for delivery. So we could look at that. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. So that was that was a critical piece that I don't think was part of our discussions in the past. So the study here would encompass that, I believe. Vice Mayor. That's that's what I'm kind of saying. So I think it falls within their guidelines.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Thank you. Councilmember Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor. So I began my comments and they were very conciliatory and in the hopes for a compromise. And I'm very disappointed that it's sort of turned into a shouting session. Our job was to conduct good public policy.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The City Council failed to do so. What did we think was going to happen when we didn't vote to adopt a balanced, reasonable measure that we had controls to protect our neighborhoods? We had a cat per district. We had a c p that regulates our operating hours and all the tools that we need as a city to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'regulate it. The city council did not pass that, so I don't see how we didn't expect the public to go to the ballot. That's exactly what happens when you don't. Do your job. And then the measure tonight, my hope coming in was to find some soft landing that puts us on on a path to a productive conversation'",
        "'speaker_4': '. But it started in the wrong place. And then people were bullied about bullied about it. And frankly, not a single member of the council who was actually in support of responsible regulation was asked to sign on the ballot initiative tonight.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So it was insincere. It appeared insincere, insincere. And tonight was a bunch of political grandstanding that I frankly don't appreciate. So the options that I see from the city attorney are to place it on the ballot, adopt it outright, or ask for a study.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'My question right now is, does that study create any additional option than placing on the ballot or adopting it outright?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Before you. And that is not before you this evening, but when it does come to evening.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I mean, our options about the ordinance on the ballot, the ballot measure.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'If I understand your question correctly, no, it does not provide you any more options. It provides you the information that the study would provide. But you would at the end of receiving that study, you still have to either place it on the ballot or adopt the initiative.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'With that study, evaluate the impact of competing ballot measures in the state in terms of recreation.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Generally speaking, it would be the study would only. Study the impacts of the initiative that is going to be placed on the ballot by the council.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Could that study be expanded to include that an evaluation of recreation, should that qualify for the ballot could include that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It could. Well, I guess if again, if I understand correctly, yes, it could include and provide an overview of the impacts of a state measure on a local initiative.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So what I'm what I would recommend and so is to move forward with Councilman Franco's recommendation. And when the time comes to study it, ensure that we can study it and evaluate the state. Because frankly, I don't want to have this come this very uncomfortable conversation, every councilmember council meeting until that happens.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I don't I don't want to study it now and have a report next council meeting and then continue it have another report at the next council meeting. I want to receive and file this tonight support councilmember during his motion and then do the study in the appropriate time so that we can have that conversation about what'",
        "'speaker_4': 'is the impact. And so we can be aware and informed as a city on what the impacts are.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilmember Richardson. And I wanted to concur with Councilmember Richardson's comments. I. I appreciate you calling out boldly exactly what we witnessed tonight. And it does make me uncomfortable as well. When I referenced the mayor's effort for the bond measure.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I was not referencing the campaign, but really the work that went into the effort prior to writing the ballot measure. That is where a lot of the work takes place. That is where the thoughtfulness took place, where many months.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And when I say many months, it's over a year worth of study and data that went into it before writing the ballot measure. That's the difference when we consider putting ballot measures, ballot items on to an election. We don't just come to the dias and suggest that in a couple of months this could be written.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And therefore we have an item. I would never compare this process to what the mayor went through. I think that would be denigrating that effort. And I want to be very clear that I was not suggesting that there was a similarity.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I was actually pointing out the difference and the vast difference that exists. As I've stated before, I do support the substitute, the original substitute motion to receive and file. And I would ask my colleagues to vote no on the substitute substitute motion.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If I may call for public speakers, please. Mr. City attorney or Mr. Sanchez, would the public speakers be speaking on any of the three motions or just what's at hand?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'They will be speaking on the motions on the table. So we have three, three.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Motions on the table. Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Hello. My name is Jason O'Toole. I'm a resident of the fourth District and I'm here today to speak on a few things associated with the measure. I think the interesting thing about this measure, I didn't read the current version of the PAC's initiative, but they're going to need 66% plus one to win because they have this tax'",
        "'speaker_6': 'change in their law, not just 50% plus one. So I think that was kind of foolish on their part to include that language in their initiative. I know this because I've drafted six myself for Matthew Poppers and we actually had to split two measures in other cities because we learned that if we put a tax regulation in'",
        "'speaker_6': 'our initiative, that we'd have to get 66% plus one instead of 50% plus one was just something I noticed from the discussion, but I came here to make a statement. I'm a little disappointed as a fourth District resident, I think that there should be no restrictions on the number of permits for collectives.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think it's unintelligent business policy because the voters of Palm Beach have already approved the ballot measure maybe four or five years ago. That says, hey, they want ten or 15%. I can't remember. That's for recreational or medicinal, but the voters already said they're okay with taxing it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I think that, for example, I'll give you an example and signal, hell, we're doing a measure right now. And people have approached our PAC about bringing an edible factory to Signal Hill that could create hundreds of jobs.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I think that's really interesting because Long Beach is a far bigger city than Signal Hill, and I can only imagine the thousands of jobs this could create. But with the current proposal as it is for for delivery services unacceptable to the voters of California, they approve Prop 215, and there are no restrictions on the number of'",
        "'speaker_6': 'permits that can be in place. And I just think it's not very good business policy, you know, and I think that personally from my research working with marijuana campaigns, I think sorry, medical marijuana campaigns, I think opposition to these reforms and the laws are unacceptable because I think some of the original bans on marijuana are rooted in'",
        "'speaker_6': 'racism. And if you look at who's incarcerated for marijuana offenses and drugs, it's mostly minorities. And I just think that needs to stop or in a different time. I know Mr. Supervisors told me I've, you know, done some work for him in his campaign.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'He says he has different values. I'm not I'm not sure he meant by that. But my values seem to think that, you know, we should have as much medical cannabis limited as we want. The voters want it. 35,000 people signed the petition once they signed it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think three years ago we petitioned. I did. We got 15,000 voters to sign that. I think, you know, the bottom line is with the three council members that are, you know, putting this motion up. If you look at their political districts and as a political consultant, I can tell you exactly why they're making these motions.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'District three is the most conservative district in the city, followed by District five. District four is kind of a wobbler. But, you know, in my opinion, I came out to say this. I think my council member. Okay, thank you.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Diana logins. Enough's enough. And I hope you're paying attention. If you want to reduce the police work, all you have to do is close down all those bars in Belmont Shore. I don't know how you deal with it because that's where the crime comes from.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm truly saddened by Susie and Stacey's lack of compassion and disdain for the democratic process. Their proposal did not pass before, and it should not pass. Now to the educated enlightened. It is clear that this proposal is solely meant to thwart the will and efforts of the people to engage in the democratic process.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'MBS Price. The monger will profess to be compassionate but claim that they have concerns about funding, etc. but the truth is they will do anything to subvert the people's initiative and this issue. Do not be fooled. This is their personal agenda.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Never forget Susie's famous words regarding the continuing the ban. That is music to my ears. Make no mistake, a ban is her ultimate goal. The city of Long Beach. Voters have spoken time and again in the ballot box in support of cannabis.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Medically prop to 15. Or is this too much for you, Stacey? She just left. I just want you to know fully. And speaking to the audience fully legalizing marijuana in Prop 19 and then taxing it on Measure A, you must represent the will of the people.'",

That'll work with what you're talking about. I have no idea. And with legalization of recreational use, I have no idea what it's going to the effect it's going to have.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I don't think one of you has ether or Mr. Parkin, but you have allowed the prohibitionist influence in this council to rule. That is why this has been so difficult all these years. I've been here for all of it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'As late as the last task force meeting, Deputy Chief Hendricks said, quote, It's all criminal. And that is the attitude that has been pervasive. And as I told my councilman when he said that this council runs the police department, that's not true.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The police department runs this council. It's really unfortunate. But the crime, corruption and violence that we really all want to see reduced. It's just exacerbated by this corruption. You might as well have rolled out the red carpet for the cartels and gangsters.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'The Blues by a musician called RMS Mesmer. And soon as I read that, I said, gee, I got to get some of this. So I tried it. And guess what I discovered it's not a crime. Possession of cannabis and get away from the expression marijuana.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Whether that expected to come from Pancho Villa and his revolutionaries used to sing a song called La Cucaracha, Cucaracha, Marijuana, Port Humor. So that's where that expression came from. We should be calling it cannabis. It's been used for thousands of years as a medication.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so this is what we need to know also. I'm also an expert in that. I was I've been I was arrested and did time. I did three years in the federal penitentiary for a half a dozen joints, banks and a crazy federal judge that told me I was worse than a murderer because I had several.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Is this is what you get with this kind of misdirection information? Yeah. And also, I understand what Diane was saying about the Miss Prize. She's a prosecutor and a legislator and executive. So we have three forms of government.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I don't think we're allowed to people to be on two of them. So I think she should recuse herself from this entirely.

        "'speaker_6': 'slightly designed proposal being discussed again here tonight. As I first said in February before this Council unanimously, unanimously rejected the price measure, maintaining the ban on a combined comprehensive commercial cannabis activity enabled by a delivery only approach is an inept public policy born of irrational taboos and political carelessness.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Does not reflect the principles of sound public policy or a sincere desire to promote more conservative concepts of public safety. Rather, the plethora of laws and embarrassing flaws and embarrassing oversights in this bill merely demonstrate the deep seated hatred that Councilmember Price has for the culture she associates with cannabis use.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'It was pointed out by Councilwoman Mongeau and councilwoman, the price and delivery only is does not give the voters choices. What it does is people who are going to consume medical marijuana, they will be given the choice of, hey, I've got a delivery guy coming to my house.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I mean, they're going to do this transaction in my front yard, hand-to-hand through a window, or I'm going to get in a delivery person's car. I'm going to invite this delivery person into my home. What that reminds me of is something I deal with almost daily in my job, which is illegal drug sale transactions.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's the choice that you're giving people by delivery only. You either conduct this business in the same way that illegal drug transactions are conducted or you don't get to safe access.

        "'speaker_2': 'Q And I am familiar, at least with one of the last two speakers. And I just want to clarify, because I think there's some confusion. The measure that was on was not a delivery only it was a delivery phase and a brick and mortar.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I just want to clarify with a maximum of seven. So that just that I think that's an important distinction, especially I think as lawyers should appreciate that it's six months and then it phases into a brick and mortar after taxes are paid and all of that.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'So how do we calculate that 40,000? How did we get that to that number?'",

We get for every dollar that we sell, we get $0.21 back in the dollar because that would be the waterfall effect that would come to the city of Long Beach.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. I just wanted to be clear because just to ensure I was getting the figures right and ensuring that the park was getting as much as it could in addition to the grant. So thank you very much. I appreciate it.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. I think this is going to be a really great project and I'm looking forward to it. I just I did have a question on page. Three of the staff report. What is the grant match of $100,000?'",

        "'speaker_12': 'The grant matches the 40,000 that was just described by the city manager is coming from the waterfall monies that are coming into the district.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Oh, I'm sorry. What is the 100,000?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Oh, the Bloomberg folks are providing additional moneys to enhance the grant monies. It falls underneath the Bloomberg initiative in the I-Team work that they're doing. So they're providing additional funds to help this project move forward a little more.'",

This is important that those dollars that have been invested from that community, the proceeds that are generated from that are being reinvested in that community to do amazing work. And the fact that we were able to leverage that to do something fantastic.'",

A real involvement in our and our council about what is important to your constituents. At one time, my being a student here, I had no idea what was working or how it worked or anything.'",

And even though we may have our differences, we also have the ability to compromise and to look forward any movement that's necessary for the development of our beautiful city.'",

And with this new project, we're going to work very diligently to make sure that what is being asked of us through the grant has also been with the favor'",

The Douglas Aerospace facility and manufacture of airplanes that they have a jet airplane mounted in the center of the park to a jet airplane being decorative and being an inspiration for youngsters.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'In the future, this would be at little cost because there are many used airplanes available. The military is trying to get rid of it, get it practically at cost. We're not talking about $1,000,000 or anything like that. We're talking about at cost, even lower than $1,000,000, I suspect.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But know those are the suggestions. I have specifics, not just generalities, not just a park of green grass, which we have all all over the place, but something that would really enchant tourists and suggest that Long Beach is really on the go and an adventuresome city that they can have some fun and.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'A little background on the council. The council is an advocacy organization that represents 72 of the nation's largest urban school districts, with a combined enrollment of 7.2 million students. And some of the districts that are members. San Diego, L.A., Fresno, Sacramento, San Francisco, on and on have rather large student populations, ethnic student populations.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'school district. And we conducted a town hall meeting at Cabrillo High School that drew over 600 people. As part of the briefing session after the My Brother's Keeper town hall, we recognize that there was a dire need to include the city and other constituents as part of that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'For this to work at all. You know, one of the Donnie tapes that we have here in our in our in our in our city is that 72%. Of our of our school districts defined as free and reduced lunch.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And in some places it's close to 90% at 90% is part of my district is also pork part of North Long Beach. We have some daunting problems with respect to our students. So what transpires when you have students who are in that kind of an economic situation?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, they have extreme difficulty focusing in the classroom. Why? Other issues take precedence over school. They're sitting in the classroom thinking about food, shelter. And they become easy targets for gang recruitment because schooling is not part of that agenda.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The need for the city wide partnership is absolutely necessary because in that partnership we can enhance safety and security throughout the city. Another piece that is very important is to look at how we get employment opportunities for students and parents.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Extremely important. Dr. Williams And I'm going to sum this up very quickly build on and identify existing services and and resources to support our youth and communities. One good example of that is a Washington middle school where we did some amazing work in helping that one school district.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I can't go through that because of time. But my closing comments are that we can expand on that concept. At Washington Middle School, we interlink critical resources and efforts across the city, and then we can evaluate the results of these efforts.'",

First is that we have really strong relationships between the city and our nonprofit organizations that serve in workforce development and elimination of bias'",

        "'speaker_2': 'But there will be some foundation funding that we can go after as a city and will partner with a nonprofit fiscal sponsor to house that funding. I also want to mention that there are several community partners in the audience today and I really want to thank them.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They journeyed with us for a 12 month planning process and you can take some time and read through the slides about the overview of of the concepts and implementation as we move forward. I do want to highlight that it's important for us to know that all boys in young men of color don't have the same issues.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We need to be very creative and careful as we look at issues of the LGBT community, the Cambodian community and undocumented youth, and not just framing this as a one issue area, but really tailor making the data as well as our program implementation for those young particular young men.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And the milestones were mentioned earlier. This was developed by President Obama's MBK task force. The six milestones include enters school, ready to learn reading at grade level by third grade, graduating from high school, college and career ready, completing post-secondary education and training, successfully entering the workforce and being safe from violence and provided second chances.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'City jurisdictions have the opportunity to really be creative and how we address these six milestones. And I would like to say that I'm proud of our city because we were very open and transparent about the data, both including race, ethnicity and gender around each milestone.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I won't belabor the process, but I do encourage you to take some time and read through the PowerPoint and read through the plan, which is also available on our city's website, about how we propose to move forward with each of these particular milestones and really begin to moving moving the needle on data for young men and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'boys of color in our city. I also would like to mention that all the pictures you see are actual young men that live here in the city of Long Beach, and they were graciously willing to be part of the photo ops for the My Brother's Keeper plan.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So these are young men that live here in our city. In closing, there is a call to action for mentors. We have over 70 adults in our city who've signed up to be mentors to young men, and we encourage you to sign on.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You can go on WW dot MBK Long Beach dot com and there's a link there that you can click and you can sign up to either mentor or school based. So during your lunch hour you can go on campus and either read to a third grader or you can mentor a middle school at risk student.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You can mentor in the evenings and weekends with some of our community based partners who are here tonight, as well as focus on probation and foster youth. And last but not least, we have the City Prosecutors Pact program where parents can mentor other parents and helping their students attend school regularly.'",

        "'speaker_10': 'It's there's a lot of good material here. I think it's very inspiring and well well thought out. I think Mr. Sanchez deserves a lot of credit here. It's everybody. Tracey Kalinga has really established herself as a as a national leader, I think, in this program.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And let's give her a big round of applause. Yeah, it was a real treat, like I said, to go back to Washington, D.C. and see how highly regarded and well regarded our plan is. But our city is is being thought about on a national level.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Other cities across the country are looking at the work we're doing here in Long Beach. We are really an example of the diversity of the city, I think sets us apart from from any other cities, but it also provides unique challenges for us in terms of, you know, the fact that, you know, our city is not monolithic'",
        "'speaker_10': '. We and we can't one size does not fit all. And so making this plan a success is going to require deep commitment and commitment from, like I said, this body, but but also partner agencies, our school district, who has come to to to our assistance and is a real partner in a big way.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So thank you, Dr. Fulton Williams, for being here today and for your work and commitment to this. And it will require a commitment, like I said, of many others. I can tell you that that I, for one, as long as I'm on this council, will work to make sure that this plan comes to fruition.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But I understand it is not a panacea, but it's a great document to to work from and to plan from. You know, Long Beach has has actually been doing a lot of good work for a long time. I think the MBK platform allowed us to package it just right to bring all of these great community organizations that'",

And so, again, I wanted to just make sure that we we gave the the staff there their wages and we pay them well.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But in terms of letting you know that we really appreciate the work, your commitments and this is my brother's keeper, but you know, it needs to be supported and has to be supported by our sisters as well. And so thank you, Tracy, for your efforts.'",

If you request Park Wickham is the Marine to conduct Park Facility and Recreation Program Analysis Report to inform the development of a pilot program designed around new public private partnership proposals.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So Pop Warner came to us and said, we have a facility in the park. It's a snack shack. It's terrible. It's not really the city's responsibility. What can we do? But there's no structure of. We'd like to donate this much money and.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Do we pull the permits? Do they pull the permits? And it's just kind of messy right now. And I think that Marie has a significant expertize on this. And so I think that she would be able to bring back a way for us to work through all of the people who want to help and be supportive and'",
        "'speaker_11': 'work through that process.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Well, to the extent you your motion and your item seeks to help streamline processes and make us help the city do business smarter. I am supportive of that. But I just want to be very careful that we don't go down a slippery slope and of course, invoke unintended consequences.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Was was your your thought for the report coming back in 120 days for Parks and Rec to give us some some ideas or to give us something specific?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I think that's within the context of the information. They know they could probably come up with a couple of ideas. But I believe that they would go through a process that would solicit additional community input. And what that looks like would be what we would would like to hear back from them.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So an example is there's a question of. Over the years. We've always done it that way, where baseball has always been able to sponsor field sponsors and raise money and put advertisements on a fence. But soccer's never had that opportunity.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And then the police foundation was able to sell bricks. But then the nonprofits that support the dog park haven't. I mean, it's very it varies so greatly through the years that we need a process. And Marie has a level of expertize and working in this area.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And I think we should trust her to bring back a comprehensive report at which time we can evaluate the direction we would like to encourage them to go.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'All right. Thank you very much for clarifying.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mr. City. Attorney.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Vice Mayor. Thank you. I was just wanted to follow up on councilmembers because I believe from what I was hearing, I was concerned also with the possible proposal or meet and confer issues that a report like this can raise.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so if this is staff evaluating the current process and maybe where they can improve on efficiencies and comes back with recommendations at that point, you may start looking at proposal issues or meeting confer issues with staff and I'd like to avoid those if possible, prior to coming back.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We are not looking to outsource anything that's currently offered. We're looking at finding ways for nonprofit organizations to partner and grow anything in our city, whether it's support of our park programs, our archery programs, whatever it is to support growth and extend services and or facility maintenance, I mean, whatever it is.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It would not be any outsourcing of any current. City work. And I know and I just want to say that I actually don't think this needs to come up. We had 3000 people volunteer in the parks last year and painted equipment that hadn't been painted in 40 years.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And if if we as a community can come together and volunteer in any way, we should embrace that. We are not looking to eliminate or outsource any city work.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I would just say the volunteer work is completely different than private partnerships. Right. And so I think that's where we need to just be very careful. I'm going to support the motion because I'm interested in. Hearing the information back.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But I just want to be very cautious that we don't do anything that we we don't intend to do here.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I would be very surprised if the director of our Parks and Rec program brought back proposals that would put us in that position.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilmember Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. I understand loud and clear where Councilmember Mongo wants to know, wants to go. And it sounds like the city attorney knows how to tread this water without crossing a line. And I think I think, you know, I think there's a way we can get the information that we're looking for here.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I want to you know, I brought up just a little while ago that I do. Since we're talking about public private partnerships and I was working on an item later and we talked about doing an item, but I'm really intrigued by some of the work like at Harvey Milk Park with the improvements, they're going to put'",
        "'speaker_4': 'in some kiosks. And I'm just interested in in learning more about how we can improve on our public private partnership with respect to vending in the park. So I'd like to just ask that you include that in your.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Absolutely would love to add in the word vending. I hope that that would have been considered, but I'd love to call it out. I think that's a great idea.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you so much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. There's been a motion and a second. Is there any member of the public that was to address council on item 40? He's come forward.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I had to laugh a little bit about the I. Nomenclature was used to describe the proposal. It's not a new proposal, and it's always been. Acceptable for. Pub for corporations to submit ideas where the public can help serve them voluntarily.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It's just a request for volunteers to work for nothing but to get the wonderful feeling of accomplishment that it brings to them, and more importantly, to all those that they favor. The thing being requested is ideas that would make.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Make public enterprise grow, and that's always been available or maybe should be made by the mayor calling them up on the phone or staff and asking, Hey, is there something we can do to help you out? That's all that's required.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That new.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Are you coming forward to speak? No. All right, members, please cast your vote.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Motion carries.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Are we at new business? What is the item?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Announcements? Yes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Announcements. Council member Andrews.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Yes. I like to give an update on one of my staff members, which is down Isabel today. At about noon time, my staff member was seriously attacked today and struck in the head. And for a moment she was unconscious.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Our thoughts and prayers will go out to her and her family, and we wish her a speedy recovery. I would also like to take this time to thank the longest fire department for their excellent care and as well as a quick reaction by the Long Beach Police Department.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We hope that we can find justice for her and violent act will not go unpunished. That was Isobel. That was my new staff assistant. And we'll quickly I'd like to go over my announcements. I'm happy to announce that the annual Six District three summer events in Long Beach, they start on June and run through September.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'But the first put two tonight to a two night at the museum there. There's a lot of family fun. For more information, please call my office and please join me for the free movies in the park and an outdoor movie experience future movie pan on Wednesday, June 29th, starting at Dusk and Mac.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Others Park 1321 East Anaheim Street, Hotel Transylvania two on Wednesday, July 13. Start two deaths in Mac That's it Mac. Right, I park. So please, for more information, please call my office. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilman Andrews and I failed to call for the second opportunity for public comment on nine agenda items. Did you want to come forward and make public comment? Thank you. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You're here. An honorable city council and mayor. This is a little bit off of Long Beach, and I wouldn't normally do this. But I was wondering if we could please say a little prayer. We're a little SEAL Beach, California.'"
