And Mr. Mayor, this item was postponed from our last meeting, as you know, to allow the applicant an opportunity to work with neighbors and give certainly my office some time to consider whether any additional conditions might address concerns presented by neighbors whom we heard from last Tuesday.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Those concerns mainly focused on music, volume, noise and smoke emanating from customers on the patio, open doors and rooftop windows open during entertainment and trash or recycling being emptied late at night, creating further disturbances as individuals rummaged through their containers, which is all very understandable.'",

They're very real concerns, but ones that I believe that the owners and our city staff can address through responsible operation and enforcement.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We have experience with that through also the venues that have come through our dining and entertainment district. I appreciate the residents who suggested additional conditions for the permit in an effort to seek compromise. I'm also very appreciative of the owners, Jim and Sophia, who reached out to and listened to the concerns of their neighbors and are taking'",
        "'speaker_5': 'action to address these concerns. I've actively witnessed them doing so, and I'm very thankful for that. Those actions include moving and delineating a smoking area on the patio away from residents, installing baffling, which is a sound wall on the property line to reduce noise and installing signage and changing protocol to eliminate loitering and dumping of trash and'",
        "'speaker_5': 'recycling at night. I'd also like to point out that the conditions required for entertainment include language that also protects residents, such as requiring that all doors and windows, including rooftop windows, be closed during entertainment, prohibiting loitering by entrances and exits.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'No speakers on the patio, no dumping of trash or recycling into outside dumpsters between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m.. Requiring the owners to monitor and reduce any nuisance to neighbors, including loitering and loud talking and sound, shall not be audible beyond 50 feet from exterior of the premises in any direction.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'These are all articulated in in the agenda item. I'm pointing them out just to illustrate that the owners are very aware of these conditions, are very amenable to them, and have been working with the community to accommodate them.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I believe these actions and conditions mostly address the resident concerns but want to modify the recommended conditions in the following manner. Number one, in recommended condition number 12, it is stated that should the permits operations give rise to a substantial increase in complaints, calls for service or trash found in the parking lot or neighborhood, the perimeter shall'",
        "'speaker_5': 'increase staff or employ uniformed licensed security guards as directed by the chief of police. So that would be that would be something new, and that would certainly be something that is very doable and honoring and understanding that this is a neighborhood as well.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Finally, number three, I would also like to amend condition number three to read as follows Entertainment activities indicated on page seven of your entertainment application shall be restricted to Sunday through Thursday, and this is, as it was stated, 5 p.m. to 11 p.m. and Friday through Saturday 5 p.m. to 1 a.m..'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I know there's currently a request to have it start earlier. I think we can start that with sweeps and revisit that at a later date, but we can do the occasional event permanent to accommodate that request and then look at it again.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I'm very open to doing so and I think that that would not be problematic. If we can start with an EP, I think the neighborhood is amenable to that as well. But if we start with OPI, I think it's a good show of faith.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I believe these amended conditions strike a compromise. Enable enabling live entertainment to be offered on retro road while protecting residents from the noise impacts associated with the patio late at night. This is not the downtown dining and entertainment.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'It's that simple. You would direct the city attorney to prepare an ordinance and he would bring it back. I think the first reading would be on the eighth, if I'm not mistaken.

The purpose of today's presentation is to provide information that was requested by the Council on April 29th, including the results of the geotechnical peer review. Before I introduce the lead geotechnical engineer to discuss the peer review results, I will provide some project background and existing condition details'",
        "'speaker_2': '. The purpose of the Ocean Boulevard Bluff, Erosion and Enhancement Project is to stabilize portions of the bluff between 20th place and 36th place. The city's engineers have recommended using cylinder drilling technology and a ten colored chocolate phasing there that contains planter pockets.'",

We also understand that retaining wall at the tall or the middle of the slope are not desirable due to a static and cost reasons.

        "'speaker_2': 'We had these parameters in our mind when we performed a review. The summary of findings. The full exploration consisted of 14 borings and three colon penetration testing, and the borings were advanced at the top of the slope as well as at the beach area by the toll of the slope.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It is the committee opinions that the full exploration was adequate considering the extent of the project as well as the consistency of the subsurface soils. The sole parameters were selected based on lab testing and also testing in the field.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Along with public correlation. Again, it's the opinion of the committee that the SOL parameters are reasonable for the site. The seismic parameters were developed following the guidelines by California Geological Survey and also Southern California Engineering Center. Those parameters are reasonable, and they follow the practice of the County of Los Angeles.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'The court requirements and the committee agreed with that findings. We had a factor of safety with the fission kleinfeld recommended for nailing to stabilized the slope. The committee agreed with that finding that some type of deep soil anchor, such as for nails or tiebacks, will be required to improve the static and seismic stability of the slope.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'This option is feasible for the site where create has not been installed and depending on the contour and inclinations of the slopes, the deep rooted vegetation may be implemented with other elements such as steel, wire mesh or timber grids to hold the topsoil and the slope planting.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This method, however, is not recommended where it has been installed because it will require remove removal of this shortcut, which it's a tedious process before it is structurally connected to the solid nailing and removal of the shortcut may impact the integrity of the existing soils and also the chocolate is placed places.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The poor is fraught directly on the slope phase. So removal of the shortcut work may also take out some of the source that would decrease the stability of the slope.

As discussed in the peer review report and by the by the Geo Technical Committee, there are viable alternatives to short create for areas that currently do not contain financial create.'",

And I just want to make sure that you all have a copy. Knowing that my time is undoubtedly limited, I want to refer to notes which usually I prefer not to do.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I want to say that on December 21st of 2009, the city gave notice that the zoning administrator would hold a hearing on this particular application for a coastal development permit for the Bluff Park Project. And in February of this year, there was a request under your Public Notice or Public Records Act requirements for a copy of'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that permit, as well as the plans associated with it. And unfortunately, your staff was unable to come up with what we were looking for. And instead we ultimately obtained a copy of much of that from the Coastal Commission where a notice was provided to them about the action taken on December 21st of 2009.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I mention that because there are a variety of conditions we found in that documentation, including an indication that certain plans had had been approved. And we've never been able to locate those plans, nor apparently has anybody at the city, as far as we can tell, are at the Coastal Commission.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And in that connection, one week after the zoning administrator acted on this coastal development permit, there was a an engineering report. It was labeled preliminary or draft, but it did not talk about Short Creek at all. It talked about some of the other ways of dealing with stabilizing the bluff.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I can only speculate that whatever the plans were that were submitted to the zoning administrator and where the subject of that permit action, in fact did not include shot, create the memo that I've provided you and I seem about running out of time if you're strict about that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The memo I provided indicates, as did your staff, that in spite of the fact that your consulting firm or the peer review group did an admirable job of dealing with the issues, given the constraints that were provided.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. We're going to leave.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We believe that if you take a careful look at that memo that I've distributed, you will see that it's quite possible for there to be some encroachment on the beach, if that's a better way of dealing with this.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Bill.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thanks.'",

Let's take our time and get it right. The neighborhood associations were shown drawings of something that was mostly plants to stabilize the bluffs the way it had been.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I've lived in Long Beach for about 15 years, and that's been stabilized by plant the whole time I've lived here. The Sierra Club is out there once a week with a regular hike that we've had since the eighties.'",

Maybe one has shored up a little bit with some new plants, but we're absolutely confused by why the whole thing looks like a target parking lot at an'",
        "'speaker_1': 'angle. But let's take our time and get it right. There's been a lot of damage done. There's a lot of cement and pins and steel plates. And, you know, and thank you, by the way, for actually giving us a price on how much to remove all that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think it was horrible mistake. I don't know anybody who says, yeah, lots of cement. Our beach looks like the monitor or the Merrimac. Maybe we will have to spend the big bucks to remove all that, but at least let's take our time and get something right.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And maybe we decide that this is that the GEO staff needs more supervising so that we don't accidentally spend 9 million on shock treat that nobody meant to be there. It is sturdy and that's great, but it was pretty sturdy before.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I don't understand why we've got like the, you know, Civil War bunker going on there, but let's take our time and get it right, because this thing will last for 20 or 50 years. And if we spend more money removing all that ugly stuff before teenagers graffiti it, well, maybe that's what we do, because it's going'",
        "'speaker_1': 'to be there for many, many years. And that's what we've hinged our tourism on. Tourists aren't going to come to hang out and spend money at something that looks like Attica.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Making. Gabrielle next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hi. My name is Seamus and I'm a licensed civil engineer in the state of California. I live in the fourth district and I have property in the second district. I'm the vice chair of the Long Beach chapter of the Surfrider Foundation, and the Lummis chapter thinks the alternative is horrible.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We need to pull it out and pretty much follow alternative for option number four. So there are alternatives. And I got a little bit ahead of myself. I wanted to start off with Go Team USA 2018. We'll come round next time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. So one recommendation is to finish as much work as you possibly can that doesn't involve concrete and demobilize all that equipment off the beach so we can study the alternatives for the concrete removal while we can finish everything else and just make the beach not look like a construction zone.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Another recommendation I recommend for you guys is to get the stakeholders involved in some sort of stakeholder workshop because there's a lot of plans and details that you guys don't need to be involved with, with, and the stakeholders are happy to spend their time getting into it and all the little options and alternatives.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And this concept about the stakeholders don't want an alternative extending out onto the beach. I don't know what stakeholders they're talking about, but some of the people right here are perfectly happy with that alternative. The peer review is flawed due to the narrow scope.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If you can go to the second slide on that on this slide up here, can we go back to the different slides? The second slide is up there. Whoever is in charge of that? No. All right. Well, the city council has to ask the the staff to do a peer review of all alternatives before they scope the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'peer review. Most of the alternatives were wiped out and not even considered. So if you need a peer review, have them go back and do it again. I disagree with as a licensed civil engineer, I disagree with the conclusions of that peer review.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The conclusion said that because it's going to be expensive and because it's going to be damaging to remove the shock to the existing soil, then you shouldn't do it. Well, that's not a good reason not to do it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We all knew it would be expensive and time consuming and damaging to the existing soil. And if you're going to rebuild the bluff in some way, you're probably going to have to damage the existing soil. So those are givens and that's not a reason not to remove the shot.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Cory, thank you for your time. Next Speaker Hello, my name is David Revell. I'm a coastal geomorphologist and was the lead author on the essay. P.W. A Report. On April 29th, I presented to the City Council on a range of bio technical stabilization alternatives.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I've said that I was here to work with the city to try and come up with some alternatives. I promptly followed up with Mr. Lopez with two of the three peer review committee members, and I followed up with a report two weeks later which was submitted to the city looking at a wide range of alternatives.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In that report, we also raised nine questions for consideration by the geotechnical committee. None of them were addressed or answered in the by this committee. These questions ranged from the potential size of a catastrophic landslide, the inclusion of the existing seawall and the slope stability analysis and the angle of repose related to the geologic unit that this'",
        "'speaker_2': 'block is made up of. After review of the report, I noticed that several of the alternatives were included. I heard in the presentation that the by the vegetation stabilization was actually considered feasible, and however, the big missing piece was the slope regrading and slope stabilization caused by recreating a stable slope and apparently was precluded for the same'",
        "'speaker_2': 'reason that it was not considered by the Kleinfeld to report. The Kleinfeld to report was specifically told not to look at regrading because of this concern about going out on to the beach, a decision not to include construction of an additional wall was the cost in esthetics.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Can we regrade this slope? Technically, absolutely. We've done it in many places and engineers do that a lot. The bluffs of Long Beach have evolved over time. The once wave attacked cliffs have been sheltered from waves. The artificial sand fill has been placed to widen the beach.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And as that cliff has gradually retreated, we've started to get closer to an equilibrium angle of stability. This natural process would have given us this free, constructed, stable angle if we had just given it time. And that has obviously not been the case we've now injected in an urban environment.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We need engineering and we need some partners to make sure we get the plants and the slope stable now. In my professional opinion, there are several technical alternatives for stabilizing this bluff. We absolutely need to consider slope regrading and slope stabilization.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We can achieve a lot with that. I don't think that either the KLINEFELTER report or the peer review committee was given the freedom to look at that alternative in earnest. And I think that is what city staff should be directed to do and to provide another option in the suite of stabilization tools.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Hi. I'm Will Collin. I live on Loma Avenue. We greatly appreciate the opportunity given to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The community during this temporary pause in.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Construction. We've been busy researching records, contacting other cities about how they've resolved similar issues and putting together alternatives for our bluffs. With that in mind, I'm here to support the council directing staff to do two things. First, continue the pause on the bluff stabilization until all alternatives can be compared.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No more work on the short creek, no more piecemeal. Work on repairing the revegetation. Failures of Phase one and two staff should put together a complete list of alternatives for bluff, stabilization, revegetation, and then do a thorough analysis of the costs and benefits.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And staff should provide the community a way to participate in the analysis so that options for cost savings and assurances for final successes are fully vetted prior to spending any more money. Second. Contract contractors and renegotiate a modification of the contract.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We'd like to see work on the Bluff Park complete as soon as possible, and we understand this may require some temporary handrails that can be removed when the bluff work starts again and maybe some time. Other than that, modifications can be made to that contract.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But we think that there are ways to do this that will allow public use of the park on schedule. And we hope that the city attorney can negotiate a contract modification that keeps the crew working while the city figures out what to do with the Stuff Revitalization Project.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Now it's clear to everyone that mistakes were made prior to the permit getting approved. We do not believe that there was any intentional wrongdoing. But telling the engineers from KLINEFELTER to upgrade the slope was prohibited by the Coastal Commission was wrong.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This is not prohibited by the city's LPC or the Coastal Act and telling the peer review team to also omit any consideration of that alternative is just repeating the error. So we do not know who asked the Coastal Commission for that opinion or what the Coastal Commission said.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But we know that the that the beach fill is not only allowed for for bluff stabilization, it was anticipated when the LCP was adopted and if the city told the Coastal Commission it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Wasn't necessary because there was an.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Alternative that didn't require beach fill, that would also be wrong. The alternative of short Crete is prohibited in the Coastal Act. Finally, if the community is allowed to contribute to that comparison of all the alternatives, we believe that we can find innovative ways to reduce costs for all the necessary repairs.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We appreciate the opportunity, given the community during this pause, and we look forward to bringing our ideas on how to fix the mistakes to this point.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker. Great.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening. As City Council vice mayor. Temporarily. My name is Gordon a cager and live at 235 Loma and thank you very much for bringing this subject back to City Council. Thank you. For those of you who participated in the special session at the end of April for making this happen, I'm also very happy to tell you'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that I've been renominated to the city's Sustainable City Commission, and I'm honored to represent the third District. I'd like to very briefly finish Mel Nutter's comments. This was something that he was prevented from speaking about as a result of the time constraints.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'd like to read specifically a paragraph that he was not permitted to to say because of the time. What we can say is that a Kleinfeld or engineering report dated a week after the December hearing describing slope stability techniques that did not include the use of shock create.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This is back in December of 2009 because shark creep was not being considered then. Presumably the approved plans did not provide for the shock treatment suggested later. Is that is the case? The work currently performed appears to be unpermitted and in violation of your LCP requirements.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm here to ask specifically two things this evening. I'd like your assistant assistance to direct staff tonight to finish the Bluff Park Project. The residents of the city deserve their park back. The Bluff Park residents deserve their park back.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We can finish the sidewalk. We can finish the handrails. We can do the lawn. We can do the irrigation and finish the construction. Separate that project from what's happening on the bluff, please. It's a whole different project, whole different constraints.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We should finish the park fast, and we should do the Bluff Erosion Project much more slowly. Secondly, I think it's very, very reasonable to request a cost benefit analysis, a feasibility study, and stop me if this sounds too eco terrorism or unreasonable.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But this is a very complex project. You've just had numbers prod up to you in public that no one has had an opportunity to look at independently. Have we had a competitive bid put out? Do we know what it costs to remove shot create?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'By the way, when I did construction at my house and I got to do demo and my new kitchen is going in, I use the same company who's doing the new construction to do the demolition of the old work.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's what saves costs. And if you're interested in saving money on this project, please consider directing staff to more competitive notions of how to cost these kinds of projects to benefit the community. Please slow down. Cool your jets.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There's no hurry here. We're looking for a long term solution to a problem that's been decades in the making. And there's no reason to do this fast. Thank you so much.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'So I say let's slow down and not rush to judgment. We've been given the impression that these concrete walls are going to be covered with plants. But I actually really question the utility of these planter pockets. They measure about two feet by two feet.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They are they are laid on a in a cement wall that South facing that's got the sun beating down on it every single day. And I just question how legitimate the growth, the promise of lush growth is that it's going to be coming out of there.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I don't actually even know of a project that has successfully used planter pockets. Another thing that I'm really worried about as it's configured now and even what the peer review suggested. It sounds to me like a patchwork of solutions and there isn't any kind of consistent design that's going to get to bring the whole thing together, and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that's just a recipe for disaster. So I propose absolutely separating the park from the bluff finish the park. The neighborhoods would be so indebted if we could finish the park, get the irrigation going, and then address the bluff.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Then consider the costs and alternatives to removing the shock rate, flattening the slope for erosion and seismic control and revegetated with carefully selected native plants. Thanks a lot.'",

I don't think so. I don't think so many of us. And I think it's really most of us feel that you showed good judgment when you voted for the first time'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and again when you voted for it the second time. The 2010 report explains in great details why the existing plan is right. I read the entire report and it makes a lot of sense to me. I also spoke to some experts about it, too.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Four years later, we have a new report. Concluding that the first report was correct. Let's finish the project. You approved a plan to ensure people that your decisions were right. And let's get it finished real soon. And please, let's not waste any more money.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'the decisions of the council, I believe, were based upon inaccurate information that was given to you. So I do not fault the Council with this. I do agree that they could be broken up and that we could finish the bluff, we could fix the sidewalks, install the handrails and get our park back.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Second, I believe that we need to take the time and do a feasibility study on the bluff and really take a look at some of our alternatives with costs and benefit to help the Council to make an informed decision.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This means considering all of the erosion control options. Unfortunately, due to budget challenges, we had lost some of the key folks that had been involved originally with this project in the initial discussions. I believe that there was vital information that was lost and that did not get communicated to the new focal people.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Let's not be in a hurry. Our City Council has spearheaded a lot of new and great ideas. There has not always been the most popular choices from plastic bags to bike lanes and parklets. But let's also be honest too.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Those were easy fixes. If they didn't work out, we could repaint. We can move a pot. This is not the same thing. This, unfortunately, is something that's going to be with us forever. And we don't want to regret it.'",

I know that was a consideration with the local coastal plan when we were talking about putting in parts tonight an additional 167,000 in restaurant, restroom improvements and other path related expenses were approved.'",

I'm very familiar with building large projects that involve doing slope stabilization and have examined the reports on the project and read them very carefully.'",

In my opinion, I had heard in when this project was being restarted or done something about two and a half years ago, I was pretty excited that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'we were actually going to do something with it. I walk the park on a regular basis and it's very disturbing to me that it had gotten to the delirious, dilapidated condition that it was in. It was very frustrating for me to walk into one of the most prime parks in the whole city and have it be so'",
        "'speaker_2': 'in bad disrepair. And it was obvious to me that one of the reasons it was in disrepair is that there's not a great foundation for it. We needed to do something to stabilize the slope there, either regrade it or reinforce it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think that's been pretty clear in all of the reports, including the peer report recently done, that those that needed to be done in order to be able to maintain a park there. It's my belief that the solution that was put forth is a reasonable one.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The we have a lot of people here that want to villainize concrete on the face of that or short creek. I want to point out that the reason that is a bluff and the nature of it is, is that there are loosely or in the original report, KLINEFELTER describes it as weakly cemented soils.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'What we basically have there is a bluff with very weak concrete on it, naturally. And all we're doing is making it stronger. I want to make that point. It's very frustrating to me that we've gotten that this has been delayed, that we're spending extra money with it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I really want to see the park finished. I think you should implement the program that you have put in place. Finish the park if you'd like to restudy regrading it. You can certainly grade over the top of this stabilization and it'll certainly be very strong if that was done.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Anyway, I'm done. Thank you very much. Thank you. Next speaker. And before we speak, is there any other speakers? I'm going to cut off the speakers list. Casey None. To the gentleman behind, you'll be the last speaker.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'You had two reports. You acted on them. You built what you've built. I'm not going to sit here and say that. I think the shot is the most esthetically beautiful thing I've ever seen. But it's okay and it seems to work.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I haven't heard one thing tonight that would indicate that it doesn't work. You stopped the project, you spent money. You had engineers come in and look at it again. And I didn't hear one word that says what you did doesn't work.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So as a resident, I would like to see you finish this project. We're being told that it would be $11 million to take this out. And someone suggested that Mr. Parkin could cleverly renegotiate the terms and get it cheaper.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I don't want to see you spend $8 million or $7 million to do this. Take your money. Spend it on something worthwhile. But you've you've run this project all the way to the end. No one is saying it doesn't work.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. Your last speaker on the item. Sir.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening. My name is Andrew Virtue. I'm a resident of Belmont Plaza, adjacent to the bluff. I've lived in Long Beach since 1989, and I'm a professional landscape designer based here in Long Beach, California. And I use the bike path a lot in the bluff.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I have to say I hate the shot create. I think it's ugly, but as many people do. But I also can see the potential practicality of of it as some the last people have said, considering the fragile crumbling nature of a bluff and bluffs do tend to crumble down into the ocean over time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I I'm not going to offer any expertize as far as whether or not the shark creed is the best idea. I do like the idea of exploring whether there are other solutions for the remaining area that hasn't yet been covered with concrete.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I have one piece of very practical advice, I think, which is Ice Plant addressing one of the earlier people who spoke about what could be put in the planter pockets that would actually cover the concrete. And it's very unsexy.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's very odd. Glamorous. It's not fashionable, but it actually can grow to up to 160 feet in diameter from a single plant. We see it all over Southern California. It's not native, unfortunately, but it really does do the job of covering slopes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It will grow in foggy, salty, coastal conditions. It will tolerate hot, scalding sun on a concrete bluff. And it's the only plant that I know of in the world. It's actually Latin name is Capo Broadus at Dulles. It's an ugly name for sort of an ugly plant, but it really will cover a hot, scalding hot bluff that's'",
        "'speaker_2': 'covered in concrete. And if the shark remains and if that's what has to be there in order to keep the bluff from falling down, even though it's not a native, it's not exciting, it's not glamorous and it's not fashionable.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think it's very practical and we should look at what actually grows versus some of the earlier landscaping projects that were done, exotic things that were put on the hillside that all failed. And we ended up with a crisscross of white PVC, plastic irrigation pipes and a lot of weeds adjacent to the staircases.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And the unglamorous ice plant is one of the few things that really will grow and hopefully would cover some of the concrete. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. That concludes the public comment. I have a couple of councilmembers, Councilmember DeLong and Councilman Bishopsgate.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. After our last speaker, somebody needs to get Gordon on Advil or adult beverage, one or the other. But, you know, to my colleagues, let me just say that, you know, you're going to miss me while I'm gone when you don't have these stimulating and exciting projects before you on a regular basis.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Start with that. You know, as you know, we've you know, obviously, it's been a bit of a divisive issue in the community, particularly recently, I think just this evening. We have experts on both sides that recommended completely different approaches.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And accordingly, I think that some compromise is in order here and to try and thread the needle and see if we can make everybody as happy as possible or at least equally unhappy. As we go forward and we'll find out the outcome.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You know, certainly looking back and hindsight being 2020, I do agree. I think that a different approach clearly could have been taken with this project or just even starting with something simple like finish phase one before moving on to phase two, because we really don't know how this will end up looking like.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But had we finished phase one, finished the irrigation, finish, the landscaping, it might look just great. And we wouldn't be here tonight because the community would be looking at it and saying, yeah, you know, that that that actually turned out okay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Let's continue on that with that process. But unfortunately, we don't know that. So what I'm going to recommend is my motion is very similar to the staff's second alternative. And what that is, is that, first of all, to move forward expeditiously with the work on the top park portion of the bluff and any other infrastructure improvements regarding'",
        "'speaker_6': 'the railings, sidewalks, etc., let's get that finished as quickly as we possibly can. Secondly, as you know, although the the peer review studies do support shot create is a viable option for bluff stabilization. We've we've heard that several times, particularly from the peer review committee.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They've also indicated that other options are viable as well, potentially. So we would ask staff that on the portions that have not been shot created to go look whether it's geo grid or whatever those other appropriate alternatives are, let's take a look at that and see if there's a better solution on a going forward basis.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'In regards to the shot create, I think we should finish what we started with. I do agree with the gentleman whether we can negotiate down from 10 million to 9 million or 7 million. It's still a tremendous amount of money for the city to do that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Again, I think we could have done it differently perhaps in the beginning, but sometimes you are where you are. So I think we need to finish with the short creek. We need to finish getting it stained. We need to get the irrigation here.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We get it. We need to get it landscaped. I will also ask staff that as the alternatives are being considered, meet with the local bluff part and Neighborhood Association and perhaps others to keep them updated. The progress so that as we move forward, this is a project that the community feels that they're a partner in every step'",
        "'speaker_6': 'of the way. And in addition to the city council and that's my motion.'",

And I have this city attorney and city manager on this is to the difficulty that residents had when they asked. They did a public records request and lo and behold, there's a missing permit, which obviously, if we didn't have it permit, it could'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Give copies to everybody?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Eric Lopez We do we do have a local coastal permit on file. That's that clearly lays out the special conditions of approval. That permit has been provided. We can distribute copies and put a copy of it on the website as well.'",

I do wish we had finished our phase one, as Mr. DeLong said, prior to multitasking and and starting.

        "'speaker_7': 'Of.'",

I mean, the depending on what the alternative that the council wants to go forward with, could either one be a change order to an existing agreement with our existing contractor? Or if it's such a significant change, a departure from what was planned, then there may be a rebid requirement, but until those'",

        "'speaker_7': 'Mr.. Brown.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, I think there was looking at the presentation for a period of time that said it would take to look at the alternatives.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'To step one coming in.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'In 2 to 3 months or something. As I recall, I heard to look at whether there are alternatives that are feasible.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So just to clarify, to come back with alternatives on the two areas that have been soil nailed but not shot created. So we would like the ability to talk to the contractor and engage with the community and look at what.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The the.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Whether it's a bio technical alternative or a landscaping alternative, then get back.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'To the council.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And we're looking for that to be a 2 to 3 month process.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. Thank you. Mr. Austin.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Mr. City Attorney.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That was my question. Is the it does the motion have or does it include or is it a limit? The options that you're asking them to evaluate to the bio technical or is are other options? I'm not clear on what direction the council's giving staff for the areas that are not to be finished with Short Creek.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So it would be, as I understood, the peer review report which I have here. Bear with me just a moment. So so the purity report said an available alternative Shot Creek for slope phase production is using prior technical techniques as outlined in Section 3.0.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So that's what I'm looking to have addressed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think that came about and.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Will bring will bring those alternatives back to the council at a later date once they've been worked out with the engineers in the community.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But I think, as Mr. Lopez says, I think we're looking for as kind of a conceptual as a viable. Does it work? You know, maybe some kind of an order of magnitude in terms of cost to the community to support it as opposed to shock, create and then come back.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Mr. Olson. Joe, anything else? Okay. I have a couple of things. From what I understand, emotion. And you want to just make sure it's clear the motion is one to complete the work at the park, but obviously at the park, anything that can get done as soon as possible.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I think that's obviously been pretty clear that the importance of it, the community certainly wants that. The second is to continue with the current short street project as and part of that one phase and finish the the other portion of the landscaping portion of the other phase that was done initially, correct?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Absolutely possible.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And then the then the last piece of that is for the areas that have not been completed to evaluate about tactical solutions. Now, could it be evaluated by a technical end or other landscaping or other solutions that are that are possibly out there?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Because and maybe I understood this roundabout, but are from what the from the peer review report that are both biotech the goal solutions as well as possible other landscape or other solutions. Or maybe I misinterpreted misinterpreted that. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Mr..'",
        "'speaker_2': 'LOPEZ The the available alternatives are only the bio technical alternatives. So there's various iterations of these about bio technical techniques that will be explored. But those are what what is feasible.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And that's not what I thought I heard. But is there anyone else appear that differently?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah. Mr. Vice Mayor, as they talk about in section 3.0, the bio technical techniques, and they give things such as deep root of vegetation, deep root of vegetation and combination of geographic timber grid and life slope grading with a lattice like a river and horizontal table.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I think biochemical techniques is pretty all encompassing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And that would include landscape options and. Yes. And other types of I want to make sure that we're not limiting to one one type, but we're looking at the a broad range of options that, according to the engineers and others, is all within this bio technical solution group.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. So that's that clarifies the motion for me. Can you comment answer the question, Mr. Lopez, on the current shot street section, that's that's I know that we were a few weeks away from completing. How much is the short crit work actually completed?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In an area in area three, the shaft work has been fully completed and it just requires the Steyning treatment and area. Two half of the half half of the area has been fully completed, which out create and just require sustaining.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The second half still has to expose someone else.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay, so it's essentially half of the second phase. It still needs complete that we would actually be finishing on the shock route side.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's now because the different areas consist of different length. So it's if we can go back to the to the exhibit and go through the three areas and face to page three.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yeah, no, I think, I think I got it. Yeah I it's different. It's a different so it's not half. So I, I get that piece. Okay. And. I think that is all I had. Any other questions for council?'",

        "'speaker_1': 'is that the administration's plan to use to EMT funds for fire equipment next year would be would be challenged.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'That was the question. And I know it's been explained just a minute ago. Could you Chief, can you could you offer your opinion? Mr. Mayor? Council members, council member O'DONNELL If the council were to elect to take the $517,000 that was appropriated into the fire's budget back to be used for other purposes, that would leave us $517,000'",
        "'speaker_2': 'whole, that would have to be filled. We would anticipate filling that hole with available GMT one time revenue that would come in, which would into the next fiscal year diminish our ability to use that GMT one time revenue to offset the cost of apparatus, vehicles or equipment or other one time needs within the fire department.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So it would have an impact and some of those one time needs where there gender equity issues that were being addressed for some capital improvement projects, is that correct? Council the the fire department has been granted funding by the council to address our privacy needs within the fire stations.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'However, additional one time funding we use for things in the facilities that may not be specifically related to privacy. But because we have the station opened up and we are remodeling it, we want to use additional one time funding to offset the cost of some of those things.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'For example, if we were to create private spaces for our mixed gender workforce, the kitchen might not necessarily be a privacy issue. But while the station's open, it's it's more fiscally prudent for us to deal with it while it's all open, rather than button it all up and then tear the kitchen out later.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So that one time funding could be used to offset the cost of that sort of stuff too, I guess. Right. Right now what I'm doing in my head is I'm trying to figure out what the best use of this money is.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean, it's accurate to say that it should have been slid back to the to to the sidewalk fund and divide among council districts. I don't have a problem with people having that opinion. I'm just wondering if a better place for this money right now is in the fire budget, given that you are opening walls and you'",
        "'speaker_2': 'have old fire stations and you find a lot of needs when you do go in to remodel and then you have some equipment needs that you described to me on the phone today. So I'm just have the position that it's probably better off staying in the fire department budget at this time, that that's my point of view'",

        "'speaker_6': 'That's right. Go public first, Mr. Arora.'",

But I'll also point out that, you know, 500,000 on a $400 million general fund is one eighth of 1%.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Hopefully we're to entertain those requests all the time. But in this particular case, I think there's a principle to be upheld here to follow the council direction. And I would like to see that money restored. And, you know, perhaps the council might look at a subsequent meeting and say, hey, you know, the best use for that is'",
        "'speaker_6': 'not sidewalks. The best use for that in my district or across city wide is to put it back in the fire department. And that's a decision that the city council can make it on any Tuesday.'",

I did want to get some clarity on the budget because as I recall, during the last budget process, we did appropriate one time moneys for gender accommodations in the fire department.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We've done that for a couple of years in a row.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I don't think that was enough to finish the entire need. But I think on a go forward basis, we were looking at looking at doing that again in the 2015 budget cycle. I certainly hope the mayor will put that and take that into consideration as he brings forth the budget.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So so with that, I support the motion as set forth. Thank you. So now my only point when when you look at the gender equity issue in particular is that we were in a legal situation where there's been some legal activity and we need to pay attention to that so that we don't get caught in a lawsuit'",
        "'speaker_2': '. That's why I believe that's so important. But either way.'",
