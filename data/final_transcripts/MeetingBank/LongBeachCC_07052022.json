        "'speaker_2': 'It is. Brant is on the line. Do we have him available?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yeah. Tom, this is Brian here. I also have Ted Stevens, who oversees our aquatics program, which would include the swim program. My recollection, though, the grant application, because of its funding limit, we've historically just applied for our three pools, although I would say in the future, because we're really working closely with Long Beach Unified School District to'",

But for this coming summer, which actually starts tomorrow and runs through the final Friday in August, that will be our summer swim program for Kings, Silverado and Belmont.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thanks, Brian. I would just say, you know, I know that we don't have our pool in North Lombard yet. We will have one someday. But the joint use that Jordan is is available to us. So as we apply for grants, we should keep that in mind because, you know, a fifth of the city's youth live in the'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Um, currently my pool is, uh, and a temporary pool. And so there's a shuttle process between the children and elderly in the Belmont area to the Kings Park pool. I was just there over the weekend and witnessed it with my own eyes as I brought some of my seniors in the neighborhood to the pool where there's a'",
        "'speaker_6': 'space capacity. And so I'm just curious what relation to this funding. How is it that we're going to be able to impact the lives and target specifically economically disadvantaged youth if the economically disadvantaged youth that live in the neighborhood are still unable to use the pool during the busiest time of the year due to, um, you know'",
        "'speaker_6': ', the swim, uh, spots being taken up by people outside the sixth district. I can't speak for relation to Silverado. Um, but I did bring it up to the Director of Parks that the people from our neighborhood in the Kings Park area are told by staff at the pool that they should go to Silverado Park to swim.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I'm hoping that if we're going to be getting some of this money, that we can somehow prioritize or make some type of quota system for residents in the area rather than, uh, continually being directed to go to a pool on the west side.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'We have a lot of progress, a lot of lessons learned over the past two years. You know, the Long Beach advancing piece was a great example. This was community building and community outreach that started down in the AOC seven and West, the Washington neighborhood area.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And last January, February, the city council asked them to bring it forward, to expand it to north and other parts of town. And that work was rewarded with a $3.9 million grant to expand a number of programs from safe passages to a whole host of things.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That's all good. We support all those things. We also saw last year after a successful pilot of the the Neighborhood Walks program in the Washington neighborhood, some significant results. We saw and we saw upwards of 40% drop in shootings in the Washington neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Now, we can't say it was directly a result of the neighborhood walks, but there's a correlation there. The city council has to expand that program to North. So we did a pilot last summer and that program and that pilot in the summer, we also saw emergency calls reduced by 7.6%.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'And look at that data and look at those best practices and say now is the time for us to go in and expand it.

We're asking as a part of this proposal that one, we take the best practices we learned through the Neighborhood Walks program and the investment we did during the safety'",
        "'speaker_8': 'recovery into the into the Bike Beats initiative and expand that. I think it was called the Neighborhood Safe Streets Initiative in the Safety Recovery Plan, and we expand that citywide. Now, this request puts the number at 25. I'm flexible.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It doesn't have to be the number 25. It could be more. It can be less. I think the idea here is if it was for last year, we want to see something across the whole city in a in a way that people actually feel the presence and see an investment program.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so as this proposal moves through the budget process, we want to see a more substantial commitment to community policing, these specific community policing programs. I believe that it's time for us to go all in. We've seen again, we've seen the evidence.'",

You know, we've been having conversation about what does it mean to build trust, to increase transparency and accountability.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And this is one of the program that was piloted in the aftermath of the framework for reconciliation being approved, and also ways that we can basically improve our relationships with our police department as well as our community. And I thought and we've been getting regular updates on it and it's been received really warmly in the community.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that's why I also agree that it's a great idea to expand it. I think that one of the last conversation we had at Public Safety Committee meeting was about more than just preventing violence. It's been advancing peace.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And in order to do that, it's about connection. It's about building relationship. It's about engagement. And that's what exactly this Neighborhood Walks program does and just really appreciate the collaboration, collaborative effort our departments are taking with police and our fire department and our Health and Human Services and many others in how we're addressing ways to advance peace'",
        "'speaker_1': '. And so I want to just think some of the neighborhood groups that have submitted a letter of support, such as the North Long Beach Neighborhood Alliance, that includes, it looks like two, four, six, eight, all ten of the neighborhood associations, as well as the Wrigley Neighborhood Association, president of the Belmont Shore Resident Association, the Fourth Street Business'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Improvement District, the Bluff Park Neighborhood Association, AOC Seven Neighborhood Association, as well as the Long Beach Convention and Visitors Bureau.

        "'speaker_4': 'I. Yes. Thank you. Vice Mayor or just, you know, leads on this very important item. And I appreciate you allowing myself and Councilman Ciro to our to sign on to this. As a former police officer, I have worked around many my unit officers, and I know that they thoroughly enjoy the far deeper community engagement that they are'",
        "'speaker_4': 'able to have in that assignment. I saw that they had a different mission set than regular patrol officers and that they truly embraced the opportunity to build relationships and trust with the communities that they were assigned. And as a former business owner, both me and my staff love the bike units assigned to our area.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They would frequently stop by and chat. Keep us posted on issues in the area and ask if there were any concerns. And now, as a councilwoman, I have heard from residents and business owners about how much they too appreciate seeing officers on foot and on bikes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So with all three lived experiences, I am a very strong supporter of this initiative and thank you to the officers who are already out there walking and biking and the beats of our neighborhoods. I have heard from folks in Zakaria and in downtown just about how much safer that they feel.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Sara, for reading off all of the all of the folks that are supporting this. So I won't do that. But I can tell you that our community feels safer and has a greater connection to officers when they just stop by and chat and say hi and just check in on on folks.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I know that the residents of the Second District feel strongly that more community oriented walking and biking beats would improve the safety and just the community relations with our officers. I too have also received all these comments in letters and support.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I just appreciate so many folks from the second district who have written in. I appreciate that. What I what I'm also vice mayor would would like for the proposal from the department is just you know how are how are we going to or how do we plan to track the work of the new unit, and which'",
        "'speaker_4': 'includes the effectiveness of productivity, the amount of engagement? Just it would be nice for us just to have clear expectations from the chain of command and how that the council offices will be able to be briefed on this and provide some input for consideration.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So just thank you again. I appreciate you, Vice Mayor, and I really am excited about this item. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Think you have some customers that are queued up. Councilman Price.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And I love this item. Do we actually have a program called Bicycle Beats? Does the city manager. Can you answer that question?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I asked the police chief to talk about that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Councilmember. We don't have a program called bicycle beats per se, but we do have a bike unit that's assigned to it, currently assigned to the South Division.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Right. And we have the commanders have the ability to make a decision about walking beats and bicycle beats. Right. I know that's something we talk to our commander a lot. And I agree that bicycle patrols are very, very popular.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I know that the commanders have some discretion in that. Can you talk about that a little bit?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes, Councilwoman, the the commanders, the divisional commanders maintain operational control of their resources. So they do have the ability to do things like put officers out on the street to walk and bring officers into for bike patrols or community policing.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'However, that has to be based on their staffing and the staffing that they have available, because their priority is really calls for service in emergency response. So depending on the situation, the staffing they have available to them and the circumstances they do have the ability do to either use overtime, utilize overtime to do those things or create'",
        "'speaker_8': 'units within their divisions.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's great. So I know that this item asks for the city manager to incorporate some of these ideas in the city manager's budget. But I just want to get a sense of the timing. The city manager, you've already submitted your proposed budget to the mayor, is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. In the charter deadline, we have until July 1st to do that. So it has been prepared from the city manager's proposed budget and it is now in the comment period and review period from the mayor and will be released by the end of July and beginning of August.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Now, I know the council, the full council hasn't had a chance to see that proposed budget, but I'm assuming some people in your office and the mayor's office have seen the proposed budget, is that right?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And is there and I know you can't go into the details of the proposed budget, but I know the chief has been talking to us in public safety a lot about some of his community policing measures. Is a bike patrol measure already something that's included in the proposed budget that you've submitted?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I can't really get into specifics on the budget. We don't do that until we actually go through the full process and we have it released by the mayor with his recommendations as well. That said, we have a new police chief who's very much in favor of bike units, of neighborhood policing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'He's been listening to what the council, the whole council has been talking about in this area. It's been a popular program. We've gotten some grants to be able to support this work in in various areas of the city, and it's proven to be effective.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we are looking at these types of components. And the police chief is going to have a proposal in the budget to look at how we kind of restructure within the police department as well as some additional resources that he'd like to propose as part of the manager's proposed budget.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. But that's the manager's proposed budget. That includes the police chief's recommendation that was submitted already on Friday, correct?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. And then just in general, I want to make sure that I love love that we're finally advocating for adding to our police department. I know that some were hesitant to do that in the past, and I'm glad we're doing that and talking about it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I also want to make sure that we don't impact our current patrol numbers, because I know that's an area that is causing a little bit of stress for our officers having sufficient patrol units. Is that something that in addition to the.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Police.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Chief's recommendations that are included in the budget that you've already submitted to the mayor for comment on, have we given consideration to how community policing efforts might impact or augment our patrol resources?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So again, without getting into specifics, I do want to confirm anything we do in the budget is not going to affect patrol beat, so we're not going to be affecting what we currently have for patrol. In fact, it's going to be looking at other ways to augment some of that, some of that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we're not taking from that area. We are looking at like the entire city budget where units are aligned. And so that'll be something the police chief will look at, but not patrol beats.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's great. Fantastic. That's what I wanted to know. But I wholeheartedly support this item and of course, pretty much any proposal that would add more officers to our department. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Ross. And please.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. You know, I have to say thank you to Jim divers who brought this item forward. You know, I think it's consistent with, you know, most of the city council members who have had the opportunity to work with over the last ten years.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I have never heard one city councilmember or one person from the community say that they didn't want more community policing. Right. And so I think this is a really a no brainer to support. I certainly support community policing have always been supportive of community policing, but obviously knows how we apply that.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'I'm really thankful that you're not just looking to overtime. I think that there's also a big difference, at least in the data that we're seeing.

        "'speaker_3': 'And our our younger generation is just not in that same mindset. And I think that the number one most important thing, and I think this really builds on what Councilman's and Day has said, is that those officers need to be in a fresh and community focused, engaging position.'",

So I look forward to seeing the proposal that was in Chief US City Manager Monica's budget to see what that looked like in your mind before getting the council input, because I know that you're really in tune with the officers.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'At least that's what I'm hearing from the boots on the ground. And I really appreciate that. Thank you for coming to our community meeting. And there's just a tone about what you're doing with our officers that I just want to keep that going and support it.'",

        "'speaker_8': ', you know, during the neighborhood walks, it felt really good. And we want to start you want to make that structural. We want to invest in that because we had a very difficult two years. So the more we can have people out walking the beat, if you notice the larger support also have business improvement district saying the very'",
        "'speaker_8': 'same thing. You know, folks in downtown saying we need help. Sure, we have bid we have bid security. But, you know, we want to see our, you know, police be helping us out. And I know and you know, the last program, they called it the Neighborhood Safe Streets.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Your website says a number of things on the patrol bureau, says bicycle beats, says K-9 beats. So we just pick bicycle beats off your website because it sounded cooler. But whatever you want to call it, Mr. Chief, call it whatever you like.'",

So absolutely whatever mechanism we can do, I think people want to know that we're making investments that are smart and and produce the results that we hope that they will produce.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So tracking data and all of that makes a whole lot of sense. So if we could put some thought into that, how you can make sure that happens in the budget would be great.

And the number one thing that I know comes up at our side of town community meetings is not just the petty theft, but the other number one idea that's very co-leaders in the fight is really the traffic issues in our'",
        "'speaker_3': 'city and how we've worked really hard with the traffic engineer to design changes that that make that difference. But until we're out there enforcing the law on a regular basis, we just don't have the compliance that we really need from both anyone driving in our city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman. Sir.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Thank you, Councilmember Price, for bringing this item forward. I think we've talked about traffic as well as pedestrian safety quite a number of time in our public safety committee. And while I do agree that we do need enforcement, we've also talk about doing education.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we do prevention around various impaired driving to making sure that our roads are safer by working with public works, to ensuring that we're just getting people to slow down and not drive so fast as well as on our Health and Human Services Department side.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And how are we making sure to educate pedestrians as drivers about how best to walk or proceed accordingly? And also in the end, it's reducing just collisions and injury. So it's taking a less told our not our fire department as well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I just wanted to make sure to acknowledge that, that while I do think we do need enforcement, we also need kind of a collaborative effort with our other departments, too. And so I think that we also have received some grants recently around doing education as well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right, Chief?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes, Councilwoman. We have the OTS grant where some of that funding goes to not only the police department, but the health department to provide educational campaigns and efforts for the community.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'How much was that?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I don't have the exact funding number, but I can report back on that for you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Come from Boston.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And I'm happy to second this motion. Obviously, we have a mission as a city to be a Vision zero city and reduce traffic fatalities and accidents across our city. But these are daily realities that we deal with in our communities.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And there are major corridors that impact many people, particularly pedestrians and businesses. So I'm happy to support this as I want to be consistent and just make a friendly request to the maker of the motion to allow us to to look at this a little closer to the budget oversight process.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That is the appropriate place for this item to be. We're talking this close to the budget season, and I think it's important for us to, you know, really, really dig in, see process and look at these proposals. And so I'm happy to support this.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This is headed in the right direction. It's good to hear the data, but like I said, I'd like to get into it a little deeper in terms of understanding personnel numbers and and, you know, how we can we can we can help improve traffic enforcement in the city of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I can tell you that I am already prepared for the first week of school. Right, for school year. Usually, you know, there's a dramatic demand for traffic enforcement around our schools, in our neighborhoods. That never changes year after year after year.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So obviously, I like to be in a position to move an item, but also be in a position to to be prepared for the demand that we're going to have during the school season, school year, because there is opportunity as number provision to educate parents, educate the public about, you know, the hazards of driving behavior, particularly in'",
        "'speaker_7': 'school zones. So I'm happy to support this and hope to see a further Barbie AOC.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. That concludes your public comment. I'm sorry on this item.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'If there are any members of the public that would like to speak on item 38 in person, please sign up at the podium in Zoom. Please use the race cam feature or dial star nine. See none. That concludes public comment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. There is a motion and I just want to clarify that. I know that he he queued on hybrid, but Councilor Austin wanted to be the second to the motion councilman Mongo. Okay, so the motion and a second member's piece couldn't catch your votes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The Mayor I had some questions as well. I cued up.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You're. I'm so. I'm sorry. You're right. You did keep up, and I'd have you on here, so call Councilman Allen.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'All right? No worries. No worries. I know it's tough with this hybrid. And so I'm. Thank you, Mayor. And again, I support this full valley. Wholeheartedly support this. I think this is great. I do have a question, Chief, if you were there.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So Councilwoman Pryce brought up the the drugs. And so I have a question regarding that myself being a former degree. And I know how much time and effort goes into that. Is there a need for us to do that anymore?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And the reason I'm asking that is, you know, we don't really prosecute for 1150 anymore. I mean, drugs have pretty much been decriminalized. So is the juice of a of a degree even worth, you know, the squeeze on our budget?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I just I know we need them for maybe felony DUIs, but is that necessary as we beef up the traffic division to actually have certified drugs?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So. Thank you, Councilwoman. The DRC training is essential and it's important. And the reason being is that, you know what you're referring to for the 1155, those are under the influence, although that might not be the primary mission of a drug recognition expert.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And even with the changes in legislation, driving under the influence is still an issue. And so having a drug that can recognize when substances beyond just alcohol are on board with a driver involved in a traffic collision or a fatality is very important.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So it is additional training that just enhances an officer's ability to address impaired driving.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. So are you using then diaries and sorry, because I've been gone for so long. I'm just. Just. Are you using drugs? Do they go to respond to all traffic collisions or is that just depending on availability?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So thank you, Councilwoman. That's depending on availability. If they are available, they they are called for and respond. However, officers are still able to articulate symptoms and symptomology to make arrests related to impaired driving, even if they are not diaries.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The DRI program just provides an enhanced level of training and certification that helps with the prosecution.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay, good. So so these programs, which are like traffic programs all throughout the city, are really important, I think, to everyone in every district. So this would still be beefed up regardless of DUI certifications, is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm sorry, Councilwoman. I don't know if I understand the question correctly. The dairy program would still be increased. Is that what you're talking?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes. I mean, we're we're still going to increase, but. But is the beefing up? Yes. The traffic division. Is that dependent on getting those officers certified?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'No, ma'am. That those are the traffic vacancies that I currently have that I would like to fill.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay, great. Okay. Thank you so much, Chief. I appreciate all your good work.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilman Fischer. Thank you. You're quite up again, correct?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes. It's just real quick. So I love the questions that Councilman Allen asked. So spot on. Right now, the only way that we can prosecute the misdemeanor DUI offense is a vehicle code sections 23, 152, C, D, E and S.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Those are the drug or combo DUIs. They're misdemeanor offenses. So the drugs are really necessary to prosecute those cases because in California, there's no per se level of impairment like there is with alcohol at a point. There's no four sigma level for drugs.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So the only expert that can come to court and opine that someone was impaired for the purposes of driving really is a degree and the chief is right. Other officers can opine, but the testimony of a degree in court in terms of whether drugs were a factor or a combination factor in someone's impairment, can really only be'",
        "'speaker_4': 'done by a degree. That's why the California Office of Traffic Safety, OTS, provides so many different grants related to drugs. And that's why CHP has really been trying to push a DRP stipend for different agencies. And CHP is willing to assist law enforcement agencies with that kind of a stipend because we saw a huge increase in DUI'",
        "'speaker_4': 'drug cases from DUI alcohol cases since the passage of Prop 64 and some other legislation that changed the number of DUI cases that we had that were either combination or drugs only. So drugs are huge. And the item that I brought specifically talks not just about DUIs, but street takeovers, loud pipes and speeding and running of spot'",
        "'speaker_4': 'stoplights stop lights and stop signs. So the traffic enforcement team hopefully can address all of those things. DUIs were just one of the items that I enumerated in my item. And and to Councilman Austin's point, yes, absolutely. They should come back to The O.C. for further discussion.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I just want to highlight that my item tonight talks about existing budgeted positions, not budgeting more. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. We are going to go ahead and go to a vote. Let me let me just two announcements here. We go to a vote. The city one city attorney has asked me just to remind folks to keep their cameras on just for the council rules.'",
