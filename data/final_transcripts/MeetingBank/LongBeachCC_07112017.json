    "Recommendation to request City Manager to report on a new Clean Long Beach Initiative in 120 days. The report should include goals and an update to City Council at a special study session set by the Mayor.": [
        "'speaker_0': 'So one announcement and then we're going to move on to our our items. Our first item is item 21, Madam Clerk.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Communication for Mayor Garcia recommendation or request of city manager to report on a new clean Long Beach initiative.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. So I wanted to just begin by saying this is on the agenda. Tonight is really a culmination of a lot of conversation that the council has had on a variety of topics when it comes to ensuring that we have a clean community and a safe community that's litter free.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I believe that a clean and beautiful city is a core service and a core thing that people look for and in every neighborhood across the community should have access to a clean neighborhood, a well manicured, street efficient trash services, clean alleys, clean walkways.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so we want to make sure that we kind of redouble our efforts in this area, if we remember the city. Probably ten, 15 years ago had some real issues when it came to cleanliness. We had graffiti that would often stay on buildings for weeks at a time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We had a lot of trash all over the city, and I think we got pretty serious, particularly about ten years ago, and focusing on those issues. We started a rapid response around graffiti and eliminated that time to about 24 to 48 hours.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We put in some teams and dedicated code enforcement that would do proactive code enforcement, which was great. And then during the recession, we lost actually some of those efforts. And so a lot of the work around code enforcement, around proactive cleanup and proactive beautification really slowed down.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Now, fortunately, over the last few years, the city council has been very committed, whether it's to focusing on dumped items or whether it's been focusing on expanding clean team service across the city. But I know I believe I know the council believes that we can do a lot more.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We should not be satisfied with the level of cleanliness that we have on our streets today in Long Beach. While we have some streets and communities that certainly are are maintained, but by local residents more and are cleaner, we still have large parts of our city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And really, every part of our community can be cleaner and better maintained. And so there's a variety of actions on here. And I want to just kind of briefly go over some and why they're why they're important. The motion asks the city to review all of our efforts around clean out of the clean and safe team and'",
        "'speaker_0': 'our investments that we've made to improve response capabilities. I want to review the work regarding the illegal dumping action plan that the Council requested earlier this year. It's a review of the clean team operations for improvements or efficiencies.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This one's important. I want the city to officially map every single freeway onramp and off ramp and work to improve cleanliness and conditions across the city. Caltrans has indicated to me that they're willing to work with us more in this, but we have to also be aware of where exactly every off ramp and onramp is and which'",
        "'speaker_0': 'ones are problematic across the city. Because I don't know about you, but I'm tired of driving on to an off of our freeways with large trash that we can't clean because it's Caltrans property. This includes a review of all of our trash cans citywide to identify opportunities to replace and or add trash cans to our budget process'",
        "'speaker_0': '. I'd like to explore a city ordinance around locking trash cans in alleys. There are some cities that require dumpsters to be locked in their alleyways. We don't require that whether or not we want to pilot that in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I have heard from some neighbors. There have been some businesses that have done this on their own. And it's unbelievable how much more clean those alleys have become overnight when they lock their large trash bins. And so it's happening already across the city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We don't require it. Should we require it? I want to see if that's something that we should do or not do. I want to review all of our supermarket and retailer shopping cart theft technology systems. This city passed probably an ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I want to say maybe 12 years ago that required major retailers to begin to include shopping cart locks systems on their shopping carts. How should we expand that and go and add additional stores, including smaller stores that still include shopping carts?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We're seeing more shopping carts across the city. I think we have to review the current technology. Is it working in all of the stores and tighten that up? We want to modernize our Golden Beach app, something this council's brought up numerous occasions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We need to, once and for all purchase a customer relationship management system so that every time a resident can communicate with the city about an issue, it's available online. And a record of that person is kept for every department to look at over one interface.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We should review our graffiti standards. We should look at the staffing levels for proactive code enforcement, which we don't do currently because we lost during the recession. Also, laws around private and public lots and how we can strengthen those lots from being left with the trash.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It is the responsibility of the property owner to keep those up. It doesn't always happen. We want to work with Long Beach Transit to ensure that every bus stop is well lit and. Has trash can service. We'd love to revisit a new litter free Long Beach campaign with our schools.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We'd love to work with our kids more. And then the last two things is one is consider establishing a citywide volunteer corps that would work with neighborhood services staff for citywide cleanup events. I know that we do these regularly through council offices, which is great, but it would be great to have a consistent volunteer corps that's accessible'",
        "'speaker_0': 'to the city for large scale cleanups. And finally, explore any marketing campaigns that the city can be involved with. To do this, I'm really hoping that that staff will put this on the agenda because this is important. I've told staff that every city, every single city employee should be involved, whether it's a manager to a employee doing'",
        "'speaker_0': 'code enforcement involved in making our city look better and be a better place for our community. It's a I think it's a basic service we should be providing. And right now, the city is not the level of cleanliness that it should be, and we've got to do a better job.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I hope that this organizes this effort. I'd love to get a report back from staff about what we're doing. I've asked all of this information to come back at a study session to the council, can ask a lot of questions and that we can get a plan in place so that one year from now we'",
        "'speaker_0': 'can look back and see that the city is dramatically a cleaner place. And so that is the item. I know there are some comments. I'm going to start with the maker of the motion by Councilman Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes, Mayor, I'd like to thank you. I know this has been a major sticking point for you personally, having worked with you for many years. But for our city, I know just driving anywhere in the city, we see this abundance of litter and it doesn't make us put on our best impression to outsiders of the city.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I would certainly love this item. And I want to thank you, Mayor, for bringing this forward. A couple of things that I want to add in addition to what the mayor had addressed. For one, I know many people have asked, as we were talking about expanded polystyrene, etc., is about a litter audit.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Perhaps this could be entertained, but it'd be an annual litter audit to ensure that we're understanding what the physical makeup is of the trash that pollutes our streets and waterways. And secondly, he mentioned the trash receptacles, which I think is great.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I know big bands are often, you know, talked about in our districts. I think those would be beneficial as well. I would also like to see a way we can get creative with our city prosecutor's office in terms of our volunteerism as well.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I know we have the program where they come out, they volunteer and pick up trash or they do some, you know, some minor work at some of our events. And so perhaps that's another opportunity or other volunteers, whether that's through, as the mayor mentioned, through this corps or perhaps youth opportunities through Pacific Gateway, through our workforce development'",
        "'speaker_6': '. And then lastly, the CRM or the constituent relationship management system. I can't speak enough to that. I know that it's still very important. Currently in my I work for Microsoft and we use Google at my office, if you can consider that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But we, we, we really need something like that. I think that just goes beyond just litter and tracking that. I think just for constituent cases in general, it's definitely needed. It's something that will keep us efficient, keep us on track in our city council offices, but also just citywide.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I definitely recommend that as well. And then lastly, as a lastly, a breakdown of current code enforcement timely timelines to clean up a property based on violation, a current list of properties that have received extensions for cleaning up their property and opportunities.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I think that's already included. But I would also like to just emphasize that we need to get a little bit more aggressive on that as well. I think far too long, so many property owners are given some extensions and it just delays the process and cleanliness.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So thank you again to the mayor and I look forward to seeing this return.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. The second councilmember Orengo.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you very much. I want all to want to thank the mayor for bringing this forward. I know it's one of those situations where we look at the city as our pride and joy and there's nothing else like we treated our own house.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'You know, we have been my guests. We want to make sure that it's clean, that it's litter free, that it's acceptable for treating our guests here. So that's the way I look at it. And as far as having a clean city, we also look at what our infrastructure is.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I think this goes very well with our major aid moneys in terms of getting our potholes fixed and our sidewalks and our trees trimmed and keeping our our neighborhoods up to speed in regards to making it a welcoming environment and clean our trash and keeping our streets passable and our sidewalks.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Certainly adds to all that. And I know, Councilmember. Gonzalez added a few. I'm sure I'll have a few, but I don't have any today. But during a study session, when our staff comes back with their recommendations, I'm sure that there's going to be some additional things that we can add to it.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But I want to I want to start this conversation and looking forward to the study later on.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Pryce.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I want to thank the mayor for bringing this item to and beyond just bringing the item and opening the discussion. I want to acknowledge the quality of the item itself. This item is is expertly drafted in the sense that obviously someone put a lot of time and effort into identifying and providing very specific suggestions.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I think that's really important. I appreciate items like this. I have in the past tried to bring items like this, and I think some people might think they're intense or a little, you know, too specific. But I think it just shows that you have given thought to every aspect of the particular item and evaluated opportunities for'",
        "'speaker_6': 'the city and provided suggestions for the city of areas that they can explore, that staff can explore and provided some direction. So I really, really appreciate items like this because it gives a lot of direction. Not that people need direction, but I think it's important kind of to get a starting point.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I really appreciate the item. I think that the trash cans in the alleys is a fantastic idea. I think it's it's something that we hear about from our residents all the time. In addition to cleanliness, I think there some public safety benefits of having locked trash cans in the alley because we do have a lot of'",
        "'speaker_6': 'people going through the trash cans at night and a lot of our homes back up to an alley. So I think that would be fantastic. I would support that tomorrow. The other thing that I've I've often talked to our Parks Rec and Marine team about is the possibility of having consistent trash cans throughout the city.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we have big bellies in some areas. We have some of the blue trash cans in the parks. Some of our trash cans are covered. Some of our trash cans are not covered, allowing trash to blow, especially near bodies of water.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So if we could consider having consistent trash cans, I think that would be good. The on ramp, off ramp, our staff actually today aborted a mission that they started a couple of weeks ago, which was taking photos of every on ramp, an off ramp off the 405 in the city of Long Beach, because this is an item'",
        "'speaker_6': 'that we had planned to bring to council because the condition of the off ramps and on ramps are horrific. They it's not just trash. There are potholes. The paint has completely worn off some of the on ramps and off ramps.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There's weeds growing completely out of control. And it doesn't matter what part of the city you're in. They all every single off ramp, an on ramp looks terrible. And I don't understand why that's not the same situation in other cities.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You know, when you get off the off ramp in Irvine, for example, you're you're not, you know, rupturing a tire because of the level of the potholes that you have to drive over. So I don't understand that. And so I would love a report back on how that resource is allocated within Caltrans and how we can maybe'",
        "'speaker_6': 'work towards bettering that. I mean, I really like the idea of a volunteer corps. I will say one of the things that is very frustrating for me and perhaps some of my colleagues is we often hear that there's a lack of resources, and I understand that in response to that, we try to get creative and we organize'",
        "'speaker_6': 'the community and we try to get community cleanup efforts and community planting efforts. And then we're then there's a lot of why we can't do those things. So whether there are legal parameters or organizational parameters, whatever the case may be, it's like we don't we don't want to hear is we don't have the resources and we can't'",
        "'speaker_6': 'use volunteers because then there's no response. There is no answer. So I would love for this report to include some sort of a mechanism that takes away that level of frustration. I understand resources are limited, but if we're willing to get the workforce in place to try to mitigate some of these issues, why can't we do that'",
        "'speaker_6': '? Why can't we find a way to make that happen? So bravo to the mayor for bringing this item. Oh, the other thing is, I think the report should really include some more education for us on noticing requirements. So when people leave items behind, there's a noticing period prior to the removal of the items that are left in'",
        "'speaker_6': 'public. Would it be possible for us to reduce the number of days that are required for something to be noticed prior to removal? That would be great. And I think that that when we don't pick things up as quickly as we can, I think there's a lot of negative feelings that develop among the residents because they're continually'",
        "'speaker_6': 'looking at these items for days on end. So with that, thank you, Mr. Mayor. And I completely support this discussion and where it's headed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilmember Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes. I also really appreciate the item and I know it's something that you've talked about a lot and it's something I fully support a proactive, integrated approach to cleaning up our neighborhoods. I feel, deputy, since our first month in office, has been doing two days a week where he drives around and does proactive field work.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I wanted to share some of the numbers to demonstrate what a difference you can see. The first month that we the month prior to us being in office, there were 167 reportedly illegally dumped items reported and resolved in that first month.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'After April, we are April numbers were around 357 resolved issues. And so you can see whenever you're being proactive, you can really have a double the impact. And so I think going back to our trash cans, I think one of my big things I've talked to staff about and talked to will be transit about is the big'",
        "'speaker_4': 'belly trash cans are a great way to make sure that people aren't digging through our trash and then leaving trash around that we should have those at every single bus stop. Bus stops are where you can see a lot of trash that gathers around.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And not only that, but they're also a great opportunity to use for whether we're doing education campaigns around some of our health initiatives, whether it's around recycling. But they provide us another avenue to communicate with residents. The other thing that I think has been really helpful and I want to say that we support is looking at getting'",
        "'speaker_4': 'volunteers out. What we've done in my district is also doing neighborhood audits. So we go out with Craftsman Village or we go out with Rosa Parks and we walk every single street talk about where the trash is due, their graffiti pickups, and really try to identify those areas so that we can have volunteers out there.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I would like to also have an understanding of what the education is around big item pickups. So it particularly in my district where we have a lot of turnover and resident because we have a lot of apartments. How are we making sure that residents in those buildings understand what's available to them?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And is there a way for us to increase that? Because maybe you guys staff have you could answer for me how many large item pickups does a building get per year without having to pay a fee? Sorry, I know that's a spring on you question.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think it's one you can it might be more.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'For residential households. I believe it's two in terms of buildings that have to be more. We'd have to get that information for apartment buildings.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If we can include that in the report, I think that would be a way for us to make sure that we have less illegally dumped items, and that is it. So congratulations on bringing this item forward. Thank.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Andrew.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, thank you. You know, first of all, I want to thank you for bringing this item forward. I'd like to suggest that the code enforcement be added to the go along with APP also. And my staff does weekly drive through the district and report illegal dumping and graffiti, which is why I know how our streets are looking'",
        "'speaker_2': '. You know, the thing I think that we have, you know, as various ways that we can do more, which is why I support this item. But the biggest part about it, I think you as a resident and a person who lives next to an individual, like we just said, we get free dumping.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So if you know someone, if you're planning on moving, just don't throw your whole furniture out in the middle of the street. You know, tell someone and we will help you get that taken care of. You lobby individuals, you move and you throw everything out in the middle of the street.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We'll get it up, but just don't leave it out there. So I'm making this a suggestion for you as an individual. If your neighbor, you know, their moving, say, hey, we can get that taken care. So that's the only thing I have to say.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And, you know, just to that point and then I go to Councilman Mongo and this is something to add to what Councilman Andrew said is we should also work with our apartment owner partners. And I know some of them are here and how do we get information to them so that the tenants are aware that'",
        "'speaker_0': 'there are pickups and that we can help instead of seeing all the stuff out on the street? Councilman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes, I am excited about this item. It is a lot similar to item 24, which is proposed tonight by Lena. Councilwoman Gonzalez. Councilmember Super not myself related to similar issues that we have in the parks related to this item.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I want to make sure to emphasize how proud I am that the mayor's including an item that has been near and dear to my heart since the day elected and I have not been able to see the movement I have encouraged for our CRM system.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It is unmanageable that we don't have a system that connects with our community in a meaningful way. I love the goal of reach out for the ways in which it does work, but I love that the logo along each app is included in this item because it still needs significant improvement.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Furthermore, I think that it's time to address, and I can say it here and now and put it in this item as well as item 24. The condition of our public bathrooms throughout the city, the condition of our public bathrooms in some cases is exemplary and in other cases it's just not acceptable.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And we need to work on that. Additionally, weeds on our corridors and. The timeliness of weed removal and how we can better partner with a lot of our nonprofits in the community with that workforce. I know that in the fifth District we've done that a lot, but it needs to be something that's regular and scheduled and thoughtful'",
        "'speaker_7': 'in terms of a schedule. And finally with the trashcans, I agree it would be great if we had universal trash cans that were similar and branded throughout the city. I would also like to recommend a Adopt a Trashcan program so that when these trash cans are put out into the city, many people don't realize how expensive they'",
        "'speaker_7': 'are. They can be upwards of $5,000. And so when there are fundraising campaigns and they exceed their goals of a nonprofit, wants to adopt a trash can and pay for a trash can to be branded with their nonprofit.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think that there's just a lot that can be said about that. We currently have the Parks Partnership Program that was brought to this council several months ago, and the partners, the partnership opportunities are available within Parks and Rec to sponsor a trash can, sponsor a bench, sponsor any of those things.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But citywide, that should be an option. You should be able to adopt a trash can on any commercial corridor. So there's also in our commercial corridor, we are allowing businesses to adopt the trash can in terms of there's no trash can here.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We in this business corridor want trash cans. We recognize there are some specific issues related to the city being able to maintenance those trash cans. So each of the business owners has come forward and said, I'm going to bring that trash can.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And every night it's not one of the affixed ones. And or I will empty it every night if it is affixed because of the issues related to not having lids in the things. So there are communities out there that want to help with this and we need to make sure that there are methods and avenues for that'",
        "'speaker_7': 'to be a possibility. So thank you again for the opportunity. And I know we're going to have a little bit of a repeat on item 24, but for the community to know how important this is to us, both in the community and in the parks, I think is important.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Vice Mayor Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And I want to say thank you and acknowledge you for for thinking broadly and including a lot of the work that our city staff is working on, a lot of the issues raised by the council in the past, and they want to be careful that we are very specific in terms of what we'",
        "'speaker_9': 'want to see. What I don't want to happen is we raise an expectation and it's and is difficult to meet. So I want to be as specific as we can about, you know, where we want to be in terms of like where we're going to prioritize our focus here in District nine.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So the 91 freeway only bisects it only it only sort of goes through District nine. So we deal with these on and off ramp issues pretty regularly. I actually remember grabbing the when I was chief of staff to Councilman Neal.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We are I got the district director for our local senator. We got the Caltrans representative and we literally got on a van and drove on and off every off ramp. And we accomplished that with about 75 letters from residents to Caltrans about the condition of the off ramps.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And it made a difference for a little while because like Councilwoman Price said, you know, since we border a lot of other cities, we would see the difference when you leave Long Beach, an entire Bellflower complete difference in terms of the offering.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I want to be real specific about, you know, let's think about let's think about what we can do specifically in Long Beach, just last week, just last week, I believe me and Mr. West went on and off an off ramp in Bellflower to show on the difference between a Bellflower the belt with bell flowers done.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I remember, Mr. West, you said it took about ten years or something to get to get there. What they've done, they've literally enhanced it. They did bio soils, all this other stuff. But it's a beautiful entryway to the city, but it took them about ten years and the city took over that off.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So so I do want to be really specific about what we want to do. There's a lot of interest to do in the Bellflower off ramp, and I don't know that that's actually possible within the scope of what we're talking about here, but there are some things we can do.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I also want to suggest, you know, someone brought up the adopt to adopt a highway. Our residents, our neighbors in the in the Hamilton neighborhood in Long Beach just finished the process of adopting the 91 embankment adjacent to their neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'They they're beautifying it. They've got a mural going up. They've they're literally taking that work on.

Whether someone's picking up trash or not just made a huge difference to have those there. And the final thing I'll say is that we've tried, you know, it's all hands on deck approach in North Long Beach'",

And what it is, is simply challenging the residents to do as many cleanups on their block, on their street as they can within a, you know, a month or so.'",

I think here across the board, education is the key and we have to get everyone educated and I think we have to enlist the help of the private sector for that.'",

And I have to give recognition to Frank Ramirez of Public Works, because I've had this discussion about locking dumpsters for a long time. I think the official position of public works right now is that we do not like locking trash cans.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The net effect is that more trash is left outside the trash can for folks who can't get in. Now, I don't think that policy has to stay static. I think with education we could come up with a solution.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But we're back to that education word again. I think the well, really, that's that's the key. And all the neighborhood cleanups and whatnot, we can coordinate those better, I believe. And and really that's it. I think education is the key outreach.'",

That's not the case. And alleys and residential areas, same thing that the resident is responsible for maintaining the alley.'",

Clean streets provide a safe community, healthier environment for everybody. A lot of council members talked about driving around the city.'",

The last one that is especially awesome and the previous speaker and all considering the ongoing volunteer development.

        "'speaker_7': 'So I appreciate that. I appreciate the word supplement. I recognize that this is a transfer in one area to another. And but I also think that it's important to note that when we do utilize these federal programs, they only reimburse at the federal the federal minimum wage rate.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so it is required of us to come up with that variance. And it doesn't always mean additional youth get employed. It often means that we are drawing on the general fund to ensure that they are paid the wage of the state of California through that variance.'",

And to the extent that it is possible, I would urge the city to try to get as many of the parents involved to the extent that they can, because that is the backbone, the backbone of keeping a program going.'",

        "'speaker_11': 'Frankly, no. The county fiscal year did start as of July one. There are still some final details yet to be determined. So we are hoping to hear and we are one of a few housing authorities at its request to roll out the program before December.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So we are asking for first quarter funds.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Great. And I did want to ask just briefly, I recall creating the incentive package, which I think was a great idea, as well as waiving some of the permits and things that we've sat down with some of the apartment association.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Has the discussion been brought up around rental insurance yet?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It has not. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's fine. We'll save that and make sure that we bring that back. Okay. Thank you, guys.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you, Councilman Andrews.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, thank you, Mrs. King. I'd just like to take just a moment to thank you and your staff, because I know how hard you guys work, because you guys do give me a chance to come back every now and then.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But the work that you've done in this situation, I think, is going to open a door for so many people out there trying to get them a place to stay. And I want to thank you again and again, you and your staff.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Please keep up the good work.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. Any public comment on this item? Please come forth.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Good evening.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I would like to thank Vice Mayor Reg.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Richardson for all the work that he's put in over the last few months in putting this program together. I'm a firm believer of this program because I do believe that it helps a lot of people who might otherwise be homeless, and it might help some homeless people come into housing.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I want to especially thank Alice and King because I've been working with her over the last several years to try to put programs together and understand the programs a little bit better.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You have worked tirelessly to.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Do this, and I appreciate the outreach that you've had to the community, the housing provider community and all the people in the community.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I want to thank Vice.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Mayor Reg Richardson for putting the organization to it and reaching out to the community and making the progress more progress than I've seen in quite a while. And I'm very excited about that and I appreciate it. So thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Good afternoon, Mr. Vice Mayor and members of the Council and Staff Gary Shelton's. My name is a couple blocks from here. You might know I've been following issues of housing and homelessness for a lot of years. Thank you, Mr. King, for all your work on this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I've known you for some time. I wanted to direct your attention to item number two or paragraph number two, whatever you want to call it. It's the waiving of the fees, which I somehow missed in the in the staff report.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It might have been there, but I'm sorry if I missed it. And I I'm wondering if know a couple of things that you might ask Mr. King. Number one, did Los Angeles waive the fees as well? And if they did, how were they able to afford it?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Because it seems like an unaffordable possibility here under under the way it would work for us in Long Beach. So if Los Angeles did do it. How did they manage to do it? And I hesitate to use this word, and I use it in the most positive sense.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It looks like there's a couple of perhaps false assumptions in the in the calculations that are used in this in this part. I'm not positive whether $57.50 is a per unit fee. If it's a four unit building, a six unit building or a ten unit building, or if that's only if it's at a $230 base price for'",
        "'speaker_0': 'a four unit building, it calculates to 5750 per unit. But is that actually 57, 50 and a ten unit building as well, or is it the $23 that we might expect it to be instead of 57, 50 if it's less.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The larger the the the number of units in the building, then, then the loss is the less and the number of FTE ees that would be unavailable to us would be less. So maybe the impact isn't all that great.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Also, the inspections are over the course of a five year span. And so even though it appears that there's an annual fee for the inspections, I'm not sure if that is every five years or if it really is every year at 57, 50 or $230, wherever the annual fee is per apartment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Finally, even regardless of that amount, if we were able to afford to give a landlord $57.50 back or whatever it might actually be or not, charge him that for a for an inspection. That might be a small amount, but actually the perception is very great and the incentive would be very great, I would say.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I appreciate your finding a little bit more out about the waiving of this fee and whether we really can afford it or not. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Good evening, City Council Robert Fox, Executive Director of the Council of Neighborhood Organizations. I had the privilege of sitting down with Ms.. King and having lunch and going over a lot of issues. And I'm gratified to find that she's a good woman and she's done a great job.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I admire the proposals in front of you. In fact, I admire them so much that I'd like to expand them a little bit. We're dealing with only the homeless population in this particular proposal. We have at present 4980 vouchers rented out.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'However, we are able to take 7398. And the problem that Ms.. King and I talked about was how do we get landlords into this program? So I've been trying to do that, and the incentives that are here in front of us seem really pretty good.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I would encourage waiving the fees because again, it's more psychological than $57. But what a landlord is looking for, if we really want to rent up that 30%, which is not rented up in vouchers at this point in time, if we could incentivize landlords with a damage mitigation fund, I know that it's we're proposing $200,000 here in'",
        "'speaker_0': 'this particular thing for a very limited number of people. But I would like you all to consider the idea of taking this incentive program beyond the homeless and beyond the 75 to make it concurrent for the entire department, even if it were on a temporary basis.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So because if we lose the federal funding, because we didn't rent everything up, that's a significant chunk of change that we will have a difficult time getting back in the future. So I want us to think about that particularly I'm not as concerned about.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The fee is, as I am with the damage mitigation fund, which is really important to landlords, whether we use it or not. It's just psychological more than anything else that we're there to help you make this thing work.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I like the holding fee idea because it does take a certain amount of time when you're taking a Section eight tenant or a housing voucher tenant before all the paperwork is solidified. And that gives the landlord an incentive that they're not going to be losing rent over a certain period of time, as Alison and I had'",
        "'speaker_0': 'talked about. It's a great idea. I guess my suggestion is, is there a possibility somehow with the money that's coming in from Proposition eight, Measure eight, to expand this program, if maybe this will be an experimental program, but maybe expand it in the future so that we can move this to all housing voucher program participants.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you so much.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. And it's open to both homeless and non homeless at this point. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Vice Mayor and the City Council members. My name is Johanna Cunningham, executive director for the Apartment Association, California Southern Cities.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I first want.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'To thank the vice mayor for including.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Us and having the collaborative spirit that he's had since the beginning of this project. And I greatly appreciate working.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'With Allison King. I have worked.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Always they're always open to new ideas and to having a discussion and to really vetting different ideas.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And situations around this.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And we have a lot of work that we still need to do as we continue to work on this issue. But again, I just want to say thank.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You for the work that's been done so far. And I appreciate.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Look and look forward to continuing.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Our work together. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Josh Butler, executive director for housing. Ron Beech And I first like to think all the landlords for coming out tonight. Maybe they could all stand up. They're not here because tenants aren't asking for any rates, so they don't show up.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But when they ask to step up to the plate and be involved in the process, I don't see them packing the house. If every one of them took one Section eight tenant, we might be able to do something.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But they can't because vacancy rates are 2% in the city. There is nowhere for people to go. At last count, 1000 Section eight vouchers in the hands of residents who cannot use them. Our vacancy rate. There wouldn't even I don't even know if there's enough available apartments to put every single one of those people into.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You'd have to start moving people out. And that is a real concern of your current renter population, is that they're going to get moved out. They're not going to get opportunities at units that are available. So you have a housing crisis here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It requires real solutions. And the landlords, you keep going to the table asking for landlords to solutions to these problems time after time after time. Yet they are not going to do it. Their job here is to make as much money as possible.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think it's very ironic that we're going to use Measure H funds that were approved by taxpayers that those groups openly opposed that will now go into their hands that they can use. It's like, how is this even become a reality that we look at this situation that they can fight against all these measures, then turn'",
        "'speaker_0': 'around and take their hand and open it up and say, go ahead and we'll take that money now. And yet they'll turn around and send threatening messages to their tenants saying, You voted for this measure. So now I have to raise your rent.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So not only are you taking the money from the taxpayers, you're raising our rent, too. So the landlord community will double dip on this. It's time for us to start talking about renter protections. It's time for us to start talking about building affordable housing in a serious way.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we are making steps forward. But the years of lagging behind have caught up with us, and we're now paying the price. Cities all over the state of California talk about Long Beach, and they can't believe that we're the largest city in the state of California, the largest population of renters on the entire West Coast, from San'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Diego, all the way up to Seattle. That doesn't even have basic renter protections. We want to be a world class city. Then we should treat 60% of our population like world class citizens and give them the same basic rights that they have up in Portland.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You know, it takes more than crosswalks and microbrews and coffee shops. It takes a population, it takes a community to make a city. And it takes investing in your current base of residents to make that happen and not just continually outreaching outside of our borders to attract people in who yeah, they're moving here because it's cheaper than'",
        "'speaker_0': 'everywhere else. We have a lot of work to do. I'm disappointed that more landlords haven't shown up tonight. We're very hopeful that they can help us solve the problem because we could lose significant federal funding as a result of this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please. Yeah. The world's.'",

        "'speaker_10': 'I think that the organization is already committed to Long Beach and it's going to be staying here in Long Beach. The way I read this item is that there's a concern that maybe Molina health care is going to be leaving Long Beach, and we should create this committee to look at how we can keep them here.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I'm not sure what that would entail. Would that entail some tax incentives without taking some kind of breaks? Some additional. Monetary concerns that they would have to keep them here and keep them from moving. So I'm not real clear in terms of what this means or what the purpose of it is.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'If it's an opportunity for us to look into maybe helping them. As I heard earlier today, getting in a parking structure or providing some kind of land use assistance, I could see that. However, they are a private business and and as a private entity, they can do pretty much what they want in regards to either staying or'",
        "'speaker_10': 'leaving. It's not up to us to decide that. And I would I would be concerned spending public funds, public moneys to retain a private organization here in Long Beach when actually they could do whatever they want. It's their prerogative whether to stay or not.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But if it's true that they want to stay in Long Beach, then I don't I don't see the concern with this with this item here, because they already are committed here. So what is it that we are trying to do here?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I've heard two words that that they have a concern to me, and that is that one is that this is a proactive effort to help keep moving health care in Long Beach. And the other is is is this a preemptive effort to keep building health care in Long Beach?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So those two words are somewhat confusing in the sense that if it's a a proactive effort that they ask has well in health care, asked for assistance, in wanting in having them stay here in Long Beach. And therefore, we're creating this committee to help to see how we can do that.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And if it's and if they didn't, then why are we doing this? And if it's a preemptive effort, what is it based on facts that they already are making some moves to leave Long Beach? And we want to make sure that we keep them here by creating some kind of effort that will help them reconsider and stay'",
        "'speaker_10': 'in Long Beach. So there's still some there's still some unanswered questions that I have in regards to what is the total intent of creating this this committee to look at the health care. And finally, the thing that I see here is it's creating the president for other businesses who might say, I want to leave Long Beach, but'",
        "'speaker_10': 'if you help me, I'll stay. And then there we go. It starts. It starts a slippery slope where we have other kinds of businesses wanting to have that kind of that same assistance that we give to one entity.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So we're going to do two for one. We have to start looking at giving it for all. And I'm not sure that that's the direction that I want to take on this. So I'm looking forward to some further discussion you'll find.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you for those questions and I'll have my chief of staff. John, would you please elaborate on that, please?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sure. On the mayor, council members, what? There is no insider information or anything like that. I think that just as an observer. Councilman Andrews, there's a lot of residents of the sixth District who are firmly in health care.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'John and Mario represented sort of the heart and soul and a very unique relationship with this city and with their departure. As we know, corporations typically are courted and have other business decisions that are part of their profile.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So there's a shake up that took place. We're all aware of it. There's assurances that they have no intentions of leaving. However, 400 employees were placed across the bridge. And we we have some vacancy rate in corporate buildings here in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And the item calls for outside of the city support as well. And so as we look at the health care debate on a national level, we are also having a debate at the state level and how we can work with strategic partners at the county and at the state level to do everything that we can.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Because as it shows here, there's there's only a handful of companies that actually reside in Long Beach that do business here. And everybody from states, governors and mayors and whatnot are trying to attract and retain corporate presence in their cities because it creates a lifeline, because those employees then get coffees and dry cleaning and all the things'",
        "'speaker_0': 'that that are in ancillary businesses that are supported. So I guess the the intent really in being proactive is that we don't allow an opportunity for 400 more employees to reside here in Long Beach. The preemptive nesses that is to allow other stakeholders, as well as the city of Long Beach, to be a partner with us to'",
        "'speaker_0': 'make sure that they continue to have their their their national headquarters here in Long Beach. That was that was the intent behind it. We have the same assurances that the mayor has received, but it's just making sure that all strategic partners are at the table and that we are making sure that we are provided we have outside'",
        "'speaker_0': 'governance trying to take companies from the state. We have other cities that are trying to take companies from other cities. And we have to make sure that we stay competitive in making sure that we provide those opportunities. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. And I appreciate this this discussion. And I appreciate the item coming forward. This is a this one kind of hits home. It's a bittersweet because and I was around in 1995 as an aerospace worker working with my my union as a representative in 1995 when the first red team was established, when this this practice that'",
        "'speaker_8': 'we are looking at today was actually put into motion. And at the time, it was a. Aircraft called the empty M.D. 95 that was being proposed to be built in another state. We fought we worked with Create a Red Team, and we were able to keep those jobs, about 10,000 aerospace jobs paying aircraft jobs here in Long'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Beach. Since then, several red teams have been established. And, you know, Boeing went from number one employer here in Long Beach. Now they're number seven. And I'm going to challenge that number because I'm not even sure they're number seven anymore in terms of employees in the city.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think this is a and I want to commend, you know, Councilmember Andrews and the rest of my colleagues for bringing this forward. I think this is a a noble gesture. And we were all, I think, taken aback by the recent shake up within the Molina health care organization.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'However, I'm my question is, is similar to what Councilmember Urunga is regarding the threat. Right. And there has been no public information. There has been no indication in my that I've heard of that there is a threat of losing jobs here in the city.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so the question is, okay, what harm is it going to be to put forth a a business retention team or a red team of local, county, state officials, economic development professionals, private partners to to show goodwill and so forth, in terms of, you know, our intent in will to keep the Molina health care here, but short'",
        "'speaker_8': 'of a a real threat, I'm not sure that that is going to be a useful use of of of time for for what kind of strategies are going on where we are really talk about once we get to the table.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Right. What type of leverage is there going to be once we get to the table? Everybody, I think if you were to go to the county of Los Angeles, you can go to the state of California.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You can see.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'This. This body here is going to say, hey, we want to keep jobs in long. These jobs here in Molina, health care here in the city of Long Beach. So if I could offer just a a friendly solution, I don't even want to necessarily make it a substantive motion.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But I think this body would be better served by pushing forth in a resolution stating that our strong support and and our will to keep jobs and work with Molina help health care to keep jobs here. I don't know that putting together a business retention team or a red team is necessarily good use of resources at this'",
        "'speaker_8': 'time. Like I said, I commend it. I support the the the ideal in in concept. But I'm not sure that that that that is the best use of time and resources at this particular juncture. I do recognize it is a privately traded company.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It's a it's a it's a private entity. They both did made decisions to leave anyway. Right. Based on markets and whatever else. And we had every every resource in place to do that. Private companies are loyal to 2 to 1 thing, and that is their profits.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so I'm going to end my comments with that. Because I've experienced it. I've seen 40,000 plus jobs leave Long Beach, and we had the same motto in place to keep it in place. Right. And so I'm not trying to turn my back on any way in any way on on the employees or the and the good'",
        "'speaker_8': 'people. MOLINA Health care. I want to make sure I support the jobs here, but I want to make sure that we're smart with how we direct our staff and our resources moving forward.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'When I was going to finish, yeah, because I'm going to stay with it, go back.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To my company name, I make some comments.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay, if and with the friendly, I'm going to, you know, deny that because I'm going to stay with what the mayor was saying when he said he spoke with them. And they believe in what they're saying. And I think I'm going to stick with that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, so let me let me just let me just let me just add and be very clear and I'll just repeat what I mentioned to to the new CEO is the city of Long Beach is is completely committed to mining health care.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I and I have assurances that Molina health care is completely committed to Long Beach. And so we are partners. We'll continue to be partners. Obviously, there's I think that the interests of Council of of the councilmember, from what I understand it, is to ensure that we are doing everything possible just to ensure that we are providing'",
        "'speaker_0': 'our our largest private employer with as much support as possible in the employees as possible. So I understand, Councilman, you know what? Where you guys are coming from, I think the councilman's intention is to ensure that our city team is in constant communication with Molina health care.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we're doing everything we can to ensure that all those jobs stay here locally in Long Beach. And so I think that's the intention. But I also just want to make it clear that Molina is moving forward. And I think I think that the Mina family has a long history in this community and they continue to be'",
        "'speaker_0': 'involved in the company. So I just want to make sure that's also very clear. They are still part of of of the company. And and we're very happy to have them here. Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So in light of the fact that the friendly was denied, I'd like to just put forth a substitute motion to have the city council or instruct the city manager to prepare a resolution or I'm sorry, the city attorney to prepare a resolution stating the council's full support for maintaining jobs.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Molina Healthcare jobs in the city of Long Beach and the city's full support to maintain a constant communication with Molina health care. And should issues come up, we will be in place to to to work with them to maintain jobs in the future moving forward.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. That's a substitute motion which is on the floor. Councilman Gonzales.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, I'd like to support Councilmember Andrews original motion. And although I understand the resolution piece, perhaps something that could be of benefit is instead of maybe it's just an issue of semantics because we're calling it business retention, perhaps it can just be called the business support team because that's really what it is.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so I know retention often looks like a threat. There doesn't have to be a threat necessarily in order for us to just support a corporation. And so I think we can go back to the original motion. I think that would be perhaps a little bit more beneficial in this in the essence of this item, and would'",
        "'speaker_6': 'certainly put us on the map in terms of supporting large corporations for the jobs, for everything else. So that would be my recommendation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So that's going to be the recommendation to you, Councilman Andrews. Okay. Next up is Councilman Ringo.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you very much. Again, I don't want to I don't want to basically disparage. Whatever it is, we're putting forward the original motion. That is not my intent. I have a total, total, complete respect for Bolivian health care.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'There's no question the impact they've had on this city, they put us on the map, Fortune 500, company, even 100 at one point. What their their value to Long Beach is absolutely unprecedented. They are our pride and joy, but they're a private entity and we are a public entity.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And my concern is that by putting together this red team, we're spending public funds for a private effort. And I'm not sure that we're in we're in line with something that we should be doing. I do support the resolution.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I seconded the motion because we should let Molina health care know that we are totally concerned about their current restructuring and reorganization. That always happens with every company concerned. Ross had mentioned that, and we've seen it everywhere, across across the economic spectrum, that when a company buys out another company or acquires another company and there's always a'",
        "'speaker_10': 'restructuring going there, whenever that happens, there's going to be a loss, there's going to be loss of jobs, there's going to be a restructuring, there's going to be a reorganization, and there's going to be movement. Whether it's complete and total exiting the home base and going somewhere else.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That's a private decision. That's a business decision. They're business decision. It would be our loss and we would be totally devastated by having that happen. And we don't want to happen. That's why this is a as it's been characterized as a preemptive effort to already talk to them, to make to assure them, to tell them that we're'",
        "'speaker_10': 'there for you, but they haven't come to us for that. They're not asking for that. At least I haven't heard it yet. But when that day if that day comes, we will be there for them. I'm sure we will, because we all all I've heard here is that we we love Molina health care.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We want them to stay here. But that's not we're not there yet. And so we're building a red team. I know it says right here that there's no fiscal impact. There is a fiscal impact. There's going to be obviously we're going to we're going to put staff, resources and time into a rare team locations, meetings to be'",
        "'speaker_10': 'to be arranged materials, pre-prepared research should be done. There is going to be an economic impact. How much is it? I don't know. Maybe it's minimal, a few thousand dollars. But it's still an impact. And it's still public funding.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Public funding for a private purpose. So I'm still having issues with that. I second the motion to send them a resolution strongly supporting their they're staying in Long Beach and if there is an opportunity for them that that they want to look at in terms of moving to another location, we want to be the first ones to'",
        "'speaker_10': 'counter anything that that that they might be hearing. If they're hearing a better land use opportunity in Texas, so be it. But give us an opportunity to counter it. And we could do it and let the the bidding begin, if you will.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But I'm just not I'm just not very supportive of having public funds going for a public company, for a private company, and then creating opportunities for other such businesses who might be in Long Beach. I don't know. I'm not going to if I start naming so companies, I'll probably get into trouble.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So I'm not going to do that. But but the problem is, is that there are the companies that might want to do the same thing. You know, there are other big companies. They might not be one of the top ten up here.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But if you look at that top ten, you know, at least six of them are private companies. I mean, excuse me, are publicly funded companies lobby state. I'll be CC. St Mary's is a nonprofit Veterans Affairs. I mean, you know, a lot of those guys that they're they're public agencies for those we could do that we did'",
        "'speaker_10': 'it we did it a few years back a few years back 20 years ago with with the Naval Shipyard, with the Veterans Affairs and Navy Hospital. At those points, I could see the validity of having a red team and working with with our, our sister and brother governmental agencies or public agencies to retain their their services here'",
        "'speaker_10': '. But and this this is this is a different situation. And it calls for a different approach, a different strategy. And I don't think this one is the right one to use for that one.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Vice Mayor Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I just want to take a moment and express my full and strong support for Councilman Andrews and the Molina health care team. I do understand and I believe the council is in the right place in terms of where they want to go.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I want to make sure that we don't miss the forest while searching for the right tree. I think both send a strong message and we have a very capable team. We just reorganized the established economic development department, which we've been treating as sort of our red team, if you will, and if by changing language here, there, semantics'",
        "'speaker_9': 'here, there about support or retention. I think we can very easily say Diana Ting, who handles our state legislation and our county stuff. Our new deputy city manager. Let's get him off the bench. You know, take a look at what resources are around.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It wouldn't take very much to say, let's have a discussion. I want to thank the mayor for leading that conversation. But to me, I think it's my opinion when you take that extra step of saying I'm here and so is my experts and my team.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'What can we do to make sure you understand that we are that you are important to us? So what I don't want to do here is send the wrong message that somehow the council is not unified. I would hope that we can support Councilman Andrew's motion here and give staff the flexibility to do more or less based'",
        "'speaker_9': 'on the circumstances at the table or on the ground. And even if there is no threat, it's okay. When's the last time you know someone who says, you know, I learned this from Shannon McKee? Actually, it was. When do you how often do businesses get?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You know, do we approach businesses and say, how? How can we just help you do more of what you already do? Right. This is just another opportunity to do that, as far as I'm concerned. So I will just ask that we hope hopefully we can get back to Councilman Andrew's original motion.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We can be unified as a city and leave some flexibility city manager and the mayor to use what tools they see fit here. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Ranga.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Because Vice Mayor Richardson, I read I'm like I say, I take offense to what you said because it's not true that it's not my intent. The intent of the substitute motion is not to divide this council. We all are in unison in the praise and the love that we have for our health care.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We're dealing with emotion here. We're not dealing with with whether we want or need a health care to stay or not. It's a it's a it's a process. It's a it's a a a strategy, an approach. That's all we're talking about here.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We're not we're not talking about whether we vote for or against Councilmember Andrews resolution. You know, you're you're you're either with me or against me. That has nothing to do with that. Let's stop that, because that's not what this is about.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'This is about how do we send the message to Molina health care or to any business, for that matter, that it might be suffering from any kind of economic downturn? Just tell them to show them that we care, that we want them here, but we want them here under the the understanding that if and when they come'",
        "'speaker_10': 'to us for help, we are going to be there. This is not doing this motion. The original motion does not do that. It doesn't. You might think it does, but it doesn't. It say that, you know, we're afraid that you're going to leave us.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Let us help. Let us. Let us work with you to help you stay here. That that's not that. I think that's a wrong approach. We don't need to do that. If they want to stay, they're going to stay.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'They want to leave. They're going to leave. It's a it's a business decision on their part. And all we can do at this point is try to help them stay here. We can do that. But trying to be preemptive and proactive, I think is that's the wrong message.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We can work with them. We can work for them. But I don't think that we could say, you know, you're going to see him. We're going to keep you here no matter what. We're going to make sacrifices. I think that's the wrong message.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Question I got one more. So, Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Mr. Mayor, I just had a question for you. Since you are the chief executive of the city of Long Beach, you had a conversation with the new CEO of Molina Health Care. Did you have any indication that jobs were at risk here in the city of Long Beach?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'From Molina health care during your conversation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I mean, I think I think we have to be honest in any conversation with any corporation. You know, you can never say never. And whether that's Molina health care or that or whether that's the ice cream shop down the street.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I think I think you we should never assume that any job, regardless of who holds it or where it is, is always going to remain in the city. What I feel completely committed to is Melina healthcare's commitment to Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Their headquarters is here. They've got multiple operations here, and they're growing. They have a new they have the new leadership. So of course, there will be changes, but that's part of it. And I think that we will continue.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm very confident that the partnership between Melina and Long Beach will continue strongly for for many, many years ahead. And so I am not concerned that that there is going to be some sort of large change. I think I think Melina is a great company, and I think we'll look forward to working with them in the future'",
        "'speaker_8': '. Thank you. And your words right now make me validate, I think the motion to pass a resolution, a strong resolution, a strongly worded resolution stating our commitment to to helping keep jobs here should the need arise. But doesn't sound like there's a need here.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I would rather use our valuable staff resources to economic development on our business corridors and in our neighborhoods, in growing our sales tax base where we can grow that. That's where I'd like to see our economic development department and our city management team be be focused on right now, focused on developing and creating new business, new'",
        "'speaker_8': 'jobs, new economic opportunities. And not going after something is not moving right. So that's that's that's that's my big rationale. And members I would ask you to support the resolution, I think is a smart approach, but do as you will.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. We have a. A secondary motion and I'm in motion. I have to do public comment. So let me do public comment and we'll come back to the council. Any public comment on this? Okay. CNN So we have a substitute motion on the floor, which is a resolution of support by Councilman Austin and Councilman Ringa'",

It's a lot of one off opportunities and there isn't a uniformity. We've grown as a city so quickly and even Councilwoman Pearce was mentioning we're bringing on board another dog park.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'So I am 100% behind getting rid of the convenience fee. That is important. I also am curious as to. I am under the understanding that several years ago we had the opportunity to have our bank provider such as, say, Union Bank.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Do this in house where we would be able to as a city, not have the 5%, where we would take 2%, they would take 2%. And that this $900,000 cost would not be burdened. I'm wondering why we don't bring some of these types of things in-house.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We have quite a bankroll at Union Bank, and I'm interested in knowing what have we done in terms of exploring getting rid of the service charges that come from agencies like this?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember We did a we did and a bid processing request for this. And and these were the cheapest services in terms of we do have some Citibank or some bank processing. But in terms of this particular service, we did we did do an open bid request.'",

So people who have those types of services responded to what we asked, and I wonder if we should be asking a different question.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so my thought would be to move forward on the elimination of the utility bill, convenience fee for credit, debit cards and electronic checks. What was the timeline on signing this contract?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It is our intent to move as quickly as possible to sign this contract as the other one is expiring. We would we would need to explore. We would need to continue the next the old contract for a period of time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We think we can do that. But we would like to move on the new contract quickly so that we can begin the implementation of elimination of the convenience fees without the new contract. We're not in a position to do that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'However, if there was more of a cooperative agreement with the banking system, we would be in a better position because there's actually is increasing costs to our city departments where at least according to your staff report.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I can't I can't say that I can think of a relationship with the bank in a way that would reduce our costs below what we have. I may be mistaken on that, but I'm not aware of a mechanism that that would reduce our costs.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'd like to listen to either public comment and or my colleagues before I might have a few additional questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilman Austin, do you have any comments?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes, I seconded the motion to support the item, but I do have a couple of quick questions. So the the elimination of the the service fee. Who does that benefit?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Who does the elimination of the convenience fee benefit? It benefits directly the utility customers. It does not have any benefit to the city. It is intended to benefit and make life easier on our customers.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'It is a direct benefit to the people who pay utility bills, our residents and our citizens. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I didn't read it in the staff report, but is there a mechanism or will there be a report back to determine whether or not this is performing the way we want, that this contract is performing, the way we want it to perform after one year, after 18 months?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I know there's a three year contract. Do we just reevaluate it then?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, we would reevaluate it then. If there was a problem with the service provider and with our reference checks, we honestly do not believe there will be. But this is a very important contract with something goes wrong with these services.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I can't even begin to tell you how unhappy people are because they get sensitive about their money and they get sensitive about it very quickly. So we are we we believe this will be an excellent provider. If there is a service problem that is that continues, you will hear about it very quickly from us.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I just have a couple questions. So this makes a lot of sense to take steps toward removing that fee. I think it's a hassle. It's annoying. You know, I used to do that. Then I just switched over to online Bill Pay and just sent a sound check directly from my account just to avoid'",
        "'speaker_9': 'that fee. The question for me is about the process. So we hired this consultant and it says, and correct me if I'm wrong, it says not to exceed $984,000. Now, will that will that consultant actually remove the fee or is there some additional funding required or necessary in order to implement whatever changes the consultant recommends?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you for that question. I'll I'll try to clarify. The 984,000 is is not a consultant. It is a it is a service a service to process the payments that come in to the city, either by way of credit card, by way of debit card and to process e checks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And they provide an intermediate service between us and the banks. The banks typically do not get involved in this, so that is the service of processing an individual transaction. In addition, in terms of answering fully answering your question, there is an implementation process so that 984,000 back to the 984 is really a charge per transaction.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We estimate based on the number of transactions that the cost will be 984,000. But if we had two transactions, the cost would be $6, something like that. We do have a cost that we estimate for implementation. There are 14 interfaces and and lots of all those interfaces have to be designed and.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Programed. In addition, their computer changes and programing changes that need to be made. Those costs, we estimate, at $600,000 as a one time costs. Almost all of the costs, both the 984,000 and the 600,000 will be paid by utilities, not the general fund.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So about 600,000. That's for the consultant.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That is for about 200,000. Of that is for the consultant. The rest is for programing and other needs associated with implementing that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The final expense in order to achieve what we want to achieve. Will there be additional expenses beyond that?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It is an estimate. It's the best estimate we can do. We do not change these services very often. We have spent a lot of time on those services. We have done some discussions with consultants. We think that 200,000 for the consultant is is on target.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The rest in terms of programing, we have to get into it to see what's going on. But it is our best estimate, I will assure you. And we have utilities watching us. If we spend less, that's what we will do.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If it turns out, we will need to spend more and we hope we don't. We would let the utilities know and they would be paying those costs. But our best guess is that 600,000 will do it.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. And I feel a little bit more comfortable understanding that 200,000 of that is for consultant. The rub that I have here is that we pay a consultant to eliminate a fee before we've we opened up a RFP to go look for that service before we just checked around, who's already managing our money to say, hey'",
        "'speaker_9': ', what would it take to expand your role to take on this service and we eliminate this fee? It seems like that would be a step that we should take. But I like the way this conversation is going, and thanks for a thank for your responses.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Vice Mayor If I can clarify on that, because I think you raised some very good points. Yes. The consultant we're using or we would be using has not been selected. And yes and no consultant was used to date.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So the whatever consultant we hire will not have had a role in what we've done so far. Thank you, Councilman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So is when we did the original RFP, did we consider purchasing our own merchant line so that we would run our own credit cards and be the processor in-house and save that money?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No, we did. We did not. I'm not aware of of governments doing that. I actually can't comment too much on that. I can't think of a single government that has done that. I'm not saying they haven't. I don't know of any.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I would be concerned if we could as to why we would get into that. I can't tell you it's good or bad, but it would certainly be a major, major change in the way we operate and the expertize we would require in-house.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So. I know that this has come up before. There are groups that have talked about this in the past and that it could be a significant savings to taxpayers. That's why we would explore it and that it would be through an addendum on potentially our banking contract or other contracts.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I'm going to I made the motion tonight. I'm going to be supportive of it. But I think that we also need to be creative about the future of how money is collected, the future of how people interact with money and the ways in which things are paid.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Because as we move more and more online, these fees are being incurred at larger quantities of the tax bill. And the reason the convenience fee was initially added. It was not a Long Beach choice. It was the determination that we could not pay.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That we could not collect different amounts from different types of people. If you pay online, you have to pay the exact same amount to the government as the people who build in a check. And that's where the convenience fee originated from.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And there were several regional committees supported, both through GAG and other agencies talking about this challenge through the years. And so I know that people have come up with solutions. And I'd like for us, as we move forward, to look at those best practices, because at the end of this three years, I think that we're going to'",
        "'speaker_7': 'be looking at a very different banking system in terms of how how millennials interact with government, how our our taxpayers are interacting with government. So thank you for the information. And I look forward to the potential that at the end of this contract that we have a more creative solution in Councilwoman.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'One thing as you move forward and we move forward with that. One of the things we would be look at and that that I and I think the the 82 Tidd chief of department had have tried to avoid is getting involved in credit card processing that involves the type of security with credit cards.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have worked very diligently to this point to avoid having to maintain credit card numbers and maintain those things and do that kind of data processing security. So that's been an important I.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Think that is a very wise choice. I also think that the the the menu of services available to us in the future is changing. And we need to instead of taking out the old RFP from years past and just regenerating over and over again, what we've always done be creative about the future to make sure that, I'",
        "'speaker_7': 'mean, $1,000,000 of processing is a lot of money and that's that's streets that sidewalks, that's a lot of trees. And so we need to talk through what are these creative solutions for the future? Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Price.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you and thank you to my colleagues for their thoughtful comments and, of course, staff. I think when our in-house financial expert starts off his staff report by talking about how excited.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'He is.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'About this item, it makes you think he needs a more exciting life. But also he rarely, you know, express his usually very, you know, objective and analytical on these items. So the fact that he's recommending this item makes me more drawn to it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'At the same time, I think Councilwoman Mango has, as she always does, raised some very valid points regarding financial consequences and future considerations for us to have. So and it's really not my area of expertize, so I do defer to a lot of her comments in that regard because this is just not my area of expertize.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But I think as she stated it well, you know, I support this item tonight, but of course, as we move forward, hopefully we start early with looking at things that even if other cities are aren't doing them, things that we might be able to do to reduce these costs associated with these in the future and see really'",
        "'speaker_6': 'to what level we can maybe even start a pilot in another context so that we can see what we can do in terms of our own application in this regard. So thank you very much for the staff report and for the conversation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Vice Mayor Richardson, just a quick question.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'When does the banking RFP come up again? Do we know?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Can I get back to you? Can I send you a note on that? I actually don't know.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. Sounds good. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Customer.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Pearce I just wanted to say I really appreciated the comments of my colleagues, but definitely if you start off saying how excited you are, I think anytime we can look at reducing costs for the city and pass those on to residents, those costs add up.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Whenever we have small fees like this. It's a small things that that hit us in our pocketbooks sometimes. So I appreciate the effort and the conversation and definitely we'll be supporting this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And let me just add, just lastly, I want to thank everyone. I think those are some really good comments. And I particularly like the conversation around the future of banking because that is going to have a big impact on our services.'",
